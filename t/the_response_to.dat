5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E
40|$|Adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP), {{substance}} P (SP) and non-cholinergic {{nerve stimulation}} contracted the guinea-pig urinary bladder. SP and two poorly-degradable analogues of ATP, the enantiomers of adenylyl 5 '-(beta, gamma-methylene) -diphosphonate (AMP-PCP and L-AMP-PCP), {{were used to}} desensitize the guinea-pig bladder. Desensitization of the bladder by AMP-PCP (50 microM) or by L-AMP-PCP (50 microM) abolished <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> ATP, and inhibited <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> non-cholinergic nerve stimulation and <b>to</b> SP. <b>The</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> histamine were unaffected. Desensitization by SP (1 microM) inhibited <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> SP itself, but not <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> ATP, L-AMP-PCP or non-cholinergic nerve stimulation. These results suggest that SP may act partly by releasing ATP, and support the suggestion that ATP rather than SP is the non-cholinergic stimulatory transmitter...|$|R

Morphine and atropine in small doses blocked the pressor effect of physostigmine without interfering with the actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Chlorpromazine in small doses (0. 5 to 2. 5 mg/kg) blocked the pressor effect of physostigmine and potentiated <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> noradrenaline whilst those to adrenaline remained unaltered. 3, 6 -Di(3 -diethylaminopropoxy) pyridazine di(methiodide) (Win 4981) blocked the pressor effect of physostigmine and, in its early stages, this block was partially reversed by choline chloride. N-Diethylaminoethyl-N-isopentyl-N'N'-diisopropylurea (P- 286), in a dose that reduced the effect of dimethylphenylpiperazinium, {{had no effect on}} <b>the</b> pressor <b>response</b> <b>to</b> physostigmine or on <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> adrenaline and noradrenaline. Hexamethonium, even in large doses (100 mg/kg), only blocked partially the effect of physostigmine while mecamylamine produced a complete block; <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> adrenaline and noradrenaline were potentiated in both instances...|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that {{the storm was}} either {{too early in the}} season or not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion of disaster funds.

40|$|The {{effects of}} benzodiazepines and their antagonists on <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) of the {{superior}} cervical ganglion of the rat were examined using extracellular recording. Chlordiazepoxide (1 microM to 28. 9 microM) and flurazepam (145 - 725 nM) increased <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> of <b>the</b> ganglion <b>to</b> GABA and the increases were antagonized by Ro 15 - 1788, at 3. 34 microM. The concentration of GABA used was 9. 7 microM which gave half-maximal responses. Chlordiazepoxide similarly increased <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> of <b>the</b> ganglion <b>to</b> GABA 38. 8 microM {{in the presence of}} bicuculline 27. 2 microM. This concentration of GABA gave, with bicuculline, responses of a similar magnitude as those to 9. 7 microM in the absence of bicuculline. Bicuculline did not affect the actions of chlordiazepoxide or the antagonism by Ro 15 - 1788. Ro 15 - 1788 did not affect the increases in GABA response caused by pentobarbitone or by phenobarbitone in the presence of bicuculline. Ethyl beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (beta CCE) (207 nM to 1 microM) significantly decreased <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> GABA in <b>the</b> presence {{and in the absence of}} bicuculline. The decreases were antagonized by Ro 15 - 1788 (3. 34 microM). beta CCE at 2. 1 microM and above did not significantly change <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> GABA. Methyl beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (beta CCM) at 88 to 440 nM significantly decreased <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> GABA. <b>The</b> decreases were antagonized by Ro 15 - 1788 (3. 34 microM) and were also seen in the presence of bicuculline. High concentrations of Ro 15 - 1788 decreased <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> GABA, 9. 7 microM, but increased <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> GABA 38. 8 microM in the presence of 27. 2 microM bicuculline.
