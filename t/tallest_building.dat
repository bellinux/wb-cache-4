This paper reviews {{the evolution of}} <b>tall</b> <b>building’s</b> structural systems and the technological driving force behind <b>tall</b> <b>building</b> developments. For the primary structural systems, a new classification – interior structures and exterior structures – is presented. While most representative structural systems for <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> are discussed, the emphasis in this review paper is on current trends such as outrigger systems and diagrid structures. Auxiliary damping systems controlling building motion are also discussed. Further, contemporary “out-of-the-box ” architectural design trends, such as aerodynamic and twisted forms, which directly or indirectly affect the structural performance of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings,</b> are reviewed. Finally, the future of structural developments in <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> is envisioned briefly...|$|R

40|$|The <b>tall</b> <b>building</b> is {{the most}} {{dominating}} symbol of the cities and a human-made marvel that defies gravity by reaching to the clouds. It embodies unrelenting human aspirations to build even higher. It conjures a number of valid questions in our minds. The foremost and fundamental question that is often asked: Why <b>tall</b> <b>buildings?</b> This review paper seeks {{to answer the question}} by laying out arguments against and for <b>tall</b> <b>buildings.</b> Then, it provides a brief account of the historic and recent developments of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> including their status during the current economic recession. The paper argues that as cities continue to expand horizontally, to safeguard against their reaching an eventual breaking point, the <b>tall</b> <b>building</b> as a building type is a possible solution by way of conquering vertical space through agglomeration and densification. Case studies of some recently built <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> are discussed to illustrate the nature of <b>tall</b> <b>building</b> development in their respective cities. The paper attempts to dispel any discernment about <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> as mere pieces of art and architecture by emphasizing their truly speculative, technological, sustainable, and evolving nature. It concludes by projecting a vision of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> and their integration into the cities of the 21 st century...|$|R

40|$|In {{a time of}} recession, the {{challenge}} of building and planning for <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> has become even more complex; the economics of development, legislative and planning frameworks, and the local politics of development must be navigated by those wishing to design and construct new <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> which fit within the fabric of their host cities. This book is a timely contribution to the debate about new <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> and their role and effect on our cities. It {{is divided into two}} main parts. In part one, the relationship between <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> and planning is outlined, followed by an exploration of the impacts that construction of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> can have. It focuses, in particular, on the conservation debates that proposals for new <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> raise. The first part ends with an analysis {{of the way in which}} planning strategies have evolved to deal with the unique consequences of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> on their urban locations. The second part of the book focuses on seven examples of medium-sized cities dealing with planning and conservation issues, and implications that arise from <b>tall</b> <b>buildings.</b> These have been chosen to reflect a wide range of methods to either encourage or to control <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> that cities are deploying. The case studies come from across the western world, covering England (Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Birmingham), Norway (Oslo), Ireland (Dublin) and Canada (Vancouver) and represent a broad spectrum of approaches to dealing with this issue. In drawing together the experiences of these varied cities, the book contributes to the ongoing debate about the role of the <b>tall</b> <b>building</b> in our cities, their potential impacts and experiences of those who use and inhabit them. The conclusions outline how cities should approach the strategic planning of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings,</b> as well as how they should deal with the consequences of individual buildings, particularly on the built heritage...|$|R

For most of Detroit's earlier years, the tallest buildings in the city were churches and government buildings with their steeples. The first skyscraper in the city is usually considered the Hammond Building, completed in 1889. However, since the 10-story building did not surpass the steeple of the Fort Street Presbyterian Church, it never became a city record holder. The first skyscraper to have {{the distinction of being}} Detroit's <b>tallest</b> <b>building</b> was the Ford Building, completed in 1909.|$|E

This paper studies structural performance of diagrid systems employed for complex-shaped <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> such as twisted, tilted and freeform towers. For each complex form category, <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> are designed with diagrid systems, and their structural efficiency is studied in conjunction with building forms. In order to investigate the impacts of variation of important geometric configurations of complex-shaped <b>tall</b> <b>buildings,</b> such as the rate of twisting and angle of tilting, parametric structural models are used for this study. Based on the study results, design considerations are discussed for the efficient use of diagrid structures for complex-shaped <b>tall</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R
