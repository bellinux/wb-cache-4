40|$|The method {{involves}} transforming <b>the</b> audio <b>signals</b> to a {{spectral range}} and determining a masking threshold (W(omega)) for <b>the</b> audio <b>signals.</b> <b>The</b> method also provides pseudorandom noise signals and data <b>signals.</b> <b>The</b> pseudorandom noise <b>signals</b> are multiplied with <b>the</b> data <b>signals</b> {{in order to}} evenly spread <b>the</b> data <b>signal</b> over a frequency range. <b>The</b> spread data <b>signal</b> is then weighted with the masking threshold and overlaid with <b>the</b> audio <b>signals.</b> Preferably when transforming <b>the</b> audio <b>signals</b> <b>the</b> method uses a fast fourier transform.

30|$|The {{reason that}} the {{reduction}} rate varied depending on both the state of movement {{and the weight of}} the bottle is likely the influence of <b>the</b> voluntary <b>signal.</b> <b>The</b> voluntary <b>signal</b> modulates <b>the</b> tremor <b>signal.</b> As described in Section I, <b>the</b> tremor <b>signal</b> is noise in <b>the</b> voluntary movement <b>signal.</b> Conversely, <b>the</b> voluntary <b>signal</b> is also noise in the tremor signal; that is, <b>the</b> tremor <b>signal</b> is modulated strongly if patients contract their muscles strongly. This modulation made it difficult to demodulate <b>the</b> EMG <b>signal,</b> because <b>the</b> tremor <b>signal</b> could not be simulated accurately when it was modulated. Therefore, to promote the proposed demodulation algorithm, we need to analyse the characteristic change in <b>the</b> tremor <b>signal</b> depending on <b>the</b> voluntary <b>signal</b> in some way, such as a timeâ€“frequency analysis or the change in the shape of <b>the</b> EMG <b>signal,</b> and then revise the processing method.|$|R
5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E
5|$|Although the receptors for systemins and HypSys remain poorly understood, we have {{a better}} {{understanding}} of <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> transduction that occurs once the peptide had bound to its receptor. Jasmonic acid is an essential, albeit late component, in the systemin and wound-signalling pathways. In tomato, <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> is transduced from the receptor by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Cosilencing of two MAPKs, MPK1 and MPK2, in tomato compromised their defence response against insect larvae compared to wild type plants. Cosilencing these genes also decreased production of jasmonic acid and of jasmonic acid-dependent defence genes. Applying methyl jasmonate to cosilenced plants rescued them, indicating that jasmonates are <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> responsible for causing changes in gene expression. The alkalisation of the apoplast is a downstream effect of signalling processing by MAPKs. Applying fusicoccin, which activates the H+ ATPase inhibited by systemin, along with systemin still activates MAPKs, even though the pH of the apoplast does not change.|$|E
5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs <b>the</b> <b>signal,</b> which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E

5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots referenced to the time <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> from the satellite arrived, using the slotted ALOHA protocol. The time that <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> is sent from the ground station begins the time slot. The burst timing offset (BTO) is the time difference between the start of the time slot and the start of the transmission received from the aircraft; it equals twice the distance (for the ground station's signal then aircraft's response) from the ground station to the satellite to the aircraft plus the time the aircraft's SDU takes between receiving <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> and responding (the SDU bias) and the delay between the time <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> arrives at the ground station and the time it is processed (when the BTO value is logged; the ground station bias). The satellite's location is known, thus the distance from the satellite to the ground station can be calculated, while the combined bias of the SDU and ground station is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in the flight while it was on the ground at KLIA, thus leaving the distance between the aircraft and satellite as the only variable.|$|E
