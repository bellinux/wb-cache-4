5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} motivate and inspire {{everyone}} by taking {{them on a}} field trip to Gettysburg. At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of the office members sit down to rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They reinforce the fact that his co-workers like him <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} {{ignored in the}} historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus instead on the {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> perceived there.|$|E

Along <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> chased by the police and a crowd of people, who presume he is rabid, but he escapes them by {{swimming}} across the Hudson River. Later he is attacked by a mongrel guard dog, but he refuses to run from the battle. He initially struggles to defend himself while muzzled, but then the other dog inadvertently bites through the strap holding the muzzle on, allowing Lad to quickly defeat him. When the Master and Mistress return from searching for Lad, they find him waiting on the porch.|$|E

5|$|Jason X (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last {{performance}} as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the U.S. government in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon {{in a research}} facility, {{where it has been}} determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop him, since numerous attempts to execute him have proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the team's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> enhanced by a regenerative nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to the planet Earth 2, burning in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in {{hospital}} and asks her {{to confess to}} burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses.

Peggy tells Ronnie to give her real mother, Glenda (Glynis Barber), another chance.

25|$|After his death, Hitler {{continued}} to be depicted as incompetent or foolish. However, while Hitler's anti-Semitic policies were well known during his lifetime, {{it was only after}} his death that {{the full extent of the}} Holocaust and other Nazi genocides became known. This, coupled with Hitler no longer being a threat, has meant that <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> depicted in popular culture has resulted in Hitler being personified as evil.|$|E

25|$|As Joey {{tentatively}} {{enters the}} stage space, he is {{met with a}} spontaneous ovation sparked by the immediacy of the live moment, in turn aided {{by the fact that}} Kohler and Jones never stray from the game that dictates they treat him as a live horse. This playful notion helps Joey’s creators invite the audience to believe in his aliveness, and the audience succumbs, not only for his lifelike movement, but also for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> activated by those around him. As both creators and performers, Jones and Kohler soothe Joey’s “nervousness,” and a planned moment when Joey “notices” the audience elicits a generous laugh. Joey shies, nervously clops his hooves, and nickers gently to demonstrate alarm. He sniffs Kohler’s jacket pocket, as he “knows” there is a snack in there. Later, when Jones crosses the stage to demonstrate a feature, he is careful not to walk behind Joey, lest he is kicked. The audience must believe he will not be kicked – only a spiteful puppeteer could activate such a trick – but Jones’s conviction that he should respect the animal’s space foregrounds the moment’s liveness and heightens the audience’s engagement. Finally, a jockey is introduced, and Joey patiently holds still while he is mounted. Joey accepts the rider’s weight without complaint, comfortably parades around the stage, and swiftly exits before the effect is mundane. For the entire time that Joey inhabits the stage, the audience is noticeably spellbound.|$|E

Along <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> tutored by an older man named Eugène de Rastignac, who encourages him to immerse himself in the world of high society.

Wisnewski says {{that by the end of}} the episode, Liz and Tracy, in reverting to [...] "the natural order", have come to understand the concept of equality; rather than forcing people [...] "to be equivalent to one another ... considering the different interests of people equally." ...|$|E
500|$|Following her announcement, Rice's {{critique}} of Christianity was commented upon by numerous journalists and pundits. In {{an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times, Rice elaborated on her view regarding being a member of a Christian church: [...] "I feel much more morally comfortable walking away from organized religion. I respect that {{there are all kinds of}} denominations and all kinds of churches, but it's the entire controversy, the entire conversation that I need to walk away from right now." [...] In response to the question, [...] "how do you follow Christ without a church?" [...] Rice replied: [...] "I think the basic ritual is simply prayer. It's talking to God, putting things in the hands of God, trusting that you're living in God's world and praying for God's guidance. And being absolutely faithful to the core principles of Jesus' teachings." [...] In 2011, Rice participated in the [...] "I Am Second" [...] project, with a short documentary about her spiritual journey.

500|$|Lasance {{explained}} that {{a common theme}} in Aden's life is something bad happening just after each time he rebuilds his life. One such bad event is the re-emergence of his alcoholic father, Larry. His arrival sets Aden [...] "on the back foot" [...] again, as most of Aden's childhood issues stemmed from his father's addiction to alcohol. He also {{explained that}} alcohol abuse is often seen in victims of abuse, so Aden is angered when Larry admits Aden's grandfather abused him too. [...] "Aden loses it" [...] with Larry, because he has had his last chance in Aden's view. Aden holds his father hostage and withdraws his medication to punish him. Aden has had so much trouble from Larry that those [...] "experiences have made him <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> now", and the story comes to a culmination with Aden giving up on his father.

500|$|A loose story arc that {{informed}} the Doctor's characterisation during the 2005 series is his feelings regarding {{the destruction of}} his own race, the Time Lords, which occurred offscreen before episode one. Eccleston felt that the episode [...] "Dalek" [...] showed the audience why his Doctor is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> and [...] "how he feels about his past". Russell T Davies remarked that the Ninth Doctor carries a lot of survival guilt; this is why he [...] "strides through the universe wearing a dark leather jacket saying [...] "Don't touch me"". Davies felt that [...] "Dalek" [...] provided a [...] "bit of therapy" [...] and after this he [...] "starts to rebuild himself". In the episode [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] the Doctor sacrifices his ninth life to save Rose. Davies {{felt it was important}} to take the Doctor away from mythological off stage concepts such as the Time War and provide a conclusion that focused on the relationship between the character and Rose. John Barrowman, who played Captain Jack, felt that the Doctor's decision to save Rose enabled a catharsis; as he sacrifices himself to save her he is [...] "letting go of the burden of the Time Lords being destroyed".|$|E
