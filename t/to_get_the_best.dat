5|$|Bond veteran {{cameraman}} {{and professional}} skier Willy Bogner, Jr. {{was promoted to}} director of a second unit involving ski footage. Bogner designed the ski chase on the bobsleigh track of Cortina d'Ampezzo hoping to surpass his work in both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me. To allow better filming, Bogner developed both a system where he was attached to a bobsleigh, allowing to film the vehicle or behind it, {{and a set of}} skis that allowed him to ski forwards and backwards <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> shots. In February 1981, {{on the final day of}} filming the bobsleigh chase, one of the stuntmen driving a sleigh, 23-year-old Paolo Rigon, was killed when he became trapped under the bob.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{controlled}} the opening passages of the game. Their first goalscoring chance {{came in the}} 11th minute when Alan Kennedy's 30 yard shot was saved by Real goalkeeper Agustín Rodríguez. Further chances were created, but neither Terry McDermott or Dalglish were able to score. Real started to exert more of an influence after this, midfielder Juanito started to cause Liverpool problems with his passing. One pass found José Antonio Camacho who beat Liverpool defender Alan Hansen but put his shot wide of the Liverpool goal. Despite their scoring opportunity, one problem Real had was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> out of their winger Cunningham. Not fully fit, he was tightly marked and made little impact in the match.|$|E

5|$|Archibald Campbell MacLaren (1 December 1871– 17 November 1944) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team {{at various}} times between 1898 and 1909. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he played 35 Test matches for England, as captain in 22 of those games, and led the team to defeat in four Ashes series against Australia. An amateur, MacLaren played first-class cricket for Lancashire, captaining that county {{for most of his}} career. As a batsman, MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of his time and had a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist. In 1895, he scored 424 runs in an innings against Somerset which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994. Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and inability <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> out of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader.|$|E

50|$|As a manager, Zoff {{was known}} for his use of tactics based upon the zona mista system, which is a cross between the catenaccio man-marking and zonal marking systems. His teams often used a sweeper, who, in {{addition}} to his defensive duties, was required to start plays from the back. He preferred not to base his team's play on set plays and formations, as he believed that cultivating a good relationship with his players and fostering a winning team mentality were <b>the</b> keys <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> out of them.|$|R
25|$|Leicestershire won {{the county}} {{championship}} in 1996, {{and again in}} 1998. This was an amazing achievement considering {{the resources of the}} club compared to other county teams.

Yates has been influenced by such directors as Steven Spielberg, David Lean, and Ken Loach. Yates' style of work includes social and political themes, character-driven narratives, realism, and atmospheric drama.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{examples}} of large assembly language programs {{from this time}} are IBM PC DOS operating systems, the Turbo Pascal compiler and early applications such as the spreadsheet program Lotus 1-2-3. According to some industry insiders, the assembly language was the best computer language to use <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> performance out of the Sega Saturn, a console that was notoriously challenging to develop and program games for. The 1993 arcade game NBA Jam is another example.|$|E

The novel is narrated in the form of a purana by an old woman of the village, Achakka. Dominant castes like Brahmins are privileged <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> region of the village, while lower casts such as Pariahs are marginalized.

Graeme Welch chipped in by conceding 21 runs in ten overs and {{claiming}} three scalps. Steve Stubbings and Michael di Venuto then shared an opening partnership of 81, but two wickets from Johann Louw evened out the game somewhat, and Monty Panesar wrapped up Derbyshire's innings with three wickets on the second day, as Derbyshire were bowled out for 219.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of general purpose mechanised proof assistants support versions of typed higher order logic, even though set theory {{is the standard}} foundation for mathematics. For many applications higher order logic works well and provides, for specification, the benefits of type-checking that are well-known in programming. However, there are areas where types <b>get</b> in <b>the</b> way or seem unmotivated. Furthermore, most people with a scientific or engineering background already know set theory, but not higher order logic.

25|$|After the uprisings, the Native Americans {{returned}} to making alliances with the European powers, using political savvy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> deals by playing the three nations off each other. The Creek were particularly good at manipulation – {{they had begun}} trading with South Carolina {{in the last years}} of the 17th century and became a trusted deerskin provider. The Creeks were already a wealthy tribe due to their control over the most valuable hunting lands, especially when compared to the impoverished Cherokees. Due to allying with the British during the Yamasee War, the Cherokees lacked Indian trading partners and could not break with Britain to negotiate with France or Spain.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the Formula and rules was to {{encourage}} designer's creativity to optimize designs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> overall performance when racing while still maintaining competitive racing postures between different designs. Although the Formula and Rules allowed for some creativity they were also intended to be comprehensive enough to eliminate loop holes which could result in an extreme design which conformed to the 12 Metre rule but completely outclassed other contemporary designs on the race course. If the rules {{were considered to be}} too loose then it would discourage the building of new 12 Metre yachts for fear of a new boat being outclassed even before it was launched.|$|E
25|$|Under Graham Taylor, many speculated his old {{mentor and}} manager at Watford {{would be able}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> out of him, but his form was to become even less consistent; {{although}} this may have partly been down to the decline of English football as a whole during this period. In Graham Taylor's first match as England Manager (against Hungary), Barnes had appeared to be attacking positively and beating players and using the ball well. This was a false dawn however and throughout a difficult time for the England squad, Barnes had few other highlights {{with the exception of}} scoring a stunning free kick against the Netherlands in a 1994 World Cup qualifying match.|$|E

Graeme Welch took four for 82 <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bowling figures for Derbyshire. However, Derbyshire's tactic of slow attrition worked well against Somerset's frontline bowlers Andy Caddick and Ian Blackwell. They made 438, in a total of 149 overs, before declaring with eight men down – four Derbyshire batsmen making fifties, Ant Botha top-scoring with 91, while 40 overs from Caddick yielded four for 102.

By the end of the calendar year Liverpool were mid table in the league and looked {{to be out of the}} running for title honours, especially as they had just lost to Manchester City 3–1 at Anfield in the Boxing Day fixture – a defeat which put John Bond's team top of the league. The New Year brought a new momentum as Bob Paisley began <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> out of his players; they began the year in South Wales visiting the Vetch Field to play Swansea City in the FA Cup, Liverpool were in fine form and thumped their hosts 4–0.
