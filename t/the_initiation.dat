5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> complex. <b>The</b> <b>initiation</b> complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> crack <b>initiation</b> of V-shaped notch tip {{has a very}} {{important}} influence on the cross-section quality and the cropping time for every segment of metal bar in course of low stress precision cropping. By the finite element method, the influence of machining precision of V-shaped notch bottom corner on <b>the</b> crack <b>initiation</b> location is analyzed and it is pointed out that <b>the</b> crack <b>initiation</b> point locates in the place at the maximal equivalent stress change rate on V-shaped notch surface.

The experimental results show that the obtained theoretical analyses about <b>the</b> crack <b>initiation</b> location, <b>the</b> crack <b>initiation</b> direction, and <b>the</b> crack <b>initiation</b> time in this paper are correct. It is also shown that <b>the</b> crack <b>initiation</b> time accounts for about 80 % of the cropping time for every segment of the metal bar...|$|R

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of <b>the</b> <b>initiation,</b> might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> proper, Lucius must {{undergo a}} series of ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for {{forgiveness}} on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins fits {{with an emphasis on}} chastity and other forms of self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing. The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{fatigue life}} in arc welded {{parts of the}} chassis {{component}} of SAPH 45 steel in automobile is affected by various defects and residual stress due to welding. Moreover, {{it is hard to}} measure directly <b>the</b> crack <b>initiation</b> length of <b>the</b> welded part in chassis component due to the complicated geometric shape. Therefore, to assure the safety of vehicles, it is necessary to evaluate <b>the</b> crack <b>initiation</b> life by using a non-destructive technique (NDT). In this study, the acoustic emission measurement was adapted to monitor <b>the</b> crack <b>initiation</b> of <b>the</b> welded part during the fatigue test. <b>The</b> crack <b>initiation</b> length was verified by a computerized image processing system under stroboscopic light illumination.
