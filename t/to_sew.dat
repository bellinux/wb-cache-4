5|$|In both later {{works such}} as Caroline Mordaunt and her earlier evangelical texts, Sherwood participated in the Victorian project of {{prescribing}} gender roles; while her later works outlined ever more stringent and narrow roles for each sex, her early {{works such as}} The Fairchild Family suggested such demarcations as well: Lucy and Emily learn <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin.|$|E
5|$|Shelby {{pressured}} President James Madison to give Harrison {{command of}} all {{military forces in}} the Northwest. Madison acceded, rescinding his earlier appointment of James Winchester. On the state level, Shelby revised militia laws to make every male {{between the ages of}} 18 and 45 eligible for military service; ministers were excluded from the provision. Seven thousand volunteers enlisted, and many more had to be turned away. Shelby encouraged the state's women <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> and knit items for Kentucky's troops.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{resources}} and fibres from plants {{are used to}} construct dwellings and to manufacture clothing. Wood is used not only for buildings, boats, and furniture, but also for smaller items such as musical instruments and sports equipment. Wood is pulped to make paper and cardboard. Cloth is often made from cotton, flax, ramie or synthetic fibres such as rayon and acetate derived from plant cellulose. Thread used <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> cloth likewise comes in large part from cotton.|$|E

5|$|Agoncillo was a {{daughter}} of a rich family {{in her hometown of}} Taal, Batangas. Finishing her studies at Santa Catalina College, she acquired her learning in music and feminine crafts. At the age of 30, Agoncillo married Filipino lawyer and jurist Don Felipe Agoncillo and bore him six children. Her marriage led to her important role in Philippine history. When her husband was exiled to Hong Kong during the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution, Agoncillo {{and the rest of the}} family joined him and temporarily resided there to avoid the anti-Filipino hostility of some foreign countries. While in Hong Kong, General Emilio Aguinaldo requested her <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> a flag that would represent their country. Agoncillo, her eldest daughter and a friend manually sewed the flag in accordance with General Aguinaldo's design which later became the official flag of the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|The {{troops for}} the Ranger company {{were to be}} Airborne qualified, so the Ranger Training Center heavily {{recruited}} troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and 11th Airborne Division who had already completed United States Army Airborne School. In spite of this, only one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing. At the first Airborne Ranger graduation in November 1950, each Ranger was given a black and gold Ranger Tab as a shoulder sleeve insignia. A few days later, each Ranger was issued a blue and white tab and instructed <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> it above the Ranger Tab. The Airborne Ranger Companies then in Korea were deactivated on August 1, 1951. They were merged into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team {{to bring them back}} up to strength with airborne-qualified combat-experienced replacements. The 187th had been moved to Kyushu, Japan’s southern island to take on a (then Top Secret) mission to save the UN negotiators at Kaesong, North Korea.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{live animals}} to {{represent}} the tribbles was immediately ruled out. According to Gerrold's account, {{the inspiration for the}} form of the tribble instead came from a fluffy keyring owned by Holly Sherman. Sherman's Planet in this episode was subsequently named after her. The design came from Wah Chang, but they were individually sewn by Jacqueline Cumeré. She was paid $350 <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> five hundred tribbles from synthetic fur and stuff them with foam rubber. Six ambulatory tribbles were made using the mechanisms of walking toy dogs, which were quite noisy and required the dialogue to be looped in during editing. Other tribbles were created by Jim Rugg out of beanbags for when it was required for one to sit on a person or object, and the breathing tribbles were hollow with surgical balloons inserted. Some of these tribbles were later displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. in 1992. The sale at Christie's auction house in 2006 included tribbles from this episode {{as part of a larger}} Star Trek sale. Because of the synthetic fur technology of the 1960s, relatively few original tribbles exist as of 2010 because the fur fell out over time and they went bald. An original tribble was sold at auction in 2003 for $1,000.|$|E
50|$|Seminole seamstresses, upon {{gaining access}} <b>to</b> <b>sewing</b> {{machines}} in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, invented an elaborate appliqué patchwork tradition. Seminole patchwork, for which the tribe is known today, came into full flower in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|Another {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>sewing</b> was <b>to</b> glue {{the edges}} of the suit together. This created a smooth, flat surface that did not necessarily need taping, but unfortunately raw foam glued to foam is not a strong bond and still prone to tearing.|$|R

25|$|It is {{not unusual}} that Ross, an upholsterer, would have been paid <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> flags. There was a sudden and urgent need for them, and other Philadelphia upholsterers were also paid <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> flags in 1777 and years following.|$|E

25|$|Throughout most of {{the history}} of the glove {{industry}} in Johnstown, most companies used home workers <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> the gloves. Men cut the gloves from leather in factories, and women hand-sewed the gloves at home. Later when the sewing machine was developed, many women moved to the factories to work. Until the last years of the 20th century, home glove workers were still working in the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of labor in traditional Inuit society had a strong gender component, {{but it was not}} absolute. The men were traditionally hunters and fishermen and the women took care of the children, cleaned the home, sewed, processed food, and cooked. However, there are numerous examples of women who hunted, out of necessity or as a personal choice. At the same time men, who could be away from camp for several days at a time, would be expected to know how <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> and cook.|$|E

25|$|He {{had a great}} {{appreciation}} of sacred music and was a great reader of works about art, but he detested physical activity. He appeared to have suffered periodic crises of depression. An aversion to changes in his routine extended to his clothing: he wore the same coat until it tore, forcing his chamberlains <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> it on his body while he slept in it. He suffered from panic attacks when he heard thunder, staying in his rooms with the windows shut and receiving no one.|$|E
25|$|As {{a fitness}} instructor, Smith found {{a lack of}} {{appealing}} clothes in which to work and started <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> her own. She had no formal training in garment production, but had been interested in fashion since a teenager, crocheting bikinis from age 16, customising her clothes from age 18, and from age 21 starting to design and make her own clothes. She began by unpicking a favourite swimsuit {{and used it to}} make a pattern out of newspaper, providing the basis for her first leotard design. Her students liked her outfits, and started requesting that Smith make clothes for them too.|$|E
25|$|The medal can be won {{multiple}} times. Each subsequent {{award is}} indicated by the award of another clasp, which displays {{the year of the}} subsequent award. The clasps are designed to be attached to the suspender and to each other with rivets, in roller chain fashion. When medals are not worn, the award of second and subsequent clasps are denoted by silver rosettes on the ribbon bar. Since it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> more than four rosettes onto a single ribbon bar and since several champions have won the award more than five times, gold rosettes were introduced to cover situations where more than five championships have been won.|$|E
50|$|Hem repair tape is {{available}} {{as an alternative}} solution <b>to</b> <b>sewing</b> a broken hem. To effect a fix, the hem repair tape is laid around {{the inside of the}} hem. It is then ironed with a hot iron. The heat causes the tape to bond the two surfaces together.|$|R

25|$|Quakers were {{prominent}} in campaigning against and publicizing the dire {{state of the}} prisons at the time. Elizabeth Fry documented the conditions that prevailed at Newgate prison, where the ladies' section was overcrowded with women and children, {{some of whom had}} not even received a trial. The inmates did their own cooking and washing in the small cells in which they slept on straw. In 1816, Fry was able to found a prison school for the children who were imprisoned with their parents. She also began a system of supervision and required the women <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> and to read the Bible. In 1817, she helped found the Association for the Reformation of the Female Prisoners in Newgate.|$|E
25|$|Various groups {{support or}} embody the anti-sweatshop {{movement}} today. The National Labor Committee brought sweatshops {{into the mainstream}} media in the 1990s when it exposed the use of sweatshop and child labor <b>to</b> <b>sew</b> clothing for Kathie Lee Gifford's Wal-Mart label. United Students Against Sweatshops is active on college campuses. The International Labor Rights Fund filed a lawsuit on behalf of workers in China, Nicaragua, Swaziland, Indonesia, and Bangladesh against Wal-Mart charging the company with knowingly developing purchasing policies particularly relating to price and delivery time that are impossible to meet while following the Wal-Mart code of conduct. Labor unions, such as the AFL-CIO, have helped support the anti-sweatshop movement out of concern both {{for the welfare of}} workers in the developing world and those in the United States.|$|E
