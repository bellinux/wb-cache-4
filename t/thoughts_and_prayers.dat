60|$|But {{for me the}} {{ceremony}} was only begun, for to-night was the night of my initiation. Leaving the inner court I bathed myself, and, clad in pure linen, passed, as it is ordained, into an inner, but not the inmost, sanctuary, and laid the accustomed offerings on the altar. Then, lifting my hands to heaven, I remained for many hours in contemplation, striving, by holy <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayer,</b> to gather up my strength against the mighty moment of my trial.|$|R

500|$|On June 1, 1978, {{following}} the monthly meeting of general {{authorities in the}} Salt Lake Temple, Kimball asked his counselors and the ten members of Quorum of the Twelve Apostles then present to remain behind for a special meeting. Kimball began by describing his studies, <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayers</b> on removing the restriction and on his growing assurance that {{the time had come}} for the change. Kimball asked each of the men present to share their views, and all spoke in favor of changing the policy. After all present had shared their views, Kimball led the gathered apostles in a prayer circle to seek final divine approval for the change. As Kimball prayed, many in the group recorded feeling a powerful spiritual confirmation. Bruce R.

40|$|This essay explores William Desmond’s {{concept of}} porosity, {{especially}} as developed in God and the Between. The author analyses Desmond’s {{imagery of the}} clogging and unclogging of pores {{in relation to the}} ability to sense signs of the transcendent, and thus one’s givenness, in the between. The origins of Desmond’s concept of porosity in Plato’s Symposium are then explored, particularly the significance of the dual parentage of Eros (Poros and Penia) in the myth of Diotima. Finally, Desmond’s understanding of porosity is related to St. Augustine’s philosophy of prayer. In conclusion, the significance of the relation between <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayer</b> for Desmond is discussed which, through humility, allows one to partake in the agapeic nourishment by the divine...|$|R
