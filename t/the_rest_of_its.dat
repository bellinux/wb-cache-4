5|$|With the Hudson River to its west, US4 heads northward once again, leaving NY197 behind. Not far after Fort Edward, {{the highway}} enters Hudson Falls, where {{it turns into}} a local road. There, it heads through downtown, {{intersecting}} with NY196, and soon afterwards, NY254. US4 makes a sudden curve to the northeast, heading through the rural regions for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> length.|$|E
5|$|As the Yorkists {{reformed}} {{their ranks}} {{to receive the}} Lancastrian charge, their left flank came under attack by the horsemen from Castle Hill Wood mentioned by Waurin. The Yorkist left wing fell into disarray and several men started to flee. Edward had to take command of the left wing to save the situation. By engaging in the fight and encouraging his followers, his example inspired many to stand their ground. The armies clashed and archers shot into the mass of men at short range. The Lancastrians continuously threw fresher men into the fray and gradually the numerically inferior Yorkist army was forced to give ground and retreat up the southern ridge. Gravett thought that the Lancastrian left had less momentum than <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> formation, skewing the line of battle such that its western end tilted towards Saxton.|$|E

By the mid-twentieth century, the suburb had absorbed large numbers of Greek and Italian arrivals. Local businesses and clubs reflected this in Mediterranean delicatessens, take-away shops and the Greek Orthodox Club.|$|R

It returned to the 509th, now designated the 509th Bombardment Group, in September. On 3 September 1948, during a polar navigation training mission, it developed an engine problem after takeoff from Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador, and ran off the end of the runway when attempting to land. Heavily damaged, it never flew again, and was eventually scrapped at Goose Bay in September 1949, despite its historical significance.|$|E
5|$|In their ninth game, however, third-ranked Virginia Tech {{suffered}} {{its first}} loss. On a Thursday night game at home, the Hokies lost 277 to the fifth-ranked Miami Hurricanes. Normally, {{a loss to}} the division-rival Hurricanes would have knocked the Hokies out of contention for the ACC Championship Game, as Miami had the tie-breaking head-to-head victory and was expected to win the remainder of its games. But because Virginia Tech won <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> games and the Hurricanes lost two ACC contests, (Virginia Tech's only ACC loss was to Miami) the Hokies won the Coastal Division championship and qualified for the championship game over Miami.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was {{inactive}} {{for much}} of <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> career. Decommissioned on 16 May 1952, it {{was used as a}} stationary headquarters for the Commander-in-Chief of the Brazilian Navy until 17 December of that year. The ship was removed from the naval register on 31 December, and sold to the Italian ship breaking company SA Cantiere Navale de Santa Maria. Minas Geraes was taken under tow on 1 March 1954 and arrived in Genoa on 22 April; the old dreadnought, which had been in service for more than forty years, was broken up for scrap later that year.|$|E

5|$|The Ontario Street name follows NY65 northwestward {{through the}} {{southern}} {{half of the}} village, where it crosses back over Honeoye Creek before passing through the village's residential center and entering its business district. Here, NY65 turns west onto East Street and crosses Honeoye Creek again to reach an intersection with Main and Monroe Streets. Monroe Street, once designated NY363, is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as NY940J, an unsigned reference route. NY65 turns north here, following North Main Street out of the village. Outside of Honeoye Falls, the route becomes Clover Street, a name it retains for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> routing.|$|E
5|$|The winghead shark is {{viviparous}} like <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> family, {{with the}} developing young sustained to term by a placental {{connection to the}} mother. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteri. Compartments form inside the uteri during pregnancy, one for each embryo. In the waters around Mumbai, the mating season is in July and August during the monsoon. The males bite {{at the sides of}} the females as a prelude to copulation. Females can reproduce every year; the litter size ranges from 6 to 25 pups, and increases with the size of the female. The gestation period lasts 8–9 months off western India, and 10–11 months off northern Australia. Pregnant females have been reported to quarrel with each other.|$|E
5|$|Timid and {{harmless}} to humans, the smalleye hammerhead {{is caught}} incidentally by inshore artisanal multispecies fisheries throughout its range, and marketed as food. It {{is the most}} or second-most important shark caught by such fisheries off Trinidad, Guyana, and Brazil. Because of its head shape, individuals of all ages are readily caught in gillnets; small numbers are also caught on line gear and in bottom trawls. The IUCN has assessed this species as vulnerable, as it is subjected to intense fishing pressure and its low reproductive rate renders it susceptible to population depletion. Anecdotal evidence suggests that smalleye hammerhead catches have declined significantly off Trinidad and northern Brazil, which are likely indicative of population trends in <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> range. It is not the target of any conservation or management schemes.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Harvey was a {{moderately}} strong tropical storm that caused flooding across south Florida during the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. The tenth tropical cyclone and eighth named storm of the season, Harvey developed from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico on September19. After forming, the system gradually intensified {{and became a}} tropical storm early on September 20. Throughout <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> duration, Harvey slowly intensified as it headed eastward. Late on September21, Harvey made landfall in Southwest Florida with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Harvey emerged into the Atlantic early on September 22, but was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Harvey reached Atlantic Canada before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Sinlaku was a {{damaging}} typhoon {{that affected}} Okinawa, Taiwan, and eastern China in September 2002. The 16th named storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, Sinlaku formed on August27 {{northeast of the}} Northern Marianas Islands. After initially moving to the north, it began a generally westward motion that it maintained for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> duration. Sinlaku strengthened into a typhoon and attained its peak winds on August31. Over the next few days, it fluctuated slightly in intensity while moving over or near the Ryukyu Islands. On September4, the typhoon's eye crossed over Okinawa. It dropped heavy rainfall and produced strong winds that left over 100,000people without power. Damage on the island was estimated at $14.3million.|$|E
5|$|While {{the north}} of the {{peninsula}} was already settled in the 7th–5th millennium BCE, <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> territory remained uninhabited until the 3rd millennium BCE, when various peoples started to arrive from the south. However, by the 1st millennium CE only the Sami people remained. This changed in the 12th century, when Russian Pomors discovered the peninsula's game and fish riches. Soon after, the Pomors were followed by the tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic, and the peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands. No permanent settlements, however, were established by the Novgorodians until the 15th century.|$|E
5000|$|Notice that <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> mass <b>of</b> a {{composite}} system will generally be slightly different from <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> masses <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts since, in its rest frame, their kinetic energy will increase its mass and their (negative) binding energy will decrease its mass.
