5|$|Soon after, Carter {{created a}} special White House {{task force to}} {{investigate}} the claims. Carter named retiring judge William B. Gunter, of the state Supreme Court of Georgia, <b>to</b> <b>mediate</b> <b>the</b> dispute. Archibald Coxa professor at Harvard and the former Watergate special prosecutorjoined the tribes' legal team pro bono. In response, Governor Longley hired Edward Bennett Williams, the named partner of Williams & Connolly, to represent the state. Three months of presentations to Judge Gunter ensued.|$|E
5|$|In May 1569, Elizabeth {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>mediate</b> <b>the</b> {{restoration of}} Mary {{in return for}} guarantees of the Protestant religion, but a convention held at Perth rejected the deal overwhelmingly. Norfolk continued to scheme for a marriage with Mary, and Elizabeth imprisoned him in the Tower of London between October 1569 and August 1570. Early in the following year, Moray was assassinated. Moray's death coincided with a rebellion in the North of England, led by Catholic earls, which persuaded Elizabeth that Mary was a threat. English troops intervened in the Scottish civil war, consolidating {{the power of the}} anti-Marian forces. Elizabeth's principal secretaries Sir Francis Walsingham and William Cecil, Lord Burghley, watched Mary carefully with the aid of spies placed in Mary's household.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 1922, Iron Duke was {{steaming}} to the Dalmatian coast for {{a training}} cruise, when she received {{news of the}} Greek defeat in Turkey. Admiral Osmond Brock, the Mediterranean Fleet commander, ordered Iron Duke to proceed to Smyrna, where he expected disturbances. There, she served as the flagship of the British naval forces participating in the evacuation of Greek refugees from the city. She was present during the Great Fire that devastated the city. During the chaos, a number of refugees managed to come alongside Iron Duke in small boats, and were brought aboard the battleship. The following month, the Allies held a conference aboard Iron Duke at Mudania <b>to</b> <b>mediate</b> <b>the</b> Greco-Turkish dispute. The ship thereafter proceeded to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the Blue Jackets, Filatov signed a three-year {{contract}} with the club on July 10, 2008. His base salary for the contract was $875,000, with bonus clauses that could bring the value as high as $1.35million per season. His signing with Columbus created some controversy within the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), however, as League President Alexander Medvedev claimed that the Blue Jackets owed CSKA Moscow compensation of at least $1.5million for signing Filatov. Medvedev claimed that although the term of the contract had expired, under Russian law it did not terminate until an indemnity amount had been negotiated. The Blue Jackets and Filatov believed that giving his club 30 days notice was sufficient to terminate the contract. CSKA threatened to withhold Filatov's transfer card, thus impeding his ability to play in another league, but Filatov, his lawyers and the Blue Jackets believed they had followed the necessary tenets of Russian law. Filatov's contract was one of six reviewed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>mediate</b> <b>the</b> disputes between the KHL and NHL. During this investigation, the players were unable to play international hockey sanctioned by the IIHF. In September, the KHL dropped its opposition to Filatov's contract with the Blue Jackets, and he received his transfer.|$|E
5|$|Jogaila {{had sent}} Klemens Moskarzewski to {{establish}} a Polish garrison in Vilnius and stabilize the situation, but this move only angered the opposition. In May 1389 Jogaila tried <b>to</b> <b>mediate</b> <b>the</b> conflict between Skirgaila and Vytautas in Lublin. Vytautas was pressured into signing a formal document declaring that he was loyal to Skirgaila and supported him, but his position as Duke of Lutsk was not formally acknowledged. Vytautas secured his position in Lutsk, and turned his sights on Vilnius. According to Teutonic testimony at the Council of Constance, Vytautas planned {{to take advantage of}} his sister's wedding by sending wagons filled with meat, hay, and other goods to Vilnius. The wagons would be escorted by armed men, who would capture the castle once inside the city. This plan was uncovered by a German spy and the conspirators were executed. In another setback, two of Vytautas' strongest allies, his brother Tautvilas and his brother-in-law Ivan Olshanski, lost their territories in Navahrudak and Halshany.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania severed its {{diplomatic}} ties with Poland after the Polish general Lucjan Żeligowski staged a mutiny in October 1920 {{by order of}} Józef Piłsudski. He invaded Lithuanian-held territory, captured the disputed city of Vilnius (known to Poles as Wilno), and established the short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania. This entity was incorporated into Poland in 1922. In demographic terms Vilnius was the least Lithuanian of Lithuanian cities, divided almost evenly between the Polish-speaking population and Jews, with Lithuanian-speaking inhabitants constituting about 2–3% of the population, according to Russian (1897) and German (1916) censuses. Lithuania demanded that Polish troops withdraw behind the line drawn in the Suwałki Agreement, while Poland falsely maintained {{that it had not}} authorized Żeligowski's actions. The League attempted <b>to</b> <b>mediate</b> <b>the</b> dispute and Paul Hymans presented concrete proposals to form a federation. However, both sides were unwilling to make compromises and negotiations collapsed in January 1922. In January 1923, Lithuanian troops crossed over to the Allied-held Memelland and staged the Klaipėda revolt. It {{was one of the main}} factors that led to the decision of the Conference of Ambassadors to award Vilnius to Poland in March 1923.|$|E

5|$|Nauendorf {{continued}} his raids, the soldiers foraged {{for food and}} dug up the local potato crop, and Joseph and Frederick glared at one another by Königgrätz. Maria Theresa had sent Kaunitz on a secret mission to Berlin to offer a truce. In a second trip, she offered a settlement, and finally wrote to Catherine in Russia to ask for assistance. When Joseph discovered his mother's maneuvering behind his back, he furiously offered to resign. His mother enlisted the assistance she needed. Catherine offered <b>to</b> <b>mediate</b> <b>the</b> dispute; if her assistance was unacceptable, {{she was willing to}} send fifty thousand troops to augment the Prussian force, {{despite the fact that she}} disliked Frederick and her alliance with him was strictly defensive. Frederick withdrew portions of his force in mid-September. In October, Joseph withdrew most of his army to the Bohemian border and Frederick withdrew his remaining troops into Prussia. Two small forces of hussars and dragoons remained in Bohemia to provide a winter cordon; these forces allowed Joseph and Frederick to keep an eye on each other while their diplomats negotiated at Teschen.|$|E
5|$|Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, agreed <b>to</b> <b>mediate</b> <b>the</b> dispute. A truce {{was signed}} on 8 October 1409 and {{was set to}} expire on 24 June 1410. Both sides used this {{time to prepare for}} war, {{gathering}} troops and engaging in diplomatic maneuvering. Both sides sent letters and envoys accusing each other of various wrongdoings and threats to Christendom. Wenceslaus, who received a gift of 60,000 florins from the knights, declared that Samogitia rightfully belonged to the knights and only Dobrzyń Land should be returned to Poland. The knights also paid 300,000 ducats to Sigismund of Hungary, who had ambitions regarding the Principality of Moldavia, for mutual military assistance. Sigismund attempted to break the Polish–Lithuanian alliance by offering Vytautas a king's crown; Vytautas's acceptance would have violated the terms of the Ostrów Agreement and created Polish-Lithuanian discord. At the same time, Vytautas managed to obtain a truce from the Livonian Order.|$|E
