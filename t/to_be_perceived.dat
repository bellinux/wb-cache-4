5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded him as an unambiguously saintly figure, a status that he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} {{what appears to}} have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and the Muslims {{buried the}} {{dead on the}} battlefield, {{returning}} home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E

60|$|Ko-tan {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceiving</b> {{these facts}} {{for the first}} time and there was an indication that his skepticism was faltering. At that moment a young warrior who had pushed his way forward from the opposite side of the pyramid to where he could obtain a good look at Tarzan raised his voice.|$|R

5|$|The prince began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as a unifier {{towards the}} middle of the 19th century. Such an {{interpretation}} is completely lacking in the historiography of the 17th-century chroniclers, and even in that of the Transylvanian School around 1800. What they emphasized, apart from the exceptional personality of Michael himself, were the idea of Christendom and his close relations with Emperor Rudolf. The conqueror's ambition is likewise frequently cited as a motivation for his action, occupying in the interpretative schema the place that was later to be occupied by the Romanian idea.|$|E
5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
5|$|Umran {{was first}} given {{the command of}} the 5th Brigade in Homs, but was {{promoted}} in June to become commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. As head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, Jadid appointed friends to senior positions, purged his enemies and appointed several Ba'athists to senior positions. Ahmad Suwaydani, {{one of the new}} members of the Military Committee, was appointed Head of Military Intelligence and Mazyad Hunaydi became Head of the Military Police. The Military Academy at Homs was put under Ba'athist control—several hundred Ba'athists, including Assad's brother Rifaat al-Assad, were given a crash course in military teaching before being given command. Assad became the de facto head of the Syrian Air Force, a dizzying promotion for a man in his thirties. Considering that the members of the Military Committee were all too young <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as the real leaders of Syria by the populace, the Military Committee appointed Colonel Amin al-Hafiz to the post of Minister of the Interior.|$|E

5|$|Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate {{drastically}} increased; {{where he}} had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years. He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta, Argentina's all-time top scorer, for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country. His first hat-trick with the Albicelestes came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure {{their place in the}} 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013; in addition to providing an assist, he scored twice from a penalty kick, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind only Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign. Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> more favourably in Argentina.|$|E

25|$|In Rublev's art two {{traditions are}} combined: the highest asceticism and the classic harmony of Byzantine mannerism. The {{characters}} {{of his paintings}} are always peaceful and calm.

25|$|Alexei's {{character}} {{was not intended}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as an individual, but rather, a symbol to the entire Soviet people: he was depicted as an archetypal worker; his date of birth is given as 25 October 1917 by the Julian Calendar, {{the day of the}} October Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Today, many Bedouin call {{themselves}} 'Negev Arabs' rather than 'Bedouin', explaining that 'Bedouin' identity is intimately tied {{in with a}} pastoral nomadic way of life – {{a way of life}} they say is over.

25|$|Later, the Pentecostal Movement {{emerged from}} the Holiness Movement, {{teaching}} that the believer could, in addition to becoming sanctified, receive power from God and the Gifts of the Holy Spirit.

25|$|Puck {{suggests}} a secret history of these routes, for unsurprisingly they attracted long extant folk lore, running {{not only through}} the physical countryside but also through the invisible geography, the 'mental terrain', of pre-industrial country-folk. Shakespeare's lines leave {{little doubt that the}} physical corpse roads came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as being spirit routes, taking on qualities which lingered in the folklore of his age and which he incorporated into his play knowing {{that it would be a}} familiar concept.|$|E
25|$|In Guernsey in 1940, the Germans proposed, {{instead of}} letters, {{to record a}} message to be {{transmitted}} by them over a radio so that people in Britain could listen. The message recorded by Ambrose Sherwill was broadcast and caused controversy as it mentioned the exemplary conduct of the German soldiers and how the population was being well looked after. This was not the way Churchill wished the Germans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived,</b> but would have provided comfort to islanders in Britain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Further {{research}} into the question of veridical perception during the "naturalistic" near-death out-of-body experience (nND OBE), that phase of the near-death experience in which the experiencer seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceiving</b> a normal earthly realm, would <b>be</b> of value <b>to</b> NDErs, their caregivers, and humanity in general.

I discuss unresolved issues in the design and implementation of such a procedure, and identify further areas of research...|$|R
25|$|The {{underlying}} principle may be {{the specific}} allotment in Jewish worship of a particular mode to each sacred occasion, because of some esthetic appropriateness felt to underlie the association. In contrast to the meager modal choice of modern melody, the synagogal tradition revels {{in the possession of}} scale-forms preserved from the remote past, much as are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> in the plain-song of the Catholic, the Byzantine, and the Armenian churches, as well as Hungarian, Roma, Persian and Arab sources.|$|E
25|$|The Kabbalistic account {{explains}} {{this difference}} in terms of the Four Worlds. All prophecy emanates from the divine chokhmah (wisdom) realm of Atziluth. However, in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> it descends to be enclothed in vessels of lower Worlds. Isaiah's prophecy saw the Merkabah in the World of Beriah divine understanding, restraining his explanation by realising the inadequacy of description. Ezekiel saw the Merkabah in the lower World of Yetzirah divine emotions, causing him to describe the vision in rapturous detail.|$|E
25|$|The Progressive Canadian party aims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as the {{successor}} {{party to the}} Progressive Conservatives. However, it does not enjoy broad support among former Progressive Conservatives. In particular, no prominent anti-merger Progressive Conservatives such as Joe Clark or David Orchard {{are associated with the}} Progressive Canadian Party, nor are any sitting MPs or senators. The most prominent members to join were to 1970s and 1980s era politicians: former cabinet minister Sinclair Stevens and former junior cabinet minister, Heward Grafftey, who polled near or below Craig Chandler in the final PC Party leadership race.|$|E
