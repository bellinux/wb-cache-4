5|$|On 19 and 20 October, Singaporean police {{questioned}} Took as part {{of their}} investigations; he said that three Chinese men kidnapped the girl. After questioning Took, police accompanied him home and to the police station again for a polygraph test. On the way, they stopped at a restaurant along Pasir Panjang Road for a meal. While eating, Took said he needed to go to the toilet, escaped, took a taxi to Woodlands and sneaked across the Causeway to Malaysia. Singaporean police searched for him until he turned himself in on 30 October, confessing that he had accidentally strangled Huang Na during a game of hide-and-seek in a storeroom. The following day, Huang Na's body was found at Telok Blangah Hill Park, and <b>Took</b> <b>was</b> charged with her murder. Direct Singapore Funeral Services oversaw her funeral for free. Thousands attended Huang Na's wake and funeral; some gave bai jin and gifts, such as sweets, flowers and her favourite Hello Kitty merchandise. However, some Singaporeans tried to make money from the girl's death by buying 4D numbers associated with her. Others spread rumours that Shuying was having affairs and was greedy for donations.|$|E
5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that <b>Took</b> <b>was</b> schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, was inappropriate {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E
5|$|The first {{alternative}} was to march southeast to the River Kennet and cross it, going through Newbury {{and returning to}} Reading's fortifications, thus evading the Royalists and allowing for a safe retreat to London. The disadvantage to {{this was the time}} it would take to cross the relatively open land between Essex's position and the Kennet. The second, and the option Essex initially <b>took,</b> <b>was</b> to go north, either to make battle in more advantageous circumstances or to evade the Royalists. If Essex was able to cross to {{the west bank of the}} River Avon, he could secure the bridges across it and prevent the Royalists from crossing it and confronting his army. His cavalry advanced to Upton to screen the main force from Royalist interference on 11 September, with the rest of the soldiers quickly following. The Royalists were left wrong-footed; Charles did not discover Essex's retreat for another 24 hours, during which the gap between the armies widened. The Royalists finally began to march on 16 September, with Rupert's cavalry streaming ahead to try to disrupt the Parliamentarian retreat.|$|E

5|$|Tomlinson {{was born}} to Jim and Ann Tomlinson in Matlock, Derbyshire. He moved to London when he was 17 {{to work as a}} scaffolder. At the time of his death, at the age of 47, he was working casually as a vendor for the Evening Standard, London's evening newspaper. Married twice with nine children, {{including}} stepchildren, Tomlinson had a history of alcoholism, as a result of which he had been living apart from his second wife, Julia, for 13 years, and had experienced long periods of homelessness. He had been staying since 2008 in the Lindsey Hotel, a shelter for the homeless on Lindsey Street, Smithfield, EC1. At the time of his death, he was walking across London's financial district in an effort to reach the Lindsey Hotel, his way hampered at several points by police lines. The route he <b>took</b> <b>was</b> his usual way home from a newspaper stand on Fish Street Hill outside Monument tube station, where he worked with a friend, Barry Smith.|$|E

25|$|Thus, - {{according}} to Zaehner - while {{the direction that}} the Sassanids <b>took</b> <b>was</b> not altogether {{at odds with the}} spirit of the Gathas, the extreme dualism that accompanied a divinity that was remote and inaccessible made the faith less than attractive. Zurvanism was then truly heretical only {{in the sense that it}} weakened the appeal of Zoroastrianism.|$|E

50|$|Horowitz's first {{recordings}} {{were on a}} piano roll for Welte and Sons in January 1927 {{and just}} one year later in 1928 for Duo-Art. Also in 1928 Horowitz made his first disc recording of the piece for Victor, taking five attempts before a satisfactory <b>take</b> <b>was</b> approved, <b>takes</b> 1-3 <b>were</b> cut on 26 March and takes 4 and 5 on the 2nd of April, <b>take</b> 5 <b>was</b> chosen for issue the other <b>takes</b> <b>were</b> destroyed.

25|$|On 4 June, Norton and Somervell {{were able}} to start their summit bid at 6:40 am, later than {{originally}} planned. A spilled water bottle caused the delay, and a new quantity had to be melted. But the litre of water each man <b>took</b> <b>was</b> wholly inadequate for their climb, and a chronic shortcoming of the pre-WW-II climbs. Weather was ideal. After ascending the North Ridge more than , they decided to traverse the North Face diagonally but, not breathing supplemental oxygen, the effect of altitude forced them to stop frequently to rest.|$|E
25|$|The Islanders {{continued}} to struggle and in 1989, they missed {{the playoffs for}} the first time since 1974. In the first game of the Islanders' next playoff series, in 1990, LaFontaine suffered the first of many concussions, after a controversial, open-ice hit by James Patrick of the New York Rangers. He fell on his head and was unconscious while being taken off the ice on a stretcher. The ambulance he <b>took</b> <b>was</b> delayed en route to the hospital by Ranger fans who rocked and pounded it as it left Madison Square Garden. He was lost for the remainder of the series.|$|E

25|$|Before {{making his}} senior team debut, Eagleston {{represented}} Ireland A against Denmark and Marylebone Cricket Club. Although Eaglestone {{was part of}} the 15-man squad that toured Bangladesh in early 2008, he did not play on the tour. He made his international debut on 1 July 2008, playing against New Zealand in a One Day International (ODI) as part of the 2008 Associates Tri-Series in Scotland. Ireland lost the match, which was played in Scotland, by 290runs. Eaglestone opened the bowling with fellow seamer Peter Connell– who was also on debut– and finished with figures of 7–0–60–1 as New Zealand amassed 402 from their 50overs. The first wicket Eaglestone <b>took</b> <b>was</b> that of Brendon McCullum for 166.|$|E
25|$|The 1947 English cricket {{season was}} {{dominated}} by the batting exploits of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich, who both broke records for the numbers of runs scored in a season. Mann's accuracy {{was one of the}} few factors that could subdue the English pair, and his first bowling in Test cricket, in the first game of the five-match series, was a spell of eight successive maidens; he finished the innings with figures of no wickets for 10 runs in 20 overs. He followed that up when England followed on with second-innings figures of one for 94 in 60 overs: the single wicket that he <b>took</b> <b>was</b> that of Compton, but Compton had made 163 by that stage and the match was easily saved.|$|E
25|$|He {{intended}} {{to clean up}} the administration of Goa. Within a week of arrival, Peres's brought new reforms and made new appointments to the Finance and Justice departments. He took some steps to benefit locals which irked the whites and mestiços. One of the first measures he <b>took</b> <b>was</b> to form a new city council. The members of the council were Manuel Correia da Silva e Gama, Brigadier José António de Melo Souto, and Major D. Teles José Maria de Castro e Almeida. He also reorganised the judicial services and abolished monastic orders. He made concessions to the communidades by removing the tax that they had to pay to the state, amounting to one-sixth of their income. He also tried to end the abuses by the privileged classes.|$|E

25|$|The {{architectural}} form which cathedrals <b>took</b> <b>was</b> largely dependent upon their ritual {{function as the}} seat of a bishop. Cathedrals are places where, in common with other Christian churches, the Eucharist is celebrated, the Bible is read, the Order of Service is said or sung, prayers are offered and sermons are preached. But in a cathedral, in general, these things are done with a greater amount of elaboration, pageantry and procession than in lesser churches. This elaboration is particularly present during important liturgical rites performed by a Bishop, such as Confirmation and Ordination. A cathedral is often the site of rituals associated with local or national Government, the Bishops performing the tasks of all sorts from the induction of a mayor to the coronation of a monarch. Some of these tasks are apparent in the form and fittings of particular cathedrals.|$|E
25|$|By 1969 {{there was}} a rift {{developing}} between the two-halves of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Bolan and his girlfriend June Child were living a quiet life, Bolan working on his book of poetry entitled The Warlock of Love and concentrating on his songs and performance skills. Took, however, had fully embraced the anti-commercial, drug-taking ethos of the UK Underground scene centred around Ladbroke Grove. <b>Took</b> <b>was</b> also attracted to anarchic elements such as Mick Farren/Deviants {{and members of the}} Pink Fairies Rock 'n' Roll and Drinking Club. Took also began writing his own songs, and wanted the duo to perform them, but Bolan strongly disapproved of his bandmate's efforts, rejecting them for the duo's putative fourth album, in production in Spring/Summer 1969. In response to Bolan's rebuff, Took contributed two songs as well as vocals and percussion to Twink's Think Pink album.|$|E
25|$|By 10:35 {{the battle}} was over. The Spanish lost five gunboats, three {{transports}} and one pontoon while the Americans took no casualties. The only significant damage the Americans <b>took</b> <b>was</b> a three pounder gun that broke loose from its rivets on the Wompatuck though one of USS Wilmingtons guns was disabled due to enemy fire for a few minutes. The threat posed by the Spanish flotilla was eliminated, and the American squadron returned to the main fleet, with Wompatuck leaving {{the rest of the}} victorious vessels and instead arriving at Guantanamo Bay to bring the Admiral news of the latest American victory. Although the Spanish naval presence in Manzanillo was eliminated Spanish troops still controlled the town and it would not be until {{the very end of the}} war that Manzanillo fell to American troops after a fiece bombardment of the city and attack by Cuban insurgents.|$|E
