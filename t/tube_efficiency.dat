50|$|The two then {{considered}} {{what would}} happen if the two metal plates of the magnetron were replaced by resonators, essentially combining the existing magnetron and klystron concepts. The magnet would cause the electrons to travel in a circle, as in the case of the magnetron, so they would pass by each of the resonators, generating microwaves much more efficiently than the plate concept. Recalling that Heinrich Hertz had used loops of wire as resonators, as opposed to the disk-shaped cavities of the klystron, it seemed possible that multiple resonators could be placed around the centre of the magnetron. More importantly, they was no real limit to the number or size of these loops. One could greatly improve the power of the system by extending the loops into cylinders, the power handling then being defined by the length of the <b>tube.</b> <b>Efficiency</b> could be improved by increasing the number of resonators, as each electron could thus interact with more resonators during its orbits. The only practical limits were based on the required frequency and desired physical size of the tube.|$|E

This phenomenon {{is responsible for}} several undesirable effects in X-ray tubes, in particular {{a reduction in the}} X-ray output. The extent of this shortfall has been estimated by using Monte Carlo simulation to start electrons at increasing depth inside the anode, the results indicating that an output enhancement of nearly 50 % could be achieved in principle if the electrons wasted in back-scatter events could be trapped inside a tungsten anode. To test this idea a further set of simulations were done for a novel anode geometry. Results showed that X-ray <b>tube</b> <b>efficiencies</b> might be substantially enhanced by this approach.

40|$|International audienceA {{parametric}} {{study on}} a 300 kWth furnace equipped with {{three pairs of}} regenerative flameless combustion burners has been performed. Each burner pair has a rated thermal power of 100 kWth firing Dutch natural gas. The objective {{of the study was}} to optimize the furnace performance, i. e., to maximize the cooling <b>tube</b> <b>efficiency</b> and minimize the CO and NO emissions. In the study the following parameters were varied: the positions of the burners in the furnace (burner configuration), the firing mode (parallel and staggered), the excess air ratio (λ) and the cycle time (tcycle). Also, the influence on the furnace performance of the jet momentum of the combustion air and the temperature uniformity in the furnace were studied. It was concluded that staggered firing mode is disadvantageous, since it results in significantly higher NO emissions than parallel firing mode. Also, out of the five investigated burner configurations one has been exempted, since its cooling <b>tube</b> <b>efficiency</b> was significantly lower compared to the other configurations. Furthermore, a horizontal setup of the firing burners improves the cooling <b>tube</b> <b>efficiency</b> at a fixed temperature uniformity. Also, for the burner configurations with the firing burners positioned closer to the regenerating burners and further from the stack, the temperatures in the regenerators are higher, leading to higher combustion air preheat temperatures. The temperature in the regenerators was also influenced by the cycle time; higher cycle times leading to higher (peak) temperatures in the regenerators. Finally, this temperature in the regenerators was shown to be more decisive for the final amount of CO emitted than the excess air ratio or the jet momentum. In all experiments, due to differences in path length of the mean flow, higher CO emissions were measured in the flue gas from the regenerators compared to in the flue gas from the stack. These two trends in the CO emissions were not observed for the NO emissions...|$|E

40|$|The use of polymer tubes {{for heat}} {{exchanger}} tube bundles {{is of interest}} in many applications where corrosion, mineral build-up and/or weight are important. The challenge of overcoming the low thermal conductivity of polymers may be met by using many small-diameter, thin-walled polymer tubes and this route is being pursued by industry. We propose the use of unique shaped tubes that are easily extruded using polymeric materials. The shaped tubes are streamlined to reduce form drag yet the inside flow passage is kept circular to maintain the pressure capability of the tube. Special treatment is required to predict convective heat transfer rates because the temperature distribution along the outer surface of the shaped tubes is non-uniform. The average forced convection Nusselt number correlations developed for these non-circular tubes {{can not be used}} directly to determine heat transfer rate. In this paper, heat transfer rates of shaped tubes are characterized by treating the tubes as a base circular tube to which longitudinal fin(s) are added. Numerical solution of an energy balance on the fin provides the surface temperature distribution and a shaped <b>tube</b> <b>efficiency,</b> which can be used {{in the same manner as}} a fin efficiency to determine the outside convective resistance. The approach is illustrated for three streamlined shapes with fins of lenticular and oval profile.

Convective heat transfer is enhanced for the oval shaped tube for 2000 ≤ Re ≤ 20, 000 when Bi < 0. 3. For polymeric materials, the Biot number in most applications will be greater than 0. 3, and adding material to the base tube reduces the heat transfer rate.

40|$|In the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer, Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) {{chambers}} and sMDT chambers {{with half of}} the tube diameter of the MDTs are used for precision muon track reconstruction. The sMDT chambers are designed for operation at high counting rates due to neutron and gamma background irradiation expected for the HL-LHC and future hadron colliders. The existing MDT read-out electronics uses bipolar signal shaping which causes an undershoot of opposite polarity and same charge after a signal pulse. At high counting rates and short electronics dead time used for the sMDTs, signal pulses pile up on the undershoot of preceding background pulses leading to a reduction of the signal amplitude and a jitter in the drift time measurement and, therefore, to a degradation of drift <b>tube</b> <b>efficiency</b> and spatial resolution. In order to further increase the rate capability of sMDT tubes, baseline restoration can be used in the read-out electronics to suppress the pile-up effects.

The analytical performances of these spray chambers are compared with commercial glass and PFA chambers in terms of signal intensity, stability, oxide ratio, LOD and wash-out time. LODs measured with polymer printed chambers are in the range or even outperform those measured with the glass chamber even though 3 D-printed chambers provide lower results in terms of sensitivity than glass.
