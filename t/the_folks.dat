VanDerWerff felt {{that although the}} episode contained several plot holes, it worked with [...] "a kind of dream sense, following its own weird, nightmare logic". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5. Gibron found that the episode contained several overly-unbelievable moments but was overall [...] "another great episode, even with some rather minor flaws". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "A Single Blade of Grass" [...] one star out of five. Shearman felt that the episode was [...] "tedious", citing a lack of any real action and a [...] "banal" [...] ending which he described as having been poorly foreshadowed.

James Poniewozik of Time magazine strongly praised [...] "Li'l Sebastian", and called {{it one of the}} best episodes of the season. He said Li'l Sebastian's funeral brought out the best in the characters, and that the episode [...] "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> we've come to know in Pawnee". Henry Hanks of CNN called it [...] "one of the funniest half-hours of any show this season", and compared the Li'l Sebastian funeral to the funeral scenes in the Mary Tyler Moore Show episode [...] "Chuckles Bites the Dust". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called the episode a [...] "triumphant exclamation point at the end of Parks and Recreations third season", and described every moment as [...] "uproariously funny".

In light of all this, our question is: why do <b>the</b> <b>folk</b> endorse moral universalism? Our hypothesis is that folk judgments of moral universalism are generated {{in part by a}} desire to punish. We present evidence supporting this across three studies. On the basis of this, we argue for a debunking explanation of folk judgments of moral universalism. Our results not only further our understanding of the psychological processes underpinning folk judgments of moral universalism. They also bear on philosophical discussions of folk meta-ethics...|$|R

The Sydney Morning Herald's readers gave the episode three out of five stars, while the paper's television critic, Andrew Murfett, commented [...] "The clock is omnipresent in tonight's 'real-time' Neighbours episode.

James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it a [...] "splendid" [...] episode that [...] "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> we've come to know in Pawnee". Punchline Magazine writer Megan Gilbert said the episode featured [...] "plenty of laugh-out-loud moments" [...] and particularly enjoyed the [...] "sweet non-aggressive fighting" [...] between April and Andy. Gilbert felt Adam Scott was underused, but praised the performances of Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari and Mo Collins. TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook said the difficulties that plague the harvest festival were funny, [...] "but like the best of Parks, these hiccups are matched with acres of heart". He praised the growing romantic interest between Leslie and Ben, as well as the subplot about Andy and April. Alex Strachan of the Montreal Gazette praised the show for being funny without resorting to cynicism or cruel jokes, and called the series [...] "one of the sharpest, smartest comedies on TV at the moment". He also called the Wamapoke curse subplot [...] "wildly politically incorrect, but funny". National Post writer Scott Stinson said Parks and Recreation [...] "continues to challenge for the title of best comedy on television", and called the continuing romance between April and Andy a [...] "welcome development" [...] for both characters.|$|E
500|$|Computer Gaming World writer Arinn Dembo {{called the}} storyline {{of a couple}} buying a haunted mansion [...] "a cliché so {{familiar}} that it needs no explanation", but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne {{was too much of}} an exaggeratedly feminine [...] "girlie-type girl". Overall, Dembo said the game [...] "achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game" [...] and was [...] "an important technological leap, and represents a step forward for the whole industry". Another Computer Gaming World review said Phantasamagoria [...] "appears to deliver on its ambitious promises" [...] and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that [...] "would have had even <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> in Amityville making tracks". Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said some of the acting was [...] "hilariously bad" [...] and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with [...] "so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've seen it all before".|$|E
