5|$|For the {{remainder}} of Anderson's childhood, the Queales lived at 56 Villa Street, in a house abutting Yeronga Memorial Park. On {{the opposite side of}} the park was Yeronga State School, the school at which Anderson began her formal education. In spite of its reputation as one of the best state schools in Queensland at the time, Yeronga State School rapidly became a site of dread and frustration for Anderson, who suffered from a speech impediment that caused strife for her in the classroom. Anderson's speech impediment (as well as her occasional flirtations with <b>truancy)</b> became such a hindrance to her education that her parents decided that she was to be home-schooled by her mother for a year, while attending weekly speech therapy sessions in the city. In spite of these efforts, Anderson's slight stammer was to stay with her for the rest of her life; several observers commented that the impediment lent her speech a careful and deliberate air. Following her primary school education, Anderson attended high school at Brisbane State High School. Upon graduation, she attended Brisbane Technical College Art School.|$|E
5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for <b>truancy.</b> Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E
5|$|Lamont's {{childhood}} was divided between Glasgow and her mother's family home on Tiree, {{where she and}} her brother David spent their summer holidays. She attended Woodside Secondary School, having declined to take scholarship exams for selective education. Like her parents, she was a Gaelic speaker, but she did not believe she spoke it well enough, and she dropped it at school in favour of French and German. It was also at school that she first developed an interest in politics, once entering a Daily Mirror competition with a politically-themed short story. The tale, whose central character discussed her intention to demand a pay rise and was finally revealed to be the Queen, won Lamont third prize. She studied English and History at the University of Glasgow, graduating with an MA. Joining the Labour Party in 1975, she was active in the Glasgow University Labour Club where she was a contemporary of fellow Labour politician Margaret Curran, and was also involved with the women's movement. She trained as a teacher for a year at Jordanhill College, gaining a Postgraduate Certificate in Education, and afterwards joined Rothesay Academy, Isle of Bute, as a teacher in 1979. She taught at Springburn Academy in Glasgow from 1982 to 1989 and at Castlemilk High School, also in Glasgow, from 1990 to 1999. Lamont taught English and worked with social workers and educational psychologists attempting to tackle instances of school <b>truancy.</b>|$|E

A similar walkout occurred in 1951 when school administration disqualified a candidate for student body office because of a questionable campaign speech. Administration retaliated by focusing on agitators within the heretofore self-selective service clubs, suspending the clubs and then reorganizing them later with a more pliant membership. Small protests (e.g. graffiti, lawn burnings, tree fellings) continued sporadically for a year.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Asthma is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} disease during childhood, known {{as the most important}} reason for children's disability adolescences <b>truancies,</b> thanks to their hospitalization and as a result intensification of disease symptom. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study is quasi-experimental kind, implemented with two groups. Sampling method was straightforward. 80 student's second-grade high school students constitute participants. Both groups were homogenized considering age, gender, education, and parent's vocation. First of all, a letter agreement was received from students. Then, the knowledge and accomplishment of students were measured by means of relevant questionnaire and checklist in advance of educational intervention. In the next step, during 4 sessions, educational content specified beforehand was presented to students via interview, lecture, group discussion, and display methods. The knowledge and accomplishment of both groups' students was measured through questionnaire and checklist. Finally, the data was analyzed by SPSS 16 and statistical test of t-paired, independent-t, man-Whitney, and ANOVA. RESULTS The finding demonstrated that group's student accomplishment registered 91. 8 ± 1. 3 while being 2. 2 ± 0. 6 before holding session. In addition, their knowledge increased significantly, registering 99. 6 ± 1. 2 while it had measured as 1. 3 ± 0. 3 before sessions. The results of paired t-test indicated that the average of difference between knowledge and accomplishment grades of two groups was significant (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS Regarding the finding of the present study and the fact that asthma is on the rise resulting in an increase in <b>truancies</b> as well as stressing the efficacy of training peers suffering from the disease, the implementation of the curriculum could be necessary...|$|R
