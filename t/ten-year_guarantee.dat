5000|$|Aliba Imti {{continued}} {{to strive for}} a settlement between the Government and the NNC members. As {{a result of his}} efforts, on June 26, 1947, Sir Muhammad Saleh Akbar Hydari, the Governor of Assam, reached a Nine-Points Agreement with the Naga leaders. It was decided that the Nagas would be granted judicial, executive and legislative powers, as well as autonomy in land-related matters. There was a <b>ten-year</b> <b>guarantee</b> of these provisions {{at the end of which}} the Nagas could choose between extending the agreement or a new agreement. The Naga leaders were also promised unification of Naga territories from nearby districts into the Naga Hills District. However, the Constituent Assembly refused to ratify the Hydari accord. The Naga leaders envisaged a sovereign state with India as a [...] "Guardian Power" [...] for ten years, while the Indian Constituent Assembly concluded that the Nine Points Agreement guaranteed only a [...] "district autonomy within the Indian Constitution".|$|E
40|$|Groups of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) back {{each other}} and form {{guarantee}} network to obtain loan from banks. The risk over the networked enterprises may cause significant contagious damage. To dissolve such risks, we propose a hybrid feature representation, which is feeded into a gradient boosting model for credit risk assessment of guarantee network. Empirical study is performed on a <b>ten-year</b> <b>guarantee</b> loan record from commercial banks. We find that often {{hundreds or thousands of}} enterprises back {{each other and}} constitute a sparse complex network. We study the risk of various structures of loan guarantee network, and observe the high correlation between defaults with centrality, and with the communities of the network. In particular, our quantitative risk evaluation model shows promising prediction performance on real-world data, which can be useful to both regulators and stakeholders.

50|$|The {{construction}} of the W.A.C. Bennett Dam involved over twenty unions that were bound by <b>ten-year</b> contracts <b>guaranteeing</b> BC Hydro no lockouts or strike action. This contract allowed the project to be built without labour delays. The men involved on the project were international, coming from around North America, Europe, {{and as far as}} Japan. The workers onsite lived in temporary camps built around the Portage Mountain site with more workers in the summer and fewer in the winter. Much of the construction occurred inside the dam which was claustrophobic, full of exhaust fumes, and occasionally subject to cave-ins. In total, 16 men have lost their lives working on the dam.|$|R
5|$|The city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, {{is covered}} by a citywide {{broadband}} wireless internet network, sometimes called Wireless Minneapolis. The network was first proposed in 2003, at which point only a few other cities nationwide had such systems in place. Local firm US Internet beat out EarthLink to build and operate the network, with a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>ten-year,</b> multimillion-dollar contract from the city itself as the network's anchor tenant. Construction began on the project in 2006, but encountered several delays. Most {{of the city was}} covered by the network by 2010, and USI Wireless, the subsidiary of US Internet responsible for the system, set up numerous free internet access points at public locations around Minneapolis.|$|R
40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the Centre Europeenne pour la Recherche Nucleaire (CERN), Geneva, Switzerland, is a proton-proton {{collider}} with a luminosity of 10 ** 3 ** 4 /cm** 2 s {{and will}} be working for ten years (starting in 2007). The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) {{will be one of}} the four general-purpose detectors. The CMS tracker consists of ten barrel layers, plus 2 multiplied by 9 end cap discs, which amounts to a total of 24 328 silicon sensors with a total area of 206 m** 2 silicon, covering a pseudorapidity of vertical bar eta; vertical bar less than approximately equals 2. 5. For the sensors close to the beam pipe, fluences of 1. 6 center dot 10 ** 1 ** 4 n// 1 MeV/cm** 2 are expected over the <b>ten-year</b> lifetime. To <b>guarantee</b> the functionality of the single-side silicon sensors during the runtime of the LHC, quality assurance was developed. In the two Irradiation Qualification Centers (IQCs) in Karlsruhe, Germany, and Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, a fraction of 1 % of the sensors are electrically qualified. In Karlsruhe, the sensors are irradiated with 26 -MeV protons and in Louvain-la-Neuve with neutrons at an average energy of 20 MeV. For reasons of flux uncertainties in the CMS tracker, sensors are irradiated with a fluence 50 % higher than predicted. For standard float zone silicon, large material dependencies have been observed under irradiation resulting in changes to various electrical parameters. To guarantee the functionality of the sensors in the tracker, it is very important to know these parameters. These electrical parameters have been determined before and after irradiation and are discussed in the following sections...|$|R
