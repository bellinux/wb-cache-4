I suspect that these lines down to the words 'throat opens,' should be removed back so as to follow the words 'on this part of the house,' in the speech of Catiline soon after the entry of the conspirators.

David V.

50|$|It {{is unknown}} whether any damnatio memoriae was totally {{successful}} {{as it would}} not be noticeable to later historians, since, by definition, it would entail the complete and <b>total</b> <b>erasure</b> of the individual in question from the historical record. It was difficult, however, to implement the practice completely. For instance, the senate wanted to condemn the memory of Caligula, but Claudius prevented this. Nero was declared an enemy of the state by the senate, but then given an enormous funeral honoring him after his death by Vitellius. While statues of some emperors were destroyed or reworked after their death, others were erected. Also, historians often wrote about the deposed emperors. Finally, many coins with the images of the discredited person continued to circulate. A particularly large number exist with Geta's image.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversion}} of the native Christians to Islam did not mean the <b>total</b> <b>erasure</b> of previous beliefs and social practises. There is some evidence of a limited cultural borrowing from the Christians by the Muwalladun and other Muslims in Al-Andalus. For instance, the Muslims' adoption of the Christian solar calendar and holidays was an exclusively Andalusi phenomenon. In Al-Andalus, the Islamic lunar calendar was supplemented by the local solar calendar, which was more useful for agricultural and navigational purposes. Like the local Mozarabs (Iberian Christians under Muslim rule in the Al-Andalus who remained unconverted to Islam), the Muslims of Al-Andalus were notoriously heavy drinkers. The Muslims also celebrated traditional Christian holidays, sometimes with the sponsorship of their leaders, {{despite the fact that}} such fraternisation was generally opposed by the Ulema. The Muslims also hedged their religious devotions through the use of Roman Catholic sacraments.|$|E
40|$|My study {{explores the}} {{underlying}} factors that allow systemic structural issues to exist within continuation high schools which {{result in the}} low educational performance of low-income Latinx continuation students. My study focuses on educators’ experiences, as I conducted 20 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with Southern California continuation high school teachers. I focused on the following areas of study: the teacher’s career, the teacher’s interactions with students, and the teacher’s opinions regarding their accessibility to funding and resources. My findings indicate that teachers, the outer community, and school-board administrators utilize cultural deficit thinking and stigmatization as tools of <b>total</b> <b>erasure</b> to exchange low-income Latinx students’ social identities with racist and classist stereotypes; in consequence, these mechanisms allow the district to impose invisibility on students’ academic and emotional needs {{in order to justify}} the formation and maintenance of institutional challenges for administrators’ fiscal benefit. Overall, these results reaffirm that our educational system reproduces social inequality; the <b>total</b> <b>erasure</b> of low-income Latinx continuation students’ academic and emotional needs permits the persistence of systemic structural issues informed by racist and classist stereotypes. My research calls for avenues of communication between administrators, teachers, and the outer community to address institutional barriers and, subsequently, establish equitable funding distributions to promote continuation high school students’ educational success with an understanding of the increased academic, emotional, and social needs of low-income Latinx students...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{cells of}} flash {{memories}} can only endure {{a limited number}} of write cycles, usually between 10, 000 and 1, 000, 000. Furthermore, cells containing data must be erased before they can store new data, and erasure operations erase large blocks of memory, not individual cells. To maximize the endurance of the device (the amount of useful data that can be written to it before one of its cells wears out), flash-based systems move data around in an attempt to reduce the <b>total</b> number of <b>erasures</b> and to level the wear of the different erase blocks. This data movement introduces interesting online problems called wear-leveling problems. We show that a simple randomized algorithm for one problem is essentially optimal. For a more difficult problem, we show that clever offline algorithms can improve upon naive approaches, but online algorithms essentially cannot. ...|$|R
40|$|Flash {{memories}} {{are widely used}} in computer systems ranging from embedded systems to workstations and servers to digital cameras and mobile phones. The memory cells of flash devices can only endure {{a limited number of}} write cycles, usually between 10, 000 and 1, 000, 000. Furthermore, cells containing data must be erased before they can store new data, and erasure operations erase large blocks of memory, not individual cells. To maximize the endurance of the device (the amount of useful data that can be written to it before one of its cells wears out), flash-based systems move data around in an attempt to reduce the <b>total</b> number of <b>erasures</b> and to level the wear of the different erase blocks. This data movement introduces an interesting online problem called the wear-leveling problem. Wear-leveling algorithms have been used at least since 1993, but they have never been mathematically analyzed. In this paper we analyze the two main wear-leveling problems. We show that a simple randomized algorithm for one of them is essentially optimal both in the competitive sense and in the absolute sense (our competitive result relies on an analysis of a nearly-optimal offline algorithm). We show that deterministic algorithms cannot achieve comparable endurance. We also analyze a more difficult problem and show that offline algorithms for it can improve upon naive approaches, but that online algorithms essentially cannot...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{processes}} {{and actions of}} diversifying memories of division in Northern Ireland’s political conflict known as the Troubles. Societal division is manifested in its built fabric and territories that have been adopted by predominant discourses of a fragmented society in Belfast; the unionist east and the nationalist west. The aim of the paper is to explore current approaches in planning contested spaces that have changed over time, leading to success in many cases. The argument is that divided cities, like Belfast, feature spatial images and memories of division that range from physical, clear-cut segregation to manifested actions of violence and have become influential representations in the community’s associative memory. While promoting notions of ‘re-imaging’ by current councils demonstrates a <b>total</b> <b>erasure</b> of the Troubles through cleansing its local collective memory, there yet remains an attempt to communicate a different tale of the city’s socio-economic past, to elaborate its supremacy for shaping future lived memories. Yet, planning Belfast’s contested areas is still suffering from a poor understanding of the context and its complexity against overambitious visions...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} {{the influence of}} identity on literary commitment in Bessie Head’s When rain clouds gather. In particular, the study {{is interested in the}} hybrid syncretic crossings reflected in the text and which define her commitment as a writer in the Third Space – a dimension that has so far been overlooked by critics of her literary works. The study adopts the analytical research design. The postcolonial theory is instrumental in the reading, analysis and interpretation of the selected text. The data collected through content analysis of the text is coded according to thematic concerns, the mode of characterization and the vision of the author. The findings reveal that Head’s identity influences her commitment in her choice of characters that like herself, are cast in the in-between space. These characters shuttle between points of inclusion and exclusion. Within this in-between or Third Space, identities defy fixity thereby remaining fickle, fluid and unstable. People are thus cast in a perpetual process of becoming, always mutating or changing into something ‘other’. Essentialist formulations of identity are undermined by defiance of territorial confinement which allows for cultural fusion, but in the process also results in fission or more precisely, a shift from essentialist perceptions of self image. Hybridity, on the other hand, emerges as the coexistence of differences. In such cases, differences meet, mix and tolerate one another. However, it does not imply <b>total</b> <b>erasure</b> of cultural differences; its only impact is to blur the boundaries. Despite this, hybridity is propped by the author as the recipe for a perfect society...|$|E
