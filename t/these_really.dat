5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we were sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played <b>these</b> <b>really</b> beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took <b>these</b> <b>really</b> irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|The {{second early}} stone design, {{emerging}} from the 12th century onwards, was the shell keep, a donjon annulaire in French, which involved replacing the wooden keep on a motte, or the palisade on a ringwork, with a circular stone wall. Shell keeps were sometimes further protected by an additional low protective wall, called a chemise, around their base. Buildings could then be built around {{the inside of the}} shell, producing a small inner courtyard at the centre. The style was particularly popular in south-east England and across Normandy, although less so elsewhere. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development, as is the later Launceston Castle; prominent Normandy and Low Country equivalents include Gisors and the Burcht van Leiden – these castles were amongst the most powerful fortifications of the period. Although the circular design held military advantages over one with square corners, as noted above <b>these</b> <b>really</b> mattered from only the end of the 12th century onwards; the major reason for adopting a shell keep design, in the 12th century at least, was the circular design of the original earthworks exploited to support the keep; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that found at Windsor Castle.|$|E

500|$|In the mid- to late 1990s, Guillermo Scott Herren {{returned}} to Decatur, Georgia, from New York {{and worked at}} a recording studio. Unsatisfied working with the studio's clients, who he felt made [...] "pre-historic trap music", Herren was encouraged to take his music in a more left-field direction, as he was [...] "bored with people barking orders at me to make them <b>these</b> <b>really</b> boring rap beats." [...] In return for Herren handling the studio's hip hop clients, the studio owner bought him a Music Production Center (MPC) which Herren would use to create his Prefuse 73 material.|$|E
500|$|... "Guy Love" [...] was {{composed}} by Fordham and Perry. It was a late {{addition to the}} episode, brought on because, according to Bill Lawrence, [...] "All the modern musicals like Jekyll & Hyde have <b>these</b> <b>really</b> overwrought love songs, so {{we really wanted to}} have one between J.D. and Turk." [...] It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and he gave her the hook, [...] "It's guy love, between two guys." [...] The writing became easier, but she still wanted a reference to a tender moment between Turk and J.D. She emailed D'Abruzzo, who she knew to be a big fan of the show, [...] "and, no exaggeration, five minutes later, she sent me a list of 30 [...] ", [...] including Turk performing an appendectomy on J.D. in [...] "My Day Off". [...] At first, the song {{was meant to be a}} power ballad.|$|E
500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. And while I was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in <b>these</b> <b>really</b> bleak things. And {{so it was really}} mostly after I finished the movie that I felt pain." [...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.|$|E

500|$|Ó Corrain {{also offers}} {{argument}} against the identification of Ímar and Ingvar/Ivar: [...] "To take but one example, if Ivarr of Dublin is identical with Inguar, {{how are we to}} give any credence to Smyth's reconstruction of Brompton (p. 229) which shows Ivarr in East Anglia in 871 when we know from contemporary Irish sources that Ivarr of Dublin was besieging Dumbarton for four months in 870 and returned to Ireland in early 871 with the takings?... Taken all together, the genuine material on Inguar in contemporary English sources is slight". He also states [...] "there is nothing new in the suggestion that Ímar of Dublin and Igwar/Ingwar/Iuuar of English history are identical. It has frequently been put forward....and has equally frequently been rejected or treated as a mere possibility". Downham concludes [...] "while medieval writers seem to have been as interested as modern historians about Ívarr’s origins, it is perhaps wiser to accept that {{we do not know what}} <b>these</b> <b>really</b> were".|$|E
500|$|Gravity Bone was {{developed}} using {{a modified version}} of id Software's id Tech 2, the graphics engine for Quake 2. Chung acknowledged that although he has worked with newer, [...] "powerful and flexible" [...] engines, he preferred the older engine because it was released as an open source platform, [...] "so you can redistribute it for free." [...] The voice work featured in the briefings in Gravity Bone was produced using text-to-speech programs, and the game incorporates three songs by Xavier Cugat and His Orchesetra: [...] "Maria Elena", [...] "Brazil", and [...] "Perfidia". These versions of [...] "Maria Elena" [...] and [...] "Perfidia" [...] were both previously used by film director Wong Kar-wai in the 1990 film Days of Being Wild. Chung declared that his passion for Wong's films were an important factor in the selection of Wong's music: [...] "He makes <b>these</b> <b>really</b> beautiful films and I've always wanted to use the same music in a videogame." [...] He said that Wong's films had a strong influence {{on the development of the}} game.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Out from Under" [...] {{and the other}} ballads from Circus [...] "have [...] hiccuping emotion from deep {{in the back of}} her throat". Chris Richards of The Washington Post commented that the singer [...] "emerges from her media bender hoping to forget the past" [...] with the song, and Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone considered it [...] "Spears' best ballad since 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman'". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said [...] "Out from Under" [...] "gleam with acoustic guitars", and that the song, [...] "My Baby" [...] and [...] "Unusual You", [...] "are the album's only attempts at warmth." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic considered the song, along with [...] "My Baby", [...] "a couple of not-good-at-all ballads", while Dave Donnelly of Sputnikmusic said both [...] "subtly evoke the Britney of old: airy pop ballads that benefit from the former Frou Frou producer's sophisticated, layered arrangements." [...] While comparing Circus to Blackout, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "the ballads are back, bringing with them the inevitable sprinkling of tedium". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club felt that both songs [...] "are about five years out of date, and [...] vocals seem anemic and distracted in spite of the confessional lyrics." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today commented that [...] "Spears tosses in a couple of ballads along , but <b>these</b> <b>really</b> aren't her forte. The slew of top-flight producers [...] bolsters her vocal variety of echoes and gimmicky effects, but they don't really help the breathy 'Out From Under' or saccharin 'Unusual You'". Mike Newmark of PopMatters described the song as [...] "nearly-emo" [...] along with [...] "Unusual You," [...] saying both [...] "try for heartfelt and come off flabby." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{dropping}} {{the requirement of}} having a useful description, even larger recursive countable ordinals can be obtained as the ordinals measuring the strengths of various strong theories; roughly speaking, these ordinals are the smallest ordinals that the theories cannot prove are well ordered. By taking stronger and stronger theories such as second-order arithmetic, Zermelo set theory, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, or Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with various large cardinal axioms, one gets some extremely large recursive ordinals.

[...] "My My Metrocard" [...] criticizes New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, and [...] "Hot Topic" [...] praises progressive activists. The band emphasized frankness and didacticism in its lyrics {{as a response to}} the ironic tone of hipster subculture. Le Tigre's vocals often carry a bored or soft-spoken tone, punctuated by more energetic bursts. Their use of girl group chants was likened to 1960s group the Shangri-Las. Hanna was influenced by the vocals on old records by Lesley Gore, the Shirelles, and Connie Francis. She explained that she was fascinated by [...] "what it would be like to be a woman with way more constraints than we have now, singing <b>these</b> <b>really</b> fucked-up insipid heterosexual love songs." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>These</b> <b>really</b> {{are three}} weighty almost dreadful {{considerations}} to a poetic-tempered King and Smoking Parliament. Out {{of which there}} is no refuge except indeed this plain fourth one: [...] "No hurry about Fritz's marriage; [Friedrich Wilhelm to Reichenbach (13th May), infra.] he is but eighteen gone; evidently too young for housekeeping.

6000|$|The violet, again, is {{a greatly}} overrated exemplar. It stimulates a certain bashfulness, hangs its head, and passed as modest among our simple grandparents. Its special merit is its perfume, and it pretends to wish to hide that from every eye. But, withal, the {{fragrance}} is as far-reaching as any I know. It droops ingenuously. [...] "How could {{you come to}} me," [...] it seems to say, [...] "when all <b>these</b> <b>really</b> brilliant flowers invite you?" [...] Mere fishing for compliments. All the while it is being sweet, to {{the very best of}} its undeniable ability. Then it comes, too, in early spring, without a chaperon, and catches our hearts fresh before they are jaded with the crowded beauties of May. A really modest flower would wait for the other flowers to come first. A subtle affectation is surely a different thing from modesty. The violet is simply artful, the young widow among flowers, and to hold up such a flower as an example is not doing one's duty by the young. For true modesty commend me to the agave, which flowers once only in half a hundred years, as one may see for oneself at the Royal Botanical Gardens.|$|E
