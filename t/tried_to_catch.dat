25|$|After rejoining {{the main}} army, Archduke Charles merged Kienmayer's command with the I Reserve Corps and reassigned him. He fought with {{distinction}} at the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 21–22 May, where he commanded 5,770 troopers and 24 artillery {{pieces of a}} reserve cavalry division. While the main armies battled on the Danube, light Austrian forces raided the French-allied Kingdom of Saxony, provoking King Jérôme Bonaparte to bring his Kingdom of Westphalia army into the field. In June, Archduke Charles appointed Kienmayer to form the XI Corps from the raiding forces plus reinforcements. The French <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> Kienmayer in a pincer, with Jérôme advancing from Leipzig and Jean-Andoche Junot moving from Frankfurt am Main. Kienmayer outmaneuvered them, defeating Junot at the Battle of Gefrees on 8 July. He then turned on Jérôme, who beat a hasty retreat, evacuating Saxony altogether. This notable success was negated by Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Wagram on 5–6 July.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on {{the next}} day, Loredan sent two galleys, bearing the Banner of Saint Mark, to the entry of the port of Gallipoli to open negotiations. In {{response}} the Turks sent 32 ships to attack them. Loredan withdrew his two galleys, and began to withdraw, while shooting at the Turkish ships, in order to lure them away from Gallipoli. As the Ottoman ships could {{not keep up with}} their oars, they set sail; on the Venetian side, the galley from Napoli di Romania tarried during the manoeuvre and was in danger of being caught by the pursuing Ottoman ships, so that Loredan likewise ordered his ships to set sail. Once they were had made ready for combat, Loredan ordered his ten galleys to lower sails, turn about, and face the Ottoman fleet. At that point, however, the eastern wind rose suddenly, and allowed the Ottomans to break off the pursuit and head back to Gallipoli. Loredan in turn <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up with the Ottomans, firing at them with his guns and crossbows and launching grappling hooks at the Turkish ships, but the wind and the current allowed the Ottomans to retreat speedily behind the fortifications of Gallipoli. According to Loredan, the engagement lasted until the 22nd hour.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{no longer}} {{formally}} operating as a team, Ambrose and Reigns continued to infrequently {{work together and}} maintained an on-screen friendship following The Shield's split. On the January 9, 2015 episode of SmackDown, Reigns {{was about to be}} put into a handicap match against Rollins and Big Show until Ambrose came to the aid of Reigns and helped defeat them, with the two continuously helping each other against The Authority thereafter. On the May 4 episode of Raw, Ambrose defeated Rollins and (as per pre-stipulation by the Director of Operations Kane) gained his first opportunity for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, being added to the title match at Payback and making it a fatal four-way match, also including Reigns and Randy Orton, with the latter being pinned by Rollins. During the match, Ambrose, Reigns and Rollins briefly worked together to perform their signature triple powerbomb on Orton. Ambrose later faced Rollins at Elimination Chamber on May 31, which saw Reigns' involvement after multiple interference by The Authority on Rollins' behalf to help Ambrose, who won by disqualification after Rollins pushed the referee in Ambrose's way as he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the standing Rollins with his signature diving elbow drop. Despite the win, Ambrose did not gain the championship, but he still took the championship belt with him and challenged Rollins in a ladder match at Money in the Bank on June 14, which he would go on to lose.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to Israeli covert operations, Iranian agents reportedly {{began trying to}} hit Israeli and Jewish targets; potential targets were then placed on high alert. Yoram Cohen, the head of Shin Bet, claimed that three planned attacks in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Thailand were thwarted at the last minute. On 11 October 2011, the United States claimed to have foiled an alleged Iranian plot that included bombing the Israeli and Saudi embassies in Washington DC and Buenos Aires. On 13 February 2012, Israeli embassy staff in Georgia and India were targeted. In Georgia, a car bomb failed to explode near the embassy and was safely detonated by Georgian police. In India, the car bomb exploded, injuring four people. Amongst the wounded was the wife of an Israeli Defense Ministry employee. Israel accused Iran of being behind the attacks. The following day, three alleged Iranian agents were uncovered in Bangkok, Thailand, {{thought to have been}} planning to kill Israeli diplomatic officials, including the ambassador, by attaching bombs to embassy cars. The cell was uncovered when one of their bombs exploded. Police responded, and the Iranian agent present at the house threw an explosive device at officers that tore his legs off, and was subsequently taken into custody. A second suspect was arrested as he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> a flight out of the country, and the third escaped to Malaysia, where he was arrested by Malaysian Federal Police. Thai police subsequently arrested two people suspected of involvement. Indian police arrested a Delhi-based journalist in connection with February’s car bomb, which injured four Israelis including the wife of an Israeli diplomat. Syed Mohammed Kazmi the journalist was arrested on 6 March 2012, he {{is said to have been}} in contact with a suspect police believe might have stuck a magnetic bomb to the diplomat’s car. It is said Kazmi was an Indian citizen who worked for an Iranian publication.|$|E
500|$|Hergé {{reached a}} {{particularly}} traumatic period {{in his life}} and suffered a mental breakdown. In 1956, he realised that he had fallen out of love with his wife Germaine, whom he had married in 1932, and by 1958, he and Fanny Vlaminck, a colourist at Studios Hergé twenty-eight years his junior, had developed a deep mutual attraction. They began courting; Hergé's new companion lifted his morale and shared many of his interests. Germaine soon began interfering with the courtship, causing Hergé to admit his desire had been to maintain a relationship with both women. When he failed to please either, he began to contemplate divorcing Germaine to marry Fanny. His Catholic upbringing and Boy Scout ethic, however, caused him to feel tremendous guilt. As he later related to interviewer Numa Sadoul: [...] "It meant turning upside down all my values—what a shock! This was a serious moral crisis: I was married, and I loved someone else; life seemed impossible with my wife, {{but on the other hand}} I had this scout-like idea of giving my word for ever. It was a real catastrophe. I was completely torn up." [...] During this period, Hergé had recurrent nightmares where he faced images of what he described as [...] "the beauty and cruelty of white"—visions of white and snow that he could not explain. As he later told Sadoul: [...] "At the time, I was going through a time of real crisis and my dreams were nearly always white dreams. And they were extremely distressing. I took note of them and remember one where I was in a kind of tower made up of a series of ramps. Dead leaves were falling and covering everything. At a particular moment, in an immaculately white alcove, a white skeleton appeared that <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> me. And then instantly everything around me became white." ...|$|E

2500|$|Churubusco {{is home to}} {{the oldest}} {{continually}} held festival in Indiana. Turtle Days is rooted in the lore of Oscar the Turtle or the Beast of Busco, a giant snapping turtle that reportedly haunted nearby Fulk's Lake in Allen County. Many have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the monster turtle but no successful attempt has ever been recorded. He has been thought to be {{the size of a small}} car. The lake he is rumored to hide in has been drained, but no evidence was found. A popular theory as to why this turtle is so elusive is because the lakes and ponds around Churubusco are connected through an extensive series of channels and streams; [...] some of which are underground tunnels. Many locals have claimed to see the beast but until evidence can be found, Oscar will still be a mystery of Churubusco, Indiana.|$|E
2500|$|When the Indian opener Sadagoppan Ramesh <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> a Pakistani player, he was causioned by Javagal Srinath {{not to try}} {{and take}} a catch because Anil Kumble should take all 10 Wickets.

When Kumble was looking to take his tenth wicket in the India-Pakistan test in 1999, Srinath, who was bowling from the other end, was trying to bowl way outside the off stump to avoid taking the final wicket in order for Kumble {{to get to the}} record. Anil Kumble always gives full credit to him for his perfect 10 against Pakistan as Srinath bowled consecutive wide balls in test match to avoid taking wicket".|$|E
2500|$|The Elector of Mainz seemed {{unfazed by}} the {{military}} violence in France, but he eventually realized that the problems in France would spill into the Rhineland, especially when the Louis XVI's brothers and cousins were agitating for their restoration and using Mainz {{as a basis for}} counter-revolutionary action. Eickemeyer was charged with developing a plan for Mainz's defenses. Based on his proposal, the gates were reinstalled and the trenches repaired. [...] In addition, palisades in the outerworks improved Mainz's defensive capabilities. [...] Work proceeded slowly, despite the launching of the campaign by the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Prussia against the French Republic. [...] When news arrived of the capture of Speyer by Custine, work elevated to a frenzy, as local leadership <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up with great zeal on what they had not done in the previous ten weeks, and even ten years.
