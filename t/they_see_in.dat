5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the school}} year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The {{competition}} is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year. The film ends with a freeze-frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.|$|E

25|$|The {{advocates of}} the Tübingen School have intensively {{examined}} the scattered evidence and testimony in the sources in order to reconstruct the principles of Plato's unwritten doctrines. <b>They</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> these teachings the core of Plato's philosophy and have reached a fairly settled picture of their fundamentals, though many important details remain unknown or controversial. A notable feature of the Tübingen paradigm is the contention that the unwritten doctrines are not unrelated to the written doctrines, rather there is a close and logical connection between them.|$|E

He is also disliked for his style of hip hop, which is said to be {{imitation}} of African American Hip Hop. Many Japanese musicians feel that artists similar to Dabo are just mimicking what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> American hip hop and is not unique in any sense.|$|E

25|$|Family {{members who}} {{identify}} {{more with the}} culture of their home country may experience frustration when they attempt to instill their cultural values into younger family members. Popular media, schools, and peers act as powerful socializing agents {{and members of the}} older generation may feel that they cannot compete with these pervasive cultural and social forces. Parents may blame television and magazines for the unwanted change <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> their children and if they decide to act by cracking down on their children's access to popular media, this may lead to further generational schisms.|$|E
25|$|Many {{practitioners}} {{say that}} the scrying medium initially serves to focus attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the mind {{in much the same}} way as repetition of a mantra, concentration on a mandala, inducing the relaxation response, or possibly by hypnosis. Once this stage is achieved, the scryer may begin free association with the perceived images. The technique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images aloud, however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, attempts to deepen the trance state. In this state some scryers hear their own disassociated voices affirming what <b>they</b> <b>see,</b> <b>in</b> a mental feedback loop.|$|E
25|$|Mexican {{handcrafted}} {{toys are}} mostly miniature representations {{of things in}} life, such as birds, furniture, mermaids, bullfighting scenes, carts and much more, made with materials on hand such as bulrush, wood, cloth, clay and lead. They were mostly made for children of the Mexican underclasses. They are considered artistic not because of originality but rather the ingenuity of creating something special from practically nothing. These toys, most of which that survive are from the 19th and early 20th century are increasingly valued by collectors but are in disdain among the general Mexican populace. Since the 1950s, with the influence of movies and television, most children stopped wanting these types of toys for mass products produced abroad and based on what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> media. Most toys sold to tourists now are cheaply made imitations {{of what used to}} be common.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do or say will be good enough or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are feeling so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E
500|$|... "The Monkey Suit" [...] is {{an episode}} that tackles the creation–evolution controversy, and {{according}} to Theresa Sanders in her book Approaching Eden: Adam and Eve in Popular Culture, [...] "skewered antievolution legislation." [...] The authors of the book Chronology of the Evolution-Creationism Controversy commented that the episode [...] "caricatures creationism as an intellectual joke." [...] Burns has cited the episode as [...] "a nice example of The Simpsons really taking one clear side". However, as pointed out by Sanders, it [...] "should {{be pointed out that}} though the Simpsons episode clearly sides with Darwin, evolutionists come in for criticism as well. When Ned and his sons go into the museum's Hall of Man, one of the exhibits <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> support of evolution is a collection of dinosaur bones with the title 'Indisputable Fossil Records.' The cartoon's inclusion of the sign can be interpreted as mocking the pretension that science knows all and may not be questioned." [...] Sanders cited another scene as an example of this; at the trial, Drummond asks Professor Frink if [...] "this theory of evolution necessarily mean that there is no God?", to which he replies, [...] "No, of course not. It just says that God is an impotent nothing from nowhere with less power than the undersecretary of Agriculture." [...] Sanders wrote that [...] "His arrogance is clear, and equally clear is the show's satirical presentation of science's hubris." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in the {{academic}} journal Rhizomes, scholar Martin Hall, while analyzing the movie, discusses the self-perception an individual develops based on the views of those outside of themselves. The academician notes that when a child first comprehends the function of a mirror, they begin to develop the understanding that their perception of themselves is not self-contained, and learn partly they are what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the mirror. He contrasts this to when Anderton discovers the precogs' vision of his future self. At {{the beginning of the}} film, Anderton shows little concern for the precogs; when Witwer feels pity for them, he responds: [...] "It's better if you don't think of them as human." [...] Shortly thereafter, however, Anderton is shown in tears at his home, high on the hard drug neuroin while mourning the loss of his son. Agatha enters a similar period of self-examination when she has visions of her mother's death, and is informed they are merely [...] "echoes" [...] i.e. a faulty image in her memory. Anderton becomes flustered when he begins to interpret the images which show him about to commit murder and begins to frantically sort through, According to Hall he begins [...] "searching for whatever possible versions of this representation are available to him, other than the one that represents him as a murderer." [...] Hall says that he is sorting through the images so feverishly, as he is convinced once they are sorted properly and understood, they will not show him to be the murderer, because he is convinced that he is not a murderer. He literally becomes obsessed with himself, seeking to resolve these images with put him at [...] "discordance with his own reality." [...] Previously, at peace with himself, Hall says Anderton cannot accept the image he sees in the precogs' visions. Unable to reconcile the two, Hall says that he is forced to decide that [...] "it is likely that errors have occurred" [...] in the PreCrime system.|$|E

2500|$|Within Marxist orthodoxy {{there is}} a hostility to what is {{commonly}} called [...] "liberal democracy", which they simply refer to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralised nature.
