40|$|Interdependence and Conduct of International Relations, by Teo Chee Hean Globalization will {{continue}} to be the dominant trend in the 21 st century. Contrary to some expectations, increased interdependence has not reduced the risks of conflicts. It is even tending to encourage ethnie fragmentation and a new form of tribalism. Furthermore the world has not become multipolar. Rather it is characterized by an Americanization that generates uneasiness. However, backtracking is not an option, especially as this phe-nomenon seems to be generally beneficial and will not cause nation states to vanish. We need <b>to</b> <b>pool</b> <b>sovereignties</b> and <b>to</b> use new methods to attack the global problems. The European Union has an important role to play in this respect and can help to establish a stabler world, given its experience of settling conflicts and cooperation. Teo Chee Hean, Neal Mercedes.

3000|$|Due <b>to</b> the <b>pooled</b> <b>sovereignty</b> {{of states}} and common {{constitutional}} traditions of European states, {{the question is not}} which level possesses the final decision-making authority, but rather whether the ruling complies with the law; whether the common legal norms are applied in a correct manner. It is only in the applicative sense that the EU enjoys primacy, and not when it comes to validity. Community law leaves ‘inconsistent national law valid but unapplied’ [36 : 14]. The multilevel legal order in Europe, with national courts and the ECJ (and in some cases also the European Court of Human Rights) sharing jurisdictional power, ensures, in principle, the judicial monitoring of laws, the ability to handle ‘conflicts of law’, and to reach conclusions in hard cases within a time limit. But on what basis? What is the single unifying principle? [...]...|$|R

Defence date: 4 July 2013 This thesis {{examines}} the difficult {{creation of a}} common European research policy {{as part of the}} process of the emergence of the European Community (EC) /European Union (EU) as an increasingly powerful global political and economic actor. It shows that strong discursive continuity and institutional path-dependency, together with the ability of the promoters of the common research policy to adapt their claims to a broader ideational framework, were the key factors that enabled the EC to enlarge its role in a field in which it originally lacked policy competence, and in which states have traditionally been reluctant <b>to</b> <b>pool</b> national <b>sovereignty</b> in supranational institutions. Moreover, the concept of EC/EU research policy, and the concrete steps towards its realisation, would not have been possible without three fundamental ideational and political transformations: the changing relationship between science and the state and the subsequent establishment of national institutions and practices to promote and orient scientific activity the emergence of economic growth as an ubiquitous political objective in all industrialised countries and the increasing conceptualisation of science in economic terms the rapid liberalisation of the world markets, where knowledge soon became regarded as a vital resource for power and money. These three developments were the origins of the crucial change in perception of the European policymakers concerning not only scientific research but also the major goals of European integration...|$|R
40|$|International health {{governance}} as {{it exists}} today is facing major structural challenges in view of globalization, the increased transfer of international health risks and the mounting challenge of health inequalities worldwide. As a consequence the capacity of nation states to ensure population health and to address major health determinants has been weakened. This paper explores health as an exemplary field to illustrate that we have entered {{a new era of}} public policy which is defined by increasing overlaps between domestic and foreign policy, multilateral and bilateral strategies and national and international interest. Cross border spill overs and externalities of national actions need to move into the core of public policy at the national and global level within a new rules based system. A new perspective on global health governance is further necessitated through the increased number of players in the global health arena. The organizational form that is emerging is based on networks and is characterized by shifting alliances and blurred lines of responsibility. The paper explores the emerging paradox of state sovereignty and makes a set of proposals <b>to</b> <b>pool</b> state <b>sovereignty</b> on health and structure the myriad of networks. Particular attention is given {{to the role of the}} World Health Organization within this process of change and adjustment. In using a framework from international relations analysis the paper explores how nation states are socialized into accepting new norms, values and perceptions of interest with regard to national and international health and what challenges emerge for the WHO in "inventing" global health policy.

40|$|On July 15, 2014 the European Parliament {{confirmed}} the new European Commission President. An absolute majority {{was needed for}} this purpose, and the 422 votes “For” cleared the 376 -vote threshold in the legislative body of 751 members. A Grand Coalition has been formed among the three largest political parties: the European People’s Party (EPP), the Progressive Alliances of Socialists Democrats (S&D), and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). Considering policy decisions going forward, the European Union (EU) faces the pressing question: Will there be more, less, or similar power from the EU? There are a greater number voices from {{across the political spectrum}} contributing to the democratic plurality. European leaders may regain trust by acknowledging that future governance will not be “business as usual” as the reform agenda gets underway. 2014 has been an exciting and important year in European politics. “This time is different” was the motto for the European Parliament’s election campaign. This essay analyzes recent EU political trends with the new Commission leadership and the Parliamentary elections results. The Parliamentary elections, held in late May, and the new European Commission, planned to be in place in the autumn, influence the leadership direction of the 28 -member bloc. Additionally, this year on July 1 Croatia celebrated the first anniversary of joining the EU in 2013. Leading the way for candidate countries, Croatia embraces the democratic politics and capitalist market economics embodied by the EU. The greater number of seats held by newer political parties in the European Parliament demonstrates increasing plurality in the EU democracy. The Parliamentary elections have taken place every 5 years since 1979. In this eighth legislative session, the EPP and the S&D remain the largest parties represented, with 221 and 191 seats respectively. As the EU has evolved, a greater number of voices influence politics. The ongoing point of contention on a host of policies is national <b>sovereignty</b> in relation <b>to</b> <b>pooled</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in the EU. The European Parliament is important for democracy in EU governance since it is the direct link from the national citizens to their elected leaders at the supranational level. The representatives of the European Commission are appointed by the national governments of Member States, and their heads of government are the representatives to the European Council. These three political institutions – the European Parliament, the European Commission, and the European Council – together with other important institutions, including the European Court of Justice Luxembourg, form the EU. The new European Commission President is Jean-Claude Juncker, former Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Luxembourg (1995 - 2013). After being nominated by the European Council on June 27, his candidacy was voted on by the European Parliament on July 15, according to the guidelines of the Lisbon Treaty. The leadership for the President of the European Commission has been an important issue, considering Britain’s deliberations on whether or not to stay in the EU {{in the face of a}} future national referendum. Voting on June 27, among the European Council on the nomination of Commission President-Designate Juncker, was 26 in favor and 2 opposed. Only Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary, joined David Cameron, the prime minister of the United Kingdom (UK), with a negative vote (Spiegel and Parker 2014). The UK had not been supportive, being concerned that Juncker embraces the policies of a federalist, prioritizing an ever-closer union above the interests of individual Member States. Historically, since joining the predecessor institution of the European Economic Community in 1973, the UK has had a relatively independent attitude about participation in the EU...|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} shared and <b>pooled</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is the Acts of Union 1707 which created the unitary state {{now known as}} the United Kingdom. It was a full {{economic}} union, meaning the Scottish and English systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade were aligned. Nonetheless, Scotland and England never fully surrendered or pooled all of their governance sovereignty; they retained many of their previous national institutional features and characteristics, particularly relating to their legal, religious and educational systems. In 2012, the Scottish Government, created in 1998 through devolution in the United Kingdom, negotiated terms with the Government of the United Kingdom for the Scottish independence referendum, 2014 which resulted in the people of Scotland deciding <b>to</b> continue the <b>pooling</b> of its <b>sovereignty</b> {{with the rest of the}} United Kingdom.|$|R

40|$|The most {{commonly}} held {{opinion about the}} eurozone crisis is that it should lead to greater EU integration. Yet despite {{all the talk about}} fundamental design flaws and the need for a federal 2 ̆ 018 leap forward 2 ̆ 019, EU governments and citizens are not ready <b>to</b> <b>pool</b> further <b>sovereignty</b> and resources as a way to strengthen the common currency and to improve the EU 2 ̆ 019 s delivering capacity. Blueprints and roadmaps for completing the Economic and Monetary Union have been dealt with contempt by national leaders. As a result, more attention ought to be focused on how the imbalances threatening the EU 2 ̆ 019 s cohesion and stability could be addressed within the existing boundaries of EU treaties. Improving the current set-up of policy coordination should be the priority of the next few years. This policy paper suggests ways to improve the institutions and scope of policy coordination in the EU. In terms of substance, the experience accumulated before and after the crisis has shown that a narrow approach in terms of fiscal and macroeconomic discipline is not enough. If EU member states do not want markets to impose adjustments in their own terms, they must embrace a broader approach to convergence and improve the conditions in which they adjust to each other. Wage and social developments should be included in EU supervision frameworks. As regards institutions, more reflection should be devoted to the innovations that would increase the impact of mutual commitments. This paper analyses the increasing contractual approach to EU governance, and argues that a stronger sense of reciprocity could arise from ad hoc cooperations on a smaller scale for the euro area and voluntary countries. One should nevertheless be clear about the limits of what coordination can achieve. Greater ambition in terms of EU cohesion and democratic legitimacy would require a more substantial rethink of EU policy-making in the long term...|$|R
40|$|In {{just half}} a century of existence, the European Union has {{achieved}} remarkable things: it has delivered peace for its members and prosperity for its citizens, it has created a single European currency (Euro) and a single market without frontiers where people, goods, services and capital move around freely. The EU has grown from six to twenty-five countries and it is preparing to embrace other two. The EU is not a federation. Its members remain independent sovereign nations but they <b>pool</b> their <b>sovereignty</b> in order to gain a strength and world influence that none of them could have on its own. <b>Pooling</b> <b>sovereignty</b> means, in practice, that the member states delegate some of their decision-making powers to European Institutions they have created, so that decisions on specific matters of joint interest could be made democratically at the European level. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} half century, the European Parliament has {{undergone}} a remarkable transformation from an assembly endowed with supervisory powers to a directly-elected legislator, co-deciding most secondary legislation on equal footing with the Council. Furthermore, while human rights were not institutionalized in the founding Treaties, the European Court of Justice began to make references to fundamental rights in its jurisprudence since the late sixties, and the recent past has seen the codification of fundamental rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Under what conditions have the parliamentarization and the institutionalization of human rights at the EU level progressed? We explain the constitutionalization of the EU – parliamentarization and the institutionalization of human rights – as strategic action in a community environment. According to this approach, community actors use the liberal democratic identity, values and norms that constitute the EU’s ethos strategically to put social and moral pressure on those community members that oppose the constitutionalization of the EU. We find that salience {{has been the most}} relevant condition for triggering incremental constitutionalization: The more a proposed or implemented decision by the member states <b>to</b> <b>pool</b> or delegate <b>sovereignty</b> is perceived to curb the competencies of national parliaments and to undermine national or other international human rights provisions, the more salient the “legitimacy deficit” of European integration becomes. This state of affairs, in turn, generates normative pressure on EU actors to redress the situation through strengthening the powers of the EP and human rights provisions at the EU level. polity building; European Parliament; fundamental/human rights; legitimacy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the choice of {{centralization}} of public policy in an economy with two government levels. It argues that centralization by subsidiarity principle stresses a conflicting interest between different jurisdictions instead of working it out. The extent of the conflict of interest is affected by spillovers and differences in public spending tastes. Spending decisions are made by negotiation in the centralized legislature of local representatives, unless they fail to reach an agreement. In the latter case, policy is provided non-cooperatively by local governments. Results show that <b>pooling</b> <b>sovereignty</b> by subsidiarity principle fails to fully internalize spillovers and may produce misallocation of public resources.

40|$|Abstract Delegating {{sovereignty}} {{to international}} organizations (IOs) is both increasingly common and controversial. I address {{the sources of}} current controversies in three claims. First, although alleged otherwise, sovereignty is eminently divisible. From practice, indivisibility {{should not be a}} barrier to delegating to IOs. Second, it is intuitive that longer chains of delegation {{will be more likely to}} fail. Yet, it is not the length of the chain per se that matters as whether identifiable conditions for successful delegation are satisfied. Third, although “delegation ” is often used to refer to both, delegating and <b>pooling</b> <b>sovereignty</b> are distinct activities. Much of the concern with IOs is really about pooling rather than delegating sovereignty...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s the European Union has {{introduced}} a number of policy coordination processes that abstain from delegating or <b>pooling</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> Instead the EU relies on soft law that does not legally bind governments {{in the same way}} as the Community Method used to. The literature assumes that soft law is chosen to achieve common objectives given considerable diversity among the Member States. In contrast, this paper suggests that non-binding coordination is first and foremost a means to foster compromises in the absence of substantial agreements. Three case studies demonstrate that international organisations have repeatedly relied on soft law to overcome disagreements among their members. The IMF, the OECD, and the EU introduced soft coordination at times of institutional crisis to prevent a breakdown of negotiations...|$|R
