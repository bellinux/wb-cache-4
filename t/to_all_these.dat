5|$|There {{are four}} states which are common <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> yogas, states the text, and these four stages of {{attainment}} are: Arambha (beginning, {{the stage of}} practicing ethics such as non-violence and proper diet, followed by asana), Ghata (second integration stage to learn breath regulation and relationship between body and mind), Parichaya (the third intimacy stage to hold, regulate air flow, followed by meditation for relationship between mind and Atman), and Nishpatti (fourth stage to consummate Samadhi and realize Atman). The emphasis and most verses in the text are dedicated to Hatha Yoga, although the text mentions Raja yoga {{is the culmination of}} Yoga.|$|E
5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E
5|$|Among all predators, ants are the {{greatest}} enemy to termites. Some ant genera are specialist predators of termites. For example, Megaponera is a strictly termite-eating (termitophagous) genus that perform raiding activities, some lasting several hours. Paltothyreus tarsatus is another termite-raiding species, with each individual stacking as many termites as possible in its mandibles before returning home, all the while recruiting additional nestmates to the raiding site through chemical trails. The Malaysian basicerotine ants Eurhopalothrix heliscata uses a different strategy of termite hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces, as they hunt through rotting wood housing termite colonies. Once inside, the ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles. Tetramorium uelense is a specialised predator species that feeds on small termites. A scout recruits 10–30 workers to an area where termites are present, killing them by immobilising them with their stinger. Centromyrmex and Iridomyrmex colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are preyed on by these ants. No evidence {{for any kind of}} relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Other ants, including Acanthostichus, Camponotus, Crematogaster, Cylindromyrmex, Leptogenys, Odontomachus, Ophthalmopone, Pachycondyla, Rhytidoponera, Solenopsis and Wasmannia, also prey on termites. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> ant species, and despite their enormous diversity of prey, Dorylus ants rarely consume termites.|$|E

25|$|The wendigo {{is part of}} the {{traditional}} belief system of a number of Algonquin-speaking peoples, including the Ojibwe, the Saulteaux, the Cree, the Naskapi, and the Innu people.

They were strongly associated with the winter, the north, and coldness, as well as with famine and starvation.|$|E

If the lung or lungs are approved, then the recipient is connected to an IV line and various monitoring equipment, including pulse oximetry.

25|$|All elapids have {{a pair of}} proteroglyphous fangs used {{to inject}} venom from glands located towards {{the rear of the}} upper jaws. In outward appearance, {{terrestrial}} elapids look similar to the Colubridae: almost all have long and slender bodies with smooth scales, a head covered with large shields and not always distinct from the neck, and eyes with round pupils. In addition, their behavior is usually quite active, and most are oviparous. Exceptions <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> generalizations occur: e.g. the death adders (Acanthophis) include short and fat, rough-scaled, very broad-headed, cat-eyed, live-bearing, sluggish ambush predators with partly fragmented head shields.|$|E

25|$|King Vajiravudh was a {{favor of}} literature, theater, he {{translated}} many foreign literatures into Thai.

He was based on the unity of nation, Buddhism, and kingship, and demanded loyalty from his subjects <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> three institutions. King Vajiravudh also took refuge in an irrational and contradictory anti-Sinicism. As a result of the mass immigration, in contrast to previous immigration waves from China, women and entire families had also come into the country, which meant that the Chinese were less assimilated and retained their cultural independence. In an article published by King Vajiravudh under a pseudonym, he described the Chinese minority as Jews of the East.|$|E

Enter where entry is banned and face the consequences, Take blows without giving them. If a fence is raised in your path , don't turn back, jump over it.

Go to the place where free food is served in the temple; and sit along with others. Let the Government be informed of what you intend to do. One should not fight shy of laying down one's life. Those who think another's touch pollutes him should not be left unmolested in their so called cleanliness. That is my view…. Give publicity <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> in the papers.
