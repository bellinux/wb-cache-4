500|$|Seventy-one {{years of}} age and {{becoming}} increasingly deaf, Cooper announced to the Kentucky Press Association on January 21, 1972, that he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, having served longer in that body than any other Kentuckian except Alben Barkley. The lame duck Cooper decided to make one more attempt to end the war, after an aggressive North Vietnamese offensive against the South in March 1972 intensified fighting in the region once again. Without advance notice, Cooper addressed a nearly empty Senate chamber on July 27, 1972, proposing an amendment to a military assistance bill that would unconditionally end funding for all U.S. military operations in Indochina in four months. The measure, which had no co-sponsors, stunned Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and provoked heated debate in the Senate. Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke saved the amendment from almost certain demise by adding a provision that all American prisoners of war be returned prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The revised amendment passed 62–33, whereupon Nixon decided to sacrifice the entire military assistance bill. At Nixon's insistence, the Senate defeated the amended bill 48–42. Disappointed, Cooper nevertheless proclaimed, [...] "I feel purged inside. I've felt strongly about <b>this</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. Now it's {{in the hands of the}} President. He's the only person who can do anything about ending the war now." ...|$|E

He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of Reindeer Games." [...] He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama Boiler Room (2000). A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck had [...] "traced over" [...] Alec Baldwin's performance in Glengarry Glen Ross, while Peter Rainer of New York Magazine said he [...] "does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next".

Nick soon finds out, but their daughter Faith is kidnapped at birth by Nick's brother, Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), and given to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). Sharon, believing Faith has died, seduces a guilty Adam. Faith is eventually reunited with her parents, and Adam's crimes are revealed.

500|$|In 1995, Lofton {{was one of}} six Indians' {{starters}} who batted [...]300 {{or higher}} (.310). He also had an MLB-best 13 triples. His 54 stolen bases led the AL {{for the third consecutive}} season. The Indians faced the Seattle Mariners in the 1995 ALCS. In the eighth inning of Game Six, Lofton had an infield bunt, stole second base, and scored from second on a passed ball between pitcher Randy Johnson and catcher Dan Wilson. The Indians won the game 40. It was described by The New York Times as [...] "the run that demoralized the Mariners." [...] Fifteen years after Lofton's crossing of home plate, the Plain Dealer recalled: [...] "Of all the electrifying moments on the Kenny Lofton highlight reel, none captures the essence of the player any better than his 180-foot dash to glory on October 17, 1995." [...] As a result of winning the game, the Indians had won the ALCS and in so doing, Lofton and the Indians had brought the AL pennant to Cleveland {{for the first time since}} the 1954 season. [...] "I'm glad for the city of Cleveland to be able to experience this, because they haven't experience <b>this</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time.

The Indians lost the World Series to the Braves in six games despite finishing the regular season with a major league-best 10044 record in the strike-shortened year. Lofton finished with a [...]200 batting average and six stolen bases in his first World Series appearance. In 2010, a few years into his retirement, Lofton stated he felt it was the toughest post-season loss of his 11 career playoff appearances, namely because he felt the umpires had favorable strike zones for Braves pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.|$|E
