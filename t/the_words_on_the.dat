5000|$|Lacey's {{first major}} book, <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Street, was {{originally}} published in 2003 as <b>The</b> Street Bible. <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Street {{is described as a}} [...] "dangerously real retelling of Scripture," [...] condensing the story of the Bible in less than 500 pages, paraphrasing the text in a distinctive, urban style inspired by Lacey's performances. Major biblical stories are recast as mini-blockbusters; individual psalms are rewritten as song lyrics; the Pauline epistles become emails to the fledgling [...] "Jesus Liberation Movement" [...] (aka <b>the</b> church). <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Street is published by Zondervan.|$|R
25|$|A {{teleprompter}} is {{a display}} device that prompts the person speaking {{with an electronic}} visual text of a speech or script.

The teleprompter was invented in 1950 by Hubert Schlafly, who was working at 20th Century Fox film studios in Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Knowing her {{background}} in anthropology and various Native American organizations, {{it is not}} surprising that the most prevalent image in her poetry are bones. In her poetry, the image of battered bone is the direct link to native American sense of self. The bones of dead Indians almost form <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> page and are the spine holding together each of her volumes of poetry. Stemming from her work with anthropology, she writes about bones auctioned, objects sold, and bodies stuffed for our edification in a museum display. Those dead Indians both form the phantoms that haunt her poetry and at the same time are given new life and the chance to speak out in her poetry.|$|E
500|$|To further {{explore the}} {{possibilities}} of the studio setting, Eno and his friend Peter Schmidt developed instruction cards, called Oblique Strategies.

Describing <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album {{as an expression of}} [...] "idiot glee", Eno and Schmidt eventually expanded the Oblique Strategies set to over 100 [...] "worthwhile dilemmas", which would be used in nearly all his future recordings and productions. Schmidt also designed the album cover, which consists of four prints from an edition of fifteen hundred of his unique lithographs, as well as Polaroids of Eno, credited on the album sleeve to Lorenz Zatecky.|$|E

The words were often written in late-night eight- to ten-hour-long sessions before the pair were due to record the vocals. The pair worked diligently to ensure the lyrics were not lackluster, even though few changes actually resulted; Shields said, [...] "There's nothing worse than bad lyrics."

500|$|Based on {{observations}} of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod {{claim that the}} stela refers to a celebration {{in which a person}} portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site. They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as [...] "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" [...] and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century. Mayanist scholar Stephen Houston contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Cobain told Spin that on Bleach he [...] "didn't give {{a flying}} fuck what the lyrics were about" [...] {{and claimed that}} 80 percent of the lyrics were written the night before {{recording}}. He was often still working on <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drive to the recording studio. He explained: [...] "It was like I'm pissed off. Don't know what about. Let's just scream negative lyrics, {{and as long as}} they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay. I don't hold any of those lyrics dear to me." [...] Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad noted that, nevertheless, many of the songs on the album reflected Cobain and various incidents in his life. [...] "Mr. Moustache" [...] was inspired by Cobain's dislike of macho behavior, while [...] "School" [...] was a critique of the Seattle music scene, particularly Sub Pop.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} {{music of the}} song {{published}} online by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] {{is set in the}} time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 127 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor with Madonna's vocals ranging from Gm to Dm. The song follows a sequence of Gm–Cm–E during the opening prayer verse and Am–Em–G–F for the rest as its chord progression. Mike Senior from Sound on Sound magazine found that along with the predominant synth sounds, there was [...] "a lot" [...] of double tracking present in the song which made the vocals unclear. He felt that this was not pose a problem in stereo sound, but with mono sounds the combined vocals appeared double tracked while the vocal level decreased. The mixing for [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] was done mainly for stereo speakers and around the 1:45–2:00 mark, the vocal levels fluctuate with the backing music being dwarfed. Senior also observed that Madonna put the stresses of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beats of the song, hence some of the enunciation are lost with the drum sounds, especially on the title hook.|$|E

2500|$|Music for {{the film}} was written by Hans Werner Henze who picked up the visual {{principle}} of multiple fixed camera shots by adopting a musical style which mirrored the fragmentation of the film structure.
