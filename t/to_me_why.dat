5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>why.</b> It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
2500|$|The Secrisy of this Mutiny {{is beyond}} all {{conception}} so that I can not discover that any who are with me had the least knowledge of it. It is unbeknown <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> I must beguile such force. Even Mr. Tom Ellison took such a liking to Otaheite [...] {{that he also}} turned Pirate, so that I have been run down by my own Dogs...|$|E

We're not a deliberate copycat of Hell in any way though. They were a great band and it's a mystery <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> they never got anywhere. To be compared to them we don't mind in the least, we would take it more as an honour than anything. We've just done a charity show at Trent Poly dedicated to Hell's guitarist Dave Halliday who committed suicide in January. All the money went to his favourite charity, Cancer Research." ...|$|E

2500|$|Irving {{nonetheless}} {{worked the}} secret material into his book, writing an entire chapter about Enigma {{in the first}} draft of The Mare's Nest. When it {{came to the attention of}} the authorities, [...] "one night I was visited at my flat by men in belted raincoats who came and physically seized the chapter. I was summoned to the Cabinet Office, twelve men sitting around a polished table, where it was explained <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> [...] was not being released and we appeal to you as an English gentleman not to release [...]" [...] Irving cooperated and withdrew the chapter, but by this time he had copied enough material from Cherwell's archive to furnish several more books. ULTRA remained secret for another decade.|$|E
2500|$|The Israeli Forum for the Promotion of Equal Share in the Burden {{threatened}} {{to boycott the}} fashion chain Fox if they hired Refaeli. The two sides reached a compromise in which Refaeli agreed to visit injured IDF soldiers whenever she is in Israel, and actively encourage enlistment in the army. Refaeli later said, [...] "I don't regret not enlisting, because it paid off big time. That's {{just the way it}} is: celebrities have other needs. I hope my case has influenced the army." [...] She also said: [...] "Israel or Uganda, what difference does it make? It makes no difference <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Why</b> is it good to die for our country? What, isn't it better to live in New York? Why should 18-year-old kids have to die? It's dumb that people have to die so that I can live in Israel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in the Genesis narrative demonstrate that adultery was understood to be a natural phenomenon. [...] These occur in the times of the Patriarchs over a span of about 200 years, the last one occurring more than 400 years before the giving of the law through Moses. In Genesis 12, Abram’s wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh’s palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts “serious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.” Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram’s wife and tells him, [...] "What is this you have done <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> <b>Why</b> did you not tell {{me that she was}} your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go." ...|$|E

2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll forget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do you say this <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> <b>Why</b> do you keep saying these things to me every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E
