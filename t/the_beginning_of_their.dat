Beginning with the 2010 awards, the rolling eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with the current rules.|$|E

5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> calendar {{as the end}} of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form.

There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E
5|$|Defoe {{was finally}} imprisoned on 21 May 1703, after {{avoiding}} his summons and evading capture. He was fined, made {{to stand in}} the pillory on three occasions and remained in prison till November; in the meantime, his business affairs sank into ruin.

Amongst the series of explanatory pamphlets doing this are An Explanation of a Late Pamphlet, Entituled, The Shortest Way… (1703) and A Dialogue Between a Dissenter and the Observator (1703).

5|$|The Portuguese {{sought to}} expand {{the power of the}} priests, as from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> empire, priests had {{accompanied}} Portuguese delegations on diplomatic missions and on occasion were the principal negotiatiors. Treaties they signed with the Keladi Nayakas progressively incorporated clauses which increased the authority of the priests over the local Catholic population, making them obedient to the priests in matters of Christian laws as well as granting priests the authority to punish violations. The Portuguese promised to refrain from slaughtering cows and to halt forcible conversions in their factories. The terms of these treaties were not always honoured by the Portuguese, with the result that whenever hostilities broke out between the Keladis and the Portuguese, the Catholic settlers were often harassed or arrested by the Nayakas.|$|E
