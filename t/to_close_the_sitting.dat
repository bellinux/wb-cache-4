The 9th of October, Marguerite Monvoisin confirmed that the black masses had included child sacrifice, and on 10 October, it was confirmed by Étienne Guibourg. In November, Montespan was further implicated when her chamber lady, Claude de Vin des Œillets, was identified by the prisoners.|$|R

At this point the lifter should be in a full squat position, with his buttocks on or very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heels, <b>sitting</b> erect with <b>the</b> bar resting comfortably across the deltoids and fingers. By keeping a rigid torso and maintaining a deep breath hold the bar bends over the lifter's clavicle.|$|R
5000|$|A confidante (also {{known as}} a canapé à joue, a canapé à confidants, or a canapé à confidant(e)) {{is a type of}} sofa, {{originally}} characterized by a triangular seat at each end, so that people could sit {{at either end of the}} sofa and be <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> person(s) <b>sitting</b> in <b>the</b> middle. The ends were sometimes detachable, and could be removed and used on their own as Burjair chairs. The name Confidante was coined by cabinetmaker George Hepplewhite, who described it in his Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Guide as being [...] "of French origin, and is in pretty general request for large and spacious suits of apartments. An elegant drawing-room, with modern furniture, is scarce complete without a Confidante, &#91;&hellip;&#93;".|$|R

There are also two girls standing on the right and probably a woman, the face partly covered with white paint. Behind them a wooden fence and a hut, the roof made of sticks and grass. To the left another small building made of wooden sticks, probably a small barn for the animals. Except the man standing and the two girls all are covered with blankets and were cloths wrapped around their head. Imprinted on the image: "Heidnische Kaffernfamilie. S. -Afrika West. No. 642.

6000|$|In all {{the loveliest}} {{representations}} in central Greek {{art of the}} birth of Athena, Apollo stands <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> Jupiter, singing, with a deep, quiet joyfulness, to his lyre. The sun is always thought of as the master of time and rhythm, and as the origin of the composing and inventive discovery of melody; but the air, as the actual element and substance of the voice, the prolonging and sustaining power of it, and the symbol of its moral passion. Whatever in music is measured and designed belongs therefore to Apollo and the Muses; whatever is impulsive and passionate, to Athena; hence her constant strength a voice or cry (as when she aids the shout of Achilles) curiously opposed to the dumbness of Demeter. The Apolline lyre, therefore, {{is not so much the}} instrument producing sound, as its measurer and divider by length or tension of string into given notes; and I believe it is, in a double connection with its office as a measurer of time or motion and its relation to the transit of the sun in the sky, that Hermes forms it from the tortoise-shell, which is the image of the dappled concave of the cloudy sky. Thenceforward all the limiting or restraining modes of music belong to the Muses; but the more passionate music is wind music, as in the Doric flute. Then, when this inspired music becomes degraded in its passion, it sinks into the pipe of Pan, and the double pipe of Marsyas, and is then rejected by Athena. The myth which represents her doing so is that she invented the double pipe from hearing the hiss of the Gorgonian serpents; but when she played upon it, chancing to see her face reflected in water, she saw that it was distorted, whereupon she threw down the flute which Marsyas found. Then, the strife of Apollo and Marsyas represents the enduring contest between music in which the words and thought lead, and the lyre measures or melodizes them (which Pindar means when he calls his hymns [...] "kings over the lyre"), and music in which the words are lost and the wind or impulse leads,--generally, therefore, between intellectual, and brutal, or meaningless, music. Therefore, when Apollo prevails, he flays Marsyas, taking the limit and external bond of his shape from him, which is death, without touching the mere muscular strength, yet shameful and dreadful in dissolution.|$|R
