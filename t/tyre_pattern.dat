Multivariate experimentation techniques were used involving five variables: slip angle, camber, vertical load, <b>tyre</b> <b>pattern</b> and land or furrow operation.

40|$|After the {{implementation}} of the AASHTO Road Test many researches have been carried out regarding material and pavement performance, both in laboratory and in situ. Many methods for pavement evaluation and design were obtained based on empirical or empirical-mechanistic approaches. Nowadays these methods are used in pavement analysis and design supported by a set of shift factors which consider the variables not included in their definition. At the present time, the development of economical electronic sensors has made possible a successful full-scale instrumentation of pavements. This paper focuses on the problems and solutions related to instrumentation and its integration in the research of pavements in situ to collect relevant data for pavement modelling. The instrumentation includes monitoring environmental conditions (rainfall, air temperature, solar radiation, UV radiation and wind), pavement state (temperature, moisture and groundwater level), pavement response (displacement, tensile and compression strains, shear effects, deformations and pressures) and vehicle characteristics (classification, axle configuration, tyre types and pressures, speed, weight by axle at high speed and the driving transversal shift, i. e. the wheel distance from the pavement border). The definition of the instrumentation for pavement response was based on conventional pavement analysis using numerical modelling in which the sensors position was chosen to ensure reliable measurements. The external parameters evaluation, such as the vehicle classification, where the contact area and the <b>tyre</b> <b>pattern</b> are included, was considered by sample-collection...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that wheels are {{responsible}} for a significant amount of the total aerodynamic drag of passenger vehicles. Tyres, and mostly rims, {{have been the subject of}} research in the automotive industry for the past years, but their effect and interaction with each other and with the car exterior is still not completely understood. This paper focuses on the use of CFD to study the effects of tyre geometry (tyre profile and tyre tread) on road vehicle aerodynamics. Whenever possible, results of the numerical computations are compared with experiments. More than sixty configurations were simulated. These simulations combined different tyre profiles, treads, rim designs and spoke orientation on two car types: a sedan and a sports wagon. Two tyre geometries were obtained directly from the tyre manufacturer, while a third geometry was obtained from our database and represents a generic tyre which covers different profiles of a given tyre size. All geometries were deformed based on measured wind tunnel data under a defined load and rotating conditions of 100 kph. Results have shown that the main grooves consistently lead to a decrease of both drag and lift. The edge pattern however, did not show a clear trend for drag and lift with respect to the different configurations studied, although its influence was always more noticeable on the sports wagon. The larger profile of the generic tyre resulted in higher drag and lift values with relation to the tyres obtained from the manufacturer. For a given rim, a drag difference was observed between two tyre geometries with same profile but different tyre tread. These findings lead to the conclusion that tyre profile, as well as <b>tyre</b> <b>pattern,</b> are important to consider. These results were confirmed by wind tunnel tests. In conclusion, the work of aerodynamic optimization of rims cannot be separated from the tyre itself...|$|E
40|$|The regular <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> {{design process}} is often based upon {{experience}} and experimental evaluations and may take about 2 years. The use of engineering tooling could improve and speed up this process. The research objective is therefore to develop experimental and simulation tooling by which interior <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> noise can be predicted, analysed and optimized. The physics of tyre-road noise is {{explained in a}} comprehensive manner as {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics is needed to evaluate, measure, analyse or optimize tyres with respect to noise. The first engineering tool developed is an instrumented vehicle with dedicated measurement and processing technologies, enabling quantification of the terminology used in subjective evaluations of tyre-road noise. The three most important <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> noise characteristics are: level, tonalness and modulation/drumming. They can be quantified, respectively, by the Sound Pressure Level, the so-called order spectrum and the (bandpass filtered) sound pressure variation during one tyre revolution. While rolling on smooth roads, the <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> geometry in the tyre-road contact is considered to be the main origin of contact pressure variations, resulting in vibrations and noise. The second engineering tool is a simulation procedure of this source. In the new source modelling approach, the averaged tread pattern height in contact is calculated. The model predicts (R 2 = 0. 76) the correct trends of the three <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> noise characteristics, by using the trend of their geometrical cause. The model can be used to reduce exterior as well as interior <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> noise. From these <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> noise characteristics dedicated Sound Quality Metrics are defined: for level the Standard Deviation (STD), for tonalness the Order Prominence (OP) and for modulation the Multi-Order Modulation (MOM). They correspond very well (respectively R 2 = 0. 96, 0. 60 and 0. 80) with the human perception of the noise characteristics. An increase in each of the metrics results in a worse subjective perception of the <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> noise. The metrics are applicable for measured and simulated sounds. In the third engineering tool the three metrics are combined to model the human percpetion of tyre tread patternn noise. The human perception model is obtained through a linear regression of these tyre related Sound Quality Metrics on the subjective rating of simulated sounds. The output of the model is called the Sound Quality Preference Index (SQPI) predicting the human perception of <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> sounds correctly (R 2 = 0. 94). The coupled source - human perception model can be used to speed up and improve the current tyre tread patter design process...|$|R

Smooth road surfaces in the database highlight contributions in the low and medium frequency domain not related to the enveloped road texture and suggest to also considering the <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> for the <b>tyre</b> belt radiated noise level prediction. Due to the essentially different road and tyre tread roughnesses, 2 D profiles are no longer suitable and therefore a 3 D envelopment procedure is proposed to account for a combined road and tyre roughness.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> design for optimum wet grip performance. A mathematical model of tyre behaviour on wet roads has been developed. This utilizes the finite element method in the representation of tread pattern geometry. The performance of a particular tread pattern is found {{in terms of the}} fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing within the contact patch, under wet conditions. Many modern tread patterns are based on 'blocks', and a computer model has been developed specifically to assist the tyre designer in the design of these blocks for improved wet grip. Numerical results are presented both for complete contact patches and for individual tread blocks. To allow the use of the computer models by the tyre designer, with no specialist knowledge of the finite element method, special purpose mesh generation and plotting programs have been developed. Experiments have been undertaken whereby the fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing in the tyre contact patch have been measured under high speed conditions in the wet. These measure- ments were made on an indoor testing machine, and the techniques developed can be used in the routine evaluation of tyre wet grip performance. Some results of experiments performed on plain and simple <b>patterned</b> <b>tyres</b> are presented. The main purpose of this work was the development of the mathematical models which can be used for future research into, and design of, tyres for improved wet grip.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Sound and Vibration [¬© Elsevier Ltd. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] noise which results from the interaction of pneumatic tyres with a rough road surface is a significant contributor to an increasing local environmental problem. Above a steady forward vehicle speed of 40 km/h this is the dominant noise source of a modern car in good working condition, and is a significant contributor to the overall radiated noise during acceleration. In order to determine the noise produced by a <b>patterned</b> <b>tyre</b> rolling on a rough road surface, the vibration characteristics of the tyre must be known. A method has been presented by O'Boy and Dowling [Tyre/road interaction noise: a 3 d viscoelastic multilayer model of a tyre belt, Journal of Sound and Vibration, volume 322, issues 4 - 5, 22 May 2009, pages 829 - 850] which provides these vibration characteristics for a tyre belt composed of multiple viscoclastic layers, each layer having a different thickness and material properties. In this paper, we use this model of the tyre belt to determine the parameters of an equivalent simple bending plate model which can be adapted to yield the response of a tyre which includes sidewalls. A method is then described which uses this response to determine the acceleration of the tyre surface as it rolls over a rough road. These accelerations are then used to predict the far-field radiated noise for a <b>patterned</b> <b>tyre</b> on two rough road surfaces. Comparisons with experimental data are provided at each stage.

40|$|Owing to the {{significant}} changes in tyre geometry especially for truck <b>tyres</b> withcomplex <b>patterns</b> and high thickness at tread area, the effect of heat transfer incircumferential direction on temperature field development during tyre curing {{should be taken into}} account. This work is based on the development of a three dimen-sional nonlinear finite element model for simulating of tyre curing process of in mould. The heat conduction equation was solved by the use of a standard Galerkin technique in a Cartesian coordinate system. Transient temperature field was modelled using the implicit-Œ∏ method. The Kamal and Sourour empirical cure reaction kinetic equation was also used to calculate the state and rate of cure as a functions of time. Based on the developed model, an interactive computer program was written in Visual Basic. This pro-gram was used to simulate the curing process of a 12 - 24 truck tyre in mould. Results of our simulations showed that distributions of both temperature and state of cure in circum ferential direction cannot be ignored. The applicability of the model was also verified by comparison between the temperature profiles at two points inside the tyre with experi-mental data. It has been shown that there is a very good agreement between the model predictions and actual data. finite element method...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Tyre</b> tread <b>pattern</b> is the {{arrangement}} of blocks, grooves and voids, sipes and channels designed into the tread to enhance its grip on the road. Tread is the uppermost part of any tyre which contact into the road and {{it has its own}} performance towards mileage, traction, low noise and heat built up properties. It would be meaningful to conduct an extended analysis on the tyre tread blocks for its performance in static and dynamic condition to predict its behavior and wear of tread block in on-road condition. The Finite Element software Abaqus is used for the present analysis of the tread block and its behavior was studied on two different contact surfaces. The tread block is modeled in six different shapes and analyzed for is performance. The deformation stress strain characteristic of different blocks is studied which will be useful in deciding the contact behavior, friction and road grip. The regular shape/geometry has common behavior and the mixed type geometry shows a distinguished variation in the analysis. The dynamic stiffness and deformed shape was analyzed in this study and it has its own effect in tyre design. The tread block dynamics study by geometric shape would be vital in tread pattern optimization to enhance the traction, better hydroplaning and rolling resistance under all operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Traffic noise {{has become}} an {{important}} issue for mental health. Tyre/road noise, caused by the interaction between tyre and road surface, is a significant contributor to road traffic noise. Current tyre regulation aims at noise abatement. In order to predict tyre/road noise accurately, advanced numerical models are needed. Most current tyre/road noise models, however, are not accurate enough to predict tyre/road noise based on physical models. Hence, a new method has to be proposed. A numerical tyre/road noise model has been built based on physics. It consists of a structural vibration model using finite elements and a sound radiation model using boundary elements; both models are coupled by the tyre vibrations. The numerical model, which takes into account structural mechanisms only, has been validated for a slick tyre rolling on various road surfaces at different speeds. For the experimental validation, a device has been developed by which tyre/road noise can be measured on a moving car. The simulation results are {{in accordance with the}} measurement results in a sense that they show the same trends. The numerical model can be used to develop more silent tyres and roads.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis is directed towards the reduction of tyre/road interface noise and embodies {{a study of the}} factors involved in its generation. These factors comprise: (a) materials and construction of tyres and road surfaces (b) the spectral distribution of the noise. The importance of this work has become greater with reduction in engine noise. A review of the literature shows what has been achieved so far, and stresses the importance of maintaining other desirable tyre properties such as adhesion in wet conditions. The work has involved an analysis of mechanical factors in tyre construction and the behaviour of road surfaces. Measurements on noise have been carried out under practical conditions and also on replica surfaces in the laboratory, and in addition tests of wet road adhesion have been carried out with a variety of road surfaces. Consideration has been given to the psychological effects of the spectral distribution of noise. A major part of the work under-taken has been the development of a computer program, the results of which have made it possible to design a <b>tyre</b> tread block <b>pattern</b> to give an optimum spectral distribution.

For that purpose, tyre/road noise was measured for a passenger car fitted with four identical <b>patterned</b> <b>tyres</b> rolling {{on a set of}} 15 impervious road surfaces. The CPX and CB measurement methods have been used simultaneously on each road surface at vehicle speeds ranging between 50 km/h and 110 km/h. A very good correlation between overall CPX and CB noise levels recomposed between 400 Hz and 4000 Hz was observed which is consistent with previous results of the literature. With the whole set of road surfaces and frequencies, a fairly good correlation between the CPX and CB spectral noise levels was also observed. Taking each road surface individually, an excellent spectral correlation was observed, leading to a very accurate estimation of the overall CB noise levels from the CPX noise levels. Considering each one-third octave band frequency, the correlations between CPX and CB spectral noise levels were also good and enable to estimate the overall CB noise levels with the same accuracy as when using the correlation between the overall CPX and CB noise levels. As a perspective, the results could help to compare different tyre/road noise prediction models which have been calibrated or validated with different testing method (pass-by or close-proximity) ...|$|R
40|$|High {{frequency}} (above 1 kHz) {{noise generation}} from the tyre/road interaction {{is still not}} fully understood and accurately modelled. Two noise generation mechanisms previously suggested in the literature are reviewed: air pumping and noise generation cased by adhesive effects between the tyre tread and road surface. These mechanisms are located in and near the tyre/road contact zone, and a deterministic description of these mechanisms requires a tyre model that is able to describe the high frequency behaviour of the tyre, including local deformation in both the radial and tangential directions. A three-dimensional two-layer plate tyre model based on the elastic field equations is suggested as a model that would fulfil these requirements. This model was developed earlier [1], and is now extended to allow for comparison to mobility measurements on real tyres. The overall agreement between the model and measurements is surprisingly good {{in view of the}} simplicity of the model. However, some limitations of the model are also presented. The tyre model is used in two investigations focusing on the dynamic behaviour of tyres in both the radial and tangential directions in the frequency range from 50 Hz to 4 kHz; (i) investigation of the dynamic behaviour of smooth and <b>patterned</b> <b>tyres</b> at high frequencies for both radial and tangential directions, and (ii) a parameter study investigating the relation between internal tyre parameters and the response at the outermost surface. It was found that the radial point mobility is greatly influenced by properties of the local deformation at high frequencies and/or small excitation areas. The tangential point mobility is affected by local deformation in almost the whole frequency range. Hence, it is mainly the properties of the tread cap and the pattern that determine the response at high frequencies and in the tangential direction. The radial response is determined by the combined properties of the belt and the tread cap at medium frequencies, while it is the dimension and the pre-tension in the plies that determines the low frequency response...|$|R

The test vehicle was a passenger car fitted with <b>patterned</b> <b>tyres.</b> Several runs were performed at steady speed from 40 km/h up to 110 km/h, leading to the estimation of CPX and CB noise levels and spectra at different reference speeds. The 3 D texture of the road surfaces was evaluated with a newly developed device involving a 2 D laser sensor. The texture sample size was about 0. 35 m by 1. 5 m with a sampling interval of 0. 1 mm. A specific protocol was used to record four aligned texture samples with overlapping zones, leading to a final complete surface of about 6 m by 0. 35 m. Texture data were processed to get the height probability densities, the mean texture depth as well as the raw and the enveloped longitudinal texture spectra. Sound absorption was also measured following ISO 13472 - 1 leading to absorption peaks around 1000 Hz for the VTAC 0 / 4 and around 800 Hz for the VTAC 0 / 6.
