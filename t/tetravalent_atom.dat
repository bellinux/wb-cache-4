40|$|The {{study of}} {{alcoholic}} influence, joint alcoholic and mental influence {{as well as}} the one of further exposition on structural and informational properties of water was carried out with the method of laser emission scattering. Experimental findings imply that adding alcohol to water results in formation of coarser cluster structure compared to the initial one. Degree and character of such restructuring are defined by duration of alcohol influence, its dosage, and the initial water structure. The mechanism of memory deterioration of water with alcohol is defined. It lies in essential abatement of its sensitivity to the influencing information compared to the one of the blank sample. The loss of memory in water containing alcohol is determined by high mechanical durability of combined clusters that consist of molecules of water and pure alcohol formed by alcohol influence which hinders their spin restructuring under informational influence. Character of changes in water structure that contains alcohol corresponds to abatement of human brain memory under consumption of alcohol and testifies to veracious conclusion of torsional nature of brain memory.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} results {{derived from}} ab initio wavefunctions, leading to new concepts of metallic bonding — real-space concepts {{that do not}} require "thinking in reciprical (k) space. " As the first step in this study of metallic bonding, Hartree-Fock and generalized valence bond wavefunctions are presented for ring clusters composed of monovalent atoms (Cu, Ag, Au, Li, and Na). These results show that one-dimensional metals need not exhibit Peierls instabilities, charge density waves, or spin density waves. In addition, magnon spectra calculated using various wavefunctions are compared {{with each other and with}} magnon spectia obtained with simple nearest-neighbor Ising and Heisenberg hamiltonians. Generalized valence bond wavefunctions for small metal clusters lead to the conclusion that, for metallic systems, the valence electrons occupy interstitial regions — bond midpoints for one-dimensional systems, triangular hollows for two-dimensional systems, and tetrahedral hollows for three-dimensional systems. The new concepts of metallic bonding are summarized by a set of rules for the valence sp electrons of metallic systems. These rules are used to derive the low-lying isomers of small metal clusters, and are expected to prove useful in predicting the chemistry and catalytic properties of such systems. Applying these rules to bulk metals leads to a new explanation of the solubility limits governing alloys of monovalent, divalent, trivalent, and <b>tetravalent</b> <b>atoms.</b> These rules are expected to prove valuable in describing the localized states in metals and alloys such as defects or interfaces. ...|$|R

50|$|In chemistry, tetravalence is {{the state}} of an atom with four valence {{electrons}} available for covalent chemical bonding in its outermost electron shell, giving the atom a chemical valence of four. An example is methane (CH4): the <b>tetravalent</b> carbon <b>atom</b> forms a covalent bond with four hydrogen atoms. The carbon <b>atom</b> is called <b>tetravalent</b> because it forms 4 covalent bonds.A carbon atom has a total of six electrons occupying the first two shells, i.e., the K-shell has two electrons and the L-shell has four electrons. This distribution indicates that in the outermost shell there are one completely filled 's' orbital and two half-filled 'p' orbitals, showing carbon to be a divalent atom. But in actuality, carbon displays tetravalency in the combined state. Therefore, a carbon atom has four valence electrons. It could gain four electrons to form the C4− anion or lose four electrons to form the C4+ cation. Both these conditions would take carbon far away from achieving stability by the octet rule. To overcome this problem carbon undergoes bonding by sharing its valence electrons. This allows it to be covalently bonded to one, two, three or four carbon atoms or atoms of other elements or groups of atoms. Let us see how carbon forms the single, double and triple bonds in the following examples.|$|R

Iron metal atom reactions with the isoelectronic species, CH(, 4), NH(, 3), and HF are also included in this study. In most cases, a metal atom-water molecule adduct is formed on co-condensation. Adduct formation is detected in these experiments by a red shift in the (nu) (, 2) water bending mode frequency at 1593 cm('- 1), over a range of 5 - 35 cm('- 1). Photolysis of the adduct with (lamda) (TURNEQ) 300 - 600 nm light results in an oxidative insertion of the metal atom into the O-H bond of water to produce the metal hydroxy hydride molecule, HMOH. The Zn, Tl and Pb adducts do not react under normal experimental conditions. Sc, Ti, V and Al metal atoms spontaneously insert into the water molecule to form the HMOH molecule on co-condensation. Preliminary studies on nickel indicate that the metal atom does not form an adduct with water and does not undergo an insertion reaction.

40|$|Recently much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} development of organic conductors and superconductors. For this purpose, syntheses of new electron donors and acceptors are very important. One of the important points for the molecular design is to extend π-conjugation in order to reduce on-site Coulombic repulsion. The other is to form highly dimensional crystal structures. From these viewpoints, 1, 2, 5 -thiadiazole rings are of interest since they have extended π-conjugation and polarized heteroatoms resulting in strong intermolecular interactions by heteroatom contacts. Furthermore, since thiadiazoles are electron-withdrawing heterocycles, compounds with both thiadiazole rings and electron-donating ones are expected to have a high polarizability, intramolecular chargetransfer (CT) interaction, and an enhanced amphoteric redox ability. In this research work, He designed some new types of redox systems containing thiadiazole moieties and investigated their electronic properties and crystal structures. Chapter 1 describes the purpose and some attractive previous works as introduction of this thesis. Chapter 2 describes preparation, properties, and an X-ray crystal structure analysis of 7 - (1, 3 -dithiol- 2 -ylidene) - 4 -methyl- 4, 7 -dihydro[1, 2, 5]thiadiazolo[3, 4 -b]pyridine. The compound and its derivatives were characterized by intramolecular CT bands around 510 and 490 nm and stronger electron-donating abilities than tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) study, indicating that they are of interest as novel electron donors which have no TTF skeleton. The crystal analysis revealed that the molecules make columnar stacks and the overlapping is in accord with an effective interaction between the HOMO and the LUMO. The crystal structure is composed of a set of four columns interacted with each other through short S･･･S contacts. Although the net atomic charges calculated by the MNDO-PM 3 method show that the molecule is highly polarized, S･･･N contacts arising from an electrostatic effect were not observed. The compounds formed conducting CT complexes with tetracyanoquinodimethane. One of them showed a high electrical conductivity (1 S cm- 1) as a compressed pellet, and the degree of CT was evaluated as 0. 67 according to the C=N stretching frequency. The cation radical salts were prepared by an electrochemical oxidation, and the C 104 salt of the ethylenedithio-derivative showed a semiconducting behavior with a σrt= 4. 4 x 10 - 2 Scm- tandEa= 0. 15 eV Nonplanar donors or acceptors giving organic conductors are very few. Chapter 3 describes a novel nonplanar donor molecule containing fused benzene and fused thiadiazloe rings. The unique butterfly-shaped structure and intramolecular short S･･･N contacts were revealed by an X-ray crystal structure analysis, and a uniform columnar stacking was also observed. Although many organic conductors are known, they are composed of multi-components such as CT complexes. Usual organic compounds are insulators as single components. However, molecules containing both donor and acceptor units are expected to exhibit unusual electrical properties owing to intramolecular CT interaction. 4 H, 8 H 4 -, 8 -Bis (1, 3 -dithiol- 2 -ylidene) benzo [1, 2 -c : 4, 5 c 2 ̆ 7]bis[1, 2, 5]thiadiazole(BTQBT) {{is one of the most}} electrical conducting materials as a single component. Its electrical behavior is ascribable to strong intermolecular interactions in the crystal. He have now replaced one of the 1, 3 -dithiole groups by a carbonyl group to give BTQT, which is considerable to be more polarized than BTQBT. Chapter 4 deals with an X-ray crystal structure analysis and an electrical behavior of BTQT. In the crystal the molecular over lapping is close to that of BTQBT, suggesting intermolecular CT interaction. The overlap mode is caused from the most effective interaction between the HOMO and the LUMO. On the other hand, the crystal structure is in sharp contrast with that of BTQBT, which makes a sheet-like network with short S･･･S contacts. BTQT molecules are three-dimensionally connected with each other through short S･･･S, S･･･N, and S･･･O contacts. These S･･･N and S･･･O contacts are attributed to an electrostatic effect due to the highly polarized structure. The electrical conducting behavior fails to obey Ohm 2 ̆ 7 s law. The current increased approximately in proportion to the third power of the voltage. The non-ohmic behavior observed here is an unprecedented one as organic crystals. Chapter 5 is concerned with novel heterocycles, benzo[1, 2 -c: 4, 5 -c 2 ̆ 7]bis ([1, 2, 5]thiadiazole) s and the monoselenium analogues, which contain a <b>tetravalent</b> sulfur <b>atom.</b> They are characterized by higher electron affinities and longer absorption maxima compared with those of a related Kekule-type isomer. The high electron affinities are owing to the unique 14 π-electron ring system containing a <b>tetravalent</b> sulfur <b>atom,</b> which generates a more stable Kekule-type thiadiazole ring upon accepting an electron. Their electron-accepting abilities are comparable to that of p-benzoquinone. They showed strong fluorescence emission. Their electronic properties and reactivities are explained by the MNDO-PM 3 calculations. In the X-ray crystal structure analysis of the dibromoderivative, the molecular structure demonstrates the hypervalency on the sulfur atoms and the 14 π-electron ring moiety. The crystal structure is composed of a set of two ribbon columns linked by short S･･･N and N･･･N contacts, and these columns interact with each other through short Br･･･N contacts resulted in a dense crystal packing. The donor-π-acceptor molecules were also synthesized by introduction of electron-donating groups into the skeleton. Their redox potentials were determined by the CV study. The molecules substituted by arnine groups show good amphoteric redox properties. The electron-donating ability of the dimethylaminobenzene derivative is similar to that of TTF, indicating that it is a promising electron donor for organic conductors. At the end of the thesis, this research work is summarized and makes some suggestions. Introduction of 1, 2, 5 -thiadiazole rings into electron donors results in large polarization, which is helpful to stabilize the ring systems. Highly polarized molecules show interesting physical properties. Unique molecular assemblies are constructed by intermolecular interactions between polarized heteroatoms. Control of physical properties and crystal structures of such molecules seems possible by changing the polarizability affected by the charge densities on the heteroatoms...|$|R

The entire set of NMR spectra is simultaneously fitted with six distinct environments {{taking into account}} the effect of first and second neighbors on the position of the 77 Se resonance. The selenium chains are bound at each end to trivalent arsenic atoms, and the chain length distribution can be modeled with the Flory theory, which is well-known in polymer science and is used {{here for the first time}} to model the probability of finding each selenium environment in a selenide glass. No arsenic homopolar bond is detected in our experiments. ■ INTRODUCTION Chalcogenide glasses exhibit a wide range of physical properties such as infrared transparency, high refractive indices, and reversible amorphous-to-crystal transitions and can be easily shaped into optical devices. 1 − 6 Among them, the arsenic selenide glasses As x Se 1 −x are considered to be a promising family because glassy As 2 Se 3 is a good candidate for all-optical switching 7 or for use as a mid-infrared laser source; 8 in addition, arsenic selenide glasses can be used for optic fibers. 9 Recent studies also investigated the possibility of preparing these glasses using microwave heating. 10 Numerous attempts were made to draw a link between the changes in the physical properties of arsenic selenide and the evolution of its molecular structure as the arsenic content varies, both at room temperature 11, 12 and when the temperature is increased, 13 during aging of the glass, 14 or when irradiated with a laser. 15 To gain some insight into the arsenic selenide glass structures, recent studies relied on molecular dynamics 16 − 18 combined with anomalous X-ray scattering 19 or 77 Se solid-state NMR 20 − 23 to characterize the environments and connectivity of selenium and arsenic atoms. Many of these studies hint toward the existence of a small amount of As−As homopolar bond 12, 16 with <b>tetravalent</b> arsenic <b>atoms</b> linked to two arsenic and two selenium atoms. 19 Moreover, 77 Se NMR spectroscopy can quantify three distinct selenium environments (selenium atoms linked to two, one, or zero arsenic atoms) and shows that there is some disorder in the distribution of the lengths of the selenium chains that link arsenic atoms together, as opposed to what is inferred in the chain-crossing model (i. e., when the selenium chains are of similar lengths). 20, 23 Interestingly, it was suggested that the Flory model, 24 which describes the distribution of chain lengths in organic polymers, could be applied to inorganic polymers (mostly silicates) because the underlying chemical phenomena share striking similarities, especially for glasses with covalent bonds and no ionic species. 25 − 27 The Flory theory provides a very simple model for the probability, P(n), of finding a chain of length n, which is equal to np n− 1 (1 − p) 2, where p is the probability to form a linkage between two monomers and the average chain length is given by 1 + p/ 1 − p. Moreover, Flory distributions are characterized by a single parameter p and not two as is the case for Gaussian distributions (which may not correctly reproduce the chain length distributions for arsenic-rich glasses with short chain lengths) or three for skewed Gaussian distributions. Therefore, the Flory framework was applied here as a model for the distribution of chain lengths. 77 Se is a spin 1 / 2 nucleus with a 7. 63 % natural abundance, a gyromagnetic ratio equal to 19 % of γ(1 H), and a fairly large chemical shift range over 3000 ppm. 28, 29 However, as many diluted spin- 1 / 2, it usually features long longitudinal relaxation times around hundreds of seconds, which may affect the measured proportions of each selenium environment. 23 Usually, three selenium environments are distinguished depending upon the nature of the two atoms (arsenic or selenium) they are connected with. 20 However, as the 77 Se atoms are excessively sensitive to their environments, it is often observed that the chemical shifts of these broad lines vary with the composition of the sample, 20 precluding any simultaneous fitting of series of NMR spectra. Such an effect results from a dependence of th...|$|R
