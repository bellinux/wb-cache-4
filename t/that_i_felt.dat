25|$|At {{the fifteenth}} attempt {{since the war}} we won at Melbourne...It was then <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that the great Australian team was just {{beginning}} to deteriorate. The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles. A number of the batsmen who scored heavily on previous occasions found that Don Bradman had not spent hours at the wicket softening the bowling, and run-scoring against bowlers who were not tired was not so easy.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

He further explained that the emotional responses of people he knew who were in relationships seemed [...] "incredibly insincere and blown out of proportion" [...] and inspired the cynical lyrics of the song.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} greeted with {{widespread}} derision in preview screenings. An audience of Los Angeles entertainment journalists, critics, and others greeted the film with guffaws and hoots at a screening in Century City while other viewers in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore responded with derisive laughter or simply walked out. At a post-launch publicity event, Travolta, on asking assembled journalists if they had enjoyed it, received no reply. He later asserted that other filmmakers had enjoyed the movie: [...] "When I felt better about everything was when George Lucas and Quentin Tarantino, {{and a lot of}} people <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> knew what they were doing, saw it and thought it was a great piece of science fiction." [...] Christian also spoke of an initially positive reception, mentioning an enthusiastic response from both the audience and Tarantino.|$|E
500|$|Davies {{would later}} comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Anning later [...] "told {{me that he}} ... knew it [...] had been partly {{inspired}} by him ... reminded him of home ... I told Arthur <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he shrugged off my apology, {{saying that he was}} flattered." [...] With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew ("Victoria", [...] "Young and Innocent Days"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons ("Australia"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home ("Shangri-La"), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War ("Mr. Churchill Says"), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war ("She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina"), and the death of his brother in World War I ("Yes Sir, No Sir", [...] "Some Mother's Son").|$|E

500|$|According to Kahn, Spears pitched him her {{original}} concept, which included all the main elements {{used in the}} final version. Spears thought of the video as a sequel to [...] "Toxic", as seen in her documentary , whereas Kahn approached it as [...] "a 2008 answer" [...] to the previous clip. He added that, [...] "'Toxic' was a crystallization of her career at that time, [...] There are elements and moments of <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> could [...] improved. [...] {{is a bit more}} fashion-forward". About how the concept of the video related to their previous work, Kahn commented that [...] "It's just a great girl fantasy. There are things she's really good at, like having a really natural knack for knowing what girls want. [...] It's a much more mature sound and much more mature lyrics, and she always has the greatest ideas. She's hyper-aware of pop culture".|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{spoke with}} Larry King on CNN, {{supporting}} the It Gets Better Project and The Trevor Project, {{a non-profit organization}} providing crisis and suicide prevention for LGBT youth, {{in light of the}} high profile suicides committed in Fall, 2010. She stated: [...] "(I was) one of those kids... holding everything inside... internalizing everything. And that really can affect you, and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that person that you can trust, that adult, like I did later on in life, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project is really all about. And they have a 24-hour hotline... There's someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you." [...] She made an official It Gets Better video which was released on December 1, 2010.|$|E
500|$|... "Blurred Lines" [...] was controversial: its {{video was}} called sexist for its {{perceived}} degradation of women, and some felt its lyrics promoted rape. Others disagreed, {{asserting that the}} lyrics supported female power and sexual freedom. Martel defended Ratajkowski's performance, saying: [...] "it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing." [...] Ratajkowski {{did not think of}} the video as sexist and claimed that the producers, through the use of humor and sarcasm, [...] "took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting". She said that the song [...] "gave me an opportunity to say the things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> about feminism today and about women in general in pop culture." [...] Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner: the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have, and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which is bad for both sexes.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{director}} David Lynch began casting for his psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. He interviewed Watts {{after looking}} at her headshot, without having seen any of her previous work, and offered her the lead role. Lynch later said about his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities {{for a lot of}} different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Conceived as a pilot for a television series, Lynch shot a large portion of it in February 1999, planning to keep it open-ended for a potential series. However, the pilot was rejected. Watts recalled thinking at the time, [...] "just my dumb luck, that I'm in the only David Lynch programme that never sees the light of day." [...] Instead, Lynch filmed an ending in October 2000, turning it into a feature film which was picked up for distribution.|$|E
500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. And while I was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And {{so it was really}} mostly after I finished the movie <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> pain." [...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|Priyanka Chopra was Bhardwaj's {{original}} {{choice for}} the role of Susanna after he worked with the actress in Kaminey: He said that Chopra [...] "is the finest actor of her generation right now... As a director I had so much trust on her <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that no one else can essay this role as brilliantly as she would do". Mohanlal was cast as one of Susanna's husbands in the film; however, he left the project to concentrate on Malayalam films. The actor was replaced by Annu Kapoor in the role of Inspector Keemat Lal. Other actors in the film were John Abraham, Naseeruddin Shah, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Vivaan Shah. Directors Karan Johar and Imtiaz Ali were approached to play two of the seven husbands, but they reportedly turned down the offer. Usha Uthup was cast as Susanna's maid in the film. Konkona Sen Sharma was confirmed for a cameo appearance.|$|E
