5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using a Magic Wand as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E

5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety.

Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device.

5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright called <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} vibrators, {{and called}} it a miracle that the device {{was able to bring}} about a orgasm in under sixty seconds.

Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the Mütter Museum. Sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand because it was imported from Japan, and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries, and durability compared to other vibrators.|$|E

5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M.

Vibration was delivered using <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure.

5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M.

Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper {{published in the journal}} Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of <b>the</b> <b>Magic</b> Wand to help measure balance and postural sway.
