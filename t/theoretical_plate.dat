Here, the condensate continues to be heated by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, {{the composition of the}} fresh vapors are determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a <b>theoretical</b> <b>plate)</b> will yield a purer solution of the more volatile component.

25|$|Another {{factor in}} {{addition}} to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is the liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed. The number of theoretical stages required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to not be working properly. The height equivalent to a <b>theoretical</b> <b>plate</b> (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform to it maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor to evenly distribute the liquid entering a packed bed can be found in references. Considerable work as been done on this topic by Fractionation Research, Inc. (commonly known as FRI).|$|E
