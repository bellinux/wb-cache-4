40|$|We have {{isolated}} mutants of Escherichia coli {{that have}} an altered beta-galactoside <b>transport</b> <b>system.</b> This altered <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> is able to transport a sugar, maltose, that the wild-type beta-galactoside <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> is unable to transport. The mutation that alters the specificity of the <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> is in the lacY gene, and we refer to the allele as lacYmal. The lacYmal allele was detected originally in strains in which the lac genes were fused to the malF gene. Thus, {{as a result of}} gene fusion and isolation of the lacYmal mutation, a new <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> was evolved with regulatory properties and specificity {{similar to those of the}} original maltose <b>transport</b> <b>system.</b> Maltose <b>transport</b> via the lacYmal gene product is independent of all of the normal maltose <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> components.

5|$|Norman Selfe (9 December 1839– 15 October 1911) was an Australian engineer, naval architect, inventor, urban planner and outspoken {{advocate}} of technical education. After emigrating to Sydney {{with his family}} from England as a boy he became an apprentice engineer, following his father's trade. Selfe designed many bridges, docks, boats, and much precision machinery for the city. He also introduced new refrigeration, hydraulic, electrical and <b>transport</b> <b>systems.</b> For these achievements he received international acclaim during his lifetime. Decades before the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built, the city came close to building a Selfe-designed steel cantilever bridge across the harbour after he won the second public competition for a bridge design.|$|E

40|$|Further {{development}} of theoretical and planned studies on optimization of <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> demands for: {{acceptance of a}} univocal understanding of the notion „transport system", precision of a criterion of system optimization as well as determination of ways of it's disaggregation. An analysis based on observations of research practice shows that all human and material elements employed in transport can be included into <b>transport</b> <b>system.</b> The notion should embrace simultaneously all internal relationships existing in <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> and these aspects of external relationships that are directly connected with system functioning. The best criterion of <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> opitimization {{seems to be in}} minimization of total transport costs in the whole national economy. The greatest advantages of such criterion consist in possibility of treating transport properties as variables in searching of ways of <b>transport,</b> <b>system</b> optimization as well as facility of evaluation of multi-variant transport development programmes. This criterion best reflects influence exerted on national income by transport. As basic area of <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> optimization and co-ordination the macro-economic level is to be accepted. In research of <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> optimization and co-ordination at lower levels a simultaneous utilization of all basic ways of <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> disagregation is indispensable.

For the light rail to use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> in Bergen.|$|E

5|$|When the Parliament of Norway {{decided on}} 8 October 1992 {{to build a}} new central airport for Eastern Norway, they also decided that the main mode of ground {{transport}} to the airport should be by railway. While the previous airport, Oslo Airport, Fornebu, was located just outside the city limits; the new Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, would be located some 50 kilometers north of the city, outside the reach of the existing public <b>transport</b> <b>systems.</b> The political agreement to build the airport stated that the costs of construction should not be borne by the tax payers. As a result, the entire airport was financed with money borrowed through Oslo Lufthavn AS, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Airport Administration. The same principle was chosen for the airport rail link. The Norwegian State Railways (NSB) created the subsidiary, NSB Gardermobanen AS, on 24 November 1992 to perform the construction of the line. This company would be able to charge train operators using the railway line; and could use this income to cover its down payments and interest on the debt created to pay for the infrastructure investment.
