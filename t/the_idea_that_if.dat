25|$|The {{breach of}} a {{procedural}} legitimate expectation {{has been recognized}} {{as a form of}} procedural impropriety. This involves <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a public authority has made a representation to an individual who will be affected by a decision that he or she can expect to be consulted in advance of the decision being taken but does not do so, this is unlawful. The representation giving rise to such a legitimate expectation may either be an express promise given on behalf of an authority, or the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue. These principles were accepted as part of Singapore law in Re Siah Mooi Guat.|$|E
25|$|Discontent {{over the}} {{reintroduction}} of feudal taxes, {{combined with the}} way the constitution of 1801 was adopted, led to increased resistance from the population of the Canton du Léman during 1801. A group of Vaudois patriots assembled as early as spring 1800 in Morges to discuss <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the feudal taxes were not abolished, a reunion with France was preferable to remaining in the Helvetic Republic. The Helvetic Republic seized on that argument to issue a blanket condemnation of the Vaudois patriots, who in turn signed an address that represented a first clear call to arms. Their address stated that they felt deeply attached to a Swiss nation that upheld the notions of egalitarism, liberty, and justice, but insinuated that the government was unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Fergus and Mandy try to {{reassemble}} {{the broken}} {{pieces of the}} mirror. Fergus has <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they put the pieces together on their side the mirror will repair itself on the other side. It works. While in the Hall of Mirrors, a kind woman appears to Daniel and Constance. She tells Constance she was right to steal the crown as the heir is dead. She also reveals that the crown {{can make a difference}} to the future. Meanwhile, in 1867 Gervais strikes gold, meaning he no longer has any need to sell the crown. The mirror appears and Constance goes through. Upon her return, Constance discovers that her father has entrusted the crown to her to do as she sees fit, but before she can arrange this with her friends in the 1990s, the mirror vanishes, signifying the end of their adventures. Back in 1997, Daniel, Fergus and Mandy visit Constance's grave and discover a clue to the location of the crown. Someone arrives and gives them a letter from Constance. The letter states that they are the new proprietors of the Crown Foundation. Now that their adventures had come to an end, Daniel decides to go back home and stay with this mum.|$|E

The first, {{directed}} by Anton Corbijn, was filmed in Berlin and features {{the band members}} performing at Hansa Studios interspersed with footage of Trabants (an East German automobile they became fond of as a symbol for a changing Europe) and shots of them dressed in drag. Bono explained that the idea to crossdress [...] "had been based on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> U2 can't do this, we've got to do it!", and it was fostered by the group's experiences dressing in drag for the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. However, the band pulled the video, fearing the single's status as an AIDS benefit would result in critics finding AIDS-related interpretations of the video. The Edge explained, [...] "We didn't {{want to be involved}} in putting back the AIDS issue into the realm of sexuality... It wasn't worth the risk of people imagining we were saying something about the AIDS issue through the drag footage, which was totally not what we were trying to say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of Zelazny's works explore {{variations}} upon <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{there exists}} {{an infinite number}} of worlds, then every world that can be imagined must exist, somewhere. Powerful beings in many of his stories have the ability to travel to worlds that possess precisely the characteristics which that being wishes to experience. [...] (Zelazny characters with this ability include Thoth in Creatures of Light and Darkness, who teleports to these worlds; those with the royal blood of either Amber or Chaos in The Chronicles of Amber, who [...] "move through shadows" [...] to reach these worlds; the guardian families of A Dark Traveling, who move between realities using high-tech devices; and Red Dorakeen in Roadmarks, who reaches these worlds by driving along a magical highway.) [...] Many of these same characters wonder whether they are creating these special places anew, or are merely finding places which already exist (very much like [...] "the problem of universals" [...] in classical metaphysics). Usually each character who ponders this ultimately decides that the question is purely academic and therefore unanswerable.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{liberalism}} opposes socialism when socialism {{is understood}} to mean an alternative to capitalism based on state ownership {{of the means of}} production. American liberals doubt that bases for political opposition and freedom can survive when all power is vested in the state, as it was under state-socialist regimes. In line with the general pragmatic, empirical basis of liberalism, American liberal philosophy embraces <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> substantial abundance and equality of opportunity can be achieved through a system of mixed ownership, then {{there is no need for}} a rigid and oppressive bureaucracy. Some liberal public intellectuals have, since the 1950s, moved further toward the general position that free markets, when appropriately regulated, can provide better solutions than top-down economic planning. Economist Paul Krugman argued that in hitherto-state-dominated functions such as nation-scale energy distribution and telecommunications, marketizations can improve efficiency dramatically. He also defended a monetary policy—inflation targeting—saying that it [...] "most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources". (These distortions are of a kind that war-time and post-war Keynesian economists had accepted as an inevitable byproduct of fiscal policies that selectively reduced certain consumer taxes and directed spending toward government-managed stimulus projects—even where these economists theorized at a contentious distance from some of Keynes's own, more hands-off, positions, which tended to emphasize stimulating of business investment.) Thomas Friedman is a liberal journalist who, like Paul Krugman, generally defends free trade as more likely to improve the lot of both rich and poor countries.|$|E

[...] The website says that Mohammad was a [...] "false prophet" [...] and that the [...] "Islamic ideology itself is clearly one of hatred and violence, which is declaring war against the entire non-Islamic world... it is determined to dominate the world, just as Nazism was." [...] The website came out against plans to build an Islamic cultural center near Ground Zero in New York, and said this was the reason why. [...] "Because Islam is a hateful and violent ideology which preaches hate and violence against ALL non-Muslims (especially Jews, as it is obsessed with us, and dehumanizes us as apes and pigs), we are against ALL mosques. We are against Islam, just as we are against Nazism.

2500|$|The cast was {{announced}} between March and August 2014, with Idris Elba being announced to voice Shere Khan during early stages and Bill Murray eventually confirmed {{as the voice}} of Baloo in August 2014. Between then, Scarlett Johansson, Ben Kingsley, and Christopher Walken were confirmed to play Kaa, Bagheera, and King Louie. Favreau decided to cast Johansson to play Kaa, originally a male character, as he felt the original film was [...] "a little too male-oriented." [...] Favreau and Marks noticed the lack of female characters in the 1967 film version and wanted to address that by featuring Raksha's character more prominently, as in Kipling's tales. Lupita Nyong'o was cast as Raksha as Favreau believed her voice imbued the emotion required for the role, [...] "Lupita has tremendous depth of emotion in her performance. There's an emotional underpinning she brings, and a strength, and we wanted that for this surrogate mother. Much of that comes from her voice." [...] Favreau also decided to change King Louie from an orangutan to a Gigantopithecus {{due to the fact that}} orangutans are not native to India, where the story takes place. His character was given a slight alteration from the 1967 film and was partly inspired by Marlon Brando's character Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, as well as incorporating Walken's own physical mannerisms. In regards to Louie's changes, Favreau stated, [...] "We created this looming figure that was trying to extract the secret of fire from Mowgli. And also this gave Mowgli <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he had fire, he could have power over Shere Khan, whether it was good or bad. So there was aLord of the Rings aspect to that; the fire was almost like the ring in that was going to give someone ultimate power, but corrupt them as well as create destruction." [...] The film is dedicated to Garry Shandling, who voiced a porcupine in the film and died of a heart attack before the film's release.|$|E
