5|$|Mathematics were {{essential}} in drafting the astronomical calendar, a lunisolar calendar that used the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. Use {{of the ancient}} Sifen calendar (古四分曆), which measured the <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> at 3651⁄4 days, was replaced in 104 BC with the Taichu calendar (太初曆) that measured the <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 days. However, Emperor Zhang later reinstated the Sifen calendar.|$|E
5|$|The Han Chinese used astronomical studies {{mainly to}} {{construct}} and revise their calendar. In contrast to the Julian calendar (46 BCE) and Gregorian calendar (1582 CE) of the West (but like the Hellenic calendars of Classical Greece), the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning that it uses the precise movements of the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. In the 5th century BCE during the Spring and Autumn period, the Chinese established the Sifen calendar (古四分历), which measured the <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> at 3651⁄4 days (like the Julian calendar of Rome). Emperor Wu replaced this with the new Taichu calendar (太初历) in 104 BCE which measured the <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 days. Since the Taichu calendar had become inaccurate over two centuries, Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75–88 CE) halted its use and revived use of the Sifen calendar. Later, astronomer Guo Shoujing (1233–1316 CE) would set the <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> at 365.2425 days for his Shoushi calendar (授時曆), the same value used in the Gregorian calendar. Besides {{the use of the}} calendar for regulating agricultural practices throughout the seasons, it was also used to mark important dates in the Sexagenary cycle—constructed by celestial stems (gan 干) and Earthly Branches (zhi 支), each of the latter associated with an animal of the Chinese zodiac.|$|E
5|$|The {{angle of}} Earth's axial tilt is {{relatively}} stable {{over long periods}} of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a <b>tropical</b> <b>year.</b> Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.|$|E

This definition brings the observed positions of the celestial bodies into accord with Newtonian dynamical theories of their motion.

25|$|A <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> (also {{known as}} a solar year), for general purposes, is {{the time that the}} Sun takes to return to the same {{position}} in the cycle of seasons, as seen from Earth; for example, the time from vernal equinox to vernal equinox, or from summer solstice to summer solstice. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the seasonal cycle does not remain exactly synchronized with the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun.

25|$|Hipparchus {{also studied}} {{precession}} in On the Length of the Year. Two kinds of year {{are relevant to}} understanding his work. The <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> is {{the length of time}} that the Sun, as viewed from the Earth, takes to return to the same position along the ecliptic (its path among the stars on the celestial sphere). The sidereal year is the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position with respect to the stars of the celestial sphere. Precession causes the stars to change their longitude slightly each year, so the sidereal year is longer than the <b>tropical</b> <b>year.</b> Using observations of the equinoxes and solstices, Hipparchus found that the length of the <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> was 365+1/4−1/300 days, or 365.24667 days (Evans 1998, p.209). Comparing this with the length of the sidereal year, he calculated that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century. From this information, it is possible to calculate that his value for the sidereal year was 365+1/4+1/144 days (Toomer 1978, p.218). By giving a minimum rate he may have been allowing for errors in observation.|$|E
25|$|To {{approximate}} his <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> Hipparchus {{created his}} own lunisolar calendar by modifying those of Meton and Callippus in On Intercalary Months and Days (now lost), {{as described by}} Ptolemy in the Almagest III.1 (Toomer 1984, p.139). The Babylonian calendar used a cycle of 235 lunar months in 19 years since 499 BC (with only three exceptions before 380 BC), {{but it did not}} use a specified number of days. The Metonic cycle (432 BC) assigned 6,940 days to these 19 years producing an average year of 365+1/4+1/76 or 365.26316 days. The Callippic cycle (330 BC) dropped one day from four Metonic cycles (76 years) for an average year of 365+1/4 or 365.25 days. Hipparchus dropped one more day from four Callippic cycles (304 years), creating the Hipparchic cycle with an average year of 365+1/4−1/304 or 365.24671 days, which was close to his <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> of 365+1/4−1/300 or 365.24667 days.|$|E
25|$|Semester: Half a lunar year. Eclipses {{will repeat}} exactly one {{semester}} apart at alternating nodes in a cycle that lasts for 8 eclipses. Because it {{is close to}} a half integer of anomalistic, draconic months, and <b>tropical</b> <b>years,</b> each solar eclipse will alternate between hemispheres each semester, as well as alternate between total and annular. Hence {{there can be a}} maximum of one total or annular eclipse each in a given year.|$|R

25|$|The Burmese {{calendar}} uses lunar months but {{tries to}} keep pace with the solar year.

25|$|At {{the end of}} his career, Hipparchus wrote a {{book called}} Peri eniausíou megéthous ("On the Length of the Year") about his results. The {{established}} value for the <b>tropical</b> <b>year,</b> introduced by Callippus in or before 330 was 365 + 1/4 days. Speculating a Babylonian origin for the Callippic year is hard to defend, since Babylon did not observe solstices thus the only extant System B year length was based on Greek solstices (see below). Hipparchus's equinox observations gave varying results, but he himself points out (quoted in Almagest III.1(H195)) that the observation errors by himself and his predecessors may have been as large as 1/4 day. He used old solstice observations, and determined a difference of about one day in about 300 years. So he set the length of the <b>tropical</b> <b>year</b> to 365 + 1/4 - 1/300 days (= 365.24666... days = 365days 5hours 55min, which differs from the actual value (modern estimate, including earth spin acceleration) in his time of about 365.2425 days, an error of about 6min per year, an hour per decade, 10 hours per century.|$|E
