6000|$|It was luxurious to loll in a {{deep green}} rep chair, his legs thrust out before him, to glance at the black Chinese <b>telephone</b> <b>stand</b> and the colored {{photograph}} of Mount Vernon which he had always liked so much, while in the tiny kitchen--so near--Mrs. Judique sang [...] "My Creole Queen." [...] In an intolerable sweetness, a contentment so deep that he was wistfully discontented, he saw magnolias by moonlight and heard plantation darkies crooning to the banjo. He wanted to be near her, on pretense of helping her, yet he wanted to remain in this still ecstasy. Languidly he remained.|$|E

60|$|The <b>telephone</b> <b>stood</b> at her elbow, concealed--at {{the express}} {{request of the}} {{interior}} decorator who had designed the room--in the interior of what looked to the casual eye like a stuffed owl. On a table near at hand, handsomely bound in morocco to resemble a complete works of Shakespeare, was the telephone book. Mrs. Pett hesitated no longer.

Many pay station telephones also used a separate ringer box.|$|R
