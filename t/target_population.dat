Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the <b>target</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to Amnesty International, {{the use of}} rape {{during times}} of war is not a {{by-product}} of conflicts, but a pre-planned and deliberate military strategy. In {{the last quarter of}} a century, the majority of conflicts have shifted from wars between nation states to communal and intrastate civil wars. During these conflicts the use of rape as a weapon against the civilian population by state and non-state actors has become more frequent. Journalists and human rights organizations have documented campaigns of genocidal rape during the conflicts in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Liberia, Sudan, Uganda, and the DRC. The strategic aim of these mass rapes are twofold. The first is to instill terror in the civilian population, with the intent to forcibly dislocate them from their property. The second is to degrade the chance of possible return and reconstitution by inflicting humiliation and shame on the targeted population. These effects are strategically important for non-state actors, as it is necessary for them to remove the targeted population from the land. Rape as genocide is well suited for campaigns which involve ethnic cleansing and genocide, as the objective is to destroy or forcefully remove the <b>target</b> <b>population,</b> and ensure they do not return.|$|E

The theory and model present an expansion of theories on the <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> and policy design from Lowi (1972), Ingram, Schneider and Deleon (2007); and Schneider and Ingram (1993). The model is tested through {{a case study of}} homeless policy in Seattle, WA from 2007 to 2016 and the correlating perceptions of the homeless generated through the rhetoric of the political elite and the general public. The homeless policy design model indicates that the public's perceptions about homeless <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> will impact policy design choices. Through qualitative research methods, the thesis finds that there is a recognizable correlation between how the public views the homeless and what type of policy the Seattle City Council passed from 2007 to 2016...|$|R

This site was chosen as it was equidistant from London and Birmingham, close to main roads and railways, and near Luton Airport.

30|$|Perhaps not {{surprisingly}} given the severe impairment characteristics associated with SSDI and SSI program eligibility and {{the barriers to}} reform described above, most SSA employment demonstrations have struggled to recruit volunteer participants. Almost every intervention tested targeted people for services after they had met SSA’s disability criteria and started receiving benefits. 6 Although some interventions used program waivers, such as allowing beneficiaries to keep more of their benefits while working, in every demonstration, participants still could lose benefits for excess work. Most of these demonstration projects enrolled about {{five percent of the}} <b>population</b> <b>targeted</b> for recruitment (Rangarajan et al. 2008; Ruiz-Quintanilla et al. 2005), though more recent demonstrations with narrow <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> of youth and those with psychiatric impairment had higher participation rates of approximately 15 percent. As will be discussed in more detail below, the demonstrations with narrow <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> had customized service approaches, which likely made the services more appealing to participants, thereby increasing volunteer rates. Regardless, all intervention <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> represented a subgroup of all beneficiaries receiving SSDI and SSI.|$|R
