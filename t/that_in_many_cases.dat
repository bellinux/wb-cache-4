It was also pioneering in its recording of Indian folklore and folktales. It was succeeded by The New Indian Antiquary (1938-47) and the Indian Antiquary (1964-71).|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of {{convenience}} system. One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|E

5|$|In March 1987, {{the main}} Libyan air base of Ouadi Doum was {{captured}} by Chadian forces. Although strongly defended by minefields, 5,000 soldiers, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, the Libyans' base fell to a smaller Chadian attacking force led by Djamous equipped with trucks mounted with machine guns and antitank weapons. Observers estimated that, in the Chadian victories {{in the first three}} months of 1987, more than 3,000 Libyan soldiers had been killed, captured, or deserted. Large numbers of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters were captured or destroyed. In some cases, Libya sent its own aircraft to bomb abandoned Libyan equipment to deny its use to the Chadians. It was reported <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> Libyan soldiers had been killed while fleeing to avoid battle.

The close quarters meant that some of the grenades would travel back and forth up to three times before exploding. The Australians held the old Ottoman fire trench and had footholds deeper in Ottoman lines. They blocked the Ottoman communications trenches as best they could, often with the bodies of the dead, to thwart raids. Other bodies were moved to unused communication trenches and saps, and where possible the wounded were evacuated, however, the fighting was so intense, the conditions so cramped and the men so exhausted <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> they were left to lie {{at the bottom of the}} trench.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E

25|$|CIDNP was {{discovered}} in 1967 by Bargon and Fischer, and, independently, by Ward and Lawler. Early theories were based on dynamic nuclear polarisation (hence the name). The subsequent experiments, however, have found <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> DNP fails to explain CIDNP polarization phase. In 1969 an alternative explanation was proposed by Closs, and, independently, by Kaptein and Oosterhoff, which relied {{on the ability of}} nuclear spin interactions to alter the recombination probability in reactions that proceed through radical pairs. This mechanism, known as the Radical Pair Mechanism is currently accepted as {{the most common cause of}} CIDNP. There are, however, exceptions, and the DNP mechanism was found to be operational, for example, in many fluorine-containing radicals.|$|E
