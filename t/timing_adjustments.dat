Earlier psychological studies have suggested that the response selection and <b>timing</b> <b>adjustment</b> processes are per-formed serially in separate stages.

The subjects performed a choice reaction time task in four conditions: two (on-line response selection required or not) by two (on-line <b>timing</b> <b>adjustment</b> required or not). We found that the neural correlates for the two processes were indeed separate: the anterior medial premotor cortex (presupplementary motor area) was selectively active in response selection, whereas the cer-ebellar posterior lobe was selectively active in timing adjust-ment.

40|$|In this contribution, {{a design}} space {{exploration}} of the various possible schemes for alldigital symbol <b>timing</b> <b>adjustment</b> of QAM signals is made. The exploration is guided by both performance degradation and implementation cost considerations. The BER performance degradation is obtained using a quasianalytic simulation approach, while the implementation cost is estimated by high level digital circuit synthesis. The results show that a good performance/implementation tradeoff is obtained by using baseband interpolation with an oversampling factor of three and adequate compensation. This <b>timing</b> <b>adjustment</b> circuit is now being applied {{in the design of}} a digital downstream CATV QAM receiver. 1 Introduction Currently, digital modems for broadband communication over coaxial or twisted pair access networks are of major interest.

Early models with the 1,592 cc engine had twin single Zenith downdraught carburettors - later 1,592/1,725 cc engines used a Solex twin choke downdraught carburettor for simplicity.

Other modifications included a water-jacketed inlet manifold, <b>timing</b> <b>adjustments</b> and stronger valve springs to eliminate valve bounce at high engine speeds. The later H120's [...] engine is a straight swap for both of these units and looks almost identical - it provides a useful boost in power to an already swift automobile. The unique Sceptre interior featured full instrumentation, including a tachometer marked up to 6,000 rpm, and a four-speed floor-mounted transmission with self-cancelling overdrive (with column-mounted control and indicator) on third and fourth gear {{for a total of}} six separate ratios in standard form. The lockout could be removed on first and second gears, and this was often done by Rootes in cars used for competitions such as rallying. In addition, the Sceptre was from the beginning provided with servo-assisted braking control and, unusually in 1963, 10-inch front disc-brakes. The Marks 1 and 1A were not available with an automatic option - although this was rectified with the Mark II cars, using a three-speed unit with automatic kick-down. This was a cheaper option than was usual at the time due to the deletion of the Laycock De Normanville overdrive fitted to the Manual cars.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 Sulfur free {{synthetic}} diesel fuels can {{be produced}} using Gas to Liquid (GTL) technology, and may prove useful {{as a substitute for}} conventional diesel fuels when oil reserves are depleted.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the manner in}} which tourists adjust travel behaviour in response to congestion. It differs from previous work because urban tripmakers have typically been the focus of similar research. A sample survey of domestic tourists travelling by car to Cornwall, a popular UK holiday destination, has been analysed and various factors that influence whether or not tourists avoid congestion have been hypothesised. These include: distance travelled to the holiday destination; number of previous visits; size and composition of the tourist group; anticipation of congestion and acquisition of information on congestion; the main priority in pre-trip planning; and whether a caravan was taken on holiday or not. Approximately 54 % of respondents took action to avoid congestion, commonly in the form of trip <b>timing</b> <b>adjustments</b> rather than route diversion.
