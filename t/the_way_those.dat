Everett's conclusions were met with skepticism from universalists who claimed that the linguistic deficit is explained by the lack of need for such concepts.|$|E

500|$|Around {{midnight on}} 4 November, Guy Fawkes was {{discovered}} guarding the gunpowder the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords, and arrested. [...] Those conspirators still in London soon took flight for the Midlands, finding along <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>those</b> {{who had already}} left {{to prepare for the}} planned uprising. [...] They met Digby and his party at Dunchurch. [...] Catesby told Digby that the king and Salisbury were dead, and [...] "if true Catholics would now stir, he doubted not that they might procure to themselves good conditions". [...] Digby was won over, but many of his party were less than impressed at being so badly deceived, and worse, being associated with treason. [...] One of his servants asked Digby what would happen to them; Digby told him that although he was aware of their ignorance, [...] "but now there is no remedy".|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two stars {{out of four}} and asked about the title character, [...] "Why should I care about this guy? He feels no pain and nothing can kill him, so {{therefore}} he's essentially a story device for action sequences." [...] James Berardinelli gave Wolverine {{two and a half}} stars out of four, calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable, and considering that when dealing with Wolverine's past [...] "there's little creativity evident in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>those</b> blanks are filled in", and that the revelations made Wolverine [...] "less compelling". Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC's Filmcritic.com website gave the film a positive [...] "4.0 out of 5 stars," [...] saying that although Hugh Jackman is [...] "capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X-Men Origins: Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season." [...] He predicted [...] "there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology;" [...] and further said that [...] "any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can't really seal the full entertainment deal." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with multiple}} critics lauding {{the performances of}} actors Anna Torv and John Noble. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote this his [...] "mind was blown not once, but twice" [...] due to the many revelations about two universes; Fringe [...] "has vaulted to {{the upper reaches of}} current television". In a second review, Tucker praised the [...] "beautifully, startlingly executed" [...] special effects when the [...] "hole" [...] in the universe closed. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A, and felt the episode made him {{want to go back and}} rewatch season one because the finale had [...] "so many references and back story nods that I wanted to have everything in my head together". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale [...] "leads to a wealth of possibilities... The déjà universe was a bold move. I can’t wait to see what our friends at Fringe do with it". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the [...] "excellent" [...] episode, and complimented [...] "the quietly creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension in the dual Walter/Olivia stories, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>those</b> stories were skillfully woven together, the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia, Peter and Mr. Jones".|$|E

2500|$|Dyson {{says his}} views on global warming have been {{strongly}} criticized.

2500|$|Another {{technique}} Seitz {{used was}} [...] "venetian blind" [...] lighting which almost gives {{the illusion of}} prison bars trapping the characters. Barbara Stanwyck later reflected, [...] "...and for an actress, {{let me tell you}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>those</b> sets were lit, the house, Walter’s apartment, those dark shadows, those slices of harsh light at strange angles – all that helped my performance.

2500|$|Once an {{instrumental}} track was completed, vocals {{would then be}} overdubbed by the group. Carl said about the Beach Boys' vocal arrangements: [...] "Our vocals were voiced like horn parts, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>those</b> R records make background vocals sound like a sax section. It sounded big, because the four parts were all within the same octave; {{that was really the}} secret. He used a lot of counterpoint, a lot of layered sound; it had a real depth to it.

2500|$|According to the Slakan writer F. Plitplov, [...] "the plot of Vedontakal Vrop is so laughable {{that no one}} {{can fail}} to take a delight in its immense confusions." [...] Its {{characters}} include a magician (in some opinions an apothecary), a student disguised as an old man, a girl disguised as a soldier, a servant who is turned into a bear, servants of a Shah and villagers with a large cake.
