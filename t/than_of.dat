5|$|After Hitler {{took control}} in Germany in 1933, Borah thought {{well of the}} new chancellor's {{repudiation}} of the war guilt and other clauses of the Versailles treaty, and saw much of value in his new social and economic programs. But he was utterly disgusted and alienated by the Nazi treatment of the Jews. This did not initially lead him {{to speak out against}} Nazi Germany, though many urged him to do so, as he felt that each nation had the right to run its own affairs. Borah opposed large-scale immigration by Jews from Germany, feeling that was impractical with millions of Americans unemployed. By 1938, Borah was speaking out against the continued persecutions, but still felt that the European issue could be settled if Germany's former colonies were returned. After the Munich Conference in September 1938, Borah issued a statement far more critical of Britain and France for deceiving Czechoslovakia into dismemberment, <b>than</b> <b>of</b> Germany for her aggression.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010 {{there are}} no indisputable body fossils of phoronids. There is good {{evidence}} that phoronids created trace fossils found in the Silurian, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and possibly in the Ordovician and Triassic. Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) have collectively been called lophophorates, because all use lophophores to feed. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and morphological features placed lophophorates among or as a sister group to the deuterostomes, a super-phylum which includes chordates and echinoderms. While a minority adhere to this view, most researchers now regard phoronids {{as members of the}} protostome super-phylum Lophotrochozoa. Although analysts using molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other <b>than</b> <b>of</b> non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. Some analyses regard phoronids and brachiopods as sister-groups, while others place phoronids as a sub-group within brachiopoda.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. The {{single most important}} factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the most}} stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher <b>than</b> <b>of</b> Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather <b>than</b> <b>of</b> kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the adult}} fish, the four {{chambers}} are not {{arranged in a}} straight row but, instead form an S-shape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two.

The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Griffiths {{focused on the}} {{inconsistent}} portrayal of Horus and Set as brothers and as uncle and nephew. He argued that, {{in the early stages}} of Egyptian mythology, the struggle between Horus and Set as siblings and equals was originally separate from the murder of Osiris. The two stories were joined into the single Osiris myth sometime before the writing of the Pyramid Texts. With this merging, the genealogy of the deities involved and the characterization of the Horus–Set conflict were altered so that Horus is the son and heir avenging Osiris's death. Traces of the independent traditions remained in the conflicting characterizations of the combatants' relationship and in texts unrelated to the Osiris myth, which make Horus the son of the goddess Nut or the goddess Hathor rather <b>than</b> <b>of</b> Isis and Osiris. Griffiths therefore rejected the possibility that Osiris's murder was rooted in historical events. This hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as Jan Assmann and George Hart.|$|E

He said he had sworn an oath to the Scottish King, and held of him more lands <b>than</b> <b>of</b> the Norwegian Monarch; he therefore entreated King Haco to dispose of all those estates which he had conferred upon him. King Haco kept him with him some time, and endeavoured to incline his mind to fidelity. Many laid imputations to his charge. King Haco indeed had before received bad accounts of him from the Hebrides; for John Langlife-son came to the King, while he was sailing west from Shetland, and told him the news that John King of the Hebrides, breaking his faith, had turned to the Scottish Monarch. King Haco, however, would not believe this till he had found it so.|$|E

Methods: Cardiomyocytes of SD rats 1 to 2 days after birth were cultured and divided into NC group (no special treatment), HR group (hypoxia reoxygenation processing) and S group (hypoxia reoxygenation after sevoflurane preconditioning). Myocardial cell injury indexes, mitochondrial pathway apoptosis indexes and oxidative stress indicators were detected. Result: (1) Myocardial injury indexes: myocardial cell apoptosis rate {{as well as}} CK, CK-MB, AST and LDH levels in cell culture medium of HR group were significantly higher <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> NC group, and myocardial cell apoptosis rate as well as CK, CK-MB, AST and LDH levels in cell culture medium of S group were significantly lower <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> HR group; (2) mitochondrial pathway apoptosis indexes: Bcl- 2, Cx 43 and Omi/HtrA 2 contents in mitochondria of HR group were lower <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> NC group, {{and the content of}} Bax was higher <b>than</b> that <b>of</b> NC group; the contents of cytochrome C and Omi/HtrA 2 in cytoplasm were higher <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> NC group, and the content of Cx 43 was lower <b>than</b> that <b>of</b> NC group; the contents of Bcl- 2, Cx 43 and Omi/HtrA 2 in mitochondria of S group were higher <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> HR group, and the content of Bax was lower <b>than</b> that <b>of</b> HR group; the contents of cytochrome C and Omi/ HtrA 2 in cytoplasm were lower <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> HR group, and the content of Cx 43 was higher <b>than</b> that <b>of</b> HR group; (3) oxidative stress indexes: the contents of ROS and MDA in cells of HR group were higher <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> NC group, and the contents of SOD, GSH-Px, VitC and VitE were lower <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> NC group; the contents of ROS and MDA in cells of S group were lower <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> HR group, and the contents of SOD, GSH-Px, VitC and VitE were higher <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> HR group.
