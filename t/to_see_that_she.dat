25|$|Sam Lowry is a {{low-level}} government employee who frequently daydreams of saving a damsel in distress. When a fly gets jammed in a printer {{and results in}} the incarceration and accidental death during interrogation of cobbler Archibald Buttle – instead of renegade air conditioning specialist and suspected terrorist Archibald Tuttle – Sam is assigned the task of rectifying the error. Visiting Buttle's widow, Sam encounters their neighbour Jill Layton, and is astonished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> resembles the woman from his recurring dreams. Jill {{is trying to help}} Mrs. Buttle determine what happened to her husband, but her efforts are obstructed by bureaucracy. Unknown to her, she is now considered a terrorist accomplice of Tuttle for attempting to report the mistake of Buttle's arrest. Sam approaches Jill, but she avoids giving him full details, worried the government will track her down.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 2008, Zach is in {{the process}} of looking for Kendall buried under rubble due to a tornado having just struck Pine Valley. He finds Bianca instead, and is {{surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is pregnant. He later finds an unconscious Kendall. As an ambulance arrives for her, it is stated that there is not enough room for Bianca and Zach to ride along to the hospital. There is, however, enough room for Zach and Kendall's children to ride in the front seat of the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall's fate. They also discuss Bianca's secret that she is pregnant with Zach's child via sperm donation, and Bianca's new lover named Reese. Zach had agreed to father Bianca's child for the couple, but did not know that she had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor. Zach helps deliver the new child into the world.|$|E

500|$|It is {{uncertain}} if the Stevens-Smith relationship was romantic. [...] The Democratic press, {{especially in the}} South, assumed so, and when he brought Mrs. Smith to Washington in 1859, where she managed his household, that did nothing to stop their insinuations. [...] In the one brief surviving letter from Stevens to her, Stevens addresses her as Mrs. Lydia Smith. Stevens insisted that his nieces and nephews refer to her as Mrs. Smith, deference towards an African-American servant almost unheard of at that time. [...] They do so in surviving letters, warmly, asking Stevens <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> comes with him next time he visits.|$|E

Thyagu simply laughs {{and says that}} she is already back, after which Manju {{seems to have a}} change of heart and starts courting Thyagu. Arun is devastated <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{has turned out to be}} just the sort of woman that Thyagu earlier said she was [...] opportunistic, money-minded, and fickle. When he asks her about her contradicting stands in life, she responds by saying that is the way she is and will be.|$|E

500|$|The {{essential}} {{idea here}} is intuitive and probably qualifies as folk wisdom. [...] It was articulated by Kurt Vonnegut in his 1961 short story Harrison Bergeron. In Vonnegut’s futuristic dystopia, the Handicapper General uses {{a variety of}} handicapping mechanisms to reduce inequalities in performance. [...] A spectator at a ballet comments: [...] "it was easy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was the strongest and most graceful of all dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two hundred pound men." [...] Zahavi interpreted this analogy to mean that higher quality peacocks with bigger tails are signalling their ability to [...] "waste" [...] more of some resource by trading it off for a bigger tail. This resonates with Thorstein Veblen's idea that conspicuous consumption and extravagant status symbols can signal wealth.|$|E
500|$|From {{the outset}} of the marriage, {{political}} members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the Liberal Party. As a hereditary peer, he already had a seat in the House of Lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. Lord Granville in fact considered Rosebery's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her [...] "If you keep him up to the mark, [...] is sure to have his page in history." [...] The subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his [...] "page in history" [...] was to become her [...] Rosebery's secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: [...] "She is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to Lord Rosebery, it is easy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is very proud of him, and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career." [...] Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact [...] "his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against." [...] However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace House of Commons debate. On a tour of America before his marriage, Rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates; in Britain little had changed in that respect since the hustings of the 18th century. He realised how an electorate could be swayed by a candidate touring his prospective constituency, aided by a well thought-out series of events, rallies and advertising, with the candidate's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side. Thus Lady Rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side. In this way it could be said she was the first openly [...] "political wife" [...] in Britain.|$|E

When she shows up to the bar with her co-workers, Barney is excited <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and all her friends are pharmaceutical representatives, which he calls the [...] "hot-chick" [...] profession of their generation (like the nurse or stewardess was in the past).

2500|$|James Boswell, diarist and biographer of Samuel Johnson, was a {{guest at}} Kirroughtree House in October 1762. Boswell {{described}} his host, young Patrick Heron, as [...] "sensible, genteel, well-bred, has an uncommon good temper, and, at the same time, has all the spirit that becomes a man". [...] Patrick married a cousin of James Boswell, Elizabeth Cochrane, in 1775 after divorcing his first wife, Jean Home, the daughter of Henry Home, Lord Kames, for adultery with a young officer. Jean Home may have had other affairs, including with Boswell himself, as Boswell wrote [...] "I loved {{the daughter of a}} man of the first distinction in Scotland. She married a gentleman of great wealth. She allowed me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> love me more than she did her husband. She made no difficulty of granting me all.... She said, [...] "I love my husband as a husband, and you as a lover, each in his own sphere.... Nature has so made me that I shall never bear children. No one suffers from our loves."".|$|E
2500|$|Kristian Bruun as Donnie Hendrix (né Chubbs), {{husband to}} Alison Hendrix. He was once Alison's monitor, working for Dyad. His and Alison's {{marriage}} was strained {{for a long}} time, especially after Alison cornered him and tortured him {{to find out if}} he was a monitor or not. He lied, and they reconciled. However, she then found out the truth: that he really was a monitor but was unaware of his true purpose and that Alison was a clone. He then cornered his boss, Dr. Leekie, in his car and killed him with an accidental pistol shot to the head. He fled back to Alison, begging her to help him do away with the body. They buried Leekie under their garage. This [...] "bonding" [...] helped to jump-start their relationship, giving it newfound passion, trust, and happiness. In season 3, he got fired after telling his boss Susan Teller that she was a bitch, something he found [...] "frickin' glorious". He and Alison later briefly sold drugs for Pouchie, and got the Hendrix family soap store Bubbles from Ali's mother. Helena comes to live with them, and Donnie comes <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> means well; he even helps find her boyfriend as a [...] "thank you" [...] present. After Pouchie's niece threatens Oscar and Gemma, Donnie is left with all the drug lord's money after Helena murders them to protect the children. (recurring seasons 1–2; regular season 3–5) ...|$|E
