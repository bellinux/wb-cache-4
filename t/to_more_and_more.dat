5|$|The cantata text {{does not}} tell a story but {{reflects}} {{different aspects of the}} Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> personal and intimate reflection.|$|E
5|$|Some of the translators {{hired to}} work on the books were {{well-known}} authors before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. The Turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator. For reasons of secrecy, translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English, leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available. This led <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} the band were {{listening}} <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> hip hop (Run DMC, Public Enemy and The Beastie Boys) as well as music from a new emerging movement of sample-heavy dance records (The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu, MARRS, S'Express and Bomb The Bass).|$|E

There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been so lucky that we've never had to do that. Part of it was because of our own tenacity, and part of it was because we were lucky.|$|R
25|$|In {{the years}} after the war, as {{automobile}} access to the region from the city increased {{with the opening of}} first the Taconic State Parkway and then Interstate 684, Lake Carmel became one of the earliest exurbs, home <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> people year-round.

25|$|The current Hullabahoos logo {{was drawn}} in fall 2003 by Morgan Anderson, {{a student at}} Williams College, to promote the Hullabahoos' visit to her college. The poster was later scanned into a {{computer}} and emailed from a girlfriend in Massachusetts to her boyfriend in Virginia, and it slowly crept its way on <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> Hullabahoos' paraphernalia, gradually overtaking the traditional but less distinctive Uppercase H logo.|$|E
25|$|The {{decomposition}} process itself {{is called a}} Fourier transformation. Its output, the Fourier transform, is often given a more specific name, which depends on the domain and other properties of the function being transformed. Moreover, the original concept of Fourier analysis has been extended over time to apply <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> abstract and general situations, and the general field is often known as harmonic analysis. Each transform used for analysis (see list of Fourier-related transforms) has a corresponding inverse transform {{that can be used}} for synthesis.|$|E

25|$|Violent {{crime is}} limited, but increasing, and public {{perception}} associates this with returns of ethnic Tongans {{who have been}} raised overseas. A few notable cases involve young men raised since infancy in the USA, whose family neglected to obtain citizenship for them and who were deported on involvement with the American justice system. At this moment crime increases faster than the police force and will remain a serious problem for the years to come. Increasing wealth has also increased {{the gap between the}} rich and the poor, leading <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> burglaries.|$|E
25|$|Although Sun Rui is {{well-known}} within the dance communities and {{small groups of}} dance fans, his name was not familiar to the audience for long time. In Jan of 2009, he {{was chosen as the}} lead dancer of the dance 'Butterfly Love for Flowers' (蝶恋花) in the CCTV Spring Festival Gala. His performance showed the life of a butterfly and its love for flowers. 'Butterfly Love for Flowers' was later voted by the national audience as 'My Favorite Dancing and Singing Show' of the CCTV Spring Festival Gala 09. Since then, his popularity expands from the dance communities and dance fans <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> Chinese audience.|$|E
25|$|A {{by-election}} {{was held}} in the Mudukulathur assembly constituency on 1 July 1957, as Thevar had resigned from his assembly seat. The election was won by D.V. Sasivarna Thevar of the Forward Bloc. The situation in the area was tense on the day that the results were released, and there was a sizeable presence of police forces in place. Clashes between Maravars, who largely supported the Forward Bloc, and pro-Congress Devendrars began in a few villages soon after the election result was acknowledged. Gradually the violence spread <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> villages, and by August the riots had spread throughout the entire district. Several persons were killed and thousands of houses were torched.|$|E

500|$|Although {{limiting}} his own jurisdiction, in 1342 voivode Thomas Szécsényi {{recognized the}} right of Transylvanian noblemen to judge legal cases of peasants owning parcels in their estates, [...] "with the exception of three cases, such as robbery, highway robbery, and violent trespass". This concession was confirmed in 1365 by King Louis I of Hungary. Furthermore, the monarchs granted jus gladii (the right to the application of capital punishment) <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> nobles {{in the course of}} the same century.|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} Victor and Cora read Witchcraft Today, a 1954 book by English Wiccan Gerald Gardner, with Cora {{claiming}} that Victor corresponded with Gardner for a time.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the decade, {{computers}} spread <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> companies and institutions, even as they became more powerful—by 1971, it is estimated that there were over 1000 computers with monitors, rather than the few dozen {{at the beginning of the}} 1960s. While different computers could generally not run the same programs without significant changes to the programs' code, due to differences in the physical hardware or machine languages, the expansion of the computing industry led to the creation of catalogs and user groups to share programs between different installations of the same series of computers, such as DEC's PDP line. These catalogs and groups, such as the IBM program catalog and the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society (DECUS), shared small games as well as programs, including, for example, [...] "BBC Vik The Baseball Demonstrator" [...] and [...] "Three Dimensional Tic-Tack-Toe" [...] in the April 1962 IBM catalog, and dice games and question and answer games in the DECUS newsletter.|$|E

2500|$|Starting {{with intense}} light at {{two or more}} equally spaced frequencies, this process can {{generate}} light at more and more different equally spaced frequencies.
