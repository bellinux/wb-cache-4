5|$|Some {{of these}} sources may {{originally}} have been oral works. A number of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> the narrative {{parts of the}} Liber resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King Cnut visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It {{is possible that the}} information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from orally transmitted tales that were written down.|$|E
5|$|Stories of mythical Orcadian demons are {{recorded}} in the 16th-century Latin manuscripts of Jo Ben, {{who may have been}} referring to the nuckelavee in his description of the Orkney island of Stronsay. Dennison transcribed much of the information available about traditional tales told on Orkney, but to an extent romanticised and systematically altered certain elements of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> the process of transforming them into prose.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian {{literary}} scholar Ajip Rosidi {{writes that}} the vast majority of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> Kawan Bergeloet are meant as comedy. He considers only one story—"Piloe"—to have been intended as more serious or sad. Several of the stories use tropes previously seen in Kasim's Teman Doedoek, such as conflict arising from a misunderstanding, and the contents of some other stories are similar.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{tried to}} {{demonstrate}} that <b>the</b> resurrection <b>story</b> <b>in</b> Secret Mark does not contain any of the secondary traits found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parallel <b>story</b> <b>in</b> John 11, and that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> John 11 is more theologically developed. He concluded that the Secret Mark version of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> contains an older, independent, and more reliable witness to the oral tradition.|$|R

2500|$|Polish {{historian}} Kazimierz Chodynicki was {{the first}} to critically evaluate <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> 1927. He noted clear similarities between <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bychowiec Chronicle and <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of two Franciscan martyrs first recorded in the Chronica XXIV Generalium, a Franciscan chronicle written around 1370, and repeated in Memoriale Ordinis Fratrum Minorum by Jan Komorowski. According to Chronica, two Czech friars, Ulrich and Martin, were murdered by Grand Duke Gediminas probably around 1341. One was tortured and murdered, another was tossed into the river to [...] "float back to where he came from". Chodynicki concluded that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bychowiec Chronicle {{is nothing more than a}} fanciful embellishment of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> Chronica and this conclusion was widely accepted. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> from Chronica is accepted by historians as authentic as the chronicle was produced within living memory of the events.|$|R
5|$|To {{commemorate the}} twentieth season, <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> this season involve {{the return of}} {{previous}} villains. Mawdryn Undead, Terminus and Enlightenment involve the Black Guardian's plot to kill the Doctor; they were released individually on VHS and as a set on DVD as parts of The Black Guardian Trilogy. This season was broadcast twice weekly on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings on BBC1.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, she {{published}} {{a collection of}} her short stories, The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories (2006). Both Clarke's novel and her short stories are set in a magical England and written in a pastiche of the styles of 19th-century writers such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. While Strange focuses {{on the relationship of}} two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic.|$|E
5|$|Benn's mother, Margaret Wedgwood Benn (née Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, {{feminist and}} the founder President of the Congregational Federation. She {{was a member of}} the League of the Church Militant, which was the {{predecessor}} of the Movement for the Ordination of Women; in 1925, she was rebuked by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating the ordination of women. His mother's theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she taught him that <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> the Bible were based around the struggle between the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught righteousness.|$|E

5|$|Image Entertainment {{released}} {{the film in}} both the English and Italian versions on DVD on August 1, 2000. Kino {{released the}} film on Blu-ray and DVD on July 16, 2013. Kino's edition of the film was mastered in high definition from the 35mm negative with the Italian language dub and original soundtrack. Arrow Films released Black Sabbath on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013. Arrow's transfer of the Italian version was from an original 35mm internegative print transferred in Italy that had additional grading and restoration done in London. Arrow's version of the American version of Black Sabbath was made from an 35mm interpositive in California. Arrow noted the high definition master they received from Italy {{was very difficult to}} restore as the master had issues with the image, sound and color quality and had <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> the wrong order.|$|E

Other collections for the spin-off Special Missions and assorted Annuals also appeared. In November 2012, IDW restarted their reprint series with the hardcover G.I. JOE: The Complete Collection, Vol. 1, intending to reprint all <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> reading order. IDW also revived the original G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero as an ongoing series in 2010, with a special #155½ issue released on Free Comic Book Day, followed by issue #156 onwards in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|In Brood War, the Dominion is {{invaded by}} the United Earth Directorate and Mengsk {{narrowly}} escapes capture with the reluctant help of Raynor. Faced with execution {{and the destruction}} of the Dominion as alternatives, Mengsk allies with Kerrigan and Raynor to defeat the UED, but Kerrigan eventually betrays their alliance and delivers a crippling blow to Mengsk's forces. Nevertheless, Mengsk rebuilds and the Dominion remains the dominant Terran power. In Frontline, many of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> the anthology paint Mengsk and the Dominion overall as tyrannical and corrupt, no different from the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|The Talyllyn Railway is {{represented}} in The Railway Series books by the Reverend W. Awdry and the spin-off TV series Thomas & Friends as the Skarloey Railway; most of the fictional locomotives are based on real-life equivalents. Awdry visited the line on a family holiday {{in the early days}} of preservation and became involved as a volunteer soon afterwards. Several of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> The Railway Series come from his real-life experiences at the Talyllyn, and some of the books contain full-page illustrations of Talyllyn locomotives.|$|E
5|$|The {{title was}} {{released}} in place of an aborted attempt to port the 2006 game Sonic the Hedgehog to the Wii. Producer Yojiro Ogawa conceived Secret Rings {{to tap into the}} Wii Remote's capabilities. He chose the theme of Arabian Nights, using many elements of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> the game's setting, characters, and Middle Eastern-influenced music. Sega changed the title of the game several times, originally being announced as Sonic Wild Fire, before settling on Sonic and the Secret Rings to tie in the theme of Arabian Nights.|$|E
5|$|Three {{volumes of}} albums titled Maria-sama ga Miteru: Haru Image Album {{containing}} image songs and background music tracks were released between April and September 2005. Each image album {{was assigned to}} one of the three families of roses; the songs were sung by the voice actors of the anime series. A vocal album titled Christmas Album was released in December 2008. Shueisha produced 12 drama CDs between January 14, 2004 and December 14, 2007, and Frontier Works produced three additional drama CDs between July 24, 2009 and July 22, 2010; the CDs use the same voice actors from the anime series. The drama CDs are based on <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> the novels. The fifth and tenth drama CDs by Shueisha were released in limited edition versions each with a slipcase and a pair of character mini-figures.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> most of Sherlock Holmes novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team has {{assumed the role of}} Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She has said that {{the difference between the two}} characters is that Wilson finds it hard to say no because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson was also one of the reasons that made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E
