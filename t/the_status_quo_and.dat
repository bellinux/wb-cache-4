5|$|As {{with many}} post-Soviet states, {{the change in}} writing system and the debates {{surrounding}} it is closely intertwined with political themes. Although not having been used since the adoption of Cyrillic, the Latin script is supported by {{those who wish to}} bring the country closer to Uzbekistan, which has adopted the Latin-based Uzbek alphabet. The Persian alphabet is supported by the devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those who wish to bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by those who wish to maintain <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo,</b> <b>and</b> not distance the country from Russia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed to maintain <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>and</b> believed that her country's military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on their terms. Egypt, on the other hand, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the {{government}} was required to coin under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo,</b> <b>and</b> a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in Congress for a strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>and</b> allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea a repudiation of the nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E
5|$|Last Exile {{is set on}} {{the fictional}} world of Prester. Prester's two nations of Anatoray and Disith are {{separated}} by a turbulent region of the sky known as the Grand Stream and are engaged in eternal conflict according to the code of chivalric warfare. A superior faction known as the Guild enforces these rules. It also provides the two nations with technology but, unknown to them, has dishonorable intentions, to preserve <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>and</b> enforce its dominance of both sides. Although the story {{is set in the}} future, the technology employed differs from that in a typical space opera. Instead, the show's retro-futuristic dieselpunk setting resembles nineteenth-century Europe {{at the height of the}} Industrial Revolution. Inhabitants of Prester operate aerial vehicles known as vanships in the world's Golden Age of Aviation; although the technology is primitive, the aerial vehicles use a form of antigravity (developed by the Guild) and lighter-than-air methods of flight rather than the use of wings.|$|E
5|$|Since the Bronze Age of Comics, the Joker {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as an archetypal trickster, displaying talents for cunning intelligence, social engineering, pranks, theatricality, and idiomatic humor. Like the trickster, the Joker alternates between malicious violence and clever, harmless whimsy. He is amoral and not driven by ethical considerations, but by a shameless and insatiable nature, and although his actions are condemned as evil, he is necessary for cultural robustness. The trickster employs amoral and immoral acts to destabilize <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>and</b> reveal cultural, political, and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore. However, the Joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself. The Joker possesses abnormal body imagery, reflecting an inversion of order. The trickster is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman, a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind. In Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker serves as Batman's trickster guide through the hero's own psyche, testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the Asylum to Batman.|$|E

5|$|To face these insurgencies, al-Ma'mun {{turned to}} another of Tahir's sons, Abdallah ibn Tahir, {{to whom he}} {{entrusted}} the command of his army. Ibn Tahir first targeted Nasr ibn Shabath in northern Syria and the Jazira. Nasr was willing to acknowledge al-Ma'mun's authority, but demanded concessions for his followers and remained hostile to the Abbasids' Persian officials, so {{that he had to}} be browbeaten into submission by a show of force before his capital, Kaysum, in 824–825. After securing his northern flank, Ibn Tahir marched through Syria into Egypt. There the two rivals, although not opposed in principle to al-Ma'mun as Caliph, were eager to maintain <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo,</b> <b>and</b> had already repulsed an invasion in 824 under Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mazyad. Ibn Tahir however managed to outmanoeuvre both, so that Ali al-Jarawi quickly went over to him, leaving Ubayd Allah to submit and face deportation to Baghdad. In Alexandria, Ibn Tahir secured the departure of the Andalusians, who left the city for the Byzantine island of Crete, which they conquered and transformed into a Muslim emirate. On his return to Baghdad in 827, Abdallah ibn Tahir received a triumphal reception, and was appointed governor of Khurasan in 828, replacing Talha. His place in the west was taken over by al-Ma'mun's younger brother Abu Ishaq al-Mu'tasim. In Yemen, another Alid revolt broke out in 822 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Ahmad, but al-Ma'mun managed to secure his surrender by negotiations.|$|E

25|$|A radical weekly {{publication}} az-Zuhrah was openly {{critical of}} French policy, and ran from 1890 until suppressed in 1897. Another periodical uneasy with <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>and</b> terminated by French authorities was Sabil al-Rashad, 1895–1897. It {{was published by}} 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Tha'alibi, who was educated at Zaytuna.

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Napoleon, Joachim Murat, who had succeeded Joseph Bonaparte as king of Naples in 1808, was dethroned in the Neapolitan War, and Ferdinand {{returned}} to Naples.

He in the end ruled in favour of Laud, but only after some intrigue: Bilson had difficulty in having his jurisdiction recognised by the group of Laud's activists, led unscrupulously by William Juxon.
