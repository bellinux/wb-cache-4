5000|$|Dynix was {{originally}} developed around the ADDS Viewpoint A2 terminal's escape sequences, because ADDS terminals were {{the de facto}} standard on the PICK-based mainframes on which Dynix was created. Shortly after Dynix started being deployed to libraries around the country, requests started coming back that alternate terminals be provided for patron use; children would bang on the keyboards or throw books at the terminals, or use unauthorized key sequences to mess up the programming. In response, Dynix asked Wyse to develop such a terminal; Wyse created the WY-30, which was a stripped-down version of the best-selling terminal ever made, the WY-60. The <b>swivel</b> <b>base</b> was removed so that the terminal sat flat on whatever surface it was placed on; what the unit now lacked in viewing-angle adjustability, it made up for in physical stability (it could not be knocked over {{by the force of}} a child). A specially-designed keyboard reduced the number of keys from 101 to 83, mainly by removing all the function keys; this was designed to keep users out of the internal setup functions {{and other parts of the}} software they [...] "weren't supposed to be going". To maintain compatibility with how Dynix was already written, the WY-30 supported the Adds Viewpoint A2 emulation, which was actually one of the only emulations on the terminal. They WY-30 had very few emulations compared to most Wyse products, and notably did not support VT100 or any other ANSI emulations. Years later, when the Dynix company was moving from Ultimate computers running Pick/OS to IBM computers running AIX and uniVerse, compatibility for VT100/102/340 terminals was added to the software; then, other models of Wyse terminal started coming into favor, such as the WY-60 and WY-150, which were easier on the eyes and hands than the WY-30 was.|$|R

Eames Demetrios, {{the grandson of}} designer Charles Eames, published a documentary film on the manufacturing process called [...] "77 Steps." [...] Many believe the chair is cast from a single form, but it is actually welded together from 12 pieces. Sheets of aluminum are rolled into tubes, cut to length, and bent into shapes on large hydraulic machines. Various notches and punchouts are made so pieces can fit together before welding.

The chair goes through a repeated heating and cooling cycle that increases the strength of the aluminum. The chairs are also anodized. Originally <b>swivel</b> chair <b>bases</b> and other parts were purchased from a supplier, but in the 1950s, Emeco began purchasing manufacturing equipment to manufacture them in-house.|$|R
50|$|The {{main feature}} of the Shaker ladder-back chair was a tilting {{ball and socket joint}} {{mechanism}} installed {{on the bottom of the}} two rear legs to keep the leg bottoms level.Normally the inflection of the chair feet edges into wooden floors would cause deep scratches and into carpets would cause puncture tear holes. The ball joint mechanism idea would prevent unnecessary punctures and stress to the chair components because the chair feet were kept level and flat even though the chair was <b>tilted</b> back.Initially the <b>swivel</b> idea was developed using just wooden balls around 1834. It was later realized that this new concept for tilting caused major stress to the chair. More repair engineering work was required than initially foreseen. This was due to the weakening of the leg caused by drilling involved in installation of the wooden ball joint mechanism. Ultimately, the wooden ball concept was discarded and the production of this device ceased.|$|R

The 2 D/ 3 D images are first pre-processed. The pre-processing consists of noise filtering, registration, calibration and range gauging. The pre-processed image sequences are then plugged into a detection and tracking system to detect and track the moving objects in the robot workspace which is a dynamic pre-defined vision volume. The decision, if a person is endangered or not, is used to control the operation of the robot. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} "swiveled Renyi entropies" as {{an alternative}} to the Renyi entropic quantities put forward in [Berta et al., Phys. Rev. A 91, 022333 (2015) ]. What distinguishes the swiveled Renyi entropies from the prior proposal of Berta et al. is that there is an extra degree of freedom: an optimization over unitary rotations with respect to particular fixed <b>bases</b> (<b>swivels).</b> A consequence of this extra degree of freedom is that the swiveled Renyi entropies are ordered, which is an important property of the Renyi family of entropies. The swiveled Renyi entropies are however generally discontinuous at α= 1 and do not converge to the von Neumann entropy-based measures in the limit as α→ 1, instead bounding them from above and below. Particular variants reduce to known Renyi entropies, such as the Renyi relative entropy or the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy, but also lead to ordered Renyi conditional mutual informations and ordered Renyi generalizations of a relative entropy difference. Refinements of entropy inequalities such as monotonicity of quantum relative entropy and strong subadditivity follow as a consequence of the aforementioned properties of the swiveled Renyi entropies. Due to the lack of convergence at α= 1, it is unclear whether the swiveled Renyi entropies would be useful in one-shot information theory, so that the present contribution represents partial progress toward this goal.

40|$|Acceptance {{testing of}} the Turboprop Test Chamber was {{conducted}} during the weeks of 27 April and 4 May 1964. The tests were conducted by personnel from the Overhaul and Repair Department, Alameda Naval Air Station, from the Bureau of Naval Weapons Fleet Readiness Represent­ative, Pacific and from the USNPGS Department of Aeronautics. The power plant utilized for correlating purposes for a T- 56 -lOW turboprop engine, recently overhauled at NAS Alameda while the propeller was the Hamilton Standard model required for this engine. The test data reveal satisfactory correlation of the engine performance data with the Alameda test results. The discrepancies that do appear {{are the result of}} errors in the instrumentation system and do not present a major problem. All of the major facility systems function satisfactorily except the oil supply system and the chamber lighting fixtures. Engine starting and control systems were adequate although somewhat different from the designs utilized in the NAVWEPS specifica­tions for this engine. The engine support stand and thrust measuring assembly were found to be structurally sound and functioned satisfactorily. The propeller orifice assembly did not induce prohibitive vibrational stresses as was anticipated. However, the vibrational loads did cause the majority of the orifice retaining bolts to loosen during the test sequence. Three bolts were found beneath the test stand; these could have caused object damage to the engine. The major areas of discrepancy are the engine oil supply system and the test chamber lighting fixtures. The engine oil system as designed could not satisfy the requirements for the T- 56 series engine. It was necessary to re-route the oil by-pass system, to obtain a more precise control of the engine oil supply and pressure, and to provide a method to heat the oil for operation of the engine at high power set­tings. The system as temporarily modified, did function adequately during the test period. The lighting fixtures mounted on <b>swivel</b> joint <b>bases</b> oscillated vio­lently when operating the engine at Idle power. One fixture above the engine broke loose during this short period and was blown clear of the engine stand by the propeller air stream. All ceiling-mounted light fixtures were removed from the chamber before further engine operation. The acoustic survey revealed that the acoustic paneling in the in­ let and the exhaust passages functioned satisfactorily. However, the Sound Pressure Level reduction across the chamber front double-doors did not meet the specified limits. Corrective action is required to (1) provide adequate and safe lighting in the test chamber, (2) re-design and install an oil supply system compatible for operation with the T- 56 engine, and (3) provide positive locking devices on all bolted fixtures in the test chambers...|$|R
40|$|Tribus b. v. is {{a company}} in Utrecht that {{converts}} minibuses for multifunctional public transportation. This means that with the same bus both ambulant people and wheelchair occupants can be transported. The multifunctionality lies in {{the combination of a}} flexible floor layout and (tip) seats. The floor system is based on separate aluminium profiles that are assembled to form any desired floor layout. Tribus' tip seat FlexusPRO meets the highest quality and safety requirements. Because of its integrated three point safety belt, the seat can be positioned anywhere in the vehicle. A common seat layout is the 4 x 4 tip seats, where four FlexusPRO seats are positioned {{on the right side of}} the vehicle and four on the left. By folding the seat pan to the backrest and subsequently rotating the seat package to the side, a wheelchair environment is created without removing or repositioning the seat. This transformation from passenger seat (mode 1) to wheelchair space (mode 2) is an easy and fast operation that enables the transporter to do a combined transportation of ambulant people and wheelchair occupants with the same vehicle. Besides the benefits of Tribus' FlexusPRO, the tip seat also has some main drawbacks with respect to the production costs, weight, the available wheelchair space after seat transformation and the hindered view outside for the wheelchair occupant as a result of the seat dimensions in mode 2. The goal is to overcome these drawbacks, in order for Tribus to be able to launch a new tip seat that exceeds seats of competitors on price, weight, operation and functionality. The goal of this graduation project focuses on the improvements of the seat position in mode 2. This means an improvement of the transformation device, where the overall goal is to reduce the production costs and weight by at least 30 % and increase the view outside for the wheelchair occupant by at least 20 % in combination with an increased lateral wheelchair space of at least 10 %. However, in order to obtain a good design, a complete concept of the new tip seat needs to be proposed, where every aspect of the seat is able to fulfil the design requirements. A morphological approach resulted in three tip seat concepts that are rated with respect to usage and manufacturing aspects. The final concept led to a tip seat with a rotation device and a tilting backrest, that increases the lateral wheelchair space in mode 2. The improvement of the lateral wheelchair space is however dependent on the entire seat design, where the base frame of the seat will be leading. Because the base frame of the seat is not part of this project, a specific percentage of the improvement is not yet known, but an improvement of at least 10 % can be realized. The separate headrest of the seat is moved down during the transformation to mode 2, which improves the view outside for the wheelchair passenger. The entire seat design is also not part of this project, but research on commercial vehicles showed that a vertical adjustment of the headrest of 210 mm is possible, which would improve the view outside by approximately 33 %. The new seat concept is used as a guideline for the design of the two mechanisms that are needed for the transformation from mode 1 to mode 2. The tilting motion of the backrest resulted in a mechanism that provides a simultaneous movement of both backrest and seat pan. The benefit is that the additional (tilting) functionality of the seat had no effect on the amount of operations needed for the transformation. The mechanism is based on the over-centre principle of a toggle clamp. The system uses four pivot points that connects the backrest to both seat pan and seat frame. This innovative solution resulted in the fact that no additional locking devices where necessary to prevent the angular movement of the backrest in mode 1. The loads on the three point belt in the backrest, as a result of a frontal impact, are transferred into the mechanism which is only locked by the geometry of the backrest and seat pan. This mechanism prevents additional costs and weight as a result of the additional tilting functionality. Finally a new rotation device is designed. The use of a morphological approach resulted in four concepts. The best concept is elaborated, resulting in a new steel swivel of 3 kg, which is a weight reduction of 38 %. Because of the minimal amount of components, no welding operations and an easy and fast assembly, the cost price of the swivel is reduced by 47 %. Both <b>tilting</b> mechanism and <b>swivel</b> have been prototyped and they underlined the benefits that are mentioned in this report. The swivel has even been tested by a physical pull test and passed this test successfully. The goal of reducing the production costs and weight by at least 30 % has been exceeded on both aspects. The view outside for the wheelchair occupant could be improved by 33 %, which also exceeds the required 20 %. The required improvement of the lateral wheelchair space by 10 % can still be realized and will exceed this 10 % especially around the arms of the wheelchair occupant. The project has been a success and Tribus decided to continue the development of both mechanisms for series production.

40|$|The human arm {{including}} the shoulder, elbow, wrist joints and exclusion scapular motion has seven degrees of freedom(DOF) while positioning the wrist {{in space and}} orientating the palm is a task that requires six DOF. Given the redundant nature of the arm which has one more DOF than is needed to complete the task, multiple arm configurations {{can be used to}} complete a task based on none unique solution for the inverse kinematics. Despite this mathematical difficulty, the human motor control provides an unique solution for the arm redundancy as the arm moves in space. Resolving this redundancy is becoming critical as the human interacts with a wearable robotic system(exoskeleton) which includes the same redundancy as the human arm. Therefore, the inverse kinematics solution resolving the redundancy of these two coupled systems must be identical in order to guarantee a seamless integration. Creating a proper control scheme between a wearable robot and human arm starts from an understanding of the redundant nature of the human arm. The redundancy of the arm can be formulated kinematically by defining the swivel angle - the rotation angle of the plane {{including the}} upper and lower arm around a virtual axis connecting the shoulder and wrist joints fixed in space. Then a global exoskeleton robot control scheme targeted for the natural human robot interaction will be achieved by providing a robot with the precise swivel angle estimation for the given kinematic and dynamic states of the human arm. In order for this, we first study human motor control mechanism for the simple reaching and grasping tasks from a kinematic point of view. Analyzing reaching tasks recorded with a motion capture system indicates that the swivel angle, which defines the redundancy of the human arm, is selected such that when the elbow joint is flexed, the palm moves toward the head for any wrist position. Based on these experimental results, a new criterion to resolve the human arm redundancy is formed and this criterion is to maximize the projection of the longest principle axis of the manipulability ellipsoid for the human arm on the vector connecting the wrist and the virtual target on the head region. For more realistic and natural human arm movement, we additionally considered the redundancy based on the dynamic criterion which minimizes the mechanical work done in the joint space for each two consecutive points along the task space trajectory. The the swivel angles from the kinematic and dynamic criteria were linearly combined with different weight factors for the unified the swivel angle. Post processing of experimental data collected with a motion capturing system indicated that by using the proposed synthesis of redundancy resolution criteria, the error between the predicted swivel angle and the actual swivel angle adopted by the motor control system was less then five degrees. This result outperformed the prediction based on a single criteria and showed that the kinematic constraint is dominant in a simple reaching and grasping tasks that frequently occurs in our daily life. In order to define the redundancy resolution mechanism for more generalized human arm movement, the effect of the wrist orientation on the redundancy of the human arm was superimposed onto the wrist position <b>based</b> <b>swivel</b> angle estimation. By applying the above inverse kinematics mechanism mimicking the natural human arm movement to the wearable robot, wearer can expect the synchronized movement with robot for unconstrained natural human arm movements. Finally, to accommodate the unnatural movement pattern such as avoiding obstacle, purely reactive task space admittance control based on multiple force sensors is combined with the above control schemes for a global exoskeleton robot control scheme. Five subjects performed a peg in hole task for three different target locations to verify the performance of the proposed control scheme. The velocities and interaction forces at the upper arm, lower arm, handle and tip were recorded during the experiments. Power exchange between the subject and device was calculated for performance evaluation. Result shows that proposed control scheme outperforms purely reactive task space admittance control with energy exchange lowered by 11. 22 %. Based on the proposed exoskeleton control scheme, the exoskeleton robot is applied to the stroke patient rehabilitation research project as a clinical trial. In order for this, 3 -D video games directly interacting with the robotic system were designed and the assistive force mechanism for the patients was implemented in the exoskeleton robot. In addition a new metric called instantaneous efficiency(IE) was established to evaluate the therapeutic improvement. This metric is designed to reveal the degree of patient's improvement in terms of natural human arm movements by looking at the joint angle configuration, speed and frequency of using uncomfortable joints comprehensively. As their movements are getting closer to the natural human arm movement of normal people, the IE index increases. Ten subjects participated in this pilot research project either as an unilateral or a bilateral therapy group for six weeks. Results shows that even in a short six weeks rehabilitation program, patients' fugl-meyer scores as well as the efficiency index of the movements were significantly improved...|$|R
