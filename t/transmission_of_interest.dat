The goal of research is to show that this change in monetary policy is one important reason for expansions of the European debt crisis since 2010. Within this new monetary policy regime, interest rate levels on the one hand and the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rate policy measures to the interest rates of the other financial markets on the other hand, have become a very important role in central banking policies of today. For example to guarantee a sure and strict <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rate policy measures, which have its starting point on the short-term money market, and which should radiate to long-term interest rates on the capital market the ECB, if necessary, uses outright monetary transactions in secondary markets for sovereign bonds in the euro area. The main reason for acting in that manner is to avoid rising of long-term interest rates and to guarantee low levels of interest rate in the sovereign bonds markets. It is argued in {{the present paper}} that in focusing to guarantee low interest rate levels especially to overcome economic crisis you can find one important reason for expansions of the European debt crisis. This is so, because in view of current European economic policy rising interest rates in the European bonds markets above a level of 6 or 7 percent have become an unmistakeable proof of a severe debt problem...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Axonal {{transport}} {{is critical}} for maintaining synaptic <b>transmission.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>interest,</b> an-terograde and retrograde axonal transport appear to be interdependent, as perturbing one directional motor often impairs {{movement in the opposite}} direction. Here live imaging of Drosophila and hippocampal neuron dense-core vesicles (DCVs) containing a neuropeptide or brain-derived neurotrophic factor shows that the F-actin depolymerizing macrolide toxin my-calolide B (MB) rapidly and selectively abolishes retrograde, but not anterograde, transport in the axon and the nerve terminal. Latrunculin A does not mimic MB, demonstrating that F-actin depolymerization is not responsible for unidirectional transport inhibition. Given that dynactin initiates retrograde transport and that amino acid sequences implicated in macro-lide toxin binding are found in the dynactin component actin-related protein 1, we examined dynactin integrity. Remarkably, cell extract and purified protein experiments show that MB induces disassembly of the dynactin complex. Thus imaging selective retrograde transport inhibition led to the discovery of a small-molecule dynactin disruptor. The rapid unidirec-tional inhibition by MB suggests that dynactin is absolutely required for retrograde DCV transport but does not directly facilitate ongoing anterograde DCV transport in the axon or nerve terminal. More generally, MB’s effects bolster the conclusion that anterograde and retrograde axonal transport are not necessarily interdependent...|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} VAR {{literature on}} identification and {{measurement of the}} impact of monetary policy shocks on the real side of the economy is fairly comprehensive for developed economies but very limited for emerging and transition economies. In this study, we propose an identification scheme, for a developing economy taking India as a case study, which is able to capture the monetary transmission mechanism without giving rise to any empirical anomalies. We use a VAR approach with recursive contemporaneous restrictions and identify monetary policy shocks by modelling the reaction function of the central bank and structure of the economy. The effect of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate and other macroeconomic variables is consistent with the predictions of a broad set of theoretical models. This set-up is used to build a hypothetical case of inflation targeting where the monetary policy instrument is set after looking at the current values of inflation only. This is in contrast with the â€žmultiple indicator approachâ€Ÿ currently followed by Reserve Bank of India. This hypothetical scenario of inflation targeting suggests a sharper response of the interest rate (monetary policy instrument) to shocks and strengthening of the exchange rate channel in <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rate impulses.

30|$|An {{ensemble}} of nodes is synchronized {{in order to}} execute a collision-free communication schedule following a time-triggered paradigm [2]. The basic element of a time-triggered system is a global timebase that is distributed among the nodes through clock synchronization. In order to provide a common timebase we propose the application of Reachback Firefly Algorithm (RFA), which is a Firefly-inspired algorithm that works {{despite the limitations of}} current radio controllers, which are deaf to incoming transmissions while in sending mode. This deafness problem is mitigated by distributing the timing of light flashes in a given time window. Using the global timebase, communication activities are scheduled according to a predefined, periodic scheme. This simple but robust scheme enables the design of dependable distributed systems and simplifies system verification and diagnosis. Furthermore, the global synchronicity is used to enable synchronized sleep schedules in a wireless network cluster which can save a considerable amount of energy at each node. This is especially useful in situations with low duty-cycles, for example, a sensor network that is utilizing only a fraction of its available bandwidth. Due to the a priori known message schedule, the synchronized nodes are then able to predict the timing of incoming messages and can turn off their receivers when no <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> are scheduled. Since listening on the channel is a significant energy consumer of a typical wireless sensor node, the overall consumer power can thus be reduced in favor of battery lifetime. The global time can also support the application in tasks like timestamping, synchronous measurements, and timely coordinated distributed actions.|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates quantitatively the {{macroeconomic}} {{implications of}} corporate governance institutions within a model where {{the size and}} distribution of firms {{and the structure of}} financial markets are jointly determined. If firms adapt their financing modes to economic conditions, aggregate shocks change the aggregate composition of financing, which, in turn, is shown to be a key determinant of firm growth and aggregate volatility. We construct a search-theoretic stochastic dynamic general equilibrium model of security design with two distinguishing features: (i) firms’ decision to issue different types of securities, i. e. private (bank) versus public (bond) debt, is modeled explicitly as a dynamic choice between long-term imperfectly enforceable contracting regimes; (ii) bonds are an imperfect substitute for bank debt, since, while being more effective than bond holders at preventing managerial misconduct, banks face occasionally binding capital adequacy constraints imposed by prudential regulation. We derive a recursive characterization and show that bank and market lending co-exist in equilibrium. Plausibly calibrated numerical solutions reveal that capital adequacy requirements have sizable consequences for aggregate welfare. At the micro level, the model is consistent with the stylized fact that larger firms have a bigger share of securities in their financial structure (e. g. Petersen and Rajan, 1994). At the macro level, the model is consistent with key regularities of financial systems and the business cycle.

40|$|Recently, the {{political}} economy of macroeconomic policy choice has increasingly been guided by the simple prescriptions of the classic trilemma. For example, policymakers often speak of the hollowing out of exchange rate regimes in a world of unstoppable capital mobility; and policy autonomy and a fixed nominal anchor present an unpleasant dichotomy for emerging markets beset by the fear of floating. Yet the trilemma is not an uncontroversial maxim, and its empirical foundations deserve greater attention. Some authors (e. g., Calvo and Reinhart 2001, 2002) have argued that under the modern float there could be limited policy autonomy given the rapid international <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rate shocks; others (e. g., Bordo and Flandreau 2003) that even under the classical gold standard there actually was considerable policy autonomy given the gold point spread and the use of gold devices and other tricks. Such arguments turn the trilemma on its head. Resolving this debate is ult imately an empirical matter, where the broadest span of data should be scrutinized. Using new techniques to study the coherence of international interest rates at high frequency, in conjunction with an examination of capital mobility policies and a data-based classification of exchange rate regimes, we propose to look at the empirical content of the trilemma based on consistent data over 130 + years.
