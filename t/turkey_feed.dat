40|$|ABSTRACT Five {{trials were}} run, using 75 adult female turkeys which were divided {{randomly}} into three different treatments.

40|$|ABSTRACT Female poults {{were fed}} diets {{containing}} 0, 10, or 20 % corn gluten feed (CGF) from 0 to 16 wk {{of age or}} no CGF from 0 to 9 wk and 20 % CGF from 9 to 16 wk of age. All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isocaloric, within each age interval. Diets containing CGF had no significant effect on body weight gain, feed efficiency, yield of carcass parts, or carcass composition, as compared with effects of feeding a corn-soybean meal control diet. However, age of slaughter, 14 vs. 16 wk, {{had a significant effect}} on the proportion of breast meat, breast bone, thigh skin, thigh bone, and drums. Carcasses were significantly higher in protein and lower in fat at 14 wk than at 16 wk of age. Results suggest CGF can successfully constitute up to 10 % of the diet of growing turkey hens. The use of CGF in turkey diets up to this level would be governed by the economics of the nutrient supply. At 20 % of the diet, the tendency for CGF to induce moist droppings may impose a restriction on its use, and the degree of restriction would depend on the housing-management situation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Both {{feed and}} water {{restriction}} of growing turkeys {{resulted in an}} increase in the basal levels of plasma growth hormone (GH). Restricted birds also showed an increased response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation. These changes were significantly greater in feed-restricted birds than in the water-restricted birds. After return to ad lib conditions, basal plasma GH levels remained elevated above control levels in both previously restricted groups. However, the GH response to TRH stimulation returned to normal during this period. The increase in GH secretion during undernutrition is a metabolic adjustment consistent with the known role of GH in glucose, protein and fat metabolism. The elevated GH levels present after return to adequate nutrition may aid compensatory growth. Feed and water restriction were equally effective in limiting the growth of young turkey poults. Body weight gain and feed efficiency were severely affected during the first 3 weeks of restriction, but improved during the 4 th week. Return to ad lib conditions resulted in compensatory growth and markedly improved feed efficiency in both restricted groups. Feed-restricted birds showed a significant increase in water consumption after 8 days of re-striction. This polydipsia may result from intermittent feeding of hungry animals. Water con-sumption returned to normal after 1 week of ad lib feeding. Birds restricted in water consumption voluntarily limited their feed intake to a level only slightly higher than that of the feed-restricted group. When water was supplied ad lib, these birds immediately resumed normal feed consumption. (Key words: growth hormone, <b>turkey,</b> <b>feed</b> restriction, water restriction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Improving forage {{production}} for an expanding livestock population {{is essential in}} the Çukurova and GAP (South-eastern Anatolia Project) regions of <b>Turkey.</b> <b>Feed</b> shortages, especially evident during winter, can be alleviated by introducing high yielding common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) cultivars into crop rotations. The objectives of this research were to determine the genotype × environment interactions and stability parameters for hay yield of 15 vetch lines and cultivars. The vetch genotypes were evaluated in the Çukurova (2 locations for 3 years) and South-eastern Anatolia (1 location for 2 years) regions. In the South-eastern Anatolia region, the rainfall limits plant growth, while the Çukurova region has much better soil and climatic conditions. Since local climatic variation is significant, each location in each year is treated as a separate environment, to give 8 environments. Linear regression techniques were used to analyse genotype × environment interactions (G × E). The hay yield was significantly different between genotypes and environments, while a genotype × environment interaction was present. The variation amongst environments was highly significant, and the mean hay yield ranged from 7453 kg ha- 1, in Doğankent (2002 - 03), to 2687 kg ha- 1, in Balcalı (2003 - 04). The genotypes ‘V 7 ’ and ‘V 12 ’, which had regression coefficients significantly greater than 1. 0 and produced mean hay yields above the overall mean, were well adapted to favourable environments. Three entries (V 5, V 9, and V 10) possessed regression coefficients significantly less than 1. 0, with hay yield above the grand mean, suggesting that these genotypes were better adapted to poor environments and insensitive to environmental change.

Some others are suspected carcinogens. The effects of mycotoxins are acute or chronic in nature. Mycotoxins are well known in the scientific community, although they have a low profile in the general population. An incongruous situation occurs in United States where mycotoxins from “moldy homes” are considered to be a significant problem, although there is a general debate about seriousness. This contrasts with the thousands of deaths from mycotoxins that occur, even now, in the technologically less developed countries (e. g., Indonesia, China, and Africa). Mycotoxins are more toxic than pesticides. Studies are moving from whole animal work to investigating the biochemical mechanisms in isolated cells, and the mechanisms of toxicity at the molecular level are being elucidated. The stereochemical nature of AFs has been shown to be important. In addition, the effect of multiple mycotoxins is being increasingly investigated, which will more accurately represent the situation in nature. It is anticipated that more fungal metabolites will be recognized as dangerous toxins and permitted statutory levels will decrease in the future.

40|$|ABSTRACT A. {{feeding system}} {{representing}} North American (NA) circumstance was {{compared with a}} successful extreme used in the European Economic Community (EEC) on three strains of large toms [Nicholas, British United (BUT), and Hybrid]. The NA system used six feeds to 24 weeks based on National Research Council (1977) specifications with corn, soybean meal, and fat as primary ingredients. The EEC extreme further employed fish meal, wheat, and barley in five feeds. Each EEC feed had a lower energy level and energy-protein ratio than the respective NA feed with these differences increasing from starting to finish. The BUT toms had the heaviest final body weight and the EEC system supported better gain with this strain than the NA system. Nicholas and Hybrid toms had equivalent final weights with each feeding system eliciting similar gains. Marketing at 20 and 24 weeks gave the same relative weight results.

Sensory evaluation on cooked grade A carcasses at 20 weeks favored Nicholas in a comparison with BUT.
