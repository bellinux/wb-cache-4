5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
5|$|Flight tests {{revealed}} difficult handling, {{and a lack}} of power due to the non-availability of the intended ACh-30BF engines. Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} balance issues, {{the game was}} initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat {{that he used to}} adjust the games setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult.</b> Further more, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't think over the boat, so if player get the boat to some land might be quickly killed. The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.|$|E

25|$|Perturbation {{theory is}} an {{important}} tool for describing real quantum systems, {{as it turns out}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to find exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation for Hamiltonians of even moderate complexity. The Hamiltonians to which we know exact solutions, such as the hydrogen atom, the quantum harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box, are too idealized to adequately describe most systems. Using perturbation theory, we can use the known solutions of these simple Hamiltonians to generate solutions for a range of more complicated systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of nuclei {{on the island}} of stability proves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> because the nuclei available as starting materials do not deliver the necessary sum of neutrons. For the synthesis of isotope298 of flerovium, one could use an isotope of plutonium and one of calcium that together have a sum of at least 298nucleons; for example, calcium-50 and plutonium-248. These and heavier nuclides are not available in measurable quantities, making production virtually impossible with current methods. The same problem exists for the other possible combinations of nuclides needed to generate elements on the island using target-projectile methods. It may be possible to generate the isotope298 of flerovium, if the multi-nucleon transfer reactions would work in low-energy collisions of actinide nuclei.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} year 2001–02 would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> for Emirates {{and one of}} the toughest for the airline. Initially sales were affected by a recession and later influenced by the bombing of Colombo Airport. The bombing destroyed three of SriLankan Airlines' twelve aircraft and damaged three other aircraft. A few months later, the September 11 attacks in New York City saw thousands of cancellations and deferments of travel plans. Emirates needed to find funds for a spike in its multibillion-dollar insurance cover due to the events. Seat factors fell considerably and profitability disappeared. The airline announced a recruitment freeze, but did not make any redundancies. The airline also reduced flight frequencies to other destinations. The unstable situation in the region, however, benefited Emirates as international airlines cut flights to Dubai and lowered competition.|$|E

25|$|On 11 June 1919, Rilke {{travelled}} from Munich to Switzerland. The outward {{motive was}} {{an invitation to}} lecture in Zurich, but the real reason was the wish to escape the post-war chaos and take up {{his work on the}} Duino Elegies once again. The search for a suitable and affordable place to live proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult.</b> Among other places, Rilke lived in Soglio, Locarno and Berg am Irchel. Only in mid-1921 was he able to find a permanent residence in the Château de Muzot in the commune of Veyras, close to Sierre in Valais. In an intense creative period, Rilke completed the Duino Elegies in several weeks in February 1922. Before and after, Rilke rapidly wrote both parts of the poem cycle Sonnets to Orpheus containing 55 entire sonnets. Together, these two have often been taken as constituting the high points of Rilke's work. In May 1922, Rilke's patron Werner Reinhart bought and renovated Muzot so that Rilke could live there rent-free.|$|E

500|$|In {{previous}} years, {{the organizers}} {{had made the}} race easier for the Italian favorites by including fewer hard climbs.

La Stampa writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano praised the route saying it was beautiful and well crafted but contained one flaw, in that the race did not finish in any major Italian city.

He considers {{it to be}} his [...] "vocation", and contrasts it with designing and creating video games, which he calls his [...] "wish" [...] and finds <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to do in comparison to composition. Kikuta does not worry about the style of music that he composes, considering it to only be a tool or method. As a result, his music is frequently composed of combinations of styles mixed together. He is inspired to create his music by things that he has seen, especially while traveling; he credits much of the musical imagery in Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 as being inspired by several islands in Fiji he has visited. Rather than {{trying to be a}} [...] "pure artist" [...] that creates art for art's sake, Kikuta says that his primary goal in composing is to entertain the listeners. He has not been influenced by other video game composers, though he claims to admire Hitoshi Sakimoto, whom he worked with at Square. He has named Pink Floyd as his single biggest musical influence, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth as the artist he would most like to collaborate with. Kikuta's favorite song that he has composed is [...] "Overture" [...] from Concerto Gate.|$|E

Arto's mother was a fantastic cook and the rectory was an open house for any Armenian students and visitors in Manchester.

Brought up in such an environment it was not surprising that Arto and his brother Koko, a civil engineer, felt that the 'traditional' Greek-Cypriot food served to the public in Britain at that time was a poor reflection of the true Middle Eastern cuisine and they decided to open a genuine Armenian restaurant in Manchester.|$|R
