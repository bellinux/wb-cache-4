Hrayr was killed during the intense fighting; Andranik survived and resumed the fight. Between 7,000 and 10,000 Armenian civilians were killed during <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of the uprising, while about 9,000 were left homeless.

5|$|Burgmeier {{made his}} debut on 23 August, in a 2–1 defeat to Gillingham at The Darlington Arena. He scored his first goal for Darlington in a 2–1 win against Port Vale on 13 September. Manager Dave Penney praised Burgmeier {{for the start}} he made to the club, both as a goal scorer and creator, which also helped him to play {{his way into the}} {{affections}} of the club's supporters. When Burgmeier won his 49thcap for Liechtenstein against Wales, it was his fourth in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> since he joined Darlington. It took him past the club record three caps of Canadian Jason de Vos and New Zealander Adrian Webster, with a coach-load of Darlington fans there to see him play at the Millennium Stadium. His next cap clashed with Darlington's FA Cup first round replay with Conference North-side Droylsden, in which they were defeated.|$|E

5|$|Fauré's new {{position}} left him better off financially. However, while he also {{became much more}} widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling {{to earn a living}} as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).|$|E
5|$|Malhotra {{suffered}} an ankle injury in November that sidelined him for four games. Upon his recovery, his play was judged by team management to have {{suffered an}}d he began to be benched. Meanwhile, the Canadian national junior team wanted the Rangers to loan him to them for the 2000 World Junior Championships. On December 12, 1999, general manager Neil Smith obliged and assigned Malhotra for the international tournament. He was then sent for a two-week conditioning assignment with the Rangers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. On March 14, 2000, he was sent back down to the OHL in order to retain his eligibility for later AHL assignment in the season. Malhotra had dressed for only four games in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> between his return from the World Junior Championships in early-January and his junior reassignment. He was pointless in the 27 games total he played with the Rangers that season.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> {{following}} the verdict were ones of great activity {{between the two}} parties and the citizens of Paris. As judicial duels were now so rare, no established battleground had been set aside, and a jousting arena at the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs north of the city agreed to host the combat. Both Carrouges and Le Gris endured bouts of illness in the weeks {{following the}} verdict but recovered with the aid of their families and supporters, who had joined the hundreds of people flocking to the city from nearby regions to witness the fight. Indeed, the event was so popular that when King Charles VI believed that his return to Paris in time for the combat would be held up in Flanders due to bad roads, he sent a fast messenger to Paris delaying the duel by a month in order that he would be present to witness it. This Royal intervention set the date for the combat back to 29 December 1386.|$|E

5|$|Though the Admiralty {{arranged}} {{for some of}} the ships to be salvaged, most were left {{at the bottom of the}} sound until entrepreneur Ernest Cox bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships in the early 1920s. Bremse presented particular challenges. She had come to rest perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might slip off and sink in deeper water. Cox's salvage team sealed her bulkheads and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously. A three-man team using oxyacetylene torches ignited some oil, causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> it took to prepare the ship, though no one was injured.|$|E

The only exception to this are <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> leading up to WrestleMania in order to build the feuds for that event, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> (including the month of WrestleMania) following WrestleMania to begin new feuds for each brand. In 2017, for example, February only had a SmackDown pay-per-view while March only had one for Raw.
