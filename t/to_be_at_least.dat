5|$|Unlike in Western Europe where priests {{were clearly}} demarcated from the laymen, the clergy of the Eastern Roman Empire {{remained}} {{in close contact}} with the rest of society. Readers and subdeacons were drawn from the laity and expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> twenty years of age while priests and bishops had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 30. Unlike the Latin church, the Byzantine church allowed married priests and deacons, {{as long as they were}} married before ordination. Bishops, however, were required to be unmarried.|$|E

However, aside from the differences {{between males and females}} described above, the post-cranial skeletons of Pteranodon show little to no variation between species or specimens, and the bodies and wings of all pteranodonts were essentially identical.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many species}} have been named, modern paleontologists {{recognize}} only one, T. bataar, as valid. Some experts see this species as an Asian representative of the North American genus Tyrannosaurus; this would make the genus Tarbosaurus redundant. Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, if not synonymous, are considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> closely related genera. Alioramus, also from Mongolia, is thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus.|$|E

A total of 1,334 {{people were injured}} by the storm throughout the country. Final damage assessments from the Nicaraguan Government for mainland Nicaragua were completed on November12. A government report said that 283 homes were destroyed and 1,899 others damaged; 1,184 latrines were destroyed and 444 were damaged, and 476 wells were destroyed and 1,139 were damaged.|$|E

50|$|A {{proportional}} {{division is}} a kind of fair division in which a resource is divided among n partners with subjective valuations, giving each partner <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 1/n of the resource by his/her own subjective valuation. For example, consider a land asset that has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> divided among 3 heirs: Alice and Bob who think that it's worth 3 million dollars, and George who thinks that it's worth $4.5M. In a proportional division, Alice receives a land-plot that she believes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> $1M, Bob receives a land-plot that he believes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> $1M (even though Alice may think it is worth less), and George receives a land-plot that he believes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> $1.5M.|$|R
5|$|In the United Kingdom, for example, the Carbon Trust {{recently}} {{estimated the}} extent of the economically viable offshore resource at 55 TWh per year, about 14% of current national demand. Across Europe, the technologically achievable resource has been estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 280 TWh per year. In 2003, the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated the viable resource in the United States at 255 TWh per year (6% of demand).|$|E

He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 100 roentgen. A dose of 1 Gy (~100 roentgen) can cause nausea and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} tungsten {{consists of}} five isotopes whose half-lives are {{so long that}} they can be considered stable. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed to do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year. The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 4×1021 years.|$|E

Platyzoa are generally agreed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that includes molluscs and annelid worms. The majority view is that Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority of researchers regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.|$|E

Roughly 90 percent of the banded wrens died within 10 years.|$|E

The walls were constructed with rubble faced with ashlar, and even without their former polished facings the walls are about 3m (10ft) thick.|$|E
5|$|The use of Latin as the {{language}} of administration persisted until formally abolished by Heraclius in the 7th century. Scholarly Latin would rapidly fall into disuse among the educated classes although {{the language}} would continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a ceremonial part of the Empire's culture for some time. Additionally, Vulgar Latin remained a minority language in the Empire, mainly along the Dalmatian coast (Dalmatian) and among the Romanian peoples.|$|E
