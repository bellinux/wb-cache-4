For this Atoua is a prophetess and holy. Now learn thou the destiny that the Gods of Egypt have given to thee to fulfil, and woe be unto thee if by any {{weakness}} thou dost fail therein! Listen: thou art no stranger adopted into my house and the worship of the Temple; thou art my very son, saved to me by this same woman. But, Harmachis, thou art more than this, for in thee and me alone yet flows the Imperial blood of Egypt. Thou and I alone of men alive are descended, without break or flaw, from that Pharaoh Nekt-nebf whom Ochus the Persian drove from Egypt. The Persian came and the Persian went, and after the Persian came the Macedonian, and now for nigh upon three hundred years the Lagidæ have usurped the double crown, defiling the land of Khem and corrupting the worship of its Gods. And mark thou this: but now, two weeks since, Ptolemy Neus Dionysus, Ptolemy Aulêtes the Piper, who would have slain thee, is dead; and but now hath the Eunuch Pothinus, that very eunuch who came hither, years ago, <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>thee</b> <b>off,</b> set at naught the will of his master, the dead Aulêtes, and placed the boy Ptolemy upon the throne. And therefore his sister Cleopatra, that fierce and beautiful girl, has fled into Syria; and there, if I err not, she will gather her armies and make war upon her brother Ptolemy: for by her father's will she was left joint-sovereign with him. And, meanwhile, mark thou this, my son: the Roman eagle hangs on high, waiting with ready talons till such time as he may fall upon the fat wether Egypt and rend him. And mark again: the people of Egypt are weary of the foreign yoke, they hate {{the memory of the}} Persians, and they are sick at heart of being named 'Men of Macedonia' in the markets of Alexandria. The whole land mutters and murmurs beneath the yoke of the Greek and the shadow of the Roman.|$|R

"Having, therefore, {{considered}} {{all these}} things, and fully reflected upon them, as I see I {{have not been}} able to engage you by any motives to do as you ought, I have come to the conclusion to lay before you, in writing, this my last determination, resolving, however, to wait still a little longer before I come to a final execution of my purpose, in order to give you one more trial to see whether you will amend or no.

'If it weren't for the jelly, and the natural {{affections}} always engendered by shoemaking, I think I should almost feel inclined <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> with a shilling, Artie, my boy--to cut you off with a shilling. Well, Artie, I'm quite convalescent now (don't you call it? I'm afraid of my long shoemaker's words before you, nowadays, you've grown so literary; for I suppose parsons are more literary than even shoemakers). I'm quite convalescent now, and I think, my boy, I must get to work again this week, and have no more of your expensive soups and jellies. If I didn't keep a sharp look-out upon you, Artie, lad, I believe you'd starve yourself outright up there at Oxford to pamper your poor old useless father here with luxuries he's never been accustomed to in his whole life.' ...|$|E

[...] There are more Rhodophils in this theatre, [...] More Palamedes, and some few wives, I fear: [...] But yet too far our poet would not run; [...] Though 'twas well offered, there was nothing done. [...] He would not quite the women's frailty bare, [...] But stript them to the waist, and left them there: [...] And the men's faults are less severely shown, [...] For he considers that himself is one.-- [...] Some stabbing wits, to bloody satire bent, [...] Would treat both sexes with less compliment; [...] Would lay the scene at home; of husbands tell, [...] For wenches, taking up their wives i' the Mall; [...] And a brisk bout, which each of them did want, [...] Made by mistake of mistress and gallant. [...] Our modest author thought it was enough [...] <b>To</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> a sample of the stuff: [...] He spared my shame, which you, I'm sure, would not, [...] For you were all for driving on the plot: [...] You sighed when I came in to break the sport, [...] And set your teeth when each design fell short. [...] To wives and servants all good wishes lend, [...] But the poor cuckold seldom finds a friend.

Wile E., unable to stop in time, ends up stuck in the puddle and tries to reach a ringing phone some {{distance}} away. Bugs answers the phone, which he hands off to Wile E.

Bugs then says [...] "Did you realise he almost hit this door?" [...] The chunk of road, having crushed Wile E. against the cliff, breaks, causing him to fall halfway down. Only the telephone cord prevents him from falling {{all the way to the}} ground, but Bugs rings up Wile E. and (mimicking the phone company) remarks [...] "You haven't paid your telephone bill lately, so we're going to have <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off.</b> Sorry." [...] Bugs severs the cord and Wile E. becomes a victim to gravity as usual. Bugs then tells the audience [...] "The moral is, never get cut off in the middle of a long-distance fall".|$|E
30|$|The {{consequence}} is that stress {{is all around}} us yet quite ambiguous. It may refer to external stimuli in the environment (e.g., the extreme cold of a windy winter day or {{the noise of the}} traffic on a city street) or it may be situational (an argument with a family member or losing one’s job and having to pay the mortgage or driving and someone tries <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off).</b> Stress can be positive (e.g., the birth of a new child) or negative (e.g., the death of a parent) and acute (e.g., an electric shock) or chronic (e.g., job strain). Moreover, the same term, stress, can be used to describe the mental or physical internal states that result from any of these stimuli or situations. For instance, tension, anxiety, irritation, and anger are all synonyms for stress.|$|E
