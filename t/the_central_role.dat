5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> of ammonia, ammonia levels {{do not always}} correlate with {{the severity of the}} encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII, Vanille was {{originally}} {{going to be}} the main character, but after the game was shown off with Lightning in <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>role,</b> the decision was scrapped. In an interview with Siliconera, Vanille's English voice actor stated that she found it relatively easy connecting with the character because of the similarities in their basic personalities. Vanille is voiced by Georgia van Cuylenburg in English, and by Yukari Fukui in Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} understated mythological importance of Sif's {{role in the}} story of her sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with the most important and powerful items in Norse mythology.

Various temple pyramids, the remains of palaces (mostly reduced to mounds of rubble) and a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame {{can be seen in the}} site core.

5|$|With {{the piece}} {{set to open}} on 26 December, Gilbert first read the {{libretto}} to the cast on 14 December, but Toole, who was playing <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> of Thespis, did not return from {{a tour of the}} British provinces until 18 December. He then appeared in nine performances at the Gaiety in the six days immediately after his return, and other actors had similar commitments. In addition, Hollingshead had committed the company to perform a pantomime at The Crystal Palace on 21 December, which included many of the performers who would be in Thespis. Lastly, Thespis was to play as the afterpiece to an H. J. Byron comedy, Dearer than Life, which shared many of its actors, including Toole and Fred Sullivan, and had to be rehearsed at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Coke {{undertook}} <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> in framing {{and writing}} the Petition of Right. The ongoing struggles over martial law and civil liberties, {{along with the}} rejection of the Resolutions seriously concerned the Commons. Accordingly, Coke convinced the Lords to meet with the Commons in April 1628 in order to discuss a petition to the King confirming the rights and liberties of royal subjects. The Commons immediately accepted this, and after a struggle, the Lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by Coke to draft the eventual document. Hearing of this, the King sent a message to Parliament forbidding the Commons from discussing matters of state. The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their fear that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. Coke, despite the fear in Parliament, stood and spoke, citing historical precedents supporting the principle that members of the Commons could, within Parliament, say whatever they wished – something now codified as Parliamentary privilege.|$|E

25|$|Kabbalistic {{doctrine}} gives man <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> in Creation, as {{his soul}} and body {{correspond to the}} supernal divine manifestations. In the Christian Kabbalah this scheme was universalised to describe harmonia mundi, the harmony of Creation within man. In Judaism, it gave a profound spiritualisation of Jewish practice. While the kabbalistic scheme gave a radically innovative, though conceptually continuous, development of mainstream Midrashic and Talmudic Rabbinic notions, kabbalistic thought underscored and invigorated conservative Jewish observance. The esoteric teachings of kabbalah gave the traditional mitzvot observances <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> in spiritual creation, whether the practitioner was learned in this knowledge or not. Accompanying normative Jewish observance and worship with elite mystical kavanot intentions gave them theurgic power, but sincere observance by common folk, especially in the Hasidic popularisation of kabbalah, could replace esoteric abilities. Many kabbalists were also leading legal figures in Judaism, such as Nachmanides and Joseph Karo.|$|E
