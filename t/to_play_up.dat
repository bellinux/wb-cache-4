5|$|Georgia coach Herman Stegeman, in {{the section}} on Southern {{football}} in Spalding's football guide, wrote that Vanderbilt had a good year but was unable <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> to its full capabilities and the Commodores should prepare for a fine season the next year. For Stegeman, the contest for the theoretical title of greatest Southern team in 1921 was between Centre, Georgia Tech, and Georgia. Clyde Berryman retroactively listed Vanderbilt as national champion. Lynn Bomar at fullback, Pos Elam at tackle, and Thomas Ryan at end were listed on Walter Camp's list of notable players. Bomar, Elam, Ryan, Tot McCullough, Alf Sharpe, and Pink Wade all made an All-Southern team although, according to the yearbook, Tom Ryan was the only player in the group to appear on an All-Southern team.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bevin faced state Attorney General Jack Conway, marking the first gubernatorial race {{in state history}} {{featuring}} two candidates from Louisville, the state's largest city. The Kentucky Democratic Party attempted <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> the fractures in the Republican Party over Bevin's candidacy, launching a web site featuring fellow Republicans' criticisms of Bevin, drawn mostly from his primary race against McConnell. Bevin responded with a web site tying Conway to President Barack Obama, who was very unpopular in Kentucky, saying that Conway would support environmental regulations that harm the coal industry and support the Affordable Care Act, which was also unpopular in the state, despite its nationally praised insurance exchange.|$|E
25|$|Multi-timbre: The {{ability to}} play more than one kind of {{instrument}} sound at the same time. Such as with the Roland MT-32's ability <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> to eight different instruments at once.|$|E

25|$|To be {{eligible}} for a contract, a player must either be an Irish national or play for an Irish club {{in one of the}} five cricketing provinces. Holsworth said that the Interpros should provide a direct pathway into the Ireland side, but that retired internationals like Nigel Jones and Albert van der Merwe would still {{be eligible}}. Teams are allowed <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> to two non-Irish nationals in the Championship matches.|$|E
25|$|Coordination games {{also have}} mixed {{strategy}} Nash equilibria. In the generic coordination game above, a mixed Nash equilibrium {{is given by}} probabilities p= (d-b)/(a+d-b-c) <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>Up</b> and 1-p to play Down for player 1, and q= (D-C)/(A+D-B-C) to play Left and 1-q to play Right for player 2. Since d > b and d-b < a+d-b-c, p is always between zero and one, so existence is assured (similarly for q).|$|E
25|$|Hearne {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> to 1914 – though {{without the}} same success of 1910 and 1911 – taking his three thousandth wicket {{on the first}} day of 1914. When first-class cricket resumed in 1919, Hearne was fifty-two and clearly was too old to play a full season's cricket. He played two more first-class matches against weak opponents in 1921 and 1923, but never again in the Championship.|$|E
50|$|Free {{accounts}} {{were limited}} <b>to</b> <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1000 songs/mo (up to 12,000/yr) without any special restrictions. A song could be skipped to bypass an undesired track, but skipped songs counted against the monthly allowance. If a free account user exceeds the monthly limit, the user {{would no longer}} be able to listen to LAUNCHcast radio for the remainder of the month, although they could listen to their personal station with no skips. Like skips, songs did not roll over to the next month. This won't be the case when LAUNCHcast is powered by CBS as it will provide unlimited listening.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the modern}} times, anti-Vietnamese {{sentiment}} continue to flare in Cambodia due {{to fear from}} Cambodians for what they believed that Vietnam will take over their land one day with some Cambodian opposition politicians continue <b>to</b> <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> the issue <b>to</b> justify their hatred against the Vietnamese. This was proved with the attacks against Vietnamese {{that resulted in the}} rape and murder of several Vietnamese in the country as anti-Vietnamese anger have been too difficult to counter in Cambodia especially when activist against racism from the Cambodian ethnicity itself been given a death threat if they tried to interrupt on the issues.|$|R
50|$|Nebraska {{survived a}} scare in Columbia, {{escaping}} {{with a victory}} due to recovering a Gamecock fumble with two minutes left <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>to</b> set <b>up</b> the go-ahead touchdown, and then intercepting a throw by South Carolina QB Todd Ellis at NU's 10 yard line with just 10 seconds remaining.|$|R

Olmert said that Israel did not want <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> the incident and was still interested in peace with Syria, adding that if Assad chose not {{to draw attention to the}} incident, he would do likewise.|$|E
25|$|Also named Tetromino Go. Devised by R. Wayne Schmittberger, {{each player}} is allowed <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> to four stones in a turn, {{provided}} they are solidly connected on adjacent points. (There are five four-stone patterns possible, two three-stone patterns, and one two-stone pattern, ignoring rotations and reflections.) There is no komi; Black is restricted {{on his first}} turn to playing {{no more than two}} stones. The winner is determined by Chinese scoring: occupied and surrounded points each count 1 point; captured stones do not have point value. The inventor suggests a 15×15 square-celled board using square-tiled pieces.|$|E
25|$|He {{strengthened}} {{the spine of}} the team, bought in Carlisle United forward Bob Hatton, a club record signing at £82,500, <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> front alongside the home-grown Bob Latchford and introduced the 16-year-old Trevor Francis to first-team football. In 1971–72, Birmingham were not in the promotion places {{at any time during the}} season until after the last match, a win away at Orient that took them to the First Division as runners-up, overtaking Millwall, who had been in the top two for most of the campaign and whose supporters attended the match in large numbers to encourage Orient.|$|E

25|$|For Newcastle United, the FA Cup final {{was their}} {{final game of}} the season, meaning that they were {{uninhibited}} in their squad selection for the match. The biggest selection dilemma for manager Ruud Gullit was who to pick <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> front alongside captain Alan Shearer: Scottish forward Duncan Ferguson, who was due for an operation on his groin two days later, or Georgian Temur Ketsbaia. Ketsbaia ultimately got the job, with Ferguson named as a substitute. After marking David Ginola out of the game in their semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, 20-year-old full-back Andy Griffin was selected {{on the right side of}} Newcastle's defence to perform a similar task against Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs.|$|E
500|$|A {{member of}} two local chess clubs, Southard was {{described}} in his New York Times obituary as [...] "one of the foremost amateur chess players in America". He often arrived at his laboratory after spending the night playing chess. After his death, in [...] "metaphors more appropriate for a comet than a man", friends described the intellect which allowed Southard <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> to six blind chess matches simultaneously. At Danvers State Hospital, he introduced a move he called the Danvers Opening.|$|E
500|$|With sleep {{deprivation}} {{one of the}} major plot points of the episode, actor Edward James Olmos (William Adama) liaised with an expert on the subject and the crew to best depict the actual effects realistically. [...] Following up, director Michael Rymer gave each main cast member a specific symptom <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up,</b> so as to avoid repetition on screen. [...] Olmos and several other cast members took their study a step further, to immerse themselves by restricting their sleep patterns to about three hours a night to emphasize what their expert was imparting.|$|E

500|$|For the episode's {{time travel}} elements, sound effects editor Bruce Tanis {{explained}} his choices of sound {{during an interview}} with Designing Sound: [...] "I used vocals from the dialog to create high-pitched jittery tones that played against the visual of his time-jumping. He would start to flicker faster and faster as he ramped up to the moment of leaping so I wanted <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> the fragmented sense of time we had visually and create {{the idea that he}} was somehow jumping over other people to land at a different point in time. It also had electrical humming and zapping to support the electrical nature of the device".|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} ensure his story would be chosen to air, Gordon decided <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> the {{elements}} of anti-Semitism. Originally, however, the script called for both the protagonists and the antagonists to be African Americans, and the main protagonist to be a [...] "Louis Farrakhan-like" [...] character. Gordon later rewrote the script because he realized [...] "black anti-Semitism is a very subtle and difficult subject and not what I needed in my dramatic structure." [...] To {{create the kind of}} hate propaganda that Brunjes and his printshop made in the episode, Gordon contacted the Anti-Defamation League and requested samples. The articles that were presented were used in the episode, with only [...] "minor alterations".|$|E

El Hijo del Santo received backup {{in the form of}} Octagón, a very popular masked técnico who had starred in several Lucha Libre Films in the past. The feud between the two teams would evolve into Barr and Guerrero recruiting other wrestlers, most importantly Konnan, who up until joining Los Gringos Locos {{was one of the most}} popular técnicos in Mexico. They were also joined by Madonna's Boyfriend, Black Cat, and Chicano Power, forming what was the first real [...] "stable" [...] in Mexico.|$|E

500|$|Karen Tye spoke favourably of the album, {{saying they}} had [...] "ditched the cutesy voices and effervescent ditties" [...] and {{replaced}} it with acoustic pop and rock which occasionally bordered on country. She praised M2M for using [...] "down-to-earhtunes and thoughtful lyrics" [...] instead of revealing outfits to propel them into the limelight, unlike many of their pop counterparts. Conversely, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic was critical of M2M's new image in the album artwork. Erlewine said they had ditched their sweet and innocent look from Shades of Purple, for [...] "lots of makeup, crimped hair [...] fairly low-cut tops". He gave the album four and a half stars out of five, concluding [...] "If M2M needs <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> their good looks to sell an album this pleasing, so be it. This is an album that deserves to find its audience, even through tactics as blatant as that." ...|$|E
500|$|Mason said {{he hoped}} that his storyline would [...] "draw in viewers in a {{responsible}} way" [...] and the feedback would stay positive. Mason added {{that he would like}} to see Chris happy in the future and hopes the viewers will warm to him. He added [...] "I know it's quite a sensitive topic, but I think the difference between his and the last encounters they've had is that we're looking more in-depth into more than just a [...] "gay kiss". We go more into the relationships, how it affects people around". Steele backed this up, saying [...] "We wanted gay to be part of Chris's character, not Chris to be the gay character. He's not your typical gay stereotype that some TV shows like <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up.</b> He's on the basketball team, he's had a girlfriend for a time, and I think the show does a good job of portraying the way his character is discovering who he really is".|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{declared}} the game's graphics {{to be some}} of the best on the Nintendo 3DS. Eurogamer reviewer Rich Stanton praised the environments for their lighting and particle effects, while GameSpot credited the highly detailed character models, especially those of Jill and some enemies. IGN also highlighted the sound design, saying that [...] "Capcom has mastered the ability <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>up</b> a soundtrack when appropriate, sometimes completely cutting to isolated noises in order to focus a player on something truly haunting." [...] Game Revolution stated similar pros, noting that the game is best experienced when played in the dark with headphones on. Tim Turi of Game Informer praised the story for its episodic structure and pacing, but also admitted that BSAA agents Quint and Keith are the worst characters in the series' history. The fact that the game supports the Circle Pad Pro was seen as a valuable feature, as it gives players the ability to move, shoot and control the camera at the same time.|$|E
