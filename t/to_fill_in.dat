5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> the space {{on either side of}} implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
