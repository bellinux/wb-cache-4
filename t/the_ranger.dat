In spite of this, only one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing. At the first Airborne Ranger graduation in November 1950, each Ranger was given a black and gold Ranger Tab as a shoulder sleeve insignia. A few days later, each Ranger was issued a blue and white tab and instructed to sew it above <b>the</b> <b>Ranger</b> Tab. The Airborne Ranger Companies then in Korea were deactivated on August 1, 1951. They were merged into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team {{to bring them back}} up to strength with airborne-qualified combat-experienced replacements. The 187th had been moved to Kyushu, Japan’s southern island to take on a (then Top Secret) mission to save the UN negotiators at Kaesong, North Korea.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{also suffered}} from engine problems, however, {{that were not}} so easily cured; <b>the</b> <b>Ranger</b> engine was well known for unreliability, and was particularly prone to overheating problems that were never satisfactoriarly solved.

The local park ranger contacts Mulder after finding the corpse of a wild man in the woods who he believes could be the Jersey Devil. Scully and Mulder bring <b>the</b> <b>ranger</b> and Dr. Diamond to the morgue, where the body has mysteriously vanished. Mulder believes that the Jersey Devil they are hunting is actually the creature's mate who has headed into Atlantic City in search of food after her mate's death. The agents, along with <b>the</b> <b>ranger</b> and Dr. Diamond, search for the creature in an abandoned building. While they are searching the building, Detective Thompson arrives with a SWAT team.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband <b>the</b> <b>Ranger</b> units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E
50|$|At the NHL Entry Draft, <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> chose Chris Kreider {{with their}} first-round pick, 19th overall. <b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> {{followed}} {{this with a}} couple of trades at the draft to pick up Brian Boyle and Chad Johnson. A bigger splash was made a few days later when <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> traded Scott Gomez to the Montreal Canadiens. With Gomez's $7 million contract gone, <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> then signed free agent Marian Gaborik on July 1, the first day of free agency.

50|$|Rita creates Goldar, {{raises an}} army of Putties, and attacks Angel Grove to find the Zeo Crystal. <b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> battle <b>the</b> Putties and head to Angel Grove in their Zords. After <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> destroy <b>the</b> Putties, Goldar pushes <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> and their Zords into a fiery pit. In the pit, the Zords combine, forming the Megazord. Rita merges with Goldar. <b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> battle and destroy Goldar. After refusing Jason's offer to surrender, a defiant Rita tells <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> that more will come for the crystal and leaps at the Megazord only to be slapped into space. <b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> are praised as local heroes, and with Rita's threats foiled, they return to their normal lives.|$|R
5|$|Failing {{to reach}} their initial {{destination}} of Tobago due to light winds and strong currents, Low's depleted fleet made it to Grenada, a French-owned island. Hiding most of his men belowdecks, he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a French sloop was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's men came out from hiding. Low, now commanding the captured sloop (renamed <b>the</b> <b>Ranger),</b> gave the schooner Squirrel to Spriggs, now his quartermaster, who renamed it the Delight before sailing away {{in the middle of}} the night with a small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the flyoff competition, the XSO2U-1 {{was used}} as a general utility {{aircraft}} and hack by the Navy, before being supplied to <b>the</b> <b>Ranger</b> Engine Corporation in July 1942 for use in tests of the V-770 engine. These tests were intended to assist in debugging the engine for the Bell XP-77 lightweight fighter and Edo XOSE floatplane, but the V-770 remained troublesome, and after two years of testing the XSO2U was returned to the Navy. Having no further use for the aircraft, the XSO2U-1 was removed from the Navy's rolls on 6 July 1944, being subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|In September 1950, on Collins' orders <b>the</b> <b>Ranger</b> Training Center {{was moved}} to Fort Benning, Georgia, and in October the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Ranger Companies began training. The {{effective}} employment of the Eighth Army Ranger Company had demonstrated {{the viability of the}} concept to Army planners, and the subsequent Chinese attacks in November reinforced the need for more such units. As a result, the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Ranger Companies were ordered to form. Altogether, another fifteen Ranger companies would be formed in 1950 and 1951, and six of them would see combat in Korea.|$|E

5|$|On October 26, 1996, a {{well-known}} gaming clan, the Rangers, surprised the Quake community with Diary of a Camper, the first widely known machinima film. This short, 100-second demo file contained {{the action and}} gore of many others, but {{in the context of}} a brief story, rather than the usual deathmatch. An example of transformative or emergent gameplay, this shift from competition to theater required both expertise in and subversion of the game's mechanics. <b>The</b> <b>Ranger</b> demo emphasized this transformation by retaining specific gameplay references in its story.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> {{played a}} legendary {{semifinal}} {{series against the}} Philadelphia Flyers in the 1973-74 playoffs. This series was noted for a game seven fight between Dale Rolfe of <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> and Dave Schultz of the Flyers. Schultz pummeled Rolfe without anyone on <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> lifting a finger to protect him (the GAG line was on the ice at the time). This led {{to the belief that}} <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> of that period were soft, especially when taking into account the bullying endured by <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> during <b>the</b> 1972 finals. One example is Gilbert's beating at the hands of Derek Sanderson of the Bruins.|$|R
5|$|The years 1976 and 1977 saw {{uranium mining}} {{become a major}} {{political}} issue, with <b>the</b> <b>Ranger</b> Inquiry (Fox) report opening up a public debate about uranium mining.
