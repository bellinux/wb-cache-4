500|$|Commenting on the {{interruption}} of Crawford's career by his dispute with Surrey, Neville Cardus wrote: [...] "His break with Surrey must {{be regarded as}} a sad deprivation of fame and pleasure to himself, and a grievous loss to the annals of English cricket. It is as certain as anything in a man's life can be confidently postulated, that had he continued to play in English county cricket... he would have taken his place amongst the select company of England's captains." [...] The Times commented: [...] "It {{was one of the great}} disappointments of English cricket in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> century that his outstanding promise was never fully realized." [...] Hart observes that Crawford's on-field successes were many up to 1909 but after that, his career effectively stalled during his absence from English cricket. Hart notes Crawford's [...] "capacity to get on the scoreboard and up establishment noses. He could turn games around and agreements over, antagonise the powerful, endear himself to the young and those young enough at heart to care to characterise great personal performances as 'heroic'". He concludes that Crawford spent the last 40 years of his life [...] "in comparative sporting obscurity". No-one on the Surrey committee ever expressed regret at what had happened, and Leveson Gower did not mention the affair in his autobiography.|$|E
