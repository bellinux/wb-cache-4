25|$|Before {{releasing}} the jury for deliberation, Judge Learned Hand altered {{the charges against}} the defendants and attempted to preface the jury of their constitutional duties. Hand dismissed all the charges against Josephine Bell, and dismissed the first count – “conspiracy to cause mutiny and refusal of duty”—against the remaining defendants. Prior to {{releasing the}} jurors, Judge Hand stated, “I do not have <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> every man {{has the right to}} have such economic, philosophic or religious opinions as seem to him best, whether they be socialist, anarchistic or atheistic.” After deliberating from Thursday afternoon to Saturday, the jury returned with two decisions. First, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist and, consequently, un-American. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror) but moved to drag the socialist supporter out into the street and lynch him. Judge Hand, given the uproar, declared a mistrial.|$|E
500|$|Richard Harrington of The Washington Post {{called it}} [...] "metaphorically ambivalent". Barbara Jaeger of The Bergen Record called Clayton's bassline [...] "ominous". Stokes {{described}} it as [...] "the antithesis of [...] bright, ringing, optimistic, inspirational selves, it was dirty, loud, discordant, repetitive, noisy, black. If the intention was to invoke a sense of evil abroad, then it was effective". Graham said [...] "'Exit' should have exploded the myth of U2 as the nice guys of rock. Never had they shown such a vicious streak or produced such a withering track.... Far more than even 'Bullet the Blue Sky', [...] playing is scratching at the prison bars of polished good taste", describing it as the wild card of the album. Author John Luerssen contrasted it {{to the rest of}} the band's catalogue, saying [...] "Unlike most of the songs U2 had written up to this point, 'Exit' lacked any optimism." [...] Hot Press contributor Colm O'Hare felt the claims by Bardo evoked memories of Charles Manson's use of [...] "Helter Skelter", and contained [...] "even more sinister shades" [...] of the death of John Lennon. In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond argued it was [...] "awkward enough <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> not even Patti Smith could regularly pull off this sort of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|As vice {{chairman}} of the Revolutionary Command Council, al-Douri was involved in the wars against Iran and Kuwait. During the 1988–1989 Al-Anfal Campaign, al-Douri was said to have ordered Ali Hassan al-Majid (aka 'Chemical Ali') to use Mustard and Sarin nerve gas on Kurdish fighters in Halabja. He was complicit in the invasion of Saudi Arabia and the attack on the town of Khafji in January 1991. During the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, he was involved in the suppression of the revolt led by the Iraqi marsh Arabs. When the Kurds rebelled again in 1991, al-Douri warned them [...] "If you have forgotten Halabja, I would like <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we are ready to repeat the operation." ...|$|E

"Nay, now, Luis, thou emboldenest me <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> I {{expressed}} a wish that thou wouldst {{not go on}} thy last voyage to the north, and yet thou didst depart!

2500|$|In 2009, 1UP.com editor Bob Mackey {{reviewed}} the NES game in 1UP.com's official Retro Gaming Blog. He wrote {{that it had}} the same problems that Bart vs. the Space Mutants had, such as [...] "lousy jumping physics", and that it [...] "also manages to strip away the novelty that made the original Simpsons NES game worth checking {{out in the first}} place. The sequel is a straight-up, cookie-cutter platformer without any real Simpson-y touches to satisfy fans of the show; Bart finds himself wandering through generic side-scrolling levels, with a Simpsons character showing up every now and then <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> this is an actual licensed product and not just a ROM hack." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 June 2011, FAO and {{its members}} {{countries}} officially recognized global freedom from the deadly cattle virus. On this day, the FAO Conference, the highest body of the UN agency, adopted a resolution declaring the eradication of rinderpest. The resolution also called on the world community to follow up by ensuring that samples of rinderpest viruses and vaccines be kept under safe laboratory conditions and that rigorous standards for disease surveillance and reporting be applied. [...] "While we are celebrating {{one of the greatest}} successes for FAO and its partners, I wish <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> this extraordinary achievement {{would not have been possible}} without the joint efforts and strong commitments of governments, the main organizations in Africa, Asia and Europe, and without the continuous support of donors and international institutions", FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf commented.|$|E
