A technique is presented for overcoming the undesirable effects of encoder quantisation, when the digital encoder signal is used to derive the velocity feedback. The technique was developed to overcome quantisation noise problems identified during testing of an adaptive controller. As such, the technique involves on-line design of a model-based filter, utilising the plant parameters identified as part of the adaptive control process. The material presented has relevance also to non-adaptive, fixed parameter control systems...|$|E

The article {{considers}} {{the process of}} development and improvement of tachometer data collectors for the data-measuring diesel locomotive hydraulic transmission test system, which will give the possibility of obtaining the source data to conduct further studies of the technical condition of diesel locomotive hydraulic transmission. It is supposed to provide {{a solution to the}} problem of development and improvement of tachometer data measuring tools of the previously created data-measuring diesel locomotive hydraulic transmission test system, starting out from the possibility of modification of the existing locomotive hydraulic transmission test-bench at the Dnepropetrovsk Diesel Locomotive Repair Plant «Promteplovoz». Methodology. The researchers proposed in the work a method of modifying the existing <b>tachometer</b> <b>sensor</b> of the automated microprocessor system for the locomotive hydraulic transmission test-bench in the conditions of a diesel locomotive repair plant. It is applicable by substantiating the choice of the required <b>tachometer</b> <b>sensor</b> measuring method, as well as by using the necessary hardware and software to accomplish the goal with the ability to integrate into the data-measuring system for diesel locomotive hydraulic transmission testing. Findings. The available equipment of the locomotive hydraulic transmission test-bench allowed for design of the optical type speed sensor based on the existing sensor D- 2 MMU- 2. The factory testing with the use of a sensor prototype resulted in determination of the required and sufficient sampling time for sensor operating microcontroller. Originality. The available equipment of the locomotive hydraulic transmission test-bench allowed for design of the optical type speed sensor based on the existing sensor D- 2 MMU- 2. We developed the operation algorithms for the microcontroller that processes the signals from this sensor. The sensor was factory-tested. According to the data sample obtained during the tests, we showed the possibility of reducing the sensor information retrieval frequency. Practical value. The designed sensor significantly reduces the cost of development of the diesel locomotive hydraulic transmission test-bench, besides it can be used when developing similar hydraulic transmission test-benches of other wheeled vehicles and the like. The designed sensor has a greater accuracy than that of D- 2 - 2 MMU and considerably lower production cost in comparison with current tachometer sensors. The measurement results are input data to perform further studies in order to determine the technical condition of UGP 750 - 1200 hydraulic transmission during the factory post-repair testing...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{adaptive}} law with an integral action is designed and implemented on a DC motor by employing a rotary encoder and <b>tachometer</b> <b>sensors.</b> The stability is proved {{by using the}} Lyapunov function. The tracking errors asymptotically converge to zero according to the Barbalat lemma.

The maximum errors of the position and velocity with the integral action are reduced from 0. 4 V and 1. 5 V to 0. 2 V and 0. 4 V, respectively.

40|$|NASA {{programs}} {{that focus on}} the use of fiber optics for aircraft engine/inlet control are reviewed. Fiber optics for aircraft control is attractive because of its inherent immunity to EMI and RFI noise. Optical signals can be safely transmitted through areas that contain flammable or explosive materials. The use of optics also makes remote sensing feasible by eliminating the need for electrical wires to be connected between sensors and computers. Using low-level optical signals to control actuators is also feasible when power is generated at the actuator. Each application of fiber optics for aircraft control has different requirements for both the optical cables and the optical connectors. Sensors that measure position and speed by using slotted plates can use lossy cables and bundle connectors if data transfer is in the parallel mode. If position and speed signals are multiplexed, cable and connector requirements change. Other sensors that depend on changes in transmission through materials require dependable characteristics of both the optical cables and the optical connectors. A variety of sensor types are reviewed, including rotary position encoders, <b>tachometers,</b> temperature <b>sensors,</b> and blade tip clearance sensors for compressors and turbines. Research on a gallium arsenide photoswitch for optically switched actuators that operate at 250 C is also described...|$|R
30|$|In terrain {{perception}} field, researchers choose {{in general}} two directions, namely, predictive and reactive terrain perceptions. Predictive terrain perception {{is done in}} a pre-entry manner, that is, the robot starts to perceive the terrain in front of itself. On the other hand, reactive terrain perception considers post-entry classification or recognition of terrain on which the robot perceives. In the case of reactive terrain perception, usually, researchers use inertial measurement unit (IMU) like sensors as described in [7]. The authors have modeled the vibration to classify terrain. Amongst other important works, [8]-[12] are notable. There are multiple sensors used in all these works, such as gyros, accelerometers, encoders, motor current and voltage sensors, multi-axis force <b>sensor,</b> <b>tachometer</b> etc. The basic disadvantage within reactive terrain perception methologies is that before entering a terrain, the robot cannot do the processing.|$|R

40|$|Precise {{knowledge}} of the end-effector position of long-reach, lightweight manipulators is important because the inherit flexibility can cause deflections and vibrations of the structure. A non-contact, low-cost position measurement is desirable for practical purposes. Our previous work focused on computer vision based methods to achieve this goal, see also [Obergfell and Book, 1992]. These investigations indicated sampling time and range or resolution limitations for the chosen approach. But alternative methods using a single sensor currently have similar limitations, e. g. drift, non-direct measurement, price. To solve these problems we consider sensor fusion, combining measurements from separate sources to yield faster and better position measurements. This approach is especially interesting for robotics applications since most robots are already equipped with the necessary sensors. We are planning to implement these methods on our manipulator testbeds: First on a one-link flexible manipulator and later on a two-link flexible long-reach manipulator. The robots are currently equipped with joint angle <b>sensors,</b> <b>tachometer,</b> strain gages and tip accelerometer...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of AC machines {{compared to}} DC motors in electrical drive applications has several reasons. A very important advantage of AC machines is their simple construction. However, AC drives often need mechanical <b>sensors</b> (<b>tachometers,</b> position encoders) for field orientation. In many applications these sensors reduce robustness and increase costs of a drive considerably. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present the practical implementation of a sensorless vector control scheme for induction motors using a space phasor based current hysteresis controller. This scheme measures the stator current hysteresis error direction to determine the rotor flux, position, during inverter zero vector states. This measurement of the rotor flux position is done indirectly by sensing the motor back emf, which is orthogonal to the rotor flux position. The basic idea is to measure the current hysteresis error direction of the stator current on the application of an inverter zero vector i. e. "short circuit at machine terminals". A generalization is possible by a combination of two (different) active states of the inverter. By a linear transformation of the electrical equations for both inverter states, a mathematical zero state is constructed. The use of this virtual short circuit is necessary at higher speeds when the inverter output voltage is fully utilized. However at low speeds the drop across the stator resistance is comparable to the motor hack emf, to overcome this a simple parameter adaptation scheme is also presented here. The proposed scheme enables a smooth transition to six-step mode of operation...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the experimental development of once per revolution sensor chatter. In milling operation, self excited vibrations also called the chatter {{are one of the}} main factors that limit productivity. The project is used sensor chatter and non-sensor chatter to measure the variance of the signal sampled at a once per revolution rate. The sensor chatter {{is one of the main}} factors that lower the productivity. Higher efforts tend to accelerate tool wear and can lead to tool breakage. This project used the accelerometer to measures vibration and proper acceleration. The mounting of an accelerometer is easy but it is location must be carefully chosen. Indeed, if the sensor is close to a vibration node, signal amplitude would be very low. It is very difficult to put accelerometer on a rotating part. Beside that, the <b>sensor</b> <b>tachometer</b> (RPM gauge) is an instrument measuring the rotation speed of a tool milling machine. The device usually displays the revolutions per minute (RPM) on a calibrated analogue dial, but for this project the software of DasyLab that used can convert to revolution per second (RPS). A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and it is inverse. The result means the FFT operation, periodic functions will include changing the peak is not one, but two places. However, both these components are symmetric, so it was only necessary to see one to obtain frequency information. And providing information about the frequency, the FFT can be used to apply signal processing techniques such as filtering the signal and image compression is much easier to implement in the frequency domain. Detection of chatter, non-chatter and marginal chatter clearly can see in accelerometer, FFT and once per revolution signal. According to the results of machining experiment, it was proven that different parameter like spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut producing chatter vibration...|$|R
