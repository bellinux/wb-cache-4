5|$|After halftime, the Hokies {{threatened}} Miami for {{the first}} time all game. Virginia Tech mounted an 80-yard drive <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> touchdown, cutting Miami's lead to 14–10. But the Hurricanes' defense clamped down on any further offensive attempts by Virginia Tech and denied the Hokies more points. Miami added twofield goals: one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter that finally put the game out of reach for Virginia Tech. Miami earned the win, 20–10. Miami's win was its first bowl victory since the 1966 Liberty Bowl, which also featured a Hurricanes victory over Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|Boston College, {{in their}} first {{possession}} of the second half, fared even worse than Virginia Tech did. Two incomplete passes and a 5-yard delay of game penalty forced Boston College into a three-and-out possession <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> punt. On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, {{thanks in part to}} an 11-yard sack of Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.|$|E
5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 35-yard line following the post-touchdown kickoff and a short return. The Bears began to run out the clock, rushing the ball more than passing it, as had been the trend throughout the game. Though Aaron Rodgers completed four passes during the drive for 38yards, J. J. Arrington and Vincent Strang rushed the ball a total of eight times during the possession. California ran 7:09 off the clock before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13-yard rush <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> touchdown. The score restored California's 14-point lead, making the game 49–35 with 6:26 remaining.|$|E

He established a temporary capital at Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou) in 1129, yet by 1132 he declared it the official capital of the Song Empire. The Jin made several failed attempts to conquer the Southern Song, but in 1165 Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189) and Emperor Shizong of Jin (r. 1161–1189) agreed to a peace treaty <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> diplomatic accord being reached between the two empires. The Song continued to rule southern China until 1279, when the Yuan dynasty led by Kublai Khan, the Khagan of the Mongols, invaded and conquered Song.

5|$|Evans' {{service as}} Imperial Wizard {{proved to be}} a lucrative position, {{allowing}} him to maintain a large residence in a prestigious Atlanta neighborhood. In the mid-1930s, however, Klan funds dwindled, and he worked for a Georgia-based construction company selling products to the Georgia Highway Board. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of Georgia governor Eurith D. Rivers, whom he had previously employed as a lecturer. Owing to the political support that he provided the administration, Evans was allowed to sell to the highway board without bidding against other contractors. In 1940, the state of Georgia charged Evans {{and a member of the}} state highway board with price fixing.
