40|$|Modern {{groupware}} {{allows us}} to work together, while bridging differences in space and time. However, there exists no standard to design groupware, which {{has resulted in a}} lack of conceptual consistency and interoperability. Additionally, current groupware design methodologies typically focus on implementation details. In contrast, we consider the service a groupware application provides {{to be the most important}} aspect of the system. Dynamic Groupware Services provides a structuring of groupware services. <b>This</b> <b>structuring</b> allows co-operating end users to select and compose groupware modules in order to form groupware services that match their needs. At the same time, <b>this</b> <b>structuring</b> helps designers design tailorable groupware services. Two important results of <b>this</b> <b>structuring</b> are a description of the elementary units of groupware behaviour and a description of the units to compose groupware services. The latter units, as well as the relations between them, are defined in a reference model for tailorable groupware services...|$|R
