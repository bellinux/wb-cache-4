25|$|Indium {{lowers the}} melting point and {{improves}} ductility. In presence of lead {{it forms a}} <b>ternary</b> <b>compound</b> that undergoes phase change at 114°C. Very high cost (several times of silver), low availability. Easily oxidizes, which causes problems for repairs and reworks, especially when oxide-removing flux cannot be used, e.g. during GaAs die attachment. Indium alloys are used for cryogenic applications, and for soldering gold as gold dissolves in indium much less than in tin. Indium can also solder many nonmetals (e.g. glass, mica, alumina, magnesia, titania, zirconia, porcelain, brick, concrete, and marble). Prone to diffusion into semiconductors and cause undesired doping. At elevated temperatures easily diffuses through metals. Low vapor pressure, suitable for use in vacuum systems. Forms brittle intermetallics with gold; indium-rich solders on thick gold are unreliable. Indium-based solders are prone to corrosion, especially in presence of chloride ions.|$|E

5000|$|Further {{evidence}} that the assignment of the so-called [...] "valence hole" [...] should be to the S2 units in these two formulae is {{the length of the}} S-S bonds, which are significantly shorter in CuS (0.207 nm) and CuS2 (0.203 nm) than in the [...] "classical" [...] disulfide Fe2+(S2)2− (0.218 nm). This bond length difference has been ascribed to the higher bond order in (S-S)− compared to (S-S)2− due to electrons being removed from a π* antibonding orbital. NMR studies on CuS show that there are two distinct species of copper atom, one with a more metallic nature than the other. and this apparent discrepancy with the X-ray photo-electron spectrum data simply highlights the problem that NMR has in assigning oxidation states in a mixed-valence compound. The issue of the valence of copper in sulfides (as well as selenides and tellurides) continues to be revisited in the literature.

50|$|GeSbTe is a <b>ternary</b> <b>compound</b> of germanium, antimony, and tellurium, with {{composition}} GeTe-Sb2Te3. In the GeSbTe system, {{there is}} a pseudo-line as shown upon {{which most of the}} alloys lie. Moving down this pseudo-line, {{it can be seen that}} as we go from Sb2Te3 to GeTe, the melting point and glass transition temperature of the materials increase, crystallization speed decreases and data retention increases. Hence, in order to get high data transfer rate, we need to use material with fast crystallization speed such as Sb2Te3. This material is not stable because of its low activation energy. On the other hand, materials with good amorphous stability like GeTe has slow crystallization speed because of its high activation energy. In its stable state, crystalline GeSbTe has two possible configurations: hexagonal and a metastable face centered cubic (FCC) lattice. When it is rapidly crystallized however, it was found to have a distorted rocksalt structure. GeSbTe has a glass transition temperature of around 100 °C. GeSbTe also has many vacancy defects in the lattice, of 20 to 25% depending on the specific GeSbTe compound. Hence, Te has an extra lone pair of electrons, which are important for many of the characteristics of GeSbTe. Crystal defects are also common in GeSbTe and due to these defects, an Urbach tail in the band structure is formed in these compounds. GeSbTe is generally p type and there are many electronic states in the band gap accounting for acceptor and donor like traps. GeSbTe has two stable states, crystalline and amorphous. The phase change mechanism from high resistance amorphous phase to low resistance crystalline phase in nano-timescale and threshold switching are two of the most important characteristic of GeSbTe.|$|E
