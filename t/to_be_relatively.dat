5|$|In {{the central}} Volcanic Plateau, cabbage trees are tall, with stout, {{relatively}} unbranched stems and large stiff straight leaves. Fine specimens are found along the upper Whanganui River. On old trees, the leaves tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> broad. The leaves radiate strongly, suggesting that tī manu {{is adapted to}} the cold winters of the upland central plateau. It may have originated in the open country created by lava, volcanic ash, and pumice. Trees of the tī manu type are also found in northern Taranaki, the King Country and the Bay of Plenty lowlands.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondrial genomes {{have far}} fewer genes than the {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some have been lost altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits. This is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> common over evolutionary time. A few organisms, such as the Cryptosporidium, actually have mitochondria that lack any DNA, presumably because all their genes have been lost or transferred. In Cryptosporidium, the mitochondria have an altered ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, azide, and atovaquone.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{species of}} melampitta is {{believed}} to be threatened with extinction. The greater melampitta is not generally common across New Guinea, but appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> common in its preferred habitat type when that habitat is studied. The lesser melampitta is less restricted in its habitat requirements and is common over a large area. Because of this, and the fact that their habitat is not considered to be threatened and their populations are considered to be stable, both species are listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the terms}} were agreed to, Buffalo marked and was {{recorded}} as Pe-zhe-ke, {{head of the}} La Pointe delegation. Although Buffalo and the other Lake Superior chiefs signed, they were said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> silent compared with the Mississippi Chippewa chiefs during the negotiations. Historian Satz says this symbolized disagreement rather than acceptance {{of the terms of}} the treaty. Lyman Warren, a trader and interpreter from La Pointe, later complained that the Pillagers (bands from present-day Minnesota) had been bribed into selling the lands rightfully belonging to the Wisconsin bands.|$|E
5|$|Radial {{velocity}} {{is measured}} by the doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of km/s. The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year. With knowledge of the star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.|$|E

He was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS Gascon, but rejoined his unit fifteen days later. On 20 May, Shout was mentioned in the despatch of General Sir Ian Hamilton, General Officer Commanding the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, in recognition of his efforts from the landing on 25 April to 5 May. He was promoted to captain on 29 July.|$|E

5|$|The F-16 was {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> inexpensive {{to build and}} simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy lamination coatings. The number of lubrication points, fuel line connections, and replaceable modules is significantly lower than predecessors; 80% of access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|The flow of {{the river}} has {{decreased}} in power in recent years, partly because of surface run-off in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, especially from the large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway, which sends {{a good deal of}} silt into the system, slowing the flow and creating a risk of flooding downstream. This problem has now been partially alleviated by the construction of the Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> clean.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, {{like those of}} Uranus, are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> young; their age is {{probably}} significantly {{less than that of}} the Solar System. Also, like those of Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E

5|$|The {{rings of}} Uranus are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> young, and {{not more than}} 600million years old. The Uranian ring system {{probably}} originated from the collisional fragmentation of several moons that once existed around the planet. After colliding, the moons probably broke up into many particles, which survived as narrow and optically dense rings only in strictly confined zones of maximum stability.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} streaky features, {{some of them}} {{hundreds}} of kilometers in length, {{that appear to be}} caused by windblown particles. Examination has also shown the surface <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> smooth; the few objects that seem to be impact craters appeared to have been filled in, perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes. Radar altimetry suggests height variation is low, typically no more than 150meters. Occasional elevation changes of 500meters have been discovered and Titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than 1 kilometer in height.|$|E
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E

5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|Charles's force {{consisted}} of 3,500 horse, organised into four brigades, the largest grouping being the 1,200 {{soldiers of the}} Northern Horse under Sir Marmaduke Langdale. In addition, there was Gerard's brigade, consisting of 800 men who had served under him in South Wales, Sir William Vaughan's 1,000-strong brigade, and the 200 members of the Life Guards, Charles's personal bodyguard, under Lord Bernard Stewart. Although experienced, the troops were depleted in number, and had low morale due to the recent string of defeats. Charles and Gerard evaded the loose Parliamentarian siege around the city, taking 600 men into Chester, while the approximately 3,000 remaining cavalry under Langdale crossed the River Dee at Holt and bivouacked at Hatton Heath, five {{miles to the south}} of Chester itself. The plan was to trap the besiegers between the two forces, destroying them or forcing them to retreat; as they numbered only 500 cavalry and 1,500 foot, this was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> simple.|$|E
5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E

5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> small, {{both for}} cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many {{of the larger}} houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E
5|$|Humidity: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{appears to}} require sustained, very high humidity. Active snails were found only when {{relative}} humidity approached 100 percent; during dry periods, snails were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> inactive. Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum humidity or saturation in the spray {{zone of the}} Falls. However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of}} the ledge nearest the Falls. Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and humidity data loggers shows that these snails occur in an area where the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season. Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at the Falls relative to the high-humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E
