5|$|Benchley {{returned}} to the cinema in 1937, cast in the revue Broadway Melody of 1938, and in his largest role to that point, the critically panned Live, Love and Learn. A short that Benchley completed for MGM, A Night at the Movies, was Benchley's greatest success since How to Sleep, and won him a contract for more short films that would be produced in New York. These films were produced more quickly than his previous efforts (while How to Sleep needed two days, the later short How to Vote needed less than twelve hours), and took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Benchley. He still completed two shoots in one day (one of which was The Courtship of the Newt), but rested for a while following the 1937 schedule.|$|E
5|$|Concerts and boxing matches {{eventually}} took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the pitch. In 2008, late post-concert pitch renovation, {{combined with}} an early start to the football season, led to the pitch not being ready for the first home fixture, causing the club to play its UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium and a moratorium to be imposed on the staging of non-football events at Eastlands. In May 2010, the club invested in a new pitch and summer concerts resumed in 2011 when Take That played eight nights, with ticket sales totalling approximately 400,000.|$|E

After the return of Howard Kendall as manager in November 1990, Whiteside managed to appear in a few reserve team games, but this only delayed the inevitable, and {{he was forced to}} retire from the game at the age of 26 in June 1991. He had a testimonial game between Manchester United and Everton at Old Trafford in May 1992, but as United lost the title the previous week, only 7,434 turned out for the occasion.|$|E

By 1931, the twin depredations of the Great Depression and the U.S. Soccer Wars had taken <b>their</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> the American Soccer League. Several teams were folding and others were relocating in attempts to maintain their financial solvency. Sam Mark had moved the Marksmen to New York City.

5|$|In 1941, the German night fighter intruders began {{achieving}} substantial successes. British ground defences, {{which had}} taken <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the German units in 1940, were now side-stepped by {{a decision to}} shift the area of operations to the North Sea, by the English coast. In June German night fighter units claimed 22 RAF aircraft; 18 over the sea. In July 19 British aircraft were claimed for four losses. By October 1941 British loss records listed 54 aircraft of all types destroyed and a further 44 damaged in these operations to all causes. German losses amounted to 27 destroyed and 31 damaged to all causes.|$|E
5|$|The JTWC {{estimated}} Mala to {{have been}} a stronger system, with peak winds of 220km/h (140mph) and a pressure of 922mb (hPa; 27.23inHg)— equivalent to a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Their Dvorak values peaked at T#6.5 or 235km/h (146mph). As the powerful storm approached Myanmar, the combined effects of increasing wind shear and land interaction soon took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Mala. At 0700UTC on April29, Mala made landfall just south of Thandwe in Myanmar's Rakhine State as a very severe cyclonic storm. The JTWC estimated winds at this time {{to have been}} 165km/h (105mph). Rapid weakening ensued once the cyclone moved onshore. Within 12hours of landfall, Mala weakened to a deep depression and was last noted as a dissipating system earl on April30.|$|E
5|$|After peak intensity, the cyclone's eye {{soon began}} to fill and cool as {{weakening}} ensued. Defying previous forecasts, Hellen continued on a southeasterly track toward Madagascar {{and the likelihood of}} it making landfall became apparent. By the end of March30, Hellen's eye had collapsed and disappeared from satellite imagery, as the combination of dry air and land interaction took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the storm. At about 0800UTC on March31, Hellen made landfall on Mitsinjo, and the previously unfavorable conditions coupled with land interaction to induce rapid weakening. The ridge to the east turned Hellen to a southwest drift over land. By early on April1, the convection largely dissipated as the center became difficult to locate, with peak winds dropping to 45km/h (30mph). As a result, Météo-France discontinued advisories that day, as did the JTWC. The remnants moved back over open waters, but were not expected to reorganize due to the poor nature of the convection. As the low continued to the west, the convection increased on April4 while approaching the coastline of Mozambique, although the system failed to redevelop before moving onshore.|$|E
50|$|This type of cat {{and mouse}} scuffle {{happened}} throughout the summer of 1887. The cost of paying these men {{day in and day}} out began taking <b>their</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> the businessmen as they almost were bankrupt (or at least were out of cash). Both sides owned most of the large land tracts in Perry County. Both sides agreed to a meeting at Big Creek and a peace was formulated. The written agreements were signed and witnessed. The agreement stated that they could return home, would disband their armies, and surrender their guns. The grudge was still there and, soon after their funds were replenished, French accused Eversole of taking his guns back from Judge Josiah Combs, Eversole's father-in-law. Eversole claimed that French hadn't witnessed that, that he hadn't disbanded his army, and that the deal only called for a partial surrender of arms. The short lived peace crumbled.|$|R

5|$|By day six, 22 September, {{the battle}} {{had settled into}} a routine of mortaring and small probing attacks at times {{supported}} by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of {{the pressure on the}} division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them. The following day began in a similar way to previous days with a mortar and artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company who were all defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, food and water shortages also took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the men, with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire. On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force. This broke up most assaults before they got started.|$|E
5|$|Flooding and {{landslides}} in Jamaica took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> property, agricultural interests, and infrastructure; fruit growers on {{the island}} sustained about $2.5 million (1935 USD) in losses. Just off the coast, an unidentified vessel went down with her entire crew in the hostile conditions. Strong winds buffeted coastal sections of Cuba, notably in and around Santiago de Cuba. There, the hurricane demolished 100 homes and filled streets with debris. Only four {{people died in the}} country, thanks to the extensive pre-storm preparations. The storm did the most damage along the Tiburon Peninsula of southwestern Haiti, where catastrophic river flooding took the lives of up to 2,000 individuals, razed hundreds of native houses, and destroyed crops and livestock. The heaviest destruction took place around the towns of Jacmel and Jérémie; one early report estimated that 1,500 had been killed at the latter. Entire swaths of countryside were isolated for days, delaying both reconnaissance and relief efforts.|$|E
5|$|Hours after {{attaining}} {{its peak}} intensity, Fred began to weaken as clouds {{began to fill}} the eye. By this time, the hurricane was beginning to turn toward the northwest as a subtropical ridge to the north weakened. Continued weakening took place as dry air started to erode convection along {{the southern edge of}} the system and the eye was no longer present on satellite imagery and wind shear also increased. Convection gradually became elongated in response to the shear and outflow was mostly restricted to the northeast region of the hurricane. By September10, the mid-level circulation center was displaced from the low-level circulation center. On September11, the convective pattern of Fred had no organized shape to it and the NHC downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm. Unrelenting shear and dry air finally took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> September12. By that time, no deep convection was associated with the main circulation of Fred, leaving the center fully exposed. The storm degenerated into a remnant-low later that day, corresponding with the final advisory from the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

5|$|Israeli aerial {{supremacy}} prompted Egypt {{to turn to}} the USSR {{for assistance}} and by the spring of 1970 an entire Soviet air defence division had deployed to Egypt. The Soviet presence spelled the end of Priha and Egypt regained the initiative, rolling its air defence array towards the Suez Canal. The IAF sought to hamper these advances through a renewed SEAD campaign and 69 Squadron saw repeated action against Egyptian air defences and related infrastructure. Egyptian SAMs, however, soon exacted <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the attackers, with Rami Harpaz and Achikar Eyal falling into Egyptian captivity on June 30, a fate shared by Amos Zamir and Amos Levitov on July 5. AN/ALQ-71 Electronic countermeasures (ECM) pods were soon rushed to Israel but proved only partially effective against surface-to-air missiles. On July 18, the IAF attempted to fly eight F-4 Phantoms in close-knit pod formations thought to maximize the effect of the ECM pods, only to lose 201 Squadron leader Shmuel Hetz, while an injured Avihu Ben-nun was forced to crash land his badly damaged aircraft at Rephidim.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, RhAR patrols in the Chaah, Labis, Bekok and Sungai Karas areas were stepped up to last between 10 and 18 days each, but {{contacts}} with the communist forces remained rare. The constant patrols gradually began to take <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the insurgents, and guerrillas began to give themselves up increasingly frequently. A contributing factor here was Britain's granting of independence to Malaya within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957, which dented the motivation of many fighters. Starting in October 1957, the RhAR were tasked to work alongside former MNLA personnel to wipe out any remaining communist forces in the region. The ex-insurgents were supposed to lead the security forces to MNLA camps and resting places, but this strategy was not successful. The RhAR soon developed a low opinion of these ex-MNLA men.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} {{to the race}} highlighted {{the dominance of the}} Kenyan and Ethiopian runners as they set a high tempo from the outset. By the time the first 5km marker was passed, Australia's Nikki Chapple was the only athlete left in the leading pack to come from outside the two historically strong nations. A few kilometres later, she dropped back from the pack and at the 10km mark five Ethiopians and four Kenyans had a fifteen-second advantage {{on the rest of the}} field. As the race reached the midway point, the temperature began to increase and the heat and humidity reduced the pace of the runners. The conditions took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> some of the leaders in this section of the race. Chepchirchir slowed considerably while Meseret Mengistu, Joyce Chepkirui and Fate Tola were the next to gradually lose contact with the front runners.

5|$|Tropical Cyclone Sose was a {{moderate}} storm system that chiefly impacted the island nation of Vanuatu in early April 2001. The developing cyclone was first detected on April 3, while situated {{well to the}} northeast of Vanuatu. As atmospheric conditions became more conducive to intensification, the disturbance gradually consolidated as it drifted toward the west-southwest. After receiving the name Sose on April 5, the cyclone was driven southeastward, passing just west of Espiritu Santo and neighboring islands. Although it never made landfall, Sose was particularly expansive, producing a wide area of gale-force winds. The cyclone peaked in strength between April 7 and 8 with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and 1-minute sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph), placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Ultimately, stronger wind shear and an increasingly hostile upper-air pattern took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the cyclone as it progressed due south; Sose lost tropical characteristics to the northeast of Norfolk Island by April 12. The extratropical remnants of Sose continued into the Tasman Sea.|$|E
5|$|With the {{hurricane}} situated {{to the southwest}} of the Hawaiian Islands, Hurricane Hunters conducted several weather reconnaissance missions into the storm. On September2, they found maximum surface winds of 125mph (205km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 957mbar (hPa; 28.26inHg); this corresponded to the peak intensity of Uleki. At the time, Uleki displayed a well-organized, tight circulation. The hurricane meandered in the same general area {{over the next two}} days, executing several small loops, with a slight northward drift. During this time, its circulation increased in coverage but became less-organized as weakening ensued. Increased wind shear and restricted outflow took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> {{the hurricane}}. The cyclone's winds dropped to 80mph (130km/h) by 12:00UTC on September4 as it resumed its west-northwest track under the influence of a subtropical ridge away from the Hawaiian Islands. Uleki passed roughly halfway between Johnston Atoll and the French Frigate Shoals on September5. By September7, the weakened trend halted and environmental conditions favored reintensification. As Uleki neared the International Dateline, it regained winds of 105mph (165km/h).|$|E

50|$|Queen Street {{forms the}} western {{boundary}} {{line of the}} Durand neighbourhood. Durand is also bounded by Main Street to the north, James Street and James Mountain Road {{to the east and}} the Niagara escarpment to the south. With the turn of the 20th century, luxurious new residences were built along Markland and Aberdeen Avenues and to the south in the lee of the escarpment. These residences reflected the entrepreneurial spirit of those who made their fortunes in transportation, finance, industry, and commerce in one of North Americas major centres, Hamilton. By 1920, the Durand neighbourhood was considered to be the “exclusive” neighbourhood in Hamilton. However, the Great Depression and the Second World War took <b>their</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> the fortunes of many of the established Durand households. Owners could no longer afford the taxes and upkeep on their homes, and many of the grander residences were either demolished and replaced with middle-class low-rise housing, or were renovated to become low-rise apartment buildings. Fortunately, much of the heritage of the neighbourhood survives today.The Hamilton A.A.A. Grounds, (Hamilton Amateur Athletic Association Grounds), is a park that was home to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats from 1872-1949. Entrance to the park at Queen Street South is right before Charlton Avenue West. Today it is also the site of the Hamilton Tennis Club. Today Ivor Wynne Stadium is the home of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. It's off of Beachwood Avenue, 2 blocks West of Gage Avenue North.|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} wind shear finally took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> late <b>on</b> January 4, and Zeta's {{convection}} began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm. The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed {{to have been}} an error. Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and dissipated into a remnant later that day. With this transition, the very active 2005 hurricane season finally came to a close. The remnant low retained its identity for a further day before it dissipated 660miles (1060km) southeast of Bermuda.|$|R
5|$|Having {{crossed the}} Niemen river with his Corps, Nansouty would {{continuously}} march {{under the command}} of Joachim Murat during this campaign, preceding the advance of the army and taking Wilna as they advanced. Despite marching constantly alongside Murat and Emperor Napoleon, Nansouty's Ist Corps of cavalry reserve saw little action, combating brilliantly in a vanguard action at Ostrovno and then briefly at Vitebsk. An incident involving some of Nansouty's light cavalry occurred during the combat at Vitebsk, when the 8th Hussars and 16th Chasseurs à cheval turned and fled before the Russian light horse. This was evidence that the division of Bruyères, of which they were a part, had been much used by always being placed at the vanguard of the army, resulting in the loss many of the best and bravest troopers. Despite Nansouty's best efforts, the extremely long and exhausting marches, the torrential rains and the absence of proper fodder took <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the Ist Cavalry Corps, with numbers reduced to half by this time. Additionally, just like the other Cavalry Corps commanders, Nansouty rarely had all his troops under direct control, which led to cavalry being used improperly at times.|$|E
