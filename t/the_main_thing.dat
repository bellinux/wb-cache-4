25|$|Skinner {{believed}} that effective teaching {{must be based}} on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of rote learning and punitive discipline in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.|$|E
25|$|A {{workbench}} is a table used by woodworkers to hold workpieces {{while they}} are worked by other tools. There are many styles of woodworking benches, each reflecting the type {{of work to be}} done or the craftsman's way of working. Most benches have two features in common: they are heavy and rigid enough to keep still while the wood is being worked, and there is some method for holding the work in place at a comfortable position and height so that the worker is free to use both hands on the tools. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> that distinguishes benches is the way in which the work is held in place. Most benches have more than one way to do this, depending on the operation being performed.|$|E

500|$|A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh, was {{released}} by Apple Corps that year, followed by a concert film in 1972. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: [...] "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems... they still got plenty... {{even though it was}} a drop in the ocean. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended." [...] The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid.|$|E

He declared support for the War in Iraq and tougher immigration laws, and advocated limits on divorce, an increased {{role of religion in}} schools and a decrease in government welfare programs. In an August interview with Weekend America, he explained his platform, [...] "e want to have protected borders and keep our gun rights and a lot of conservative things, but <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> is help America realize that 95 percent of violent crime is connected with alcohol." ...|$|E

500|$|Gay genre films remain rare, {{and science}} fiction films' {{inclusion}} of gay characters continues to relegate them to supporting roles, {{such as the}} [...] "stereotypical, limp-wristed, frantic homosexual" [...] minor character in the 1996 blockbuster Independence Day, a film whose main theme {{has been described as}} being the anxiety surrounding male friendships and homosexual panic. It is also {{interesting to note that the}} film's director, Roland Emmerich, is openly gay. Still there are some curious cases like Cthulhu (2007) a horror/thriller film based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, in which the main character is gay but it isn't <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing,</b> although it is important in the development of the character's psychology. The film is plagued with monsters and disturbing happenings. Also, in V for Vendetta there are two secondary characters – one gay, one lesbian – shown as victims of the totalitarian dystopia. 2012 saw the light of the epic Wachowskis + Tom Tykwer blockbuster, Cloud Atlas, featuring in one of the six stories a couple of gay characters.|$|E
500|$|Griffith {{continued}} to have faith in Neuer during the exhibition season, and said he could potentially be [...] "one of the greatest ever in the twirling line." [...] Instead of working on his control during that time, which was considered <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> he needed to work on, he practiced throwing the knuckleball and spitball. Griffith encouraged him to do so, believing that developing these trick pitches {{would allow him to}} become a great pitcher, and as a result, he practiced these pitches until, according to one sportswriter, [...] "he was so wild he couldn’t hit the grand stand." [...] In one exhibition game against Atlanta, he appeared in relief of Jack Chesbro, and allowed four runs in less than an inning due to his lack of control. His pitching {{continued to}} get worse, {{and by the end of}} spring training he was sent to the Newark Indians of the Eastern League. He never returned to the major leagues, becoming the only person to throw a shutout in both his major league debut and his final game.|$|E
500|$|After this album, {{the group}} planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to {{facilitate}} their solo careers. Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years? <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's a good business move." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding the {{structure}} of Chaplin's films, the scholar Gerald Mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline. Visually, his films are simple and economic, with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage. His approach to filming was described by the art director Eugène Lourié: [...] "Chaplin did not think in 'artistic' images when he was shooting. He believed that action is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing.</b> The camera is there to photograph the actors". In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, [...] "Simplicity is best... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant... The camera should not intrude." [...] This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being [...] "old fashioned", while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium. Kamin, however, comments that Chaplin's comedic talent {{would not be enough}} to remain funny on screen if he did not have an [...] "ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium".|$|E
500|$|For Stampede, {{the members}} went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a {{recording}} process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, {{surrounded by the}} obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. [...] "We were doing it at my house solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," [...] Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. [...] "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> that I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," [...] Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed {{for the creation of}} a big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. [...] "We slept there, so if one of us just came up with an idea, we could jump on it," [...] guitarist Tom Maxwell said.|$|E
500|$|Damien Leith stated how {{his debut}} studio album wanted to pan out: [...] "I didn't {{really want to}} do anybody else's songs... I just wanted this album to be mine". Immediately after Australian Idol concluded, he {{convinced}} the producers of the show to break from protocol by giving him longer time to record the album. The protocol was that the Australian Idol winners had only one week after the competition ended to record their first album. He decided to work on his first studio album for the next few months. Leith was aware of the little success of the previous two Idol winners, Casey Donovan and Kate DeAraugo, so he decided to turn something more palpable than the previous winners by producing an album of original songs. He comments, [...] "I suppose <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> for me was trying to establish myself as a songwriter out of it because that's something that hasn't really been promoted in the past." [...] He was determined to create as much original material as possible for the album, and create songs that truly represent who he was. He also wanted the themes in the lyrics to not only be personal, but broad enough so that listeners can relate to them.|$|E

500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And I just thought he did that so great." ...|$|E
500|$|Will Salmon at SFX {{scored the}} episode 3.5 stars out of 5, feeling that [...] "The 'agent gone bad' is a {{hackneyed}} trope, but this works, {{largely because of}} Pascale Armand’s strong, understated performance" [...] and praising the opening sequence as being [...] "wonderfully eerie", comparing it positively to Doctor Who and The Avengers. Graeme Virtue at The Guardian praised the more focused, personal stakes of the episode, noting that [...] "it's easier to cheer for scrappy underdogs than a huge, militarised Big Brother organisation like SHIELD", as well as Grant Ward's storyline, but criticized the episode's use of Bear McCreary's score, calling it [...] "backgrounded". Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter praised the episode for its much more realistic (compared to previous episodes) familial environment, complete with tension, {{as well as the}} character of Akela Amador and the fact that [...] "Agent Coulson {{was at the center of}} the action, where he belongs". Den of Geeks James Hunt surmised that [...] "Agents of SHIELD is definitely getting better and that's <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> to take away from this episode. At this rate it should actually be quite good (rather than forgivably average) by Christmas. Let's hope the viewers last that long." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the episode [...] "had an overall cohesion not previously in evidence", but criticized it as unambitious, noting that [...] "stripping the Marvel concept to its visual minimum makes little sense".|$|E

In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories.

[...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game.
