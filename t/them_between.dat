Nearly all the fighting was outside of the state's boundaries. Only one significant conflict, known as Morgan's Raid, occurred on Indiana soil during the war. The raid, which caused a brief panic in Indianapolis and southern Indiana, was preceded by two minor incursions into Indiana.|$|E

Cross-compatibility between the Wii U and 3DS versions was also confirmed, allowing players to customize their characters and transfer <b>them</b> <b>between</b> versions. While development had begun, Sakurai stated that the early announcement was made public in order to attract developers needed for the game. The titles are also the first games to utilize Nintendo's Amiibo platform. The new Super Smash Bros. titles were released in late 2014.|$|E

5|$|Rozen Maiden is {{authored}} by Peach-Pit and was serialized in Gentosha's Monthly Comic Birz between issues September 2002 and July 2007. Gentosha compiled the individual chapters into eight tankōbon volumes released between March 2003 and June 2007. These volumes were later recompiled into seven shinsōban volumes by Shueisha and released between April 2008 and November 2008. Tokyopop localized Gentosha's tankōbon volumes in English for North America and released <b>them</b> <b>between</b> May 2006 and May 2008. In 2011, Tokyopop's North American division was closed down and their licenses to manga franchises were revoked. Tokyopop's translations were distributed in Australasia by Madman Entertainment. The series {{has also been}} localized in other languages such as Chinese, French, and Italian.|$|E
5|$|The 503rd Parachute Infantry {{lost three}} men killed and 33 {{injured in the}} jump. Another eight were killed and 12 wounded in action against the Japanese, and 26 were {{evacuated}} sick. The 2/5th Field Ambulance treated 55 jump casualties on 7 September. Between 5 and 19 September, the 7th Division reported 38 killed and 104 wounded, while another 138 were evacuated sick. To this must be added the 11 Americans and 59 Australians killed and 92 Australians injured in the air crash at Jackson's Airfield. Thus, 119 Allied servicemen were killed, 241 wounded or injured, and 166 evacuated sick. Japanese casualties were estimated at 2,200, but {{it is impossible to}} apportion <b>them</b> <b>between</b> the 7th and 9th Divisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} keeps {{were built}} {{as part of}} motte-and-bailey castles from the 10th century onwards – a combination of documentary and archaeological evidence places the first such castle, built at Vincy, in 979. These castles were initially built by the more powerful lords of Anjou in the late 10th and 11th centuries, in particular Fulk III and his son, Geoffrey II, who built {{a great number of}} <b>them</b> <b>between</b> 987 and 1060. William the Conqueror then introduced this form of castle into England when he invaded in 1066, and the design spread through south Wales as the Normans expanded up the valleys during the subsequent decades.|$|E

During World War II, the school taught students from {{a good number of}} southwestern tribes. During the 1950s, as the tribe was fighting against termination, the emphasis of the school was on vocational and technical training. Beginning in 1960, the BIA contracted for schools to be built near other tribes, and attendance at the school started to drop.|$|E
5|$|Two {{established}} meteor showers {{originate from}} within Corvus' boundaries. German astronomer Cuno Hoffmeister discovered and named the Corvids in 1937, after observing <b>them</b> <b>between</b> June 25 and July 2. They {{have not been}} seen since, nor was there evidence of a shower when previous records were examined. Hoffmeister noted the trajectory of the shower {{was similar to that}} of the comet 11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR, though this was not confirmed by Zhukov and colleagues in 2011. The shower has been tentatively linked with 4015 Wilson–Harrington. In January 2013, the MO Video Meteor Network published the discovery of the Eta Corvids, assigning some 300 meteors seen between January 20 and 26. Their existence was confirmed by data analysis later that year.|$|E
5|$|While the EU's {{system of}} {{governance}} is largely unique, elements {{can be compared to}} other models. One general observation {{on the nature of the}} distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised <b>them)</b> <b>between</b> the levels of government, and the states participate strongly with decision making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers are clearly divided between the levels of government, and the states have little say in federal decision making.|$|E
5000|$|The Hausdorff {{distance}} and the (area of the) symmetric difference are both pseudo-metrics {{on the set}} of measurable geometric shapes. However, they behave quite differently. The figure at the right shows two sequences of shapes, [...] "Red" [...] and [...] "Red ∪ Green". When the Hausdorff distance <b>between</b> <b>them</b> becomes smaller, the area of the symmetric difference <b>between</b> <b>them</b> becomes larger, and vice versa. By continuing these sequences in both directions, it is possible to get two sequences such that the Hausdorff distance <b>between</b> <b>them</b> converges to 0 and the symmetric distance <b>between</b> <b>them</b> diverges, or vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|A boxology is a {{representation}} of an organized structure as a graph of labeled nodes ("boxes") and connections <b>between</b> <b>them</b> (as lines or arrows). The concept is useful because many problems in systems design are reducible to modular [...] "black boxes" [...] and connections or flow channels <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> The term is somewhat tongue-in-cheek and refers to the generic nature of diagrams containing labelled nodes and (sometimes directed) paths <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
