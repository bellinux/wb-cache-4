However, due to heavy rain on the Tuesday, many teams abandoned their initial <b>test</b> <b>schedule</b> and instead looked to focus on wet-weather set-ups. Both Ferrari and Red Bull took advantage of these conditions and scored first and second fastest times respectively on both Tuesday and Wednesday.

25|$|The {{design change}} imposed a two-year delay into the {{original}} timetable and increased development costs from US$5.3billion (€5.5B) to approximately US$10billion (€9.7B). The total development {{cost for the}} A350 was estimated at US$15billion by Reuters (€12billion or £10billion). The original mid-2013 delivery date of the A350 changed, as a longer than anticipated development forced Airbus to delay the final assembly and first flight of the aircraft to {{the third quarter of}} 2012 and second quarter of 2013 respectively. As a result, the flight <b>test</b> <b>schedule</b> was compressed from the original 15 months to 12 months.

25|$|The April 2016 Report {{from the}} U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{described}} Boeing’s <b>test</b> <b>schedule</b> for the KC-46 program as “optimistic” and projects Boeing will need an additional four months beyond the August 2017 target to deliver 18 full-up tankers due to testing and parts qualification issues. The report notes that operational testing will not now begin until May 2017 {{and will not}} be completed until two months after the first tranche of 18 aircraft are delivered, risking late discoveries of problems. The GAO also noted that Boeing has not obtained Federal Aviation Administration's approval for two key aerial refueling systems - the centerline drogue system and the wing aerial refueling pods, which were built without following FAA processes. Boeing now projects these components will be ready for the FAA to certify by July 2017 — over three years late. The 18 aircraft were meant to include the four developmental aircraft, brought up to an operational standard, plus the first 14 low-rate production (LRP) examples. Instead, 16 of the 18 will be production line examples; because the aircraft will be delivered before operational testing is complete, Boeing will be responsible for any late design fixes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Reducing test cost by {{minimizing}} the overall test time {{remains one of}} the main goals of System-on-Chip (SoC) testing. Power-aware strategies optimize the overall test time of a SoC for a global peak power budget. Test time and test power can be regulated by VDD and test clock frequency to optimize SoC <b>test</b> <b>schedules</b> for a given power budget. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) techniques have been used in the past to optimize energy efficiency in SoCs. In this paper, we extend the concept of DVFS to optimize the <b>test</b> <b>scheduling</b> of SoC. We adopt a sessionless <b>test</b> <b>scheduling</b> strategy and provide a simple heuristic approach for its optimization. The proposed idea is implemented on several ITC 02 benchmarks. Results show significant test time reduction over sessionless reference <b>test</b> <b>schedules</b> for which VDD and clock frequency are fixed at nominal values. I...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{systems have}} become highly complex, {{which results in}} a {{dramatic}} increase of both design and production cost. Recently a core-based system-on-chip (SoC) design methodology has been employed {{in order to reduce}} these costs. However, testing of SoCs has been facing challenges such as long test application time and high temperature during test. In this thesis, we address the problem of minimizing test application time for SoCs and propose three techniques to generate efficient <b>test</b> <b>schedules.</b> First, a defect-probability driven <b>test</b> <b>scheduling</b> technique is presented for production test, in which an abort-on-first-fail (AOFF) test approach is employed and a hybrid built-in self-test architecture is assumed. Using an AOFF test approach, the test process can be aborted as soon as the first fault is detected. Given the defect probabilities of individual cores, a method is proposed to calculate the expected test application time (ETAT). A heuristic is then proposed to generate <b>test</b> <b>schedules</b> with minimized ETATs. Second, a power-constrained <b>test</b> <b>scheduling</b> approach using <b>test</b> set partitioning is proposed. It assumes that, during the test, the total amount of power consumed by the cores being tested in parallel has to be lower than a given limit. A heuristic is proposed to minimize the test application time, in which a test set partitioning technique is employed to generate more efficient <b>test</b> <b>schedules.</b> Third, a thermal-aware <b>test</b> <b>scheduling</b> approach is presented, in which test set partitioning and interleaving are employed. A constraint logic programming (CLP) approach is deployed to find the optimal solution. Moreover, a heuristic is also developed to generate near-optimal <b>test</b> <b>schedules</b> especially for large designs to which the CLP-based algorithm is inapplicable. Experiments based on benchmark designs have been carried out to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed techniques. 200...|$|R
