Within a couple of years, all the structures had been removed, {{with the exception of}} the two sentry posts at the entrance, the cemetery monument, and the former Manzanar High School auditorium, which was purchased by the County of Inyo.

The building, once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester, was not regarded as architecturally interesting, and was demolished in the spring of 2008.

5|$|Everybody {{had thought}} St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural {{firebreak}} {{in the form}} of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E
5|$|For two years, from 1948–1950, {{work was}} done on the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch.

This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E
