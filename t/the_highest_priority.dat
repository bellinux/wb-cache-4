5|$|By {{this point}} the Air Ministry was desperate to get any unit into service. Satisfied with his visit in May, Dowding {{suggested}} that the Mk. I {{was good enough for}} operational testing purposes. On 11 June 1939, AI was given <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> and provisions were made to supply 11 additional Blenheims to No 25 squadron at RAF Hawkinge (for a total of 21). Since each of the parts came from different suppliers, and the fitters were unfamiliar with any of it, members of the AI team would have to hand-assemble the components as they arrived and instruct the fitters on the sets.|$|E
5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>priority.</b> Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had not developed such weapons.|$|E
2500|$|When an alkene {{has more}} than one {{substituent}} (especially necessary with 3 or 4 substituents), the double bond geometry is described using the labels E and Z.

40|$|The Optical burst {{switching}} (OBS) {{networks have}} been attracting much consideration as a promising approach {{to build the}} next generation optical Internet. Aggregating the burst in the OBS networks from <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> traffic will increase {{the average of the}} loss of its packets. However, the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> traffic (e. g. real-time traffic) in the burst is a very important factor for reducing the data loss, and ensuring the fairness between network traffic types. This paper introduces a statistical study based on the significant difference between the traffics to find the fairness ratio for <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> traffic packets against the low priority traffic packets inside the data burst with various network traffic loads. The results show an improvement in the OBS quality of service (QoS) performance and <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> traffic packets fairness ratio inside the data burst is 50 to 60 %, 30 to 40 %, and 10 to 20 % for high, normal, and low traffic loads, respectively...|$|R

5|$|By January 1974, a {{joint working}} party {{representing}} Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county. <b>The</b> <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> was {{to increase the}} quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation—much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the 25 {{personnel}} of the Comité {{joined the}} CIA officers in sorting and processing the seized documents. The CIA officers had a separate side {{entrance to the}} building in which the operations took place, {{in order to maintain}} the image that the operation was a Guatemalan internal affair. The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of every document was to remain in Guatemala. Approximately half of the paper that had been gathered was incinerated. The CIA gave <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> to the documents seized from the PGT.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} to redeploy to the Mariana Islands. The Command ceased its {{attacks on}} Japan and East Asia, {{for which it}} used bases in China to refuel the B-29s en route to their targets, and instead focused on targets in Southeast Asia that could be reached from Kharagpur. As there were few industrial targets within range of Kharagpur, <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> was given to attacking shipping in major ports such as Rangoon, Bangkok and Singapore as well as smaller harbours. Attacks were conducted through both conventional bombing and laying naval mines. As part of the transition, LeMay departed for the Mariana Islands on 18 January {{and was replaced by}} Brigadier General Roger M. Ramsey.|$|E

5|$|Mirs Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) {{provided}} or controlled atmospheric pressure, fire detection, oxygen levels, {{waste management}} and water supply. <b>The</b> <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> for the ECLSS was the station's atmosphere, {{but the system}} also collected, processed, and stored waste and water produced and used by the crew—a process that recycles fluid from the sink, toilet, and condensation from the air. The Elektron system generated oxygen. Bottled oxygen and Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) canisters, a system known as Vika, provided backup. Carbon dioxide {{was removed from the}} air by the Vozdukh system. Other byproducts of human metabolism, such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat, were removed by activated charcoal filters. Similar systems are presently used on the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|The symbols {{used for}} clouds emulate the cloud shape.

5|$|The various {{agencies}} {{that participated in}} Operation PBHistory had different aims in mind for {{the products of the}} operation. The CIA was most interested in using the information gathered against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> of the United States Information Agency was to use the documents to release information {{that could be used to}} change international opinion. The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these various interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use. The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, Operation Kufire and Operation Kugown, both of which had been a part of Operation PBSUCCESS.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944 General George Kenney, the {{commander}} of the Allied air forces in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), adopted a goal of landing forces at Selaru Island in the eastern NEI and establishing a bomber base there. Accordingly, in early March, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, who led RAAF Command, presented Kenney with a proposal for the RAAF to contribute two fighter wings and several ancillary units to this operation, which at the time was scheduled for 15June. One of these wings would be equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks and the other with Spitfires. In March Group Captain Clive Caldwell, the RAAF's highest-scoring flying ace of the war, reluctantly accepted command of the projected Spitfire wing after his request for a transfer to Europe was rejected by Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice Marshal George Jones. In a meeting between Jones and Caldwell, Jones stated that the wing would have <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> for supplies and equipment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel architecture of internally two priority buffered Multistage Interconnection Network (MIN). First, we compare by simulation the new architecture against a single priority MIN and demonstrate up to N times <b>higher</b> throughput for <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> traffic {{in a hot}} spot situation, when N {{is the number of}} inputs. In addition, under uniform traffic assumption we show an increase in the low priority throughput, without any change in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> throughput. Moreover, while in the single <b>priority</b> system <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> delay and its standard deviation are increased when low priority traffic is present, it is kept constant in the dual priority system. Finally, we introduce a new approach of long Markovian memory performance model to better capture the packets dependency in a single priority MIN under uniform traffic and extend this model for a dual priority MIN. Model results are shown to be very accurate...|$|R
