In fact, it is the one poem in this group <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> but is not [...] Like 'France' too, the poem suffers from a lack of 'heart'." [...] George Watson declares that the poem [...] "shows how precarious Coleridge's new achievement was. It is a shameless return to the older, effusive manner, evidently written in a white heat of patriotic indignation against the degradation of English public opinion during the French wars, and it is only by stretching charity that it can be considered a conversation poem at all." ...|$|E
500|$|In June, Romney {{said that}} he would not vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton either, saying: [...] "It's a matter of {{personal}} conscience. I can’t vote for either of those two people." [...] He suggested that he may vote for a third-party candidate, or write-in his wife's name, saying she would be [...] "an ideal president". When pressed on who of Trump and Clinton was more qualified to be President, Romney quoted P. J. O'Rourke: [...] "Hillary Clinton is wrong on every issue, but she's wrong within the normal parameters." [...] He considered voting for the Libertarian ticket of former Republican Governors Gary Johnson and William Weld, saying that he would [...] "get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he's someone who I could end up voting for", adding that [...] "if Bill Weld were {{at the top of the}} ticket, it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president." [...] In September he called for Johnson to be included in the presidential debates and in October it emerged that Independent candidate Evan McMullin was using an email list of 2.5 million Romney supporters to raise money. McMullin's chief strategist said that it was purchased from Romney for President and that [...] "we'll let other folks discuss what <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> and certainly never speak for [...] ". A spokeswoman for Romney said that the list had been [...] "rented by several political candidates in the presidential primary, and by countless other political and commercial users in the time since the 2012 campaign" [...] and Romney made no public comment on McMullin's candidacy. Romney and his wife cast early ballots in Utah, but he declined to say who he voted for.|$|E

In the fury of my bitterness and passion I actually bought the book, thereby ensuring that my enemy would get some of my money. I opened it prepared to find some brutality, some blasphemy, which would really be an exception to the general silence and sanctity of the railway station. I was prepared to find something in the book that was as infamous as its title.|$|E
