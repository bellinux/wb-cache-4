40|$|Utilizing {{geometry}} based static {{phase separation}} {{exhibited in the}} radial vaned capillary <b>drying</b> <b>tray,</b> a system was conceived to recover water from brine. This technology has been named the Capillary BRIC; abbreviated CapiBRIC. The CapiBRIC utilizes a capillary <b>drying</b> <b>tray</b> within a <b>drying</b> <b>chamber.</b> Water is recovered from clean water vapor evaporating from the free surface leaving waste brine solids behind. A novel approach of optimizing the containment geometry to support passive capillary flow and static phase separation provides {{the opportunity for a}} low power system that is not as susceptible to fouling as membranes or other technologies employing physical barriers across the free brine surface to achieve phase separation in microgravity. Having been optimized for operation in microgravity, full-scale testing of the CapiBRIC as designed cannot be performed on the ground as the force of gravity would dominate over the capillary forces. However, subscale units relevant to full-scale design were used to characterize fill rates, containment stability, and interaction with a variable volume reservoir in the PSU Dryden Drop Tower (DDT) facility. PSU also using tested units scaled such that capillary forces dominated in a 1 -g environment to characterize evaporation from a free-surface in 1 -g upward, sideways and downward orientations. In order to augment the subscale testing performed by PSU, a full scale 1 -g analogue of the CapiBRIC drying unit was initiated to help validate performance predictions regarding expected water recovery ratio, estimated processing time, and interface definitions for inlets, outlets, and internal processes, including vent gas composition. This paper describes the design, development and test of the terrestrial CapiBRIC prototypes...|$|R

Product quality and uniformity of the desired final moisture content {{are affected by the}} uneven air flow and temperature distribution inside the <b>drying</b> <b>chamber.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to numerically evaluate the operation parameters of a new indirect solar dryer having an appropriate design based on thermal uniformity inside the <b>drying</b> <b>chamber,</b> low construction costs and easy accessibility to resources needed for manufacture. The research was focused on both the investigation of different operation conditions and analysis of the influence of the damper position, which is incorporated into the chimney, on the internal cabinet temperature and air flow distribution. Numerical simulation was carried out with Comsol Multiphysics CFD commercial code using a reduced 2 D domain model by neglecting any end effects from the side walls. The analysis of the coupled thermal-fluid model provided the velocity field, pressure distribution and temperature distribution in the solar collector and in the <b>drying</b> <b>chamber</b> when the damper was totally closed, half open and fully open and for different operation conditions.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, an {{indirect}} natural convection updraft solar dryer {{was designed and}} fabricated with objectives to; suit mid-latitude applications, determine its performance efficiency, analyze air properties by use of psychrometric chart and assess the quality of dried product. The dryer was fabricated using low cost and locally available materials. For mid-latitude regions, zenith angle is dependent on latitude, solar declination angle, {{time of the year}} and of the day. Based on these changing parameters, the solar dryer was designed to suit the conditions. The main parts of the dryer are; hinged flexible angled solar collector, <b>drying</b> <b>chamber</b> consisting of three <b>drying</b> <b>trays,</b> updraft chimney with metallic absorber plate. The experiments were carried out to dry sliced apples of 2. 5 mm thickness spread over the <b>drying</b> <b>trays.</b> Temperature and relative humidity of airflow were taken at the collector inlet, <b>drying</b> <b>chamber</b> inlet and <b>drying</b> <b>chamber</b> outlet to chimney using data loggers. Airflow inlet to solar collector and from <b>drying</b> <b>chamber</b> was determined using hot wire anemometers, irradiation in W/m 2 was measured by radiation meter. Drying characteristics such as the collected solar energy to evaporated moisture, average drying rate, moisture content, etc., were determined. Natural convectional flow was adopted with an advantage of utilizing updraft air chimney to induce thermo-siphoning effect hence improving efficiency. In our current study, fresh apples of 886. 64 grams with moisture content of 86 % were dried to moisture content of 8. 12 % (wet basis) within 9 hours 20 minutes at an average irradiance of 534. 45 W/m 2.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore theapplication of ionic interactions between naproxen sodium (NS) and chitosan (CH) in complexes (NSC) prepared by <b>tray</b> <b>drying</b> (TD) and spray drying (SD) methods. Drug–polymer ratio (1 : 1) in the NSC was optimized on the basis of dialysis studies. The particulate systems of NSC were prepared by <b>tray</b> <b>drying</b> (TD) and spray drying (SD) methods. Release retarding polymers were added to the NSC and to the physical mixtures containing NS–CH and their effects on water uptake, matrix erosion and drug release at different pH were compared. Spray dried complexes (SDC) were spherical, free flowing, light and fine amorphous particles in contrast to the crystalline, hard, tenacious, irregularly shaped, denser <b>tray</b> <b>dried</b> complexes (TDC) with poor flowability. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) patterns confirm the conversion of crystalline to high energy amorphous phase suitable for ionic interactions in NSC. Presence of release retarding polymers, kappa carrageenan and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) in the NSC compacts retarded the drug release and improved the matrix integrity. Carrageenan matrices exhibited more retardation than HPMC tablets. FTIR patterns, erosion, swelling and drug release from matrices support ionic interactions between NS and CH in NSC. The reasons for retarded drug release from the chitosan matrices at acidic pH include poor solubility of drug at acidic pH, formation of a rate limiting polymer gel barrier along the periphery of matrices and the ionic interactions between oppositely charged moieties...|$|R

When required preserve food for a time, a dry or dehydrate alternative is removing the water contained therein. There are several ways to achieve this issue, the simplest is to exposed the food into a stream of air with certain conditions of temperature, humidity and velocity. There are several types of solar dryers to achieve proper product treatment. The two basic elements of a solar dryer are manifold where solar radiation heats the air and the <b>drying</b> <b>chamber</b> where the product is dried by the air passing through it, these elements can be designed to integrate the team in different forms.
