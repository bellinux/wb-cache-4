25|$|In their filing, they {{accused the}} Guatemalan state {{of violating the}} victims' human rights by {{allowing}} its agents to kill civilian men, women, and children and by failing <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> situation with measures of judicial protection and guarantees. Guatemala replied to the petition by stating that during the armed conflict both parties committed abuses, and that events {{such as those in}} Plan de Sánchez stand as testimony to that fact. It went on to say, however, that the villagers' petition was inadmissible since it had been presented extemporaneously and because the jurisdictional remedies offered by the domestic courts had not yet been exhausted. The petitioners countered that they had attempted to exhaust the domestic remedies, but had been prevented from so doing by excessive procedural delays {{on the part of the}} state's judicial officers. Finding for the petitioners, the Commission declared the case admissible on 11 March 1999.|$|E
500|$|Calhoun {{rejected}} the belief of Southern {{leaders such as}} Henry Clay that all Americans could agree on the [...] "opinion and feeling" [...] that slavery was wrong, although they might disagree on the most practicable way <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> great wrong. Calhoun's constitutional ideas acted as a viable conservative alternative to Northern appeals to democracy, majority rule, and natural rights.|$|E
500|$|Most {{actions in}} the game use up adventures, {{including}} crafting items and exploring the game world (adventuring). [...] When exploring, players experience combat encounters, in which they fight monsters, as well as non-combat encounters. Combat is turn-based, meaning that the player and the monster take turns attacking one another using weapons, skills and items. [...] Players who successfully defeat a monster receive experience points, pieces of meat (the game's currency), and various items. [...] Non-combat encounters simply present the reader with a text description of an event, occasionally allowing the player to choose how <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> event.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of the episode, Luna {{had also}} hinted at the {{continued}} conflict between Phil Coulson {{and the new}} Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Jeffrey Mace, saying, [...] "Coulson has been doing what he wants, doing his own thing, taking the quinjet out for a spin wherever he needs to go. He’s shooting from the hip {{with a lot of}} these moves he’s making, and I’m sure that’s going to rub the director the wrong way. [...] in who is reportedly a serial killer, so how the director is going <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> we can only wait and see." [...] Bell talked about this, acknowledging that Coulson [...] "wants to have his cake and eat it too", having decided to step down from the role of director himself but still wanting to do what he wants. He said that they were mostly trying to [...] "tee-up" [...] that conflict and give the audience time to get to know Mace before more thoroughly exploring that aspect in later episodes.|$|E
500|$|On October 26, 2010, Levy's then-64-year-old father, Robert, {{took the}} stand and refuted {{statements}} about his past suspicions of Condit. Robert Levy testified that he told authorities {{during the early years}} of the investigation that his daughter Chandra would have been too cautious to jog in the woods alone, but said that he no longer believed this to be true. He said that he also told police that his daughter and Condit had a five-year plan between them to get married. In retrospect, Robert Levy admitted: [...] "I just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as the villain." [...] Levy added that he had been convinced that Condit was [...] "guilty until we learned about this character here," [...] referring to Guandique. On November 1, Condit testified at the trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and Chandra Levy had been involved in a sexual relationship. He replied, [...] "I am not going <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question out of privacy for myself and Chandra." [...] FBI biologist Alan Giusti testified that semen found on underwear from Levy's apartment contained sperm matching Condit's DNA profile.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is typical}} {{for a given}} {{biological}} function {{to be controlled by}} a single mechanism that is capable of sensing the germane conditions and then executing the necessary function [...] The mechanism signals all the systems and tissues that need <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> function by means of organism-wide signals (hormones). If ageing is indeed a biological function, we would expect all or most manifestations of ageing to be similarly controlled by a common mechanism. Various observations (listed below) indeed suggest the existence of a common control mechanism.|$|E

2500|$|When Soros {{was asked}} in 2006 about his {{statement}} in The Age of Fallibility that [...] "the main obstacle to {{a stable and}} just world order is the United States," [...] he responded that [...] "it happens {{to coincide with the}} prevailing opinion in the world. And I think that's rather shocking for Americans to hear. The United States sets the agenda for the world. And {{the rest of the world}} has <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> agenda. By declaring a 'war on terror' after September 11, we set the wrong agenda for the world.... When you wage war, you inevitably create innocent victims." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, {{preferred}} Sony's console to {{the competition}} from Sega, saying [...] "Our game designer likes the Sony machine." [...] Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, Famicom Tsūshin would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation {{a few weeks after}} its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is [...] "fairly average", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, [...] "To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war." [...] An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, [...] "Live in your world. Play in ours." [...] It is stylised as, [...] "LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS." [...] Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled [...] "You Are Not Ready" [...] or [...] "U R NOT [...]" [...] Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that [...] "it's the ultimate challenge. Gamers love <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> tag line and say 'Bullshit. Let me show you how ready I am.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|What but {{a common}} {{antagonism}} would ever keep these multitudes together? I understood why modern electioneering {{is more than}} half of it denunciation. Let us condemn, if possible, let us obstruct and deprive, but not let us do. There is no real appeal to the commonplace mind in [...] "Let us do." [...] That calls for the creative imagination, and few have been accustomed <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> call.

Then he stood over against her, strong and heavy in his revolt, and though he said nothing, still she felt his anger and heavy impatience grip hold of her, she was shaken again as out of a torpor. Again her heart stirred with a quick, out-running impulse, she looked at him, at the stranger who was not a gentleman yet who insisted on coming into her life, and the pain of a new birth in herself strung all her veins to a new form. She would have to begin again, to find a new being, a new form, <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> blind, insistent figure standing over against her.|$|E
60|$|I {{could name}} these books, {{if it would}} serve any purpose, but, in my doubt, I will leave the reader to think of them, for I believe that his {{indolence}} or intellectual reluctance is largely {{to blame for the}} failure of good books of short stories. He is commonly so averse to any imaginative exertion that he finds it a hardship <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> peculiar demand which a book of good short stories makes upon him. He can read one good short story in a magazine with refreshment, and a pleasant sense of excitement, in the sort of spur it gives to his own constructive faculty. But, if this is repeated in ten or twenty stories, he becomes fluttered and exhausted by the draft upon his energies; whereas a continuous fiction of the same quantity acts as an agreeable sedative. A condition that the short story tacitly makes with the reader, through its limitations, is that he shall subjectively fill in the details and carry out the scheme which in its small dimensions the story can only suggest; and the greater number of readers find this too much for their feeble powers, while they cannot resist the incitement to attempt it.|$|E
