The album also featured a sensitive song, Mä uskon huomispäivään ("I Believe in Tomorrow"). Other well-known songs from the album are Playboy 60 v ("Playboy 60 yrs"), Suomi–Ruotsi ("Finland–Sweden") and Taas lapsuuden maisemiin ("Back Again <b>to</b> <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> Grew Up").|$|E
5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am.|$|E

Sam's Town was mostly recorded at Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas, with finishing touches added to the album at Criterion Studios, London in June 2006. Upon completion of the album, Flowers claimed he felt the band had made [...] "one of the best albums of the past twenty years" [...] and that he wanted the album to capture [...] "everything important that got me <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am today". [...] In July 2006, the lead single [...] "When You Were Young" [...] was premiered and it became a hit, gaining another two Grammy Award nominations and mostly positive reviews with many bringing attention to the influence of Heartland rock on the song.|$|E

500|$|The live {{performance}} for [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as part of}} 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, where it served as the closing song, was taped and premiered online on November 16, 2011. It was added on the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4, which was released in late November 2011. The video begins with Beyoncé onstage in a shimmery silver minidress, giving the crowd {{a bit of a}} windup about where [...] "I Was Here" [...] came from. She says: [...] "It's taken {{a lot of hard work}} to get <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am. I searched all around the world, and I found myself. You all are my inspiration. I want to sing this last song and dedicate it to all of you guys." [...] The video then turns into a career retrospective in the form of Beyoncé's home movies and her professional highlights. It splices poignant memories throughout Beyoncé's life, from her childhood, to partying and vacations with her family, to most of the locations she visited around the world, to her rise with Destiny's Child into solo stardom and her love story with Jay-Z. Also containing footage from major performances and awards shows, the clip begins with a young Beyoncé thanking the judges in a talent show and later doing the snake in her living room, performing in her TLC-inspired neon overalls.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by Kai Ebel, a German TV reporter, Lewis Hamilton stressed {{that it was}} important to him to [...] "strike back" [...] after his retirement in Singapore. Later on in the press conference, he commented on equalling Ayrton Senna's number of victories: [...] "Also knowing that this would be the race that I would equal Ayrton, who won here and who had quite an interesting [...] here. So, yeah, quite an emotional day. But to be honest I'm not a teary guy, so I'm just full of joy and happiness and light and I'm really grateful for [...] all the people who have helped me get <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am today and this team, because without them I would not be here." [...] Nico Rosberg acknowledged that [...] "it's going the wrong way" [...] in terms of his championship hopes as he would have needed a victory and declared: [...] "Just need to try to win next time out." [...] Sebastian Vettel lamented his chances at second place, as he said that he could have stayed in front of Rosberg had he made a pit stop a lap earlier during the second round of stops, However, he stated that [...] "with hindsight, it's always easy so, nevertheless, it's a great day". Hamilton followed up on his delight at matching Senna later on, saying: [...] "For me to win here at a race where I loved watching Ayrton drive and to match his wins, it doesn't feel real at the moment." [...] Senna had won his three world championship titles at Suzuka.|$|E

2500|$|Lead singer Bono {{explained}} {{that he had to}} ask himself a few hard questions before carrying on recording: [...] "I wanted to check where I was <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am.

There is a variety of birds, a miscellany of trees, some of them exotics, a range of weedy but pretty flowers, no doubt snakes, and certainly kangaroos. Ironically, a month ago I saw more kangaroos (a mob of 14) on Red Hill in the centre of Canberra than I saw subsequently during the entirety of a 16-day tour of the Red Centre.

2500|$|This {{implies that}} a [...] "traditional combination" [...] of bread, beer, cheese, and pickle was popular before {{rationing}} in the United Kingdom (during and after World War II). In 1956, author Adrian Bell reported: [...] "There's a pub quite close <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> live where ... {{all you need}} say is, 'Ploughboy's Lunch, Harry, please'. And {{in a matter of}} minutes a tray is handed across the counter to you on which is a good square hunk of bread, a lump of butter and a wedge of cheese, and pickled onions, along with your pint of beer". Only one year later, in June 1957, another edition of the Monthly Bulletin of the Brewers' Society, referred to a ploughman's lunch using exactly that name, and said that it consisted of [...] "cottage bread, cheese, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, cold sausages and, of course, beer". The Glasgow newspaper The Bulletin from 15 April 1958 and The Times from 29 April 1958 refer to a ploughman's lunch consisting of bread, cheese and pickle.|$|E

The Marshall Mathers LP {{was released}} with two different album covers. The original features Eminem {{sitting on the porch}} of the house he lived in during his teenage years.

[...] " [...] The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a [...] "dysfunctional Little Rascal", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: [...] "Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked." ...|$|E
