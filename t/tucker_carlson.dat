25|$|Partially {{obscured}} {{photos of}} Mangum {{at the party}} were broadcast by The Abrams Report on cable news channel MSNBC and by local television affiliate NBC 17 WNCN in North Carolina. On April 21, 2006, outspoken talk-radio host Tom Leykis disclosed Mangum's name during his nationally syndicated talk-radio program. Leykis has disclosed identities of accusers of sexual assault in the past. On May 15, 2006, MSNBC host <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> disclosed Mangum's first name only on his show, Tucker. Court records presented by the defense revealed Mangum's name.|$|E
25|$|George W. Bush is {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of capital punishment. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, 152 people were executed in that state, maintaining its record as the leading state in executions. As President of the United States, he has continued in his support for capital punishment, including presiding over the first federal execution in decades, that of convicted terrorist Timothy McVeigh. Although Bush's support of the death penalty is known, controversy broke in 1999 when journalist <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> revealed that the Governor had mocked the plight of Karla Faye Tucker in an interview.|$|E
25|$|On September 6, 2016, Hume {{was named}} the anchor of On the Record after that show's {{longtime}} anchor, Greta Van Susteren, abruptly left Fox News. He served as the program's anchor {{through the end of}} the 2016 elections. Hume's first show as host of On the Record drew 2.4 million viewers, a double-digit increase over Van Susteren's average viewing audience in 2016. On November 4, 2016, it was announced that <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> would host a new show in the former On the Record timeslot from November 14, 2016.|$|E
25|$|In the April 19 episode, Perino read a {{prepared}} statement about O'Reilly's dismissal equivalent {{to what the}} network had released earlier in the day. The reasons for his firing and the sexual harassment allegations were {{not mentioned in the}} program itself. The termination of employment of the former host was a major feature of news coverage on both MSNBC and CNN; outside of the prepared statements, it was not mentioned on-air during the program and other regular topics were covered. The following day, images of the host were removed from the front windows of the News Corp. Building. O'Reilly was not given an opportunity to sign-off on-air, instead releasing a statement through his agency about the matter, while continuing to deny the sexual harassment allegations against him. During the final episode Gutfield spoke about the program's legacy and the loyalty of the show's staff after a segment with <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson,</b> followed by a fading of the stage's lighting to a dark state, revealing the set now blank of anything identifying the show.|$|E
500|$|Rappaport {{responded that}} the {{materials}} {{were meant to}} keep the students engaged and promote discussion, but the company has since replaced the song on its site. <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> said Flocabulary was a [...] "get-educated-quick [...] " [...] that disregards historical [...] "context or accuracy", and said [...] "there are still no independent studies that demonstrate rapping about social studies is any more educational than rapping about sex or gunfights." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria Taft of the Independent Journal Review {{called the}} use of President's Day to protest the current {{president}} new and said, [...] "Some would suggest that it's downright disgraceful to use the day to protest." [...] <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson,</b> {{in an interview with}} Shane Saunders, a [...] "Not My President's Day" [...] protester from Los Angeles, dismissed the protest actions completely, saying, [...] "I'm making the mistake of taking you seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hard Ball" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "Negotiation") is the fifteenth episode of NBC's first season of 30 Rock. It {{was written by}} one of the season's co-producers, Matt Hubbard, and {{directed}} {{by one of the}} season's supervising producers, Don Scardino. It aired on February 22, 2007 in the United States. Guest stars who appeared in the episode were David Alan Basche, Gregg Bello, Katrina Bowden, Kevin Brown, Grizz Chapman, Rachel Dratch, Keith Powell, Lonny Ross and Gregory Wooddell. <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> and Chris Matthews also appear as themselves in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune {{covered the}} dinner, but not Colbert's remarks. The wire {{services}} Reuters and the Associated Press each devoted three paragraphs to discuss Colbert's routine in their {{coverage of the}} event, and The Washington Post mentioned Colbert several times throughout its article. The most extensive print coverage came from USA Today, which dedicated more space to Colbert's performance than to President Bush's skit. [...] The day after the dinner, Howard Kurtz played clips of Colbert's performance on his CNN show Reliable Sources. On the Fox News show Fox & Friends, the hosts mentioned Colbert's performance, criticizing him for going [...] "over the line". <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson,</b> a frequent target of The Colbert Report {{before and after the}} event, criticized Colbert as being [...] "unfunny" [...] on his MSNBC show Tucker.|$|E
500|$|On May 18, Gilmore {{appeared}} on the MSNBC program Tucker, hosted by <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson.</b> When alerted {{about the situation in}} Iraq, Gilmore made the assessment that when Iraq was invaded the president probably did not think American troops would be trying to control the streets in Baghdad at this point. He stated that it {{is in the interest of}} Americans to remain in Iraq and be involved in the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] because if not, America is [...] "going to end up with a major war". Later in the interview when Gilmore was asked if he believed Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was credible, he stated, [...] "No, I don’t think he is particularly credible". On May 27, Gilmore {{appeared on}} ABC's This Week and continued the strategy of attacking his opponents in the race for president. On the show, he criticized the credentials of former Senator and potential candidate Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He reminded the audience that Thompson is [...] "a one-term senator" [...] and that [...] "he's well known because of his Law & Order appearance. But the question is, is there a solid, consistent record there of supporting conservative principles?" ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E
500|$|The Back to the Future trilogy is parodied and {{referenced}} {{throughout the}} episode, {{along with many}} other movies and famous people throughout the 1980s. Other cultural references include how after going back in time, Peter becomes excited about his new prospects in life, and states to Cleveland {{that he is going to}} [...] "raise more hell than Hellraiser" [...] from the 1987 horror film Hellraiser. It also depicts Pinhead as weak and ridiculous, stating that the worst he can do is unscrew a salt shaker and trick someone into using it, causing salt to come out all over their food. The first scene where Lois appears at the swimming pool is a reference to a scene from the 1980 film Caddyshack, featuring the song [...] "Mr. Night" [...] by Kenny Loggins. Once Lois appears, she asks Peter if he would like to see the 1982 film Zapped!. Rejecting her offer, Peter decides to go partying with Cleveland instead and play the video game Menstrual Ms. Pac-Man, in addition to making out with actress Molly Ringwald. While there, Brian gets into a fight, and instructs the bar patron to meet him on top of the World Trade Center to fight him at eight A.M. on September 11, 2001. While downstairs in the alternate universe, Peter makes a reference to the Twilight Zone episode, [...] "The Eye of the Beholder." [...] The joke about the World Trade Center has been edited from current versions of the show accessible on Netflix as of January 2012. Returning to the present, Peter and Brian decide to watch television, and are shocked to discover that actor Chevy Chase is now the host of The Tonight Show. They also discover that former Vice President Al Gore is now President of the United States, and flying cars running on vegetable oil exist. A parody of the 1962 ABC animated series, Hanna-Barbera's The Jetsons, is then shown. In the alternate reality, Death refers to the Dick Cheney hunting accident, explaining that the [...] "Chairman of Halliburton" [...] accidentally shot and killed Karl Rove, Antonin Scalia, and <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> (Brian groans that Peter and he can't change this wonderful future, but Peter flatly says [...] "I don't know who any of those people are"). The main plot of the episode, complete with the scene in which Peter and Brian are in the living room, with Brian explaining to Peter what happened using a chalk board, is a reference to the alternate universe scene in Back to the Future Part II.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> {{announced}} that Kellerman {{would be a}} permanent contributor on his MSNBC show Tucker. On {{a segment of the}} show called [...] "The Outsider", Kellerman generally took the position selected by Carlson. Frequently, Carlson introduced Kellerman with a bio containing a humorously enthusiastic compliment. The show was canceled in March 2008.|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 2004, Parrish {{appeared}} on CNN {{in an interview}} with Wolf Blitzer and <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson,</b> defending her position against Bush and her recent actions that led to ousting from the Liberal party. She also defended the overall Canadian stance regarding the Iraq War and the National Missile Defence program. Several days later Martin {{appeared on}} Late Edition, with Blitzer hosting. [...] Blitzer talked about several MPs attacking Bush and Martin replied that only Parrish had made attacks and that they had been condemned throughout Parliament.|$|E
2500|$|Imus's {{behavior}} has often drawn {{the attention of}} the press. He famously called Rush Limbaugh [...] "a fat, pill-popping loser" [...] and a [...] "drug-addled gas bag", Gwen Ifill a [...] "cleaning lady" [...] and Lesley Stahl a [...] "gutless, lying weasel." [...] His comedic exchange of quips ("fat pig") regarding his show's former news reader, Contessa Brewer, made news, as did Brewer's response ("cantankerous old fool"). When <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> brought up Brewer on the program in 2005, Imus hung up on him, calling him [...] "a bowtie-wearing little pussy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Others {{felt that}} Stewart's anger was unwarranted or misdirected. [...] Richard Cohen of The Washington Post {{called it a}} [...] "cheap shot at {{business}} media". [...] In an article from The Daily Beast, <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson,</b> whose own cable television show was cancelled after a similar encounter with Stewart on Crossfire in 2004, criticized Stewart for having illogical arguments. Carlson also implied that Stewart was attacking CNBC because he was unwilling {{to go after the}} new Democratic administration as he had in the past with the administration under George W. Bush.|$|E
2500|$|The {{journalist}} Nick Cohen {{was among}} those who responded on Twitter: [...] "Even if Hopkins knows nothing of Nazism – which I doubt – her [...] "final solution" [...] can only mean ethnic cleansing". Others, such as Owen Jones called for a boycott of the LBC radio station while they employ her. Interviewed later on Fox News by <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson,</b> she called for people to insist on deportations among other responses to terrorist acts. She said: [...] "I used the word 'final solution' in a tweet, and I would not in any way want to use that term and the inference other people lay on that. What I meant was, we need a lasting solution, a resolution to this". [...] The incident led to Hopkins leaving LBC.|$|E
2500|$|Along this theme, PBS {{commentator}} Bill Moyers {{noted that}} MSNBC commentator <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> had said of Clinton, [...] "There's {{just something about}} her that feels castrating, overbearing, and scary," [...] and that top-rated {{radio talk show host}} Rush Limbaugh continued to refer to her as [...] "the woman with the testicle lockbox." [...] During the campaign, Carlson made repeated statements of the form [...] "When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs." [...] Further discussion ensued when the Drudge Report and a few other media outlets ran an unflattering Associated Press photograph of Clinton looking old and tired on the wintry Iowa campaign trail; Limbaugh sympathized with the plight of American women in an appearance-obsessed culture, then asked, [...] "Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The book {{sold more}} than one million copies in the first month {{following}} publication; its sales during its first week of availability set a record for a non-fiction book. [...] The success of the book surprised many in the publishing industry, who thought Simon & Schuster had overpaid for the work. It also surprised pundits who had doubted her selling power, including CNN's <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson,</b> who had said, [...] "If they sell a million copies of this book, I'll eat my shoes and my tie. I will." [...] (Once past the million mark, Clinton appeared on Carlson's show to present him with a shoe-shaped chocolate cake.) [...] Clinton's energetic promotion of the book, which included signing an estimated 20,000 copies (causing her to require ice and wrist support treatments), was credited for part of the success. [...] By 2007, she had earned over $10 million from the book.|$|E
2500|$|Comedian Jon Stewart {{appeared}} on Crossfire on October 15, 2004 and criticized its format and {{the style of}} arguments presented on the show. He called hosts <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> and Paul Begala [...] "partisan hacks", {{and asked them to}} [...] "stop hurting America". [...] Begala argued {{that the purpose of the}} show was that it was intended as for debate, to which Stewart responded [...] "To do a debate would be great. But that's like saying Pro Wrestling is a show about athletic competition" [...] and called Carlson's signature bow-tie an example of [...] "theater". At one point Carlson told Stewart [...] "I think you're more fun on your show", Stewart replied by saying: [...] "You know what's interesting though? You're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show." [...] Carlson later told Stewart that [...] "You need to get a job at a journalism school, I think" [...] to which Stewart quipped [...] "You need to go to one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-eight years later, in an {{appearance}} on MSNBC television, Falwell {{said he was not}} troubled by reports that the nominee for Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, John G. Roberts (whose appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate) had done volunteer legal work for homosexual rights activists on the case of Romer v. Evans. [...] Falwell told MSNBC's <b>Tucker</b> <b>Carlson</b> that if he were a lawyer, he too would argue for civil rights for LGBT people. [...] "I may not agree with the lifestyle, but {{that has nothing to do}} with the civil rights of that part of our constituency," [...] Falwell said. [...] When Carlson countered that conservatives [...] "are always arguing against 'special rights' for gays," [...] Falwell said that equal access to housing and employment are basic rights, not special rights. [...] "Civil rights for all Americans, black, white, red, yellow, the rich, poor, young, old, gay, straight, et cetera, is not a liberal or conservative value. [...] It's an American value that I would think that we pretty much all agree on." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Trinity College chapter endows a St. Anthony Professorship in Art History, several annual {{prizes for}} Trinity students, {{and an annual}} public lecture, named for Martin W.

(It is compared to but more generalized than the annual Maynard Mack Lecture of Yale's Elizabethan Club, down the block, whose sessions with actors and directors focus on Shakespeare's era.)
