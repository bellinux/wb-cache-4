5|$|Alexander Karelin {{was awarded}} for his {{recognition}} {{as the greatest}} wrestler of all time (from antiquity to the present day). He was a Greco-Roman wrestler in the Olympics, and in his career he won 887 bouts and lost only 2 <b>times.</b> <b>His</b> losses are controversial because commentators believe they were caused by trivial rule changes, not a bona fide athletic defeat.|$|E
5|$|Flying Fox {{went on to}} be {{champion}} sire in France three <b>times.</b> <b>His</b> progeny included Prix du Jockey Club and Grand Prix de Paris winner Ajax, Prix de Diane winner Flying Star, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Prix du Cadran winner Gouvernant, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Prix du Jockey Club winner Dagor, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Eclipse Stakes winner Val d'Or and Prix de la Forêt winner Adam.|$|E

5|$|For {{his service}} on the Western Front, Bennett {{received}} many awards. He received the Order of Danilo from Montenegro in 1917, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1918, received a Distinguished Service Order in 1919 and mentioned in despatches a further six <b>times.</b> <b>His</b> attitude towards regular officers and temperament, {{as well as his}} tendency to act without clearing his actions with superiors, though, resulted in criticism from senior officers.|$|E

5|$|Into modern <b>times,</b> <b>his</b> legacy has {{remained}} {{more pronounced in}} Ireland and Scotland than in his native Norway. Among the few domestic developments known during his reign, Norway developed a more centralised rule and {{moved closer to the}} European model of church organisation. Popularly portrayed as a Viking warrior rather than a medieval monarch, Magnus was the last Norwegian king to fall in battle abroad, and he may in some respects be considered the final Viking king.|$|E
5|$|Kemp co-founded the AFL Players Association with Tom Addison of the Boston Patriots, and {{was elected}} its {{president}} five <b>times.</b> <b>His</b> founding of {{and involvement in}} the players' union contributed to his frequent siding with the Democrats on labor issues later in his career.|$|E
5|$|Moran {{has been}} married and {{divorced}} three <b>times.</b> <b>His</b> second wife, Mary Howard Moran, filed for divorce in 1999, one day after an argument at the couple's Alexandria home {{that resulted in a}} visit from the police. The Congressman provided his own divorce papers a few months later, and in 2003 the couple officially separated. He remarried in 2004 to real estate developer LuAnn Bennett. In December 2010, Moran and Bennett announced they were separating.|$|E

He filed for divorce on grounds of her {{adultery}} with the theatre producer Theodore Komisarjevsky, and the much publicised suit was undefended. His second marriage, which took place on 9 July 1938, to Dorothy Beatrice Lewer (1915–2005), also ended in divorce. On 14 January 1950, Aaronson married Margaret Olive Ireson (1920–1981), with whom he had one son, David, who was born in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had largely}} {{abandoned}} short fiction by the mid-1990s, Gibson returned to writing novels, completing his second trilogy, the Bridge trilogy {{at the close}} of the millennium. After writing two episodes of the television series The X-Files around this time, Gibson was featured as the subject of a documentary film, No Maps for These Territories, in 2000. Gibson has been invited to address the National Academy of Sciences (1993) and the Directors Guild of America (2003) and has had a plethora of articles published in outlets such as Wired, Rolling Stone and The New York <b>Times.</b> <b>His</b> third trilogy of novels, Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007) and Zero History (2010) have put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{only had}} an {{elementary}} education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister. During his tenure, Karamchand married four <b>times.</b> <b>His</b> first two wives died young, after each {{had given birth to}} a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade, a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860 – March 1914), a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960) and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).|$|E

Kesselring {{believed}} that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial {{to being able to}} command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and multi-engined aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945. At <b>times,</b> <b>his</b> flight path took him over the concentration camps at Oranienburg, Dachau, and Buchenwald.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge and Cox were renominated {{for their}} {{respective}} offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his {{actions in the}} Police Strike around {{the state and the}} nation and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form. He faced the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than seven <b>times</b> <b>his</b> margin of victory from a year earlier. His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge run for president in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Crowley left Busch and {{returned}} to London, where he took Pearl Brooksmith as his new Scarlet Woman. Undergoing further nasal surgery, it was here in 1932 that {{he was invited to}} be guest of honour at Foyles' Literary Luncheon, also being invited by Harry Price to speak at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. In need of money, he launched a series of court cases against people whom he believed had libelled him, some of which proved successful. He gained much publicity for his lawsuit against Constable and Co for publishing Nina Hamnett's Laughing Torso (1932) – a book he thought libelled him – but lost the case. The court case added to Crowley's financial problems, and in February 1935 he was declared bankrupt. During the hearing, it was revealed that Crowley had been spending three <b>times</b> <b>his</b> income for several years.|$|E

5|$|During the tour, McCool took 57 {{first-class}} wickets at {{a bowling}} average of 17.82; {{he was the}} fifth most prolific wicket-taker and had the fourth best average among Australia's seven frontline bowlers. With England agreeing {{to have a new}} ball available after every 55 overs, more frequently than the old rule of replacing the ball after every 200 runs, fast bowling dominated over spin. As a result, McCool did not play in the Tests, but was used heavily in the tour matches so the leading pacemen could conserve their energy for the important matches. Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall, he delivered the least overs because of his injured finger. McCool took five wickets in an innings three <b>times,</b> <b>his</b> best return being 7/78 against Cambridge University.|$|E

Ellis had three children and two grandchildren; both daughters have since died, one in 2003 due to complications arising from type 1 diabetes. Ellis had a daughter, Shangalesa, with Paula. His son with Austine, Dock Phillip Ellis III (Trey), played college basketball at California State University, Bakersfield. Trey fathered Ellis' first grandchild, Dock Phillip Ellis IV (Dru). Ellis' youngest daughter Simone, who mothered Ellis' second grandchild, passed in December 2012 after losing her battle with cancer. Ellis stopped using drugs and alcohol in 1980, when his son was an infant.|$|E
