50|$|Tire Group International has {{multiple}} specialized market segments including industrial {{applications such as}} Skid-steer loader, backhoe loader, forestry mulcher, Forklift, Grader, front loader, Reach stacker, <b>Telescopic</b> <b>handler,</b> Tractor, agricultural and forestry, Feller buncher, harvester, Skidder and Forwarder as well as mining applications such as Articulated hauler and cherry pickers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telescopic</b> <b>handlers</b> {{are like}} {{forklift}} trucks {{that have a}} telescoping extendable boom like a crane. Early <b>telescopic</b> <b>handlers</b> only lifted {{in one direction and}} did not rotate; however, several of the manufacturers have designed <b>telescopic</b> <b>handlers</b> that rotate 360 degrees through a turntable and these machines look almost identical to the Rough Terrain Crane. These new 360-degree telescopic handler/crane models have outriggers or stabiliser legs that must be lowered before lifting; however, their design has been simplified {{so that they can be}} more quickly deployed. These machines are often used to handle pallets of bricks and install frame trusses on many new building sites and they have eroded much of the work for small telescopic truck cranes. Many of the world's armed forces have purchased <b>telescopic</b> <b>handlers</b> and some of these are the much more expensive fully rotating types. Their off-road capability and their on site versatility to unload pallets using forks, or lift like a crane make them a valuable piece of machinery.|$|R

50|$|Horley {{was home}} to the Matbro works which {{produced}} forklift trucks from the 1950s to the 1980s and pioneered <b>telescopic</b> <b>handlers.</b> The bright yellow Teleram 40 and Teleram C machines were very popular with farmers and construction companies.|$|R
50|$|A <b>telescopic</b> <b>handler,</b> {{also called}} a telehandler, teleporter, or boom lift, is a machine {{widely used in}} {{agriculture}} and industry. It is somewhat like a forklift but has a , making it more a crane than a forklift, with the increased versatility of a single telescopic or articulating boom that can extend forwards and upwards from the vehicle. On {{the end of the}} boom the operator can fit one of several attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, muck grab, or winch. Telehandlers are sometimes called cherry pickers in North America, as that name can refer to any truck or heavy equipment that has such a boom.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system can}} weigh {{in all the}} {{ingredients}} of a ration in any chosen order and weigh out according to chosen quantities corresponding {{to the needs of}} different groups of animals. As each ingredient is loaded, a visual and audible signal alerts the operator when the required amount is reached. The flashing light and [...] "beep" [...] system repeats faster and faster until the ingredient is complete, when the signal becomes continuous for 2 seconds. The computer then shifts to the next ingredient and displays the product name and weight to be loaded.Loading is generally done using the mixer-wagon cutting and loading device, a high capacity tractor loader, or a <b>telescopic</b> <b>handler.</b>|$|E
50|$|With these sets it is {{possible}} to build or convert manually-operated mechanical movement to motorized using electric motors which are controlled via switches or IR remote control. Future plans for this set include more parts which will add even more function/control possibilities.. Lego has already started to design and sell Lego Technic models (sets) which can be easily retrofitted with the Power Functions system. For example, models like the 8294 Excavator, 8295 <b>Telescopic</b> <b>Handler</b> or 7645 MT-61 Crystal Reaper are sold like classic Lego Technic models with manual motorization but are designed with free space for the Power Functions components with factory instructions on how to perform the conversion to an electrically operated model.The Power Functions line-up also includes a Linear Actuator currently not sold separately, but already used in many models like the 8294 Excavator and the 8043 Motorised Excavator.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{shows the}} study and {{simulation}} of a hydropneumatic suspension to be adopted for a <b>telescopic</b> <b>handler</b> vehicle. The hydropneumatic suspension system with independent wheels and with quadrilateral architecture has been studied to improve the comfort and the productivity of the existing vehicle, which has a suspended rigid axle {{on the front and}} a rigid axle on the rear, which limits the comfort and the grip. After the choice of the architecture and the kind of suspension, the paper shows the design of the suspension kinematics. The optimization of the characteristic angle of the suspension has been performed by means of Adams/Car and Adams/Insight. The kinematic model optimized is subsequently reproduced in Adams/View to simulate the dynamics of the complete vehicle. The simulation results are used to evaluate the vehicle performances in terms of comfort and stability according to the methods proposed by the standard...|$|E

50|$|Matbro was a {{brand of}} lifting equipment, popular with farmers. Matbro {{produced}} {{a wide range of}} all terrain forklifts and <b>telescopic</b> <b>handlers</b> in their distinctive yellow livery, using engines derived from Ford and Perkins. Matbro began operating at a loss in the late 1990s and in the end went under in 2003 after accounting issues in their parent company Powerscreen. The old designs were then sold to the tractor company John Deere. which sub-licensed them to heavy lifting company Terex, who continued to evolve the designs, with new ideas such as side mounted engines instead of rear ones and hydrostatic drive.|$|R

50|$|An {{example is}} the {{operators}} who in {{the division of labor}} have all the equipment. Most operators will not operate equipment they perceive as lowly such as skid steer, kick-brooms and <b>telescopic</b> <b>handlers,</b> laborers usually are used to operate these unless an operator apprentice is available and demands his right to operate. The same is true for most other trades except the ironworkers who are notorious for protecting their work and not wanting anyone else to touch their steel, tie-wire or Kliens. The advantage to this system is that many laborers gain sufficient experience working with another trade to journeyman-in while earning a higher wage than an apprentice. Many foremen will gradually give a laborer extra responsibility until they are performing at a journeyman level and can enter a more skilled union as a journeyman.|$|R
50|$|Quick {{couplers}} are devices {{installed at}} the outer end of the work equipment of various types of construction and earth-moving machines. They facilitate the rapid exchange of working tools or buckets. Quick couplers are most common on hydraulic excavators and compact excavators and on the backhoe equipment of backhoe loaders, but are also installed on <b>telescopic</b> <b>handlers,</b> wheel loaders (loading shovels), skid-steer loaders and the loader equipment of backhoe-loaders. They are also occasionally installed on attachments installed on agricultural tractors.Quick couplers do not normally have a specific function themselves in {{that they do not}} carry out handling or digging operations, but when installed on a machine they {{become a part of the}} overall system. They are usually mounted on the machine by means of the pins that would otherwise be the mountings for the bucket or attachment.This article concentrates on quick couplers installed on excavators and similar equipment.|$|R
