Microsoft is initially targeting this project towards laptops.|$|E
5|$|Some hymns narrate that Chinnamasta likes {{blood and}} thus is offered blood sacrifices at some shrines.

Further, it explains the worship rituals {{to be followed by}} householders and those to be followed by renouncers.

5|$|In 1218 and 1219, Jocelin also {{ended the}} dispute between his diocese and Glastonbury Abbey. Jocelin gave up any claim to {{control of the}} abbey, and the abbey gave the bishopric a number of estates. Previously, the bishops, {{as part of their}} attempt to annexe Glastonbury to their bishopric, had been known as the Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury. They also had held the office of abbot. In 1218, as part of the settlement, a new abbot was elected at Glastonbury. The papacy had never {{acknowledged}} Jocelin's claiming of the title of abbot. The historian J. A. Robinson felt <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the settlement, Jocelin began to use the title Bishop of Bath and Wells, but another historian, David Knowles, disagreed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{originally}} suggested the yellow, green and red, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and traditional dress. At the Great Seimas of Vilnius of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as {{the flag of the}} Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by Jonas Basanavičius, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as Belarus, and Ukraine. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.|$|E

The County made no use of the property, and was the building was later leased to a start-up cable network for a token sum of a dollar per year. During the ensuing court case, the plaintiff alleged <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a questionable relationship, Paulk arranged for a sexual encounter between Jones and one of Paulk's former mistresses. When deposed, Jones refused to answer questions relating to that incident, {{as well as a number}} of other questions involving his dealings with Paulk. That case was ultimately withdrawn by the plaintiff's attorney, Louis Levenson, who felt that the judge in the case was biased against his client. The case was subsequently refiled and drew a different judge.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 2010, a {{ceremony}} was held aboard Belfast {{to mark the}} 65th anniversary of end of the Second World War in Europe. Veterans of the Arctic convoys were in attendance to receive medals from the Russian Ambassador Yuri Fedotov. During the ceremony it was announced <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the restoration of the}} ship, two new masts had been manufactured at the Severnaya Verf shipyard near Saint Petersburg. The production of the masts, to replace corroded originals, had been supported by a number of Russian businesses at a reported cost of £500,000. The restoration of the masts involved removing the fittings from both masts, allowing them to be individually restored. The old masts were then cut down in sections, the new masts erected, and the original fittings replaced. On 19 October 2010, the new masts were dedicated at {{a ceremony}} attended by HMS Belfast veterans, by Prince Philip and officials from the Russian embassy and government.|$|E

On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S, an edition of Windows 10 designed for low-end mobile devices targeting the education market (which have led critics to compare the product line to Chrome OS). Similarly to Windows RT, it restricts software installation to applications obtained via Windows Store, but it may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to remove these restrictions.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman {{imperial}} government adopted its Tanzimat modernization {{reforms in}} 1862 and originally entrusted Aqil with enforcing {{the new law}} of the land in northern Palestine. Part of these measures were stronger efforts to suppress the Bedouin tribes and decisively end their raiding activities. Aqil was given orders to prevent them from setting up camps in the cultivated lands of Galilee and forbade the collection of khuwwa tolls from the local inhabitants. Aqil resigned from his post when he was informed <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his new assignment he and his men were required to don Ottoman uniforms. He objected to the requirement, insisting that as Bedouin, they were not accustomed to wearing uniforms. He was replaced by one of his Hawwara tribesmen, but Aqil compelled his successor to resign as well. Shortly after his resignation, the requirement of uniforms was canceled and Aqil resumed his assignment.|$|E
