5|$|Although {{the stories}} and {{characters}} were fictional, a number of elements had a real life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred to <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> of a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E
5|$|Bond's number—007—was {{assigned}} by Fleming {{in reference to}} one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> of the German diplomatic code. One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which was coded 0075, and {{which was one of}} the factors that led to the US entering the war.|$|E
5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> of the export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 {{formed the basis for}} the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that a series can contain {{an unknown number of}} smooth breaks raises two distinct problems. First, even if <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> are sharp, <b>the</b> number of <b>breaks</b> and <b>the</b> <b>break</b> dates themselves are generally unknown and need to be estimated along with the other parameters of the model. Second, even if <b>the</b> number of <b>breaks</b> is known, <b>the</b> possibility of a smooth <b>break</b> means that <b>the</b> functional form of <b>the</b> <b>break</b> is unknown to the researcher. A misspecification of the functional form of <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> may be as problematic as ignoring <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> altogether. Moreover, ever if a series contains no breaks, it may be subject to other nonlinearities or parameter instabilities. We summarize a number of papers that use a variant of Gallant’s (1981) Flexible Fourier Form to control for the unknown number and form of <b>the</b> <b>breaks.</b> <b>The</b> paper details and illustrates several unit root tests, stationarity tests, and tests for parameter instability that are based on a Fourier approximation...|$|R

The process parameters were optimized in <b>the</b> <b>break</b> drafting zone with pressure bar of the INA-V spinning frame, the drafting principle in <b>the</b> <b>break</b> drafting zone with pressure bar of INA-V spinning frame was analyzed, and the sliver configuration was observed in <b>the</b> <b>break</b> drafting zone with pressure bar. The result revealed that installed the pressure bar in break drafting zone after, when the roving twist factor was small, CV%, thinness, thickness and neps of the yarn spun decrease as <b>the</b> <b>break</b> drafting ratio increase; when the twist factor of roving was larger, <b>the</b> <b>break</b> draft ratio as 1. 3 time was optimum drafting conditions.

Bertrand Barère and other Thermidorians have claimed that he proposed a dictatorship for Robespierre, but nonetheless some of them considered him to be redeemable, or at least useful – until he delivered his uncompromising public defence of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794).|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} of the separation and constant press attention began to take its toll of Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. <b>The</b> <b>breaking</b> point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions.

40|$|In fission yeast mating-type {{switching}} is {{initiated by}} {{the formation of a}} double-strand DNA <b>break</b> at <b>the</b> mating-type locus. A prerequisite for generation of <b>the</b> <b>break</b> is some 'imprinting' of the DNA in the previous cell cycle. We have used the technique of genomic sequencing to map the position of <b>the</b> <b>break</b> directly on chromosomal DNA cleaved in vivo. On one strand <b>the</b> <b>break</b> is situated very close to the right-hand border of the expressed mat 1 cassette. Cells of opposite mating type, P and M, have their breaks at slightly different positions on this strand. On the other DNA strand of both alleles the ends are probably masked by tightly bound proteins and therefore the precise nature of <b>the</b> <b>break</b> could not be determined. Since <b>the</b> <b>break</b> is stable throughout the cell cycle, these proteins may function in vivo to confer structural stability on the chromosomes having <b>the</b> <b>break.</b> <b>The</b> implications of these findings for models of mating-type switching are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{estimates}} <b>the</b> <b>break</b> {{point in}} <b>the</b> residual variance {{and in the}} propagation mechanism of the real exchange rates at {{about the time of}} the Asian crisis that occurred in 1997, and provides some explanations for <b>the</b> <b>breaks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> residual variance increased the volatility of the real exchange rates, which given the overall effects of common adverse shocks to the countries seems to be reinforced by the sudden withdrawal of Japanese commercial banks' lending to the region. And <b>the</b> subsequent <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> propagation mechanism reduced the volatility, which reflects the change in the government policy stance to result in smoothing the pace of appreciation. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> nominal exchange rates rather than in the price ratios are mainly responsible for <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> real exchange rates...|$|R

5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> point. These economic circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression.

40|$|This paper investigates an {{efficient}} estimation method for a cointegrating regression model with structural change. Our proposal {{is that we}} first estimate <b>the</b> <b>break</b> point by minimizing the sum of squared residuals and then, by replacing <b>the</b> <b>break</b> fraction with <b>the</b> estimated one, we estimate the regression model by the canonical cointegrating regression (CCR) method proposed by Park (1992). We show that the estimator of <b>the</b> <b>break</b> fraction is consistent and of order faster than T - 1 / 2 and that the CCR estimator with <b>the</b> estimated <b>break</b> fraction has <b>the</b> same asymptotic property as the estimator with <b>the</b> known <b>break</b> point. Simulation experiments show how the finite sample distribution gets close to the limiting distribution as the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>break</b> and/or <b>the</b> sample size increases. ...|$|R
