25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of our contribution... They would shout back at us and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically {{of the things that they}} are doing.|$|E
25|$|Those mining {{communities}} {{had good}} working class values {{and a sense}} of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous {{as a result of the}} strike.|$|E
500|$|On March 5, 1770, {{a street}} {{confrontation}} resulted in British soldiers killing five civilians in {{what came to}} be known as the Boston Massacre. The accused soldiers were arrested on criminal charges and had trouble finding legal representation. Adams ultimately agreed to defend them, though he feared that it would hurt his reputation. In arguing their case, Adams made his legendary statement regarding jury decisions: [...] "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." [...] He also expounded upon Blackstone's Ratio: [...] "It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of security whatsoever." [...] Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two of them who had fired directly into the crowd were charged with murder but were convicted only of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.|$|E

2500|$|Likud party {{spokesperson}} Zalman Shoval said in March 2007 that Israel {{would never}} accept {{the return of}} refugees {{who had lived in}} pre-1967 Israeli territory, saying [...] "If 300,000–400,000, or maybe a million, Palestinians would invade the country, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the state of Israel as a Jewish state.... That's not why we created the state." [...] Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also stated that month that [...] "I'll never accept a solution that is based on their return to Israel, any number.... I will not agree to accept any kind of Israel responsibility for the refugees. Full stop.... It's a moral issue of the highest level. I don't think that we should accept any kind of responsibility for the creation of this problem." [...] In general, however, Olmert has described the initiative as a [...] "revolutionary change".|$|E
