500|$|The {{antivenom}} manufacturer's {{product information}} recommends one vial, although more has been used. Past guidelines indicated two vials, with a further two vials recommended if symptoms did not resolve within two hours, however recent guidelines state [...] "antivenom is sometimes given {{if there is}} a history, symptoms and signs consistent with systemic envenoming, and severe pain unresponsive to oral analgesics ... however recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. The antivenom can be given by injection intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). The manufacturer recommends IM use, with IV administration reserved for life-threatening cases. In January 2008 toxicologist Geoffrey Isbister suggested IM antivenom was not as effective as IV antivenom, after proposing <b>that</b> <b>IM</b> antivenom took longer to reach the blood serum. Isbister subsequently found the difference between IV and IM routes of administration was, at best, small and did not justify routinely choosing one route over the other.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} {{molecular}} {{characterization of the}} immune deficiency (imd) gene, which controls antibacterial defense in Drosophila. imd encodes a protein with a death domain {{similar to that of}} mammalian RIP (receptor interacting protein), a protein that plays a role in both NF-κB activation and apoptosis. We show <b>that</b> <b>imd</b> functions upstream of the DmIKK signalosome and the caspase DREDD in the control of antibacterial peptide genes. Strikingly, overexpression of imd leads to constitutive transcription of these genes and to apoptosis, and both effects are blocked by coexpression of the caspase inhibitor P 35. We also show <b>that</b> <b>imd</b> is involved in the apoptotic response to UV irradiation. These data raise the possibility that antibacterial response and apoptosis share common control elements in Drosophila...|$|R

Im Tirtzu received US$100,000 from JHM and $34,000 {{from other}} sources. In 2010, The Jerusalem Post reported that JHM [...] "expressed deep displeasure" [...] with Im Tirtzu after its campaigns against the New Israel Fund and Ben-Gurion University and announced {{the cessation of}} its funding.

Sternhell analyzed the writings published by Im Tirtzu and observed expressions of fascist thinking {{in the writings of}} the group's founder. These include seeing the nation as an organic body, viewing the West as being weakened, and describing the situation in the country as an emergency situation that requires unusual action against [...] "traitors".|$|E

2500|$|A NIS 2.6-million {{lawsuit was}} filed by Im Tirtzu against Israelis who had opened a Facebook page that {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>Im</b> Tirtzu was a Fascist group. A court in Jerusalem rejected {{some of the}} charges but found one person guilty of slander. In the verdict the Judge Refael Ya'akobi {{found that there were}} commonalities between the group and [...] "certain principles of Fascism". He also stated that {{it is clear that the}} defendants are [...] "bitter adversaries" [...] of Im Tirtzu. He additionally wrote that the defendants do not imply a full identification Fascism with Im Tirtzu, but only some common lines. Finally the judge ruled that as Im Tirtzu emphasizes national aspects, the defendants can rely on the protections set in the law in order to be acquitted. and wrote also that there is truth in comparing the poster of [...] "Im Tirtzu" [...] against the New Israel Fund to the style of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer. The judge wrote: [...] "One should view these publications (against Im Tirtzu) as saying and warning that past experience teaches that support of similar principles to those <b>that</b> <b>Im</b> Tirtzu supports ... brought harsh and bad results." [...] In September 2013, the judge rejected the majority of Im Tirtzu's arguments, and cleared four of the five defendants. One defendant, Roy Yellin, was found to have libeled Im Tirtzu by implying that the group shared the [...] "Nazi race theory". However, the judge criticised Im Tirtzu for bringing the action in the first place, and postponed awarding any damages for the one successful claim. In February 2014, the court rejected Im Tirtzu's claim for damages, though it also rejected the defendants' claim for legal costs. Both Im Tirtzu and the defendants appealed to the high court. In the appeal, the high court declared the previous ruling as void and null and decided that the libel suit should have not been heard in court, since the main discussion is ideological, not juridical.|$|E

[...] NIF also quoted Avichai Mandelblit, the IDF's Chief Military Advocate General during Operation Cast Lead: [...] "The organizations are a conduit for getting information on very important matters so that IDF activity is normative....

Using a two-hybrid screen in yeast, we have isolated the death protein dFADD as a molecule that associates with IMD.

By genetic analysis we show that dFADD acts downstream of IMD in the pathway that controls inducibility of the antibacterial peptide genes...|$|R
