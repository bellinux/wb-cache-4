His first cousin was Charles Floyd, {{the only member of}} the Lewis and Clark Expedition <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> letter dated 15 December 1830, Sam Houston stated that Floyd was the first cousin of another Lewis and Clark Explorer, Nathaniel Pryor.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his work, Johnston himself {{has become part of}} the history of volcanic eruptions. With Harry Glicken, he is one of two volcanologists from the United States <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> volcanic eruption. Glicken was being mentored by Johnston, who relieved Glicken of his watch at the ColdwaterII observation post 13 hours before Mount St. Helens erupted. Glicken died in 1991, eleven years later, when a pyroclastic flow overran him and several others at Mount Unzen in Japan. Despite the deaths of other volcanologists in later eruptions at Mount Unzen and Galeras, prediction methods similar to Johnston's allowed scientists to convince residents of settlements near the Mount Pinatubo volcano to evacuate, preventing thousands of deaths.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{is caused}} by blood {{deprivation}} in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage. OCD {{can be difficult to}} diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.|$|E

5|$|Mac {{returns to}} work after a month's leave. When Caroline meets him she implies that she is engaged to Guy. Mac and Guy are then drunk in a bar, where Mac tells Guy he is going <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{couple of weeks and}} makes Guy promise he will not tell Caroline. However, Guy tells Martin, who then {{complains}} to him about his selfishness. However, Caroline walks in and overhears the argument. Meanwhile, Mac suggests to Sue that she finds someone else to love. Caroline confronts Mac about marrying her. Mac defends himself by saying {{it would be better for}} her to marry Guy because he will live longer. Guy later decides to do the right thing, and tells Mac to propose to Caroline because they love each other. Caroline and Mac therefore become engaged and later marry, where the majority of the core cast are in attendance. At the wedding, Sue is seen with a new boyfriend. The special ends with Caroline floating away into the sky holding a mass of helium balloons.|$|E

25|$|Buddhism {{sees the}} {{experience}} of dying as a very sensitive moment in one's spiritual life because the quality of one's mind {{at the time of}} death is believed to condition one's future rebirth. The Buddhist ideal is <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> calm but conscious state, while learning to let go. Dying consciously, without negative thoughts but rather joyously with good thoughts in mind is seen as a good transition into the next life. Chanting and reciting Buddhist texts is a common practice; in Tibet the Bardo Thodol is used to guide the dying to a good rebirth.|$|E
25|$|After Harvard, Emerson {{assisted}} {{his brother}} William {{in a school}} for young women established in their mother's house, after he had established his own school in Chelmsford, Massachusetts; when his brother William went to Göttingen to study divinity, Emerson {{took charge of the}} school. Over the next several years, Emerson made his living as a schoolmaster. He then went to Harvard Divinity School, and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa in 1828. Emerson's brother Edward, two years younger than he, entered the office of the lawyer Daniel Webster, after graduating from Harvard first in his class. Edward's physical health began to deteriorate, and he soon suffered a mental collapse as well; he was taken to McLean Asylum in June 1828 at age 23. Although he recovered his mental equilibrium, he died in 1834, apparently from long-standing tuberculosis. Another of Emerson's bright and promising younger brothers, Charles, born in 1808, died in 1836, also of tuberculosis, making him the third young person in Emerson's innermost circle <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> period of a few years.|$|E

The car survived the accident relatively intact and de Angelis had only minor injuries. However, there were very few track marshals at the circuit and he was trapped in the car and killed by oxygen deprivation due to a fire before they arrived, prompting a review of testing safety, with changes including more marshals as well as medical staff and a required medical evacuation helicopter. Sadly de Angelis would die from smoke inhalation 29 hours after the crash at the hospital in Marseille where he had been taken. In the Belgian Grand Prix following the death of de Angelis, Brabham only entered one car for Patrese. From the next race in Canada, British driver Derek Warwick joined the team.
