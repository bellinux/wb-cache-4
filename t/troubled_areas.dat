Order was finally restored when regional military commander Yuzaini requested the help of community leaders and youth organisations to arrange for local patrols (...) with security forces. Security inaction continued as violence escalated in Jakarta, and the military leadership in charge of security in the capital city—Wiranto, Prabowo, and General Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono—were absent.
