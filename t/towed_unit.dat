40|$|Four {{commercial}} harvesters {{were compared}} with respect to recovery of pruning residues for energy conversion. These harvesters were tested side-by-side on 17 test fields, totaling 15. ha. The test fields consisted of vineyards and apple and pear orchards. The residue yield was between 0. 7 and 9 green tonne per hectare, at a moisture content from 37 % to 48 %. Yield was highest for the orchards, and lowest for vineyards. Harvesters collected the residues and moved them to the roadside {{at a cost of}} between 11 and 60 € per green tonne, depending on field conditions and technology choice. Single-pass harvesting was the cheapest, especially if applied through a dedicated tractor and a <b>towed</b> <b>unit</b> with a large integral container. Two-pass harvesting was the most flexible, but also the most expensive: it should be favored only when space, weather or other management constraints limit the application of the other systems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

50|$|In early 1943, {{stemming}} from problems found in North Africa, the Army began {{to consider a}} more defensive role for tank destroyer units. After trials in January, fifteen battalions were ordered to convert to towed guns on 31 March, and shortly thereafter {{it was decided that}} half of all tank destroyer units would convert to a towed organization. The broad outline of the battalion remained - three companies of three platoons of four guns - but the reconnaissance company was downgraded to two platoons in the headquarters company. However, the need for larger gun crews and more security troops meant that the manpower of the unit increased again. These units were equipped with 3-inch M5 guns towed by trucks or M3 Halftracks. However, combat experience in Normandy and Italy - coupled with the fact that purpose-built M18 and M36 tank destroyers were becoming available - showed that the <b>towed</b> <b>units</b> were underperforming compared with self-propelled ones. After the Ardennes campaign, where 85% of all tank destroyer losses were towed guns, it was decided to convert all <b>towed</b> <b>units</b> back to self-propelled guns.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the lateral {{performance}} of heavy vehicle combinations, specifically longer combination vehicles, is discussed. The use of longer combination vehicles is promoted by their {{positive impact on}} the traffic congestion problem, as well as their economic and environmental benefits due to reduced fuel consumption and emissions. However, from a safety perspective, there are concerns about their impact on the traffic. In a heavy vehicle combination maneuvering at high speeds, lateral motions get amplified at the <b>towed</b> <b>units,</b> which causes trailer swing and large path deviation and side slip. These amplified motions are dangerous for any nearby cars as well as the vehicle combination itself and can lead to instability. The main goal of the research presented in this thesis is to develop control strategies for improving the lateral performance of heavy vehicle combinations at high speeds by suppression of amplified motions at the <b>towed</b> <b>units.</b> As a starting point, the heavy vehicle accidents are investigated and the relevant critical maneuvers are identified. Subsequently, the lateral performance of heavy vehicle combinations in the identified critical maneuvers is investigated by simulations to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} causes behind rearward amplification of motions in heavy vehicle combinations and to specify the control objectives. Accordingly, a generic controller for improving the lateral performance of heavy vehicle combinations by active steering of the <b>towed</b> <b>units</b> is developed. The developed controller is verified for various heavy vehicle combinations by simulation, with respect to the identified critical maneuvers. The verification results confirm the effectiveness of the controller and show significant reductions in yaw rates, side slip and path deviation of the <b>towed</b> <b>units</b> of the heavy vehicle combinations, up to 70 %. Additionally, the robustness of the controller is evaluated by extensive analysis of its performance in various driving conditions and presence of parameter uncertainties for a sample heavy vehicle combination. Furthermore, the controller is implemented on a truck-dolly-semitrailer test vehicle and verified in a series of single and double lane changes. The experimental results approve the simulation outcomes. The developed controller can be easily implemented on steerable trailers; since it utilizes common sensors for steering input, speed and yaw rates and does not require large computing capacity. The significant improvements obtained by the developed controller can promote the use of longer combination vehicles in traffic, which will result in a reduction of traffic congestion problem, as well as substantial environmental and economic benefits...|$|R

50|$|The most {{significant}} employment of tank destroyers in Normandy was in early August, {{at the battle}} of Mortain, where the 823rd Tank Destroyer Battalion (towed 3-inch guns) was on the defensive alongside the 30th Infantry Division.

The 823rd put up a strong defense—knocking out fourteen tanks—but took heavy losses, being mostly overrun and losing eleven guns.

40|$|The {{three main}} {{requirements}} of a vehicle-trailer connection system are: en route stability, over- or under-steering restraint, minimum off-tracking along curved path. Linking the two units by four-bar trapeziums, wider stability margins may be attained {{in comparison with the}} conventional pintle-hitch for both instability types, divergent or oscillating. The stability maps are traced applying the Hurwitz method or the direct analysis of the characteristic equation at the instability threshold. Several types of four-bar linkages may be quickly tested, with the drawbars converging towards the trailer or the <b>towing</b> <b>unit.</b> The latter configuration appears preferable in terms of self-stability and may yield high critical speeds by optimising the geometrical and physical properties. Nevertheless, the system stability may be improved in general by additional vibration dampers in parallel with the connection linkage. Moreover, the four-bar connection may produce significant corrections of the under-steering or over-steering behaviour of the vehicle-train after a steering command from the driver. The offtracking along the curved paths may be also optimized or kept inside prefixed margins of acceptableness. Activating electronic stability systems if necessary, fair results are obtainable for both the steering conduct and the off-tracking...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} and transport of voids in composite materials remains a key research area in composite manufacturing science. Knowledge of how voids, resin, and fiber reinforcement propagate throughout a composite material continuum from green state to cured state during an automated tape layup process {{is key to}} minimizing defects induced by void-initiated stress concentrations under applied loads {{for a wide variety}} of composite applications. This paper focuses on modeling resin flow in a deforming fiber tow during an automated process of partially impregnated thermoset prepreg composite material tapes. In this work, a <b>tow</b> <b>unit</b> cell based model has been presented that determines the consolidation and impregnation of a thermoset prepreg tape under an input pressure profile. A parametric study has been performed to characterize the behavior of varying tow speed and compaction forces on the degree of consolidation. Results indicate that increased tow consolidation is achieved with slower tow speeds and higher compaction forces although the relationship is not linear. The overall modeling of this project is motivated to address optimization of the 'green state' composite properties and processing parameters to reduce or eliminate 'cured state' defects, such as porosity and de-lamination.
