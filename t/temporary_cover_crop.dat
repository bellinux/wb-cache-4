40|$|In {{order to}} advance or delay grape ripening, colored {{covering}} plastic films with different radiometric properties {{are often used}} in table grape viticulture in South Italy. Covering films protect also clusters from adverse weather conditions, such as rain, hail and wind, and reduce damage of the berries from diseases, especially in organic viticulture. The covering of vineyards is a sustainable choice for the organic soil management strategies that will influence also grape quality and quantity. This paper presents the results obtained during an experimental test carried out during 2012 at an organic irrigated 'Sugrathirteen'Â® table grape vines cultivation at Gioia del Colle (Bari, Italy). Three plastic films, coded Yellow, Neutral and Red film, were used to cover the grapes. Three different soil inter-row space management, such as tilled cultivation, permanent resident cover crop and temporary sub-terranean clover, were applied. The interaction effects of the plastic films and of the soil inter-row space management were analysed. Radiometric tests were carried out in laboratory on the plastic films {{at the beginning of}} the vegetation period. Different soil management strategies and plastic films covering have shown high interaction on vines water status in relation to midday stem water potential during berry growth period. Berry weight was affected from plastic filmâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 7 soil management interactions with a highest berry mass on Yellow plastic filmâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 7 Trifolium soil management. An high interactions between different soil managementsâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 7 plastic films were observed in terms of T. S. S., T.

Olive tree s {{and vines}} {{are two of}} the major tree crops in the Mediterranean region. Both crops present severe soil {{degradation}} problems due to accelerated water erosion associated with cultivation on sloping areas, sporadic but intense rainfall events, and management based on bare soil to prevent competition for soil water with the main crop (Gómez et al., 2011). In the last few decades the major soil conservation efforts for both crops have been or iented towards the use of <b>temporary</b> <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> in the lanes between the tree rows that are mowed or sprayed in the early spring to balance soil conservation with an adequate soil water balance for the major crop.

Growing <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> is recognized as a climate-smart agricultural practice. Practical recommendation Where to position and when to time <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> in the rotation? •	Grow <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> in the 1 st and 2 nd year after ploughing of clover-grass to avoid nitrogen losses. •	Grow nitrogen fixing <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> on soils with low fertility. •	Sow <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> into or immediately after the main crop. In row <b>crops,</b> sow the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> {{in combination with the}} last hoeing. If the harvest of the main crop is rather early, sow the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> after harvest. •	The earlier a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> is sown in August, less nitrogen is lost. Each day of delay in sowing a cruciferous <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> in August results in loss of about 2 kg of N per ha. •	Do not sow cruciferous <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> into main crops shortly before the harvest, as weed competition may be too high for successful establishment of the <b>cover</b> <b>crop.</b> •	<b>Cover</b> <b>crops</b> sown in spring usually establish well and safely. For spring-sown <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> use clover mix rather than ryegrass to satisfy nitrogen needs. •	On sandy soils with irrigation, undersow spring crops with wide row distances after the main crop has developed 1 - 2 nodes high to allow hoeing of the main crop in early stages. •	In winter <b>crops,</b> sow <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> (clover mix rather than ryegrass) in spring as early as possible. •	Use <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> after application of large amounts of solid manure, as it helps to retain the nitrogen. •	In lupines or broad beans, undersow a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> followed by a spring crop the next year. If a winter crop is chosen instead, perennial weeds might flourish. <b>Cover</b> <b>crops</b> and weed control •	Problems with creeping thistle, sow-thistle and coltsfoot do not rule out cover crops: Sow the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> immedia¬tely after an early harvest and ploughing.

40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is a major}} issue in organic farming systems. Although interseeding <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> is one alternative to herbicides, <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> often suppress not only weeds but also main <b>crops.</b> Therefore, using <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> for weed control without adverse effects on main crop growth is important. To verify the effect of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> on competition between main <b>crops,</b> <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> and weeds in a snowy-cold region, main crops soybean (Glycine max Merr.) in 2005 and maize (Zea mays L.) in 2006 were grown with <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), respectively. The <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> were sown on three sowing dates: before main crop planting (Pre-MC), on the same date of main crop planting (Syn-MC) and after main crop planting (Post-MC). A plot without <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> (Sole-MC) was used as a control. The dry weight (DW), vegetation cover ratio (VCR), vertical community structure and chlorophyll content were measured to estimate the competition between main <b>crops,</b> <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> and weeds. Weed DW was suppressed significantly by sowing <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> in both soybean and maize. This weed suppression was associated with the increase of VCR of main <b>crops</b> plus <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> at the early growth stage of main crops. Soil seed banks of dominant weed also became lower by sowing <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> implying the importance of proper weed management for suppressing weeds successively. In addition, the sowing dates of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> had large effects on main crops DW especially in maize, i. e., it was significantly lower in Pre-MC and Syn-MC than in Post-MC. Although the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> height was markedly shorter than the main crop height, the chlorophyll content of the main crops was significantly lower when <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> were sown earlier. These results suggest that the growth inhibition of main <b>crops</b> by <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> was partly caused by competition for nutrients between main <b>crops</b> and <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> and this growth inhibition was alleviated when <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> were sown after the establishment of main crops. Consequently, soybean yield was the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 29 %, 18 % and 7 % in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively, and maize yield was also the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 68 %, 100 % and 24 % in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively.

To evaluate the effect of three years of autumn <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> on subsequent processing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) production in 2010 and 2011, a field split-split-plot factorial design trial with effects of <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> type, urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer rate (0 or 140 kg N ha- 1 preplant broadcast incorporated) and tomato cultivar (early vs. late) was conducted. The main plot factor, <b>cover</b> <b>crop,</b> included a no <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> control, oat (Avena sativa L.), winter cereal rye (hereafter referred to as rye) (Secale cereale L.), oilseed radish (OSR) (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiferus Metzg Stokes), and mix of OSR and rye (OSR + rye) treatments. <b>Cover</b> <b>crop</b> biomass of 0. 5 to 2. 8 and 1. 7 to 3. 1 Mg ha- 1 was attained in early Oct. and the following early May, respectively. In general, OSR increased soil mineral N during <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> growth and into the succeeding summer tomato growing season, while the remaining <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> did not differ from the no <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> control. The lack of a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> by N rate interaction in soil and plant N analyses at harvest suggests that growers may not need to modify N fertilizer rates to tomatoes based on <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> type. Processing tomato fruit quality at harvest (rots, insect or disease damage, Agtron colour, pH, or natural tomato soluble solids (NTSS)) was not affected by <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> type.

However, <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> {{may contribute to}} weed suppression and soil fertility, potentially increasing crop yield and sustainability of the system. The utility of individual <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> species have been well documented, but the agronomic benefits of diverse <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixtures have received less attention. <b>Cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixtures are an appealing option for farmers, as increasing species diversity {{has been shown to}} increase resource-use efficiency, stability, resiliency, and productivity of plant communities. Despite the growing interest in <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixtures, {{little is known about the}} effect of increasing <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> diversity on cropping system performance. Moreover, organic farmers have questions about the most effective method for <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixture termination. In an effort to increase knowledge about <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixtures and management for the western Corn Belt, an organic {{cropping systems}} trial was initiated in 2009 at the UNL ARDC near Mead, NE. Spring-sown mixtures of <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> ranging from two to eight species, were included in a sunflower - soybean - corn <b>crop</b> rotation. <b>Cover</b> <b>crops</b> were planted in late-March and terminated mechanically with either a field disk or sweep plow undercutter in late-May. Changes in <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixture influenced <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> productivity and early-season weed biomass, while termination method drove differences in weed community composition, soil microbial community structure, soil moisture and nitrogen, and crop yield. Interestingly, the management of ambient weed communities as a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> led to unique shifts in soil microbial community structure, but did not alter soil nitrogen or crop yield when compared to <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixtures. When considering cropping system performance in combination with potential environmental benefits, diverse <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixtures paired with a sweep plow undercutter for termination seems to be a profitable and sustainable management option for organic grain farmers in the western Corn Belt. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{a growing}} global {{population}} and society’s {{increased awareness of}} the negative environmental impacts of intensive row-cropping agriculture, conservation practices in agriculture are becoming more prominent and important. <b>Cover</b> <b>cropping</b> is one such conservation practice that has generated {{a lot of interest}} in the agricultural community in recent years. While the use of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> has been increasing, the large majority of farmers in the United States do not implement a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> into their rotations. While there is growing evidence of the agronomic and environmental benefits that <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> can provide, including reducing erosion, increasing soil nitrogen content, and weed control, reliable long-term economic information on <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> use is minimal. ^ Knowing that farmers would be more likely to adopt <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> if they had access to reliable information on how they can benefit the farm financially, our study sought to determine how <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> influence cash crop yield. To perform an economic analysis on the benefits and costs of <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> we gathered data from farmers from Central and Northeastern Indiana in corn-corn or corn-soybean rotations. We obtained data from both <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> and non-cover crop farmers. They were asked to provide five years of data on their fields, their cash crop management and yield, their <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> use, and demographic information. This information, combined with monthly precipitation and daily temperature data by county, was then econometrically analyzed using a fixed effects model to determine the yield differences between <b>cover</b> <b>cropped</b> and non-cover cropped fields, as well as to determine other significant yield-determining factors. ^ The study included 95 fields supplied from 20 farmers. This number was smaller than initially desired when recruiting farmers to participate in the study. The dataset needs to be larger to obtain conclusive results, requiring more fields in general, more <b>cover</b> <b>cropped</b> fields, and more fields that have been using <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> on a long-term basis. While the dataset was smaller than initially hoped, the study did find some interesting results. The study also found evidence that farmers who already use another form of conservation practice, such as no-till, are more likely to adopt <b>cover</b> <b>crops.</b> The near homogeneity of no-till in the <b>cover</b> <b>cropped</b> fields may suggest that the use of no-till is already capturing several of the same benefits that <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> can provide. The farmers in this study who used <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> also had a higher average slope when compared to non-cover crop farmers, implying that farmers who have less productive fields that are more susceptible to erosion are more likely to adopt <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> because they have more to gain from their use. Finally, it was found that the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> farmers applied less fertilizer to their soil, although we cannot confirm that <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> are the cause of the lower levels of applied fertilizer. ^ The dataset available to us provided some interesting results, but ultimately failed to show a significant increase in yields due to <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> use. This could be due to the size of the dataset, or a contradiction of the literature that says <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> increase yield. The lack of a significant impact could also be due to the fact that <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> have different impacts on different fields, under different management strategies, and using different <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> species. The lessons and takeaways learned from the methods used to gather and analyze information in this study can also be used to influence further research efforts sand methods. ...|$|R

30|$|Adequate use of <b>cover</b> <b>cropping</b> {{prior to}} {{strawberry}} transplanting can improve soil structure, suppress weeds, {{and if the}} proper <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> is grown, suppress nematode populations. Recent {{research has shown that}} certain <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> can kill disease organisms as well (Pritts and Nonnecke 2004). Benefits of a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> are greatest when the soil is sandy and/or the soil organic matter content is low. Although <b>cover</b> <b>cropping</b> prior to strawberry transplanting is not widespread in Egypt, many strawberry areas have such soil characteristics. Furthermore, to optimize this practice, the chosen <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> should be compatible with time of year when a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> is desired, the crop to follow, pH and soil fertility, available tillage equipment, length of time the crop will be allowed to grow, and primary purpose of the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> (increasing soil organic matter, reducing weed populations, or controlling certain pests such as targeting a definite nematode species). <b>Cover</b> <b>crops</b> such as marigold, switch grass, and sunn hemp have been shown to reduce populations of root-knot (Osman et al. 2008), lesion (Pritts and Nonnecke 2004), and sting (Noling 2016) nematodes, respectively.|$|R

Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} was to assess the economic impact of different amounts of biomass associated with growing high residue <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> in a corn-cotton conservation tillage system.

Findings suggest that rye and crimson clover <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> used in a conservation tillage system can, in fact, be profitable to a farmer if managed properly and if economically viable levels of biomass are obtained from the <b>cover</b> <b>crops.</b> Taking into account potential cost savings, the minimum amount of <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> biomass needed to be profitable for rye prior to cotton was 4, 897 lbs per acre and for crimson clover prior to corn was 2, 680 lbs per acre...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cover</b> <b>crops</b> are {{increasingly}} being used in agriculture, primarily for weed or erosion management. The addition of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> increases the primary productivity {{of the system and}} diversifies basal resources for higher trophic levels. How increases in {{the quality and quantity of}} basal resources affect bottom-up and top-down control remains a key question in soil food web ecology. We evaluated the response of the nematode community to the introduction of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> between rows of a banana plantation. We measured changes in nematode food web structure and inferred the prevalence of bottom-up and top-down effects on the abundance of phytophagous nematodes (i. e., plant-feeding and root-hair-feeding species) 1. 5 years after plots with <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> (Poaceae or Fabaceae species) or bare soil were established. The addition of a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> greatly affected the structure and the abundance of the soil nematode community 1. 5 years after planting. The abundance of all trophic groups except for plant-feeding nematodes tended to increase with the addition of <b>cover</b> <b>crops.</b> The Shannon Weaver diversity index and the enrichment index increased with the addition of <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> indicating that opportunistic, bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes benefited from the added resources. Plant-feeding nematodes were least abundant in plots with Poaceae <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> while bacterivorous, omnivorous, and root-hair-feeding nematodes were more abundant with Fabaceae <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> than with bare soil, indicating that <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> identity or quality greatly affected soil food web structure. Bottom-up effects on all trophic groups other than plant-feeding nematodes were evident with Poaceae <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> suggesting an top-down control of plant-feeding nematodes by omnivorous nematodes. Conversely, plant-feeding nematodes were evidently not suppressed in Fabaceae <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> perhaps because bottom-up effects on omnivorous nematodes were weaker (hence, top-down control by omnivorous nematodes was weaker), and because Fabaceae <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> probably served as good hosts for some plant-feeding nematodes...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{environmental}} benefits to incorporating <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> into crop rotations, {{such as their}} potential to decrease soil erosion, reduce nitrate (NO 3) leaching, and increase soil organic matter. Some of these benefits impact other agroecosystem processes, such as greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, {{there is not a}} consensus in the literature regarding the effect of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> on nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Compared to site-specific studies, meta-analysis can provide a more general investigation into these effects. Twenty-six peer-reviewed articles including 106 observations of <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> effects on N 2 O emissions from the soil surface were analyzed according to their response ratio, the natural log of the N 2 O flux with a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> divided by the N 2 O flux without a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> (LRR). Forty percent of the observations had negative LRRs, indicating a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> treatment which decreased N 2 O, while 60 % had positive LRRs indicating a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> treatment which increased N 2 O. There was a significant interaction between N rate and the type of <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> where legumes had higher LRRs at lower N rates than nonlegume species. When <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> residues were incorporated into the soil, LRRs were significantly higher than those where residue was not incorporated. Geographies with higher total precipitation and variability in precipitation tended to produce higher LRRs. Finally, data points measured during <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> decomposition had large positive LRRs and were larger than those measured when the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> was alive. In contrast, those data points measuring for a full year had LRRs close to zero, indicating that there was a balance between periods when <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> increased N 2 O and periods when <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> decreased emissions. Therefore, N 2 O measurements over the entire year may be needed to determine the net effect of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> on N 2 O. The data included in this meta-analysis indicate some overarching crop management practices that reduce direct N 2 O emissions from the soil surface, such as no soil incorporation of residues and use of non-legume <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> species. However, our results demonstrate that <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> do not always reduce direct N 2 O emissions from the soil surface in the short term and that more work is needed to understand the full global warming potential of <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> management...|$|R
