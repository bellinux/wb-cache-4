50|$|Metzner, who {{achieved}} {{the rank of}} captain during the war, maintained a visual record of his experiences with the 32nd Indiana through numerous sketches. His illustrations included the daily life of the Union soldiers during training, in camp, and in battle. When artists' supplies were unavailable in the field, Metzner used materials such as scraps of cardboard instead of canvas. His <b>training</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pharmacist</b> also may have provided him with the knowledge to produce tints for his drawings from natural sources such as berries and bark. After the Battle of Stones River, Metzner was assigned as a topographical engineer with the 2nd Division, Army of the Cumberland, where artists' materials were more readily available for sketching during his idle hours. Upon his return to Indianapolis in 1864, Metzner created at least one oil painting from his wartime sketches. An 18.5 in by 23.25 in oil on canvas scene of artillerymen in battle was Metzner's last known work before he pursed other interests.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{inclusion}} of pharmacists in primary healthcare in Brazil through the Family Health Support Team has {{encouraged them to}} reflect on the need to change from a professional focused on medications to one focused on individuals. This autoethnography allowed a pharmacist to confront her perspectives on clinical practice between 2014 and 2016, a period when she decided to challenge her traditional <b>training</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pharmacist</b> centered on medications. Using pharmaceutical care practice as the theoretical framework that prompted the profession of pharmacy to change its focus to the patient, the authors collaborated to construct a monologue that engages readers in the meanings of becoming patient centered. The research findings also support the versatility of application of the reflective process provided by autoethnography. Through fieldwork, reflective writing and interviews, the pharmacist discovered a new way to relate to 2 ̆ 2 caring 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 patients 2 ̆ 2 in her daily routine...|$|E
40|$|Dr John Sebastian Helmcken {{is widely}} viewed as thefirst {{physician}} to establish regular practice in British Columbia. He practised medicine in Prince Rupert and then Victoria from 1850 {{until his death in}} 1920, at the age of 96. His early practice in British Columbia was notable for the skill with which he used chemicals and tinctures brought with him from England. He developed this knowledge of pharmacognosy and pharmaceutics during his apprenticeship as a pharmacist in London before entering his medical apprenticeship. Upon his arrival in Victoria, Dr Helmcken provided medical services far and wide, and was responsible for supplying medicines, advice, and treatment to Hudson Bay Company posts throughout the interior of what was to become British Columbia.
