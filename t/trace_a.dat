5|$|Species {{that were}} unable {{to adapt to the}} {{changing}} environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.|$|E
5|$|At his home, Vance {{is confronted}} by a ghostly vision of Samuel, who accuses him of betraying the church and perpetrating the murders. Vance confesses and blames his {{bitterness}} at having been resurrected with such a scarred and deformed visage. Mulder and Scully, who {{have been able to}} <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> large purchase of grasshoppers to Vance, arrive to find the man dying of cyanide poisoning from his own glass of water. He confesses to the agents before falling dead.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{historical}} record {{of events in}} Iron Age Britain, so archaeological investigation {{is the only way}} to reconstruct the history of Danebury, and other such hill forts. It is impossible to state with certainty every significant event in the hill fort’s history, but where an event leaves an archaeologically identifiable <b>trace,</b> <b>a</b> general chronology can be established, although dates are much less easy to establish. The hill fort was occupied from the mid-6th centuryBC until around 100BC, and the defences were remodelled numerous times.|$|E

5|$|Giles' dream {{begins with}} Giles {{swinging}} a watch {{in front of}} Buffy. They are in Giles' apartment, which has been stripped of furniture but for a chair and a bed. She laughs, and Giles' dream cuts to a family scene with Buffy and his girlfriend Olivia at a fairground. Quicker than the others to understand that something is wrong, he confronts Spike, who is posing for a photo-shoot in his crypt. In The Bronze, he meets Anya failing as a stand-up comic, and Willow and Xander (with a bloody chest wound), who warn him of their attacker. He breaks into song, giving {{suggestions on how to}} deal with what hunts them, but when the sound system breaks down, he crawls backstage to <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> wiring fault. He begins to realize his pursuer is the First Slayer, just as she scalps him.|$|E
5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, {{and the victim}} is coerced into paying for the ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to <b>trace.</b> <b>A</b> range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E

25|$|For any {{particular}} cipher, the input difference {{must be carefully}} selected for the attack to be successful. An analysis of the algorithm's internals is undertaken; the standard method is to <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> path of highly probable differences through the various stages of encryption, termed a differential characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Many traditions, {{including}} those of British Traditional Wicca, require formal initiation within an established coven for membership of their respective traditions.

25|$|The {{definition}} of c-command is based {{partly on the}} relationship of dominance: Node N1 dominates node N2 if N1 is above N2 in the tree and one can <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> path from N1 to N2 moving only downwards in the tree (never upwards); that is, if N1 is a parent, grandparent, etc. of N2.|$|E

25|$|In December 1927, the U.S. Navy {{placed a}} {{contract}} with the Hall Aluminum Aircraft Corporation of Bristol, Pennsylvania for a developed version of the Naval Aircraft Factory PN-11, which itself could <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> development history back to the Felixstowe F.5 flying boat of World War I.

25|$|The {{creation}} of the Karakoram fault started with {{the closing of the}} ancient Tethys ocean seaway which once separated the two modern continents of Asia and India. The Karakoram fault itself does not <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> plate boundary, except for where it possibly ends in the Indus-Yalu Suture Zone. The original thrusting occurred by linking existing thrust faults in what is now the Pamir Mountains starting between 17-20 millions years ago.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> vacancy chain, a {{researcher}} notes a vacancy coming {{into a system}} and then follows this vacancy as it moves {{to a number of}} resource units in turn and then finally leaves the system. Since vacancy chains in humans often take considerable periods of time, on the order of months, to move from beginning to end and because the chains often involve people widely scattered geographically, researchers usually trace the chains by reconstructing them from organizational records or from series of linked interviews.|$|E
25|$|These are {{intended}} for measuring spatial ability in children. With this test, an experimenter presents the participant with a drawing of a maze {{with a picture of}} a man in the centre. While the participant watches, the experimenter uses his or her finger to <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> pathway from the opening of the maze to the drawing of the man. The participant is then expected to replicate the demonstrated pathway through the maze to the drawing of the man. Mazes vary in complexity as difficulty increases.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> continuous line of cultural development during this time. A proposed theory that the islands were sparsely populated during Fatimid rule {{is based on a}} citation in the French translation of the Rawd al-mi'ṭār fī khabar al-aqṭār ("The Scented Garden of Information about Places"). Al-Himyari describes Malta as generally uninhabited and visited by Arabs solely for the purpose of gathering honey and timber and catching fish. No other chronicles make similar descriptions and this claim is not universally accepted.|$|E

25|$|Studies using {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> slight increase in {{blood flow to the}} frontal lobe in participants completing prospective memory tasks involving remembering a planned action, while performing other tasks. During these procedures, sites of brain activation include the prefrontal cortex, specifically the right dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and medial regions, as well as the median frontal lobe. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for holding the intention in consciousness and suppressing other internal thoughts. The median frontal lobe keeps attention focused on the planned action instead of the other tasks.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for the Olympic flame to be accidentally or deliberately extinguished {{during the course of the}} relay, and on at least one occasion the cauldron itself has gone out during the Games. To guard against this eventuality, multiple copies of the flame are transported with the relay or maintained in backup locations. When a torch goes out, it is re-lit (or another torch is lit) from one of the backup sources. Thus, the fires contained in the torches and Olympic cauldrons all <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> common lineage back to the same Olympia lighting ceremony.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, McDonnell Douglas {{unveiled}} {{a study of}} a double deck jumbo-sized aircraft designated MD-12. Despite briefly leaving the market, the study was perceived as merely a public relations exercise to disguise the fact that MDC was struggling under intense pressure from Boeing and Airbus. It was clear to most in the industry that MDC had neither the resources nor the money to develop such a large aircraft, and the study quickly sank without a <b>trace.</b> <b>A</b> similar double deck concept was used in Boeing's later Ultra-Large Aircraft study intended to replace the 747, but ultimately the double deck concept would not {{see the light of}} day until the Airbus A380 in the 2000s.|$|E
