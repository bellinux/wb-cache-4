5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{vertical}} monopoly, by 1940 the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States, from local and long-distance service to the telephones themselves. This allowed Bell to prohibit its customers from connecting phones not made or sold by Bell to the system without paying fees. For example, if a customer desired a type of phone not leased by the local Bell monopoly, he or she had to purchase <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> cost, give it to the phone company, then pay a 're-wiring' charge and a monthly lease fee in order to use it.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the show {{occurred}} to actor James Corden during a wedding reception, and he then developed the idea with co-writer Ruth Jones, whom he had met during the filming of ITV drama Fat Friends. Corden claims to {{have been inspired by}} the story of his own real life best friend Gavin, who met his wife over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> work, and arranged to meet. They presented it to the BBC as a one-off play, but the BBC instead asked for a full series. The roles of Gavin and Stacey were cast through an auditioning process, but were almost immediately given to Mathew Horne and Joanna Page on the strength of their chemistry together. The roles of Nessa and Smithy were written by Corden and Jones for themselves. Some roles were written with certain actors in mind; Uncle Bryn was written specifically for Rob Brydon, who had been to school with Jones, whilst Pam was written specifically for Alison Steadman, who had also worked on Fat Friends. Jones had worked with Julia Davis in her sitcom Nighty Night, and the role of Dawn was written with her in mind. Additionally, Corden had appeared with Adrian Scarborough in the Alan Bennett-penned play and film, The History Boys, which led to him being cast in the role of Pete. An audition process was used to cast the roles of Mick and Gwen, whilst the roles of Gavin's friends were given to Corden's co-stars in The History Boys.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team {{then set}} about recording the game's dialog, which {{proved to be}} challenging because of Vicious Cycle's location on the East Coast. [...] All of the recordings were done over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> a studio in Hollywood. [...] Despite this, {{and the fact that}} Fred alone had over 1000 lines of in-game dialog, the recording went smoothly, {{with the exception of one}} unidentified actor who walked out in the middle of a session. [...] The original script had only one instance of the word [...] "fuck", but several recording sessions with McGinley resulted in a great deal of colorful improvisation. [...] The design team liked the recordings and the script was modified to permit McGinley and other actors to curse more. [...] McGinley focused on portraying Fred as [...] "pissed off" [...] and [...] "having a chip on his shoulder" [...] because his head was missing.|$|E
500|$|Apart from Mike Schmidt, Jeremy Fitzgerald, Fritz Smith, and Michael (a {{character}} {{whose voice}} is heard in Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location), {{none of the}} other human characters in the series have any real, or at least confirmed, names. In the first three games, a man simply identified as [...] "Phone Guy" [...] leaves a recording over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of each night which serves as advice to the player {{on how to deal with}} the animatronics. Phone Guy is present through all five nights of Five Nights at Freddy's 2, four of the main nights in Five Nights at Freddy's, and four of the main nights in Five Nights at Freddy's 3 (as well as in Night 6 for the second and third games.) He is not present in the fourth and fifth games, though his first night recording from the original game is sometimes played backwards as ambiance in Five Nights at Freddy's 4. His call at the start of Night 4 in Five Nights at Freddy's implies that he was killed by the animatronics. In the third game, he is heard over archival recordings discovered by the creators of Fazbear's Fright. Sister Location instead features a human A.I. named [...] "HandUnit", who like Phone Guy, acts as a tutor to the player. [...] The first two nights of the third game also feature [...] "Phone Dude", one of the creators of Fazbear's Fright.|$|E
2500|$|The {{games are}} visual novels, {{in which the}} player can affect {{the outcome of the}} story through choices. In Chaos;Head and Chaos;Child, the player does this by {{controlling}} what types of delusions the player character experiences: they can make him experience positive or negative delusions, or alternatively choose to let him stay in reality. Chaos;Child Love Chu Chu!! additionally uses a [...] "yes/no" [...] questionnaire the player character takes in in-game magazines to determine the plot's direction. In Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0, the player affects the outcome by using the player character's cell phone: in Steins;Gate, it is done by choosing to respond to certain messages, make phone calls, or taking out <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> specific times, as this affects what information the player character learns and how he interacts with other characters; and in Steins;Gate 0, it is done by deciding whether or not to answer <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> certain times. Robotics;Notes works similarly to Steins;Gate, but with the player using a tablet computer and its apps instead of a cell phone.|$|E

2500|$|A {{statement}} {{released by}} the Afghan interior ministry said, [...] "The initial findings of the ministry show that the main target of this attack has not been security forces like in most attacks but has been particularly planned to target the Indian embassy". There was immediate confusion and panic in the Indian embassy after the bomb blasts. According to a CNN reporter, a man who answered <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> the Indian embassy abruptly hung up, saying, [...] "We are not fine. All communications have been cut off". The Ministry of External Affairs of Government of India {{was reported to be}} in touch with India's ambassador to Afghanistan, Jayant Prasad. The Indian ambassador and his deputy were inside the building complex at the time of the explosion but were not hurt. Indian External Affairs Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, called for an emergency meeting of officials in Delhi after the bomb attack to review security arrangements. An anonymous person reported that rumours said the Indian embassy had previously received bomb threats.|$|E

According to Klein, Haq then moved to another section of the building and Klein, bleeding profusely, crawled to her desk and dialed 911, despite Haq's threats to kill anyone who called the police. Haq eventually returned to Klein's office and discovered her on <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> <b>at</b> which point he reportedly shouted [...] "Now since you don't know how to ... listen, now you're the hostage, and I don't give a [...] if I kill you or your baby." [...] Klein told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that Haq [...] "...stated that he was a Muslim, [...] this was his personal statement against Jews and the Bush administration for giving money to Jews, and for us Jews for giving money to Israel, about Hezbollah, the war in Iraq, and he wanted to talk to CNN." [...] Klein then offered Haq the phone and suggested that he tell the dispatcher what he had just told her.|$|E
2500|$|During the storyline, Inside Soap {{magazine}} had {{a regular}} feature they called [...] "Kat watch! Our {{eye on her}} guy!" [...] {{in which they would}} be [...] "scouring the episodes with a fine-tooth comb to spot any stolen glances, pointed lines of dialogue or suspicious circumstances that might indicate the identity of the fella Kat is having her torrid affair with." [...] In the first few episodes of the storyline, Derek asks for Kat's help to keep Joey in Walford, which Inside Soap said would mean he would owe Kat a favour, and Derek defends Kat when she is insulted by the rival football team's manager. Inside Soap also pointed out [...] "serious" [...] flirting between Jack and Kat, when she teases him about being out of shape, and she names him 'Legs of the match' after the team play their first football match. They spotted that Kat has a [...] "smouldering tete-a-tete" [...] with Max and she knows how frustrated he is by his family problems, and he is also seen on <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> the same time as Kat.
