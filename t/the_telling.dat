From {{the end of}} October to mid-November, Poe Evermore, a storytelling event based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe is held.

5|$|In Native American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the coyote in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites in Native American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in <b>the</b> <b>telling.</b> One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.|$|E
5|$|Montejo the Younger next {{sent his}} cousin to Chauaca {{where most of}} the eastern lords greeted him in peace. The Cochua Maya {{resisted}} fiercely but were soon defeated by the Spanish. The Cupul Maya also rose up against the newly imposed Spanish domination, and also their opposition was quickly put down. Montejo continued to the eastern Ekab province, reaching the east coast at Pole. Stormy weather prevented the Spanish from crossing to Cozumel, and nine Spaniards drowned in the attempted crossing. Another Spanish conquistador was killed by hostile Maya. Rumours of this setback grew in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> and both the Cupul and Cochua provinces once again rose up against their would-be European overlords. The Spanish hold on the eastern portion of the peninsula remained tenuous and a number of Maya polities remained independent, including Chetumal, Cochua, Cupul, Sotuta and the Tazes.|$|E
50|$|At their Garden of Eden {{music festival}} in September 2006, the band debuted another side project dubbed <b>The</b> <b>Tells.</b> Consisting of all {{five members of}} Strangefolk, <b>The</b> <b>Tells</b> played a late-night two-hour set of music {{consisting}} entirely of Led Zeppelin cover songs. The band repeated this performance again in October 2006, opening for themselves under <b>the</b> moniker <b>The</b> <b>Tells</b> at a concert in Burlington, VT. In September 2007 <b>The</b> <b>Tells</b> performed a Jack White themed late night set at the StrangeCreek Festival in Greenfield, MA, covering songs by The White Stripes and The Raconteurs.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tell</b> {{contains}} <b>the</b> {{remains of}} at least 30 settlements (so-called building levels) placed one over the other. Various peoples had settled at <b>the</b> <b>tell</b> altogether for more than 6,000 years, {{at least from the}} Early Chalcolithic (5000 BCE) onwards. On top of <b>the</b> <b>tell,</b> a medieval cemetery with Christian burials was excavated. For the most part, the burials were without grave-goods. A small Roman period (2nd to 6th century AD) fortress also existed on the top of <b>the</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>The</b> fortification was further enforced by a ditch surrounding <b>the</b> <b>tell.</b> Both <b>the</b> fortress and the medieval cemetery, to a large extent, disturbed the building layers from the Early and Late Iron Age. However, two building levels from the Early Iron Age (10th to 6th century BCE) and one from the Late Iron Age (5th and 4th century BCE) have been attested.|$|R

25|$|Form {{and order}} of the event - The aunt's story might begin as a {{response}} to a toast to the grandmother. The story's plot and development would have a sequence structured by the aunt.

50|$|Scant {{evidence}} of this period was found on <b>the</b> <b>tell</b> in <b>the</b> form of stray sherds. In the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>tell</b> (to <b>the</b> east, in Area C6) {{evidence of}} tombs and possible domestic activities were found.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tell</b> Atlas {{enjoys a}} typical Mediterranean climate, warm with dry summers and mild, rainy winters with snow at upper elevations. As a consequence, the {{northern}} slopes of <b>the</b> <b>Tell</b> Atlas are forested with the endemic Abies numidica, and Atlas cedar, pine, and cork oak. In the summer a hot, dry wind, the Sirocco, blows north from the Sahara across <b>the</b> <b>Tell</b> Atlas, causing dusty, dry conditions {{along the northern}} coast of Africa.|$|R

25|$|While Fulgentius {{claims to}} explain the Aeneid as an allegory for {{the full range of}} human life, the work seems to end rather abruptly, and <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> only goes as far as manhood. There is no {{evidence}} to suggest, however, that any part of the original text was lost. His hurried finish was probably caused by a loss of interest in its completion.|$|E
25|$|Galileo Galilei lampooned {{the misuse}} of Occam's razor in his Dialogue.

25|$|Authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde (in The Picture of Dorian Gray) also {{developed}} fantasy, in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> of horror tales, a separate branch of fantasy {{that was to}} have great influence on H.

25|$|Episodes with {{dialogue}} {{from the}} Ramayana are enacted using painted {{figures of the}} characters in profile, which strongly resemble the 18th-century Indian tradition of Rajput painting. The Rajput style of brush painting was principally enacted on manuscripts and commonly employed in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> of epics such as the Ramayana. In the film they serve as a more traditional style of dramatic narrative, although the dialogue is frequently ironic, inappropriately modern or otherwise humorous.|$|E

Upon completion of this campaign, American task forces set their sights on islands closer to the Japanese homeland.

During <b>the</b> <b>telling,</b> George appears with a gun and fires at Martha, but an umbrella pops out. After this scare, Martha's taunts continue, and George reacts violently by breaking a bottle. Nick and Honey become increasingly unsettled and, {{at the end of the}} act, Honey runs to the bathroom to vomit, because she had too much to drink.|$|E
50|$|Shimron was {{the name}} of a major city in the north of Israel in early antiquity. It is {{mentioned}} in the Bible by this name, and in other period sources as Shim'on. In late antiquity, it was known by the name Simonias (סימונייה). The city is identified with <b>the</b> <b>tell</b> called Tell Samunia in Arabic, also written Samunieh. <b>The</b> <b>tell</b> rises 60 meters above its surroundings, north-east of moshav Nahalal, on the border between the Lower Galilee, and the Jezreel Valley. Today <b>the</b> <b>tell</b> in not settled, Timrat was established alongside, to the east.|$|R
50|$|Excavations of <b>the</b> <b>tell</b> have {{identified}} humans living {{here in the}} Bronze and neolithic ages, however the area is principally known as an Iron Age settlement. <b>The</b> <b>tell</b> at Mastuma is 18 metres high and 200 metres in diameter.

25|$|Symbolism {{plays an}} {{enduring}} role in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> {{of a story}} through painting or other Chinese art. For instance, stars and the moon are important both for religious significance and as an illustration of Chinese mythology. Symbols used in art may be grouped into four overarching categories: religious imagery, divine and mortal beings, symbols from nature and inanimate objects. Some examples of symbols include bats which means both good wishes and good luck. The moon, aside from religious and mythical connotations, can also mean a month. The particular way an image is depicted has meaning - like a round eyed-cat means it's a night scene.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling in {{indigenous}} cultures {{is sometimes}} passed on by oral means {{in a quiet}} and relaxing environment, which usually coincides with family or tribal community gatherings and official events such as family occasions, rituals, or ceremonial practices. During <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> of the story, children may act as participants by asking questions, acting out the story, or telling smaller parts of the story. Furthermore, stories are not often told {{in the same manner}} twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.|$|E
25|$|By AD 8, he had {{completed}} his most ambitious work, the Metamorphoses, a hexameter epic poem in 15 books. The work encyclopedically catalogues transformations in Greek and Roman mythology, from {{the emergence of}} the cosmos to the apotheosis of Julius Caesar. The stories follow each other in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> of human beings transformed to new bodies: trees, rocks, animals, flowers, constellations etc. At the same time, he worked on the Fasti, a six-book poem in elegiac couplets on the theme of the calendar of Roman festivals and astronomy. The composition of this poem was interrupted by Ovid's exile, and it is thought that Ovid abandoned work on the piece in Tomis. It is probably in this period, if they are indeed by Ovid, that the double letters (16–21) in the Heroides were composed.|$|E

50|$|Manhunters was {{a three-part}} TV Drama Series that aired on BBC Two in the United Kingdom in 2005. It <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> story of three cases of man-eaters through the memoirs {{of those who}} hunted them and, {{in the case of}} the third episode, accidentally {{unleashed}} them on their community. <b>The</b> first <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> story of Jim Corbett, played by Jason Flemyng and the Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag. <b>The</b> second <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> story of George Rushby and the Lions of Njombe, and <b>the</b> third <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> story of the Wolf of Gysinge.|$|R
25|$|Anyhow, {{a fierce}} story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American {{character}} with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) {{is only half}} Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> itself. For a huge picture, There Will Be Blood is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well {{down the road from}} Eli Sunday's church—and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world. For bleakness, the movie can't be beat—nor for brilliance.|$|E
25|$|Zeus, {{pressed by}} {{the cries of}} the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever {{consumed}} food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who had been sent to retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds, (either six or four according to <b>the</b> <b>telling)</b> which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six or four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother {{for the rest of the}} year. This left a long period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} an aspectual frame is the unrealized inceptive aspect ('just about to X'), {{illustrated}} here with the verb 'to tell'. 'To tell' is an indexical (directional) verb, where the index finger (a G hand) begins with a touch to the chin and then moves outward {{to point out the}} recipient of <b>the</b> <b>telling.</b> 'To be just about to tell' retains just the locus and the initial chin touch, which now becomes the final hold of the sign; all other features from the basic verb (in this case, the outward motion and pointing) are dropped and replaced by features from the frame (which are shared with the unrealized inceptive aspects of other verbs such as 'look at', 'wash the dishes', 'yell', 'flirt', etc.). These frame features are: Eye gaze toward the locus (which is no longer pointed at with the hand), an open jaw, and a hand (or hands, in the case of two-hand verbs) in front of the trunk which moves in an arc to the onset location of the basic verb (in this case, touching the chin), while the trunk rotates and the signer inhales, catching her breath during the final hold. The hand shape throughout the sign is whichever is required by the final hold, in this case a G hand.|$|E
