5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water</b> drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
25|$|On the air side of HVAC coils a {{significant}} difference exists between those used for heating, and those for cooling. Due to psychrometrics, air that is cooled often has moisture condensing out of it, except with extremely dry air flows. Heating some air increases that airflow's capacity <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water.</b> So heating coils need not consider moisture condensation on their air-side, but cooling coils must be adequately designed and selected to handle their particular latent (moisture) {{as well as the}} sensible (cooling) loads. The water that is removed is called condensate.|$|E

25|$|Decayed, dried {{sphagnum}} moss has {{the name of}} peat or peat moss. This {{is used as a}} soil conditioner which increases the soil's capacity <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water</b> and nutrients by increasing capillary forces and cation exchange capacity. This is often necessary when dealing with very sandy soil, or plants that need increased or steady moisture content to flourish. A distinction is sometimes made between {{sphagnum moss}}, the live moss growing on top of a peat bog, and 'sphagnum peat moss' (North American usage) or 'sphagnum peat' (British usage), the latter being the slowly decaying matter underneath.|$|E
25|$|In unconsolidated aquifers, {{groundwater}} {{is produced}} from pore spaces between particles of gravel, sand, and silt. If the aquifer is confined by low-permeability layers, the reduced water {{pressure in the}} sand and gravel causes slow drainage of water from the adjoining confining layers. If these confining layers are composed of compressible silt or clay, the loss of water to the aquifer reduces the water pressure in the confining layer, causing it to compress from the weight of overlying geologic materials. In severe cases, this compression can be observed on the ground surface as subsidence. Unfortunately, much of the subsidence from groundwater extraction is permanent (elastic rebound is small). Thus, the subsidence is not only permanent, but the compressed aquifer has a permanently reduced capacity <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the natural}} {{resources}} in the Salween basin remained unexploited until the twentieth century as well. Prior to extensive logging activity in the upper watershed, the Salween's flow varied much less between the rainy and dry seasons, allowing for fertile riverbanks fed by soil deposits from the river. With the clear-cutting of the forests during the 20th century, specifically in 1997, soil began to erode away in great amounts and was unable <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water,</b> thus lowering the river's baseflow during the dry season and causing floods of greater size during the monsoon. The erosion has also made the Salween very silty. The construction of logging roads made it even easier for Burmese interests to enter the area, exploiting other resources and severely damaging the native way of life. Although strict limitations have been imposed on logging, illegal practices continue, including one in 2009 involving the discovery of teak logs floating in the river on the Thailand-Burma border.|$|E

25|$|The main {{entrance}} of the church leads into a space under the choir area, which is covered by a Gothic vault with nerves that form {{the shape of a}} star. The highly stylized murals painted in black on the side walls have been retouched. They consist of bands of decorations with contains elements such as letters, niches and coats of arms. This entrance area ends with an arch that opens into the main nave. This area serves as the baptistery and contains three monolithic pieces, which originally were part of the teocalli. The first two are used for baptisms. The first is the large basin <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water</b> for baptism. The second, called a “piscina” is meant to receive the water that pours off the head of the one being baptized. On the outside of the main basin, there are the heads of animals and humans, which may indicate that the bowl was originally part of a fountain, readapted to its current function. The heads that protrude indicate the duality of life with the masculine represented by a jaguar and the feminine represented by a woman. The use of a jaguar symbol indicates Olmec influence. Next to these two, there is a small pillar with worn, unidentifiable designs, whose purpose are unknown.|$|E
500|$|In Haiti, Hazel brought flash floods which {{destroyed}} numerous villages, {{and high}} winds which caused considerable damage to major cities. The death toll {{was estimated to}} be as high as 1,000people; most of the casualties drowned when the water flowed in a flood down the mountains, some of which were as high as [...] The situation was exacerbated by deforestation, which lessened the ability of the soil <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water.</b> Haiti's South Peninsula took the brunt of the storm: the largest town, Aux Cayes, reported at least 200 casualties, while the second-largest town of Jérémie was reported to have been washed in the sea, with at least 200 more casualties. Damage in Aux Cayes {{was estimated to be}} $500,000 (1954 USD). Estimates of people left homeless in the wake of Hazel are as high as 100,000. Hazel destroyed about 40% of the coffee trees and 50% of the cacao crop, affecting the country's economy for several years. [...] Objects from Haiti, such as bowls, were reported to have been transported by the hurricane to the Carolinian coast.|$|E
500|$|When {{they first}} arrived in British Columbia, the Doukhobors began felling trees {{adjoining}} the Kootenay River to build their first homesteads. They also cleared areas of level ground in order to plant orchards and fields, and constructed sawmills on the Columbia and Kootenay rivers to process the logs into lumber. After more settlers began arriving, they built larger buildings that housed multiple families, instead of the small cabins then typical of the region. Each larger house or dom, holding 70-100 persons each, was constructed on [...] roughly [...] plots of land that Verigin had divided the entire community into back in 1911. The Doukhobors then constructed a brick factory at the present-day site of Grand Forks, from where they made bricks to be used mostly in the Brilliant settlement. Brilliant {{was also one of}} the first cities in the area to have running water—they constructed a reservoir <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water</b> from the Kootenay River and a local spring, and by 1912, each household had running water. In 1913, Verigin converted an abandoned factory in Nelson, about [...] up the Kootenay from Brilliant, to produce jam and marmalade. The Doukhobors then established a ferry across the Columbia River, and a suspension bridge serving the same purpose was completed in 1913.|$|E

2500|$|Hydration backpacks [...] {{are also}} available. These light daypacks are {{especially}} designed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water</b> {{in a special}} water bladder (also known as reservoir), and their purpose is to allow the carrier constant fluid hydration handsfree, so that the carrier can focus on the mission ahead without having to stop for water breaks. This is possible because of the tube that leads from the bladder (which sits within the backpack), to the front strap of the bag, which is long enough to reach {{the mouth of the}} carrier. These packs are used in extreme conditions such as military operations, during performing extreme sports and also for different competitions, races (such as Spartan or marathon) and even music festivals.|$|E
2500|$|Rafts {{are also}} {{often used as}} a {{whitewater}} craft; more stable than typical kayaks, they are less maneuverable. Rafts can carry large loads, so they are often used for expeditions. Typical whitewater rafts are inflatable craft, made from high strength fabric coated with PVC, Urethane, Neoprene or Hypalon; see rafting. [...] While most rafts are large multi-passenger craft, the smallest rafts are single-person whitewater craft, see packraft. Rafts sometimes have inflatable floors, with holes around the edges, that allow water that splashes into the boat to easily flow {{to the side and}} out the bottom (these are typically called [...] "self-bailers" [...] because the occupants don't have to [...] "bail" [...] water out with a bucket). Others have simple fabric floors, without anyway for water to escape, these are called [...] "bucket boats", both for their tendency <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water</b> like a bucket, and because {{the only way to get}} water out of them is by bailing with a bucket.|$|E

2500|$|Soil {{can have}} a {{significant}} impact on the potential quality of wine. While geologist and viticulturist are not exactly sure what type of immutable or terroir based qualities that soil can impart on wine, there is near universal agreement that a soil's water retention and drainage abilities play a primary role. Water retention refers to the soil's ability <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water.</b> The term [...] "field capacity" [...] is used to describe the maximum amount of water that deeply moistened soil will retain after normal drainage. Drainage is the ability of water to move freely throughout the soil. The ideal circumstance is soil that can retain sufficient amount of water for the grapevine but drains well enough to where the soil doesn't become water-logged. Soil that doesn't retain water well encourages the vine to easily sleep into water stress while soil that doesn't drain well runs of the risk of water-logged roots being attacked by microbial agents that consume all the soil nutrients and end up starving the vine.|$|E
60|$|In {{one corner}} of the Bitter Saal there stood an ancient vessel <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water,</b> and beneath it was a {{porcelain}} trough to catch the drippings.

60|$|Among the {{flowering}} vines is one deserving of particular notice. Each flower {{is composed of}} six leaves or petals, about three inches in length, of a beautiful crimson, the inside spotted with white. Its leaves, of a fine green, are oval, and disposed by threes. This plant climbs upon the trees without attaching itself to them; when it has reached the topmost branches, it descends perpendicularly, and as it continues to grow, extends from tree to tree, until its various stalks interlace the grove like the rigging of a ship. The stems or trunks of this vine are tougher and more flexible than willow, and are from fifty to one hundred fathoms in length. From the fibres, the Indians manufacture baskets of such close texture as <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{scheme to}} be put before them was really Peter's, but Solomon {{did most of the}} talking, because he soon became {{irritable}} if other people talked. He began by saying that he had been much impressed by the superior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nest-building, and this put them into good-humour at once, as it was meant to do; for all the quarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests. Other birds, said Solomon, omitted to line their nests with mud, and as a result they did not hold water. Here he cocked his head as if he had used an unanswerable argument; but, unfortunately, a Mrs. Finch had come to the meeting uninvited, and she squeaked out, 'We don't build nests <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>water,</b> but to hold eggs,' and then the thrushes stopped cheering, and Solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water.|$|E
