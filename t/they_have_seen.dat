5|$|Because fleas carry plague, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> {{service as}} a {{biological}} weapon. During World War II, the Japanese army dropped fleas infested with Y. pestis in China. The bubonic and septicaemic plagues are the most probable form of the plague that would spread {{as a result of}} a bioterrorism attack that used fleas as a vector.|$|E

5|$|His father, Hyman Krustofski, was a rabbi and {{strongly}} opposed young Herschel's wish {{to become a}} comedian; he wanted the boy to go to yeshiva instead. Krusty did attend the school, where he said he made the other students laugh by doing funny impressions of his father. As a result, Krusty became a slapstick comedian behind his father's back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbi's convention and a rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. Rabbi Krustofski, {{who was in the}} audience, recognized him, was furious and disowned his son, and now it has been 25 years since <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> or spoken to each other.|$|E
5|$|The novel first follows Kallik {{who lives}} {{with her mother and}} brother. However, they are {{separated}} on ice when a group of killer whales attacks them and Kallik must survive by herself. On her own, Kallik decides to go to a gathering place for polar bears that her mom told her about. At the gathering, Kallik asks other polar bears if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> her brother, but no one has. Alone, Kallik meets a female bear Nanuk who helps Kallik around the area. However, Nanuk is killed by a helicopter crash shipping her and Kallik back to the wild. Before she dies, Nanuk tells Kallik about a place where the ice never melts. Hearing this, Kallik sets off to this place.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), {{and there are no}} true records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but coming down with a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst with a needle, green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E

5|$|Monroe {{finishes}} {{viewing the}} footage, and expresses his disgust {{to the station}} executives regarding their decision to air the documentary. To convince them otherwise, he shows them the remaining, unedited footage, which only he has seen. The final two reels begin with the team locating a Ya̧nomamö girl, whom the men film and gang-rape. Faye only tries to intervene when Alan participates. Afterwards, they encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where they claim that the natives killed her for loss of virginity. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by the Ya̧nomamö in revenge for the girl's rape and death. Jack is hit by a spear, and Alan shoots him so the team can film how the natives mutilate his corpse. As the three surviving team members try to escape, Faye is captured. Alan initially insists that they try to rescue her, but ultimately decides not to. Mark continues to film as she is raped, beaten to death, and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then pursues and kills the last two team members as the camera drops {{to the floor and}} ends showing Alan's bloody face. Disturbed by what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> the executives order the footage to be destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Fish {{can seem}} mindful of which {{individuals}} have watched {{them in the}} past. In an experiment with Siamese fighting fish, two males were made to fight each other while being watched by a female, whom the males could also see. The winner and the loser of the fight were then, separately, given a choice between spending time next to the watching female or to a new female. The winner courted both females equally, but the loser spent more time next to the new female, avoiding the watcher female. In this species, females prefer males <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> win a fight over males <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> losing, and it therefore makes sense for a male to prefer a female that has never seen him {{as opposed to a}} female that has seen him lose.|$|E

25|$|Outside {{commentators}} {{have also been}} critical of the decision, since it might discourage whistleblowers. In addition to echoing Stevens' concerns, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it as abandoning any concern for the truth, imposing a heavy burden on a plaintiff, relying on an overly narrow conception of the public's interest, and possibly discouraging people from entering public service. The decision resulted in a lower court changing its ruling in a high-profile case involving controversial academic Leonard Jeffries.|$|E
25|$|The SA Greens, {{founded in}} 1995, are a {{sub-division}} of the left-wing Australian Greens.

25|$|Souls {{then begin}} cycles of reincarnation. It {{generally}} takes 10,000 {{years for a}} soul to grow its wings and return to where it came, but philosophers, after having chosen such a life {{three times in a}} row, grow their wings and return after only 3,000 years. This is because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the most and always keep its memory as close as possible, and philosophers maintain the highest level of initiation. They ignore human concerns and are drawn towards the divine. While ordinary people rebuke them for this, they are unaware that the lover of wisdom is possessed by a god. This is the fourth sort of madness, that of love.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{customers}} speak positively about 99p Stores, {{with most}} reviewers only criticising customer and product overcrowding, {{as well as}} a lack of cleanliness in many of their stores. Some reviewers note that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> several items cheaper from other retailers; however mostly the products on offer at 99p Stores are of good value. Reviews on dooyoo.co.uk (a shopping advice and review site) show an average rating of 4/5.

25|$|By far {{the biggest}} problem with the {{conventional}} approach is cost; solar cells require a relatively thick layer of doped silicon in order to have reasonable photon capture rates, and silicon processing is expensive. There {{have been a number of}} different approaches to reduce this cost over the last decade, notably the thin-film approaches, but to date <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> limited application due to a variety of practical problems. Another line of research has been to dramatically improve efficiency through the multi-junction approach, although these cells are very high cost and suitable only for large commercial deployments. In general terms the types of cells suitable for rooftop deployment have not changed significantly in efficiency, although costs have dropped somewhat due to increased supply.|$|E
25|$|In {{popular culture}} and UFO {{conspiracy}} theories, men in black (MIB) are supposed men dressed in black suits who claim to be government agents who harass or threaten UFO witnesses to keep them quiet about what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> It is sometimes implied {{that they may be}} aliens themselves. The term is also frequently used to describe mysterious men working for unknown organizations, as well as various branches of government allegedly designed to protect secrets or perform other strange activities. The term is generic, used for any unusual, threatening or strangely behaved individual whose appearance on the scene can be linked in some fashion with a UFO sighting. Several alleged encounters with the men in black have been reported by UFO researchers and enthusiasts.|$|E
