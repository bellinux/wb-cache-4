5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
5|$|From a Neo-Darwinian perspective, {{evolution}} {{occurs when}} there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms. For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms that can lead <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.|$|E

40|$|Little {{has been}} done {{to address the issue of}} how to {{overcome}} resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> in a change effort in the church world. “How to overcome resistance to change?” is a question that requires serious consideration among church leaders. Church leaders continue to act in ways that produce resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> and ultimately failed change efforts. These actions on the part of church leaders often strengthen and reinforce the sources of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> making it very difficult for <b>change</b> <b>to</b> be accepted by church members. A literature study design was used to conduct this research. The purpose of this research was to: • Understand the phenomenon of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> • <b>To</b> determine the actions of leaders that generate resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> • <b>To</b> determine how church leaders can overcome resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> The research indicates that church leaders make too many errors in a change process that generates resistance <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> The research has found eight actions of leaders that generates resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> by followers. Apart from the eight actions of leaders that produce resistance <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> many <b>change</b> agents continue <b>to</b> function as managers and not leaders in a change process. This results in further resistance <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> The research clearly shows that for church leaders to effectively overcome resistance <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> they need <b>to</b> follow a multi-stage change process, which is comprehensive, sequential and one that develops naturally and addresses all the sources of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> The research shows that church leaders should not skip or race through the steps or fail to reinforce earlier steps in the process of overcoming resistance <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> The researcher recommends nine steps that can be used by church leaders to overcome resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> and thus facilitate change successfully.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2000. The {{management}} of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> by school principals of secondary {{schools in the}} North-West Province was investigated in this study. Changes are continually occurring on all levels of a rapidly developing society, and resistance is an inseparable part of this process. Since the school stands {{in the center of}} the developing community, the school principal, as education manager, should have a firm knowledge of skills which will enable him to efficiently implement the {{management of}} resistance <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Examples of large-scale changes that occurred in education during the past five years are the implementation of Curriculum 2005 and the transformation of Model C schools. The aim of this research centered on the following problems: What is the nature of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change?</b> What does the management of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> encompass? <b>To</b> what extent and in which way do school principals manage resistance <b>to</b> <b>change?</b> Firstly a literature study was undertaken to ascertain the nature of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> as well as methods and models according to which resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> can be managed. Findings from the literature study points to a number of aspects of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> which plays a decisive role in the management of change. These include factors giving rise <b>to</b> resistance <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> types of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> manifestations of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> and reaction phases of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> The way in which resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> is managed is influenced by, among others, factors indicating whether or not the school is ready for change, techniques which can be employed in the management of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> and also existing models which can be used successfully to facilitate the management process of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Secondly an empirical investigation was undertaken to investigate the degree and way in which school principals manage resistance <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> For this purpose a structured questionnaire as well as a semi-structured interview schedule was used. Findings from the empirical interview revealed that in general school principals handled the management of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> better than what was initially surmised, although few of them had enough relevant knowledge to be considered specialists in this field. Recommendations ensuing from this study comprise the inclusion of a module in educational management courses specifically aimed at <b>change,</b> resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> and especially the management of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> with the view to better equip education managers, the development of a refined model for the management of resistance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> in schools, and also further research into such management model(s) to ascertain the practical application or its relevance in practice.

This study analyzed a sample of 113 chronic cocaine/crack users’ performances on the WCST and WAIS-III subtests, the URICA, and the Readiness <b>to</b> <b>Change</b> Ruler. The results showed significant correlations between the presence of cognitive deficits and lower levels of motivation <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Multiple regression analyses revealed the influence of cognitive test performance on the increase of readiness <b>to</b> <b>change</b> among the participants.

The {{purpose of the present}} paper was to explore potential factors influencing employees’ commitment <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> In addition <b>to</b> investigating the role of organisations’ HRM practises and individual disposition during change, we also aimed to broaden the current approach to the research on commitment <b>to</b> <b>change</b> by examining supervisors’ commitment <b>to</b> <b>change</b> and change turbulence. Data were collected from a large governmental organisation. As this study included data from both supervisors (N = 30) and employees (N = 356), multilevel modelling was chosen as the appropriate method for analysis. Results indicated that both change-related information and change-related participation were associated with employees’ commitment <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Change turbulence displayed a significant relationship with employees’ change commitment. Further, and contrary to what was expected, supervisors’ affective commitment <b>to</b> <b>change</b> had a negative relationship with employees’ affective commitment <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Our study implies that the broader change context should be taken into account when investigating factors that predict employees’ commitment <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> We suggest that our findings may be used as guidance for organisations that strive to form a sustainable change process where the employees’ change support is ensured...|$|R
