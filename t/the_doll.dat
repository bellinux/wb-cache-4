50|$|One {{method of}} {{determining}} the production date of <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> is by studying the footwear. For example, <b>the</b> earliest <b>dolls</b> from around 1913 had mocasins made of leather. By 1918, the mocassins were simulated with suede applied to wood, and painted designs. By 1924, they were molded of composition material, and by <b>the</b> 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> had plastic feet. Production of <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> ended in <b>the</b> early 1960s.|$|R

5|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>the</b> <b>doll</b> {{depends on the}} creator; however, certain reborn artists allow customers to customize their doll, usually using a photograph to replicate a particular infant.|$|E
5|$|A reborn doll is a {{manufactured}} skin doll {{that has}} been transformed by an artist to resemble a human infant with as much realism as possible. The process of creating a reborn doll {{is referred to as}} reborning and <b>the</b> <b>doll</b> artists are referred to as reborners.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1940s Pooh author A. A. Milne donated <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> to <b>the</b> American {{publisher}} E. P. Dutton. <b>The</b> <b>dolls</b> {{were then}} {{donated to the}} library in 1988. In 1998 British Member of Parliament Gwyneth Dunwoody urged that <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> {{be returned to the}} British Parliament after saying she [...] "detected sadness" [...] in the inanimate objects.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, the Greek {{government}} banned <b>the</b> <b>dolls,</b> {{releasing a}} statement which described {{them as a}} [...] "serious threat to the smooth formation {{and development of the}} child's personality and mental health." [...] Two of <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> singled out were Inferno, a bat-winged doll with fiery eyes, and Sybil, wearing a collar and chains. In response, the Irish government also looked into banning <b>the</b> <b>dolls,</b> with <b>the</b> Minister of State for Children, Brian Lenihan describing it as a question of [...] "public morality." [...] <b>The</b> <b>dolls</b> were also [...] "nearly banned" [...] in Singapore.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile Matt and {{his partner}} have been {{following}} along with <b>the</b> two worry <b>doll</b> related crimes so far, discovering how they tie together after finding evidence linking them to Henry. They realize {{that all of the}} perpetrators had purchased worry dolls from Chloe and that she had taken them from Matt. They meet up with Della, who tells them that <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> were once capable of strong healing magic, but became cursed after she gave them to a young Henry, as his sorrow and darkness from his father's death corrupted them. Della cautions them that they must bring Chloe and <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> to her in order to remove the curse from the child and <b>the</b> <b>dolls.</b> Now aware that they must collect all <b>the</b> <b>dolls,</b> Darcy and Matt begin looking for <b>the</b> final two <b>dolls,</b> as they had previously collected <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> from <b>the</b> prior two murders. They're successful in collecting <b>the</b> third <b>doll</b> and halting a murder, but Darcy dies while retrieving <b>the</b> fourth <b>doll</b> from Ethan, Amy's boyfriend.|$|R
5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki {{is sitting}} on the bench, starts to rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is <b>the</b> <b>doll</b> starts to rain as well. Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing <b>the</b> <b>doll</b> to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E

5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous {{time consuming}} steps. The most basic {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to <b>the</b> <b>doll.</b> Artists can pick different brands to best suit <b>the</b> <b>doll</b> they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make <b>the</b> <b>doll</b> seem more realistic.|$|E

5|$|Sindy is a British fashion doll {{created by}} Pedigree Dolls & Toys in 1963. A rival to Barbie, Sindy's {{wholesome}} look {{and range of}} fashions and accessories made it the best-selling toy in the United Kingdom in 1968 and 1970. After Marx Toys' unsuccessful attempt to introduce Sindy in the United States in the late 1970s, Hasbro bought the rights to Sindy and remodelled <b>the</b> <b>doll</b> to look more American. As a result, the doll's popularity declined and Barbie manufacturer Mattel filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement, which was settled when Hasbro agreed to remodel Sindy's face. During the 1990s, Barbie's share of <b>the</b> <b>doll</b> market continued to grow while Sindy's diminished, which led to Sindy being delisted from major retailers in 1997. Hasbro returned the doll's licence to Pedigree, and <b>the</b> <b>doll</b> was relaunched in 1999, manufactured by Vivid Imaginations. Sindy's 40th anniversary in 2003 saw a new manufacturer, New Moons, and another relaunch and redesign.|$|E

50|$|One by one, these {{projects}} {{did not turn}} into long-term gigs, and Kane began to feel {{that there was no}} longer any place in the music business for him; that what little material success he had achieved with <b>the</b> <b>Dolls</b> was to be the high-water mark of his career. Kane saw himself living in poverty and obscurity {{for the rest of his}} life. As this bitter realization gripped him, band after band directly inspired by <b>the</b> <b>Dolls</b> catapulted to stardom, and the other members of <b>the</b> <b>Dolls</b> continued their careers. Lead singer of <b>the</b> <b>Dolls,</b> David Johansen, who Kane viewed as a rival, found success as Buster Poindexter.|$|R

5|$|In 1908 Prus serialized, in the Warsaw Tygodnik Ilustrowany (Illustrated Weekly), {{his novel}} Dzieci (Children), {{depicting}} the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists {{of the day}} — an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, Przemiany (Changes), was to have been, like <b>The</b> <b>Doll,</b> a panorama of society and its vital concerns. However, in 1911-12 the novel had barely begun serialization in the Illustrated Weekly when its composition was cut short by Prus' death.|$|E
