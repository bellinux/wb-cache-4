30|$|Here, {{we present}} our {{work on the}} heating-enhanced (HE) dynamic DEP process for aligned SWCNT film of {{ultrahigh}} density. We think the SWCNTs far from DEP grooves and beyond the DEP force’s ability {{can be taken to}} <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> of DEP grooves by the convection induced by intentional heating and then are captured by the DEP force, resulting in much higher alignment density of SWCNTs than the case without heating. The simulation work suggests that the heating-induced convection takes the SWCNTs beyond 100  μm far away from DEP grooves to <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> of DEP grooves. We assumed that DEP force is equal to the “convection force” at the boundaries of the SWCNTs-gathering areas in <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> of DEP grooves, based on which the convection force can be assessed with DEP force.|$|R
