500|$|DuVall joined Alice in Chains as {{lead singer}} during the band's reunion concerts. Duff McKagan again joined the band for the reunion tour, playing rhythm guitar on {{selected}} songs. Cantrell explained the reunion, [...] "We want to celebrate {{what we did}} {{and the memory of}} our friend. We have played with some [...] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [...] rich legacy. It's a tough <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing {{to take a chance on}} it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on." [...] Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.|$|E
500|$|To promote Beyond the Sea, Spacey and Phil Ramone {{devised a}} 12-city United States concert tour titled An Evening Celebrating the Music of Bobby Darin, which {{consisted}} of Spacey performing with a 19-piece band.

Spacey's performance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on December 11, 2004 received a standing ovation. Dodd Darin commented, [...] "It was said about my dad that he had some big brass ones. To do a film about my dad is one thing, but it's another <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and attempt to work a nightclub. Kevin's got a lot of courage. I think he sounds good." [...] The film was shown and promoted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2004.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{was very}} fond of Caillat's 2007 debut album, Coco. Swift explained, [...] "When it came out, I {{fell in love with}} the way that she makes music." [...] Swift later {{contacted}} her management and asked if she could write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E

The scene was cut for time and budget reasons. Tarantino said: [...] "I'm dealing with a three and a half-hour movie. Yuki's revenge {{is going to be}} the first to go. I'm going to kill myself shooting it, it's going to cost $1 million and it's going to be the first <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> so I can't do it." [...] Another draft featured a scene in which the Bride's [...] "Pussy Wagon" [...] is blown up by Elle Driver.|$|E
