This rock weathers to a white or pink colour, but it is covered by the smooth grassy turf characteristic of Great Dodd, Watson's Dodd and Stybarrow Dodd, all of which are covered by the same sheet.|$|E
25|$|The pontoon hull {{was built}} of soft Siemens steel framing and 11 {{millimeters}} <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> iron. In November 1879, when the double bottom was 2/3 complete (but not formally laid down yet), Popov persuaded the imperial authorities to award interior finishes contact to the British, and hired Tideman {{to review the}} design again. Tideman built another 1:10 scale model, ran another series of tests and recommended changes to the powerplant and propeller arrangement that caused a significant extension of the contract. The Livadia had a double, perfectly flat bottom and only 7ft (2.1 m) of draft, excluding the propellers. Their blades projected 9 feet below the hull. Tideman found what he claimed was near-perfect propeller configuration: all three screws had the same diameter but varied in blade pitch, which in practice required running the engines at different revolutions per minute.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conventional}} {{method is}} to place a collimator over the detection crystal/PMT array. [...] The collimator consists of a <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> of lead, typically [...] thick, with thousands of adjacent holes through it. [...] The individual holes limit photons which can be detected by the crystal to a cone; {{the point of the}} cone is at the midline center of any given hole and extends from the collimator surface outward. [...] However, the collimator {{is also one of the}} sources of blurring within the image; lead does not totally attenuate incident gamma photons, there can be some crosstalk between holes.|$|E

[...] The North Dakota Children's Home Society wanted to use publicity about Hazel's story {{to raise money to}} build an orphanage for children in the state. A memorial committee was established in Center and talked of naming a new hospital in Hazel's honor, but some months later her parents said they wanted a memorial statue erected instead. Children across the state collected money to pay for a memorial.|$|E

2500|$|The M3 was an automatic, {{air-cooled}} blowback-operated {{weapon that}} fired {{from an open}} bolt. [...] Constructed of plain [...]060-in. <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> steel, the M3 receiver was stamped in two halves that were then welded together. [...] The M3 was striker-fired, with a fixed firing pin contained inside the bolt. The bolt was drilled longitudinally to support two parallel guide rods, upon which were mounted twin return (recoil) springs. This configuration allowed for larger machining tolerances while providing operating clearance {{in the event of}} dust, sand, or mud ingress. The M3 featured a spring-loaded extractor which was housed inside the bolt head, while the ejector was located in the trigger group. [...] Like the British Sten, time and expense was saved by cold-swaging the M3's barrel.|$|E
2500|$|The first trochotrons were {{surrounded}} by a hollow cylindrical magnet, with poles at the ends. The field inside the magnet had essentially-parallel lines of force, parallel to the axis of the tube. It was a thermionic vacuum tube; inside were a central cathode, ten anodes, and ten [...] "spade" [...] electrodes. The magnetic field and voltages applied to the electrodes made the electrons form a <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> (as in a cavity magnetron) that went to only one anode. Applying a pulse with specified width and voltages to the spades made the sheet advance to the next anode, where it stayed until the next advance pulse. Count direction was not reversible. A later form of trochotron called a Beam-X Switch replaced the large, heavy external cylindrical magnet with ten small internal metal-alloy rod magnets which also served as electrodes.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the roof}} was completed, the {{reflecting}} pool was constructed on top of it. The landscape architects Clarke and Rapuano designed the [...] deep, [...] pool. The pool walls were [...] thick at the base, and tapered as they rose. A sheet of monel (a rustproof nickel alloy metal) was embedded in the wall, rising to within [...] {{of the top of}} the wall. The entire wall was coated in epoxy as a waterproofer. Nine [...] steel girders acted both to support the pool above and the ceiling of the main exhibition hall below. These steel girders were nearly [...] below ground to accommodate the pool's construction. On top of the girders were double-tongued, prestressed, precast concrete T-beams. The tongue of each T-beam was [...] thick, and the height of the T-beam [...] A [...] thick layer of concrete was laid atop the T-beams, forming the floor of the pool. Five layers of roofing felt were laid atop the concrete floor, followed by a [...] layer of perlite. A grid of concrete beams, each [...] and over [...] long, was laid in the perlite to support the layers above. Inverted U-shaped drainage tiles were inserted between the beams to help remove any water which leaked from above. A [...] <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> of polyethylene formed a moisture barrier above the perlite, and [...] thick layer of concrete laid atop the moisture barrier. The bottom of the pool consisted of another five layers of roofing felt, on top of which were laid a [...] thick layer of gravel. [...] The gravel-impregnated grout was laid down in alternating grey and white sections (each section separated by a brass rail), to add visual distinctiveness {{to the bottom of the}} pool. The granite for the lip of the pool was imported from West Germany. The granite, which was shaped to wrap around the exterior, top, and interior of the lip, was about [...] thick. [...] The lip of the pool was made of concrete. It was [...] wide, and dropped in a pitch of [...] was it extended toward the water. Overflow drains were placed at intervals on the inside of the lip, just below the granite cladding. A gutter just outside the pool provided extra diversion in case water spilled over the lip. Grey granite slabs, also imported from West Germany, formed a sidewalk around the pool.|$|E

It was rather a forlorn hope, but it seemed to her just possible that there might be in some of his pockets a letter which would throw light upon his disappearance. She found nothing of the sort, however. There were picture postcards, a few photographs, and a good many restaurant bills, but they were all from places in Germany and Austria. At the bottom of the second trunk, however, she found something which he had evidently considered it worth while to preserve carefully. It was a <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> of official-looking paper, bearing at the top an embossed crown, and covered with German writing. It was numbered at the top [...] "seventeen," [...] and it was evidently an odd sheet of some document. She folded it carefully up, and took it back with her to her own room. Then, {{with the help of a}} German dictionary, she commenced to study it. At the end of an hour she had made out a rough translation, which she read carefully through. When she had finished she was thoroughly perplexed. She had an uncomfortable sense of having come into touch with something wholly unexpected and mysterious.|$|E
