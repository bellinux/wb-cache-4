40|$|Abstract There {{are many}} {{excellent}} specialised texts and articles that describe the physical principles of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques. There are also many texts written with the clinician {{in mind that}} provide an understandable, more general introduction to the basic physical principles of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques and applications. There are however very few texts or articles that attempt to provide a basic MR physics introduction that is tailored for clinicians using CMR in their daily practice. This {{is the first of}} two reviews that are intended to cover the essential aspects of CMR physics {{in a way that is}} understandable and relevant to this group. It begins by explaining the basic physical principles of MR, including a description of the main components of an MR imaging system and the three types of magnetic field that they generate. The origin and method of production of the MR signal in biological systems are explained, focusing in particular on the two tissue magnetisation relaxation properties (T 1 and T 2) that give rise to signal differences from tissues, showing how they can be exploited to generate image contrast for tissue characterisation. The method most commonly used to localise and encode MR signal echoes to form a cross sectional image is described, introducing the concept of k-space and showing how the MR signal data stored within it relates to properties within the reconstructed image. Before describing the CMR acquisition methods in detail, the basic <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> and gradient pulse sequences are introduced, identifying the key parameters that influence image contrast, including appearances in the presence of flowing blood, resolution and image acquisition time. The main derivatives of these two pulse sequences used for cardiac imaging are then described in more detail. Two of the key requirements for CMR are the need for data acquisition first to be to be synchronised with the subject's ECG and to be fast enough for the subject to be able to hold their breath. Methods of ECG synchronisation using both triggering and retrospective gating approaches, and accelerated data acquisition using <b>turbo</b> or fast <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> and gradient echo pulse sequences are therefore outlined in some detail. It is shown how double inversion black blood preparation combined with <b>turbo</b> or fast <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> pulse sequences acquisition is used to achieve high quality anatomical imaging. For functional cardiac imaging using cine gradient echo pulse sequences two derivatives of the gradient echo pulse sequence; spoiled gradient echo and balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) are compared. In each case key relevant imaging parameters and vendor-specific terms are defined and explained. </p...|$|R

The inter-scan variability and relation between NER(plaque) and gadolinium (assessed with inductively coupled plasma- mass spectrometry) were compared between inversion-recovery fast <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> and fast <b>spin</b> <b>echo.</b> Inter-scan variability was higher for inversion-recovery fast <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> than for fast <b>spin</b> <b>echo.</b> Although gadolinium and NER(plaque) correlated well for both techniques, the NER of plaque was higher for inversion-recovery fast <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> than for fast <b>spin</b> <b>echo.</b> In mice injected with CB 2 -R targeted micelles, NER(plaque) can be best evaluated at 36 - 48 [*]h post-injection.

40|$|In {{patients}} with spinal stenosis, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} of the cervical spine can be improved by using 3 D driven-equilibrium fast <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> sequences to provide a high-resolution assessment of osseous and ligamentous structures. However, {{it is not yet}} clear whether 3 D driven-equilibrium fast <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> sequences adequately evaluate the spinal cord itself.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the nonexponentiality of proton <b>spin</b> <b>echoes</b> of {{skeletal}} muscle has been carefully examined.

This can lead to variable contrast across the brain which is particularly pronounced in T 2 -weighted imaging that requires multiple radiofrequency pulses. To obtain T 2 -weighted images with uniform contrast throughout the whole brain at 7 T, short (2 - 3 ms) 3 D tailored radiofrequency pulses (kT -points) were integrated into a 3 D variable flip angle <b>turbo</b> <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> sequence. METHODS: The excitation and refocusing "hard" pulses of a variable flip angle <b>turbo</b> <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> sequence were replaced with kT -point pulses. Spatially resolved extended phase graph simulations and in vivo acquisitions at 7 T, utilizing both single channel and parallel-transmit systems, were used to test different kT -point configurations. RESULTS: Simulations indicated that an extended optimized k-space trajectory ensured a more homogeneous signal throughout images. In vivo experiments showed that high quality T 2 -weighted brain images with uniform signal and contrast were obtained at 7 T by using the proposed methodology.

40|$|ABSTRACT Nitroxyl {{free radical}} {{electron}} spin relaxation times for spin-labeled low-spin methemoglobins were measured between 6 and 120 K by two-pulse electron <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> spectroscopy and by saturation recovery {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR). Spin-lattice relaxation times for cyano-methemoglobin and imidazole-methemoglobin were measured between 8 and 25 K by saturation recovery and between 4. 2 and 20 K by electron <b>spin</b> <b>echo.</b> At low temperature the iron electron spin relaxation rates are slow relative to the iron-nitroxyl electron-electron spin-spin splitting. As temperature is increased, the relaxation rates for the Fe(lIl) become comparable to and then greater than the spin-spin splitting, which collapses the splitting in the continuous wave EPR spectra and causes an increase and then {{a decrease in the}} nitroxyl electron <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> decay rate. Throughout the temperature range examined, interaction with the Fe(lIl) increases the spin lattice relaxation rate (1 /T 1) for the nitroxyl. The measured relaxation times for the Fe(lIl) were used to analyze the temperature-dependent changes in the <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> decays and in the saturation recovery (T 1) data for the interacting nitroxyl and to determine the interspin distance, r. The values of r for three spin-labeled methemoglobins were between 15 and 15. 5 A, with good agreement between values obtained by electron <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> and saturation recovery. Analysis of the nitroxyl <b>spin</b> <b>echo</b> and saturation recovery data also provides values of the iron relaxation rates at temperatures where the iron relaxation rates are too fast to measure directly by saturation recovery o...|$|R
