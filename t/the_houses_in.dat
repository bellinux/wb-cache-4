5|$|Destruction was {{heaviest}} in Belize and totaled $250million (2001USD). Because Iris was compact, {{the damage}} was largely confined to 72% of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> the Toledo district and 50% of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> the Stann Creek district. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35villages in the poorest parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000people homeless, many receiving assistance {{from the government and}} the local Red Cross chapter. High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> {{the village}} are Grade II listed buildings, {{and many were}} built using local red and blue bricks.

5|$|Also, {{electrical}} {{lines and}} drinking water supplies were cut in La Paz. Also, communication lines were extensively damaged. The La Paz airport received damage during the hurricane; however, by {{the afternoon of}} October1, the airport re-opened, thus allowing the military to provide much-needed aid to victims. Wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered throughout La Paz. By October 2, rescue teams had covered 38sqmi (100sqkm) to configure the damage. Throughout the city, a total of 412 people had been killed, 150 were missing people within the resort city, five of which were later presumed dead. Overall, {{nearly a third of}} <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> La Paz were leveled.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> the Ghetto age, and as {{the number}} of {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in {{the northern}} offshore islands and {{in the northern}} portion of the mainland. On the offshore islands, downed trees and power lines blocked most roads. In Caye Caulker and San Pedro, Keith damaged the roofs of about 90% of houses and damaged or destroyed 676 houses, leaving 3,279 people homeless. About 50% of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> Caye Caulker were destroyed, with reports of only five dwellings still standing after the storm. In San Pedro, about 30% of houses, or at least 50, were wrecked. On Ambergris Caye, four airplanes were destroyed. At Turneffe Atoll, about 35% of the landmass was affected, with many trees in that section uprooted and numerous tree branches snapped.|$|E

5|$|During Keyser's lordship, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales listed Adminston as a {{possible}} name for the village. On his death in 1929, his wife, Mary, continued to occupy the house until she died in 1938. The estate was auctioned off in September 1938, and many lots were purchased by their occupiers. The manor house was bought by Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) for £16,000. One of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> the village is recorded as having fetched £1,375.

5|$|In 1549 a {{grammar school}} was opened (closing again in 1739), and in 1561 Skagen's first {{lighthouse}} was constructed. In 1568, some 350 fishing boats and merchant ships were wrecked {{off the coast}} of Skagen. In the 1590s, successive storms led not only to numerous drownings but to flooding, destroying many of <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> <b>In</b> 1591, 22 died in a flood and in 1593, 14 houses were washed away. In 1595, 25 farms in the area were covered in drifting sand. As a result, new housing was built in Østerby to the north east, away from the rapidly accumulating sand.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{section of}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was built <b>in</b> 1741 by Abraham D. Haring.

5|$|In 1825 the {{inhabitants}} of Rùm (then numbering some 450 people) were given a year's notice to quit. The inhabitants of Rùm had simply been tenant farmers, paying rent to the laird; they owned neither the land they worked, nor <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> which they lived. On 11 July 1826, about 300 of {{the inhabitants}} boarded two overcrowded ships bound for Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. The laird, and Dr Lachlan, paid for their journey. The remaining population followed in 1827. Similar evictions happened all over the gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland, and collectively {{became known as the}} Highland Clearances.|$|E
5|$|Like the House of the Lake, most {{houses in}} the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped floor plans (such as {{trapezoidal}} designs), as opposed to square or rectangular designs. The narrow and irregular street grid is unlike that of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar {{to the majority of}} excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> the Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E
5|$|Over land, the {{hurricane}} weakened to a tropical storm, although it re-intensified {{slightly in the}} Gulf of Mexico. On September25, it made a second landfall just south of Tampico, Tamaulipas with winds at around , and it quickly dissipated over land. Damage was heaviest there, estimated at $5million (1933USD) and {{there were hundreds of}} deaths. About 75% of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> Tampico were damaged, including about 50% of houses that had severe to total destruction to their roofs. The destruction prompted the declaration of martial law, and there was a curfew instated.|$|E

Locally sourced stone for walls and slate for roofs are the predominant building materials, used for places of worship, the school, houses (including many not listed), and boundary dry stone walls. An exception is Fisher House, a three-storey Georgian rendered building.|$|E
5|$|Around 820 Coenwulf forced Wulfred into an {{unfavourable}} settlement {{by which}} Wulfred gained {{control over the}} debated monasteries {{in exchange for a}} large payment of gold and the loss of a very large estate to the king. Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop. In September 822, Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king, which had been delayed about a year because of the dispute with the archbishop. After Ceolwuf's deposition in 823 Wulfred's situation improved. The new Mercian king, Beornwulf, presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to that point was written down. Coenwulf's daughter Cwenthryth, abbess of Winchcombe and Minster, paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> Kent. Later in 825 (or possibly the following year), however, Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun. Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold, and coinage in Wulfred's name appears to have ceased for a time, though it had been restored before Wulfred's death in 832. Final settlement of the debate over lordship of monasteries came in 838 at Kingston, shortly before Egbert's death.|$|E
5|$|As {{it moved}} ashore, Iris damaged houses and schools {{in dozens of}} villages. In 35villages, the storm {{destroyed}} more than 95% of the buildings. Its small size confined the worst damage largely to Toledo and Stann Creek districts, which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country. The percentage of damaged houses was 72% in Toledo district and about 50% in Stann Creek, leaving about 15,000people homeless. In both districts, the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies. In the worst-affected areas, poor Mayan people living on farms lost {{much of what they}} owned. At Placencia near the coast, about 80% of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage, with downed power poles in the streets. About 90% of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>in</b> nearby Seine Bight were destroyed, and where Iris made landfall, over 90% of the homes were destroyed throughout Monkey River Town. The storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern Belize. Iris also damaged tourism facilities, including minor impact to the Maya ruins of Belize, and damaged 20% of the hotel rooms in the country, accounting for $37million in losses. The remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm.|$|E
