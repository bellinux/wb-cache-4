40|$|Regarding {{the type}} of {{industry}} discussed, the markets are getting more global which enhances the competition. The major focus today lies mostly {{in the field of}} optimization of the production to minimize the costs while, simultaneously, maximize the output. Logistics has increased in its importance within firms when optimization since logistics is a wide spread area with large improvement possibilities for most of the firms and actors. Transportation is one part of the wide field of logistics and with increased costs for fuel, demand for shortened lead times and minimized costs, transportation is today an important aspects for firms. Boliden Mineral AB, the case organization of this study, is a firm within the mining industry that has been active since the year of 1924 with headquarter of production in Boliden, a small community outside of Skellefteå. The area surrounding Boliden has during the years contained around 30 different mines and one of them, Kankberg, is the case object for this study. In the mine of Kankberg the main focus lies on minerals such as gold and tellurium. The mine of Kankberg has been closed down the last fifteen years but was during 2012 reopened. Since it is reopened, there have been thoughts about how the organization should be formed and how the daily operations should be handled. This study is focused on the identification of how the underground transports with minerals and waste rock are working today and how they in the future should be utilized and formed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to firstly analyze the transports of today, to later be able to recommend future investments and if the transport section should be kept outsourced as today or if Boliden should handle it by themselves. The transport system active today was analyzed through several interviews and observations in Kankberg and based on the results future investment possibilities could be identified and assessed. When collecting data, several important factors were revealed that was necessary to take into account if the investment was discussed. No mine is as any other, which means that factors necessary in one mine do not need to be of importance in another. The production site is always in movement and in transformation within a mine, which means a found optimum, may not be the optimum after some elapsed time. Very few, if any, industries have the some issue as the mining industry with the ever-going movement of the production site. Based on that, the transportation system in use needs to be flexible but to a low cost. The recommendations mentioned in this study are that Boliden Mineral AB should invest in two types of vehicles, two mine trucks with the <b>tramming</b> <b>capacity</b> of 60 metric tonnes together with a truck with a <b>tramming</b> <b>capacity</b> of 28 metric tonnes. This combination resulted in the lowest net present value seen by the time horizon of ten years. Regarding the question of continued outsourcing or not, it is recommended to continue to outsource the transportation section, assuming there are entrepreneurs willing to invest in the types of recommended vehicles.

50|$|Their <b>tramming</b> <b>capacities</b> {{varies from}} 1 to 17-25 metric tons. Their bucket size varies from 0.8 to 10 m3. Bucket height range from 1.8 to 2.5 m.|$|R
50|$|With the {{extension}} of the Lademoen Line in 1913, as well as the ordering of the Class 2 <b>trams,</b> <b>capacity</b> was not large enough at Hospitalløkken. It became degraded to a workshop, and most of the trams were stored at the new Voldsmine Depot. In 1923, when the new Dalsenget Depot was opened, Hospitalløkkan was taken over the municipality (who owned the tramway). The building still remain, though they have been considerably rebuilt.|$|R
50|$|The A-class are single-unit bogie trams {{that operate}} on the Melbourne tram network. Seventy were built by Comeng, Dandenong between 1984 and 1987 in two batches, 28 A1s and 42 A2s, with only minor differences. They are the {{smallest}} <b>trams</b> by <b>capacity</b> currently operating on the network.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} the 2006 survey study origin {{destination}} and price that we carried out during 2006 {{fall in the}} area in the Moroccan region of Rabat-Salé-Zemmour-Zaer. The survey concerns the people’s characteristics, their displacements behavior and the price {{that they will be able}} to pay for a tramway ticket. The main objective is to study a set of relative features to the households and to their displacement's habits and to their choices among public and privet transport modes. A comparison between this survey results and that of the 1996 ‘s is made. A pricing scheme is also given according to the <b>tram</b> <b>capacity.</b> (The Rabat-Salé tramway is under construction right now and it will be operational beginning 2010).

500|$|The trams are bi-directional, [...] {{long and}} with low-floor access to meet UK Rail Vehicle Access Regulations for {{disabled}} people. Each <b>tram</b> has a <b>capacity</b> of 250, allowing for 78 seated and 170 standing passengers and 2 wheelchairs.|$|R
50|$|By {{the summer}} of 2008 won the {{competition}} to supply three-section <b>trams</b> with a <b>capacity</b> of 350 people for a second turn of Volgograd Speed Tramскоростного. The first of such trams was released in 2008, with the second in May 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Azienda Trasporti Milanesi (ATM), {{the city}} {{transport}} company of Milan, has bought 93 Sirios (all one direction cars). In 2002, the first carriages were delivered. The ATM has 58 seven section Sirios (7100 series) with {{a length of}} 35.35 m; these <b>trams</b> have a <b>capacity</b> of 285 people, of which 71 can sit. The ATM has also 35 five section Sirietto (literally [...] "little Sirio": 7500 series) with a length of 25.15 m; these <b>trams</b> have a <b>capacity</b> of 191 people, of which 50 can sit. Both types of Sirios have a width of 2.40 m and have been built for the unusual track gauge of [...] The maximum speed is 70 km/h. Part of the 7500 will be numbered in the 7600 series because of minor modifications. It is not exactly known how many Sirio will be built.|$|R
25|$|In the {{original}} interior layout {{with a separate}} conductor and driver the HM V <b>trams</b> had <b>capacity</b> of 29 seated passengers and 69 standing passengers. During the rush hour this could be exceeded by an additional 50 standing passengers. On conversion to one-person operation during the late 1970s and early 80s, the conductor's seat was replaced with two additional seats, bringing the seating capacity up to 31, while the standing capacity was downsized to 57 plus an additional 44 during the rush hour. Following conversion into the Spårakoff, tram number 175 (ex-15) has a capacity of 24 all-seated passengers.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, {{the concept of}} the {{articulated}} bus has been extended further {{with the addition of a}} second trailer section that extends the bus almost to <b>tram</b> length and <b>capacity,</b> to create a bi-articulated bus, called also triple bus. The Chinese manufacturer Zhejiang Youngman (Jinhua Neoplan) has developed the 25 m JNP6280G bi-articulated bus, deemed the [...] "world's largest", which will be used in Beijing.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} {{comprehensively}} rebuilt in 1989 by the Swiss company, Von Roll, with new track, a computerized control system, and two new two-car <b>trams</b> with a <b>capacity</b> of 120 passengers per tram. By {{the time of}} the handover in 1997, the system carried some 2 million passengers annually. Today, more than 4 million people ride the Peak Tram annually, or an average of over 11,000 every day.|$|R
50|$|The Tram was {{produced}} from 1942, however {{it was only}} in service for around 10 years since fierce competition from bus travel in Buenos Aires meant that there was less demand for high <b>capacity</b> <b>trams</b> of this kind. During its time in service, it was limited to lines that ran near the centre of the city since its great height meant that it was unsuitable for safe clearance under certain bridges, tunnels and underpasses.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 the dot-matrix {{displays}} {{were replaced}} with LED equipment and cab air-conditioning fitted in 2009. In 2014, an upgrade of the interiors commenced. Seats were removed {{and replaced with}} 'lean seats' as fitted on C and C2 class <b>trams,</b> that increases <b>capacity</b> by seven to nine passengers while providing space for prams and shopping carts, while extra hand rails will also be installed floor to ceiling, and seats will be re-covered.|$|R
50|$|On the European side T2 line, the tramcars are {{original}} Istanbul cars, {{from the}} first-generation tramway (closed in 1966), which were restored in the 1980s {{for use on}} the heritage tramway. During peak season, a trailer is often coupled to the motored <b>tram</b> for extra <b>capacity.</b> As of 2008, the motored trams include car 47, built in 1913; car 223, built in 1928; and car 410. Trailers are 411 and 418, built in Germany in 1914 and 1919, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|It {{functions}} {{using two}} parallel [...] tracks, {{each with its}} own tram and central rack, laid on wooden sleepers over stone ballast. The trams are connected along a 7 m long, 2 m wide steel cable, over a 4.5 m wheelbase. The suspension system is made of four helical without dampers and hinged spiral-spring stop brakes. Each <b>tram</b> supports a <b>capacity</b> of seat 30 passengers, with the total capacity of 38 possible across six bunks (that sat five passengers), eight standing and conductor.|$|R
2500|$|Each tram is a {{chain of}} eight cylindrical, five-seat {{compartments}} with a small window on the doors. As each <b>tram</b> has a <b>capacity</b> of 40 passengers {{and there are two}} trams, 80 passengers can be transported at one time, with trams departing from the ground every 10 minutes. The cars swing like Ferris-wheel cars as they ascend and descend the arch. This fashion of movement gave rise to the idea of the tram as [...] "half-Ferris wheel and half-elevator." [...] The trip to the top takes four minutes, and the trip down takes three minutes.|$|R
50|$|The Tatra KT8D5 is a large, high <b>capacity</b> <b>tram</b> {{constructed}} {{using three}} articulated body sections riding on four bogies. The middle section {{is located on}} two jacobs bogies. The tram is bidirectional and has driving cabs at each end and doors on both sides. There are two pantographs, one located on the each end of vehicle.With a capacity of up to 231 passengers, these trams are operated on the busiest routes and during peak hours; due to their bidirectional capability they are also frequently used on routes without termini and during track maintenance for continued operation on only one track in both directions.|$|R
50|$|The system {{infrastructure}} costs calculated on mean fabricated tonnage {{of steel and}} construction quantities reference a twin track system with a parallel platform station located every 750 metres. Costs including planning, required Acts of Parliament, professional and tendering costs, electrical supply costs and street diversion costs for central London implementation were estimated at £15 million per kilometre (2005 estimate). Costs outside London {{must be based on}} approx 1000 tonnes of fabricated steel per km plus the local cost of planning etc. By comparison to tramway implementation MonoMetro costs around 60% of the cost of building a tramway. The difference however is that MonoMetro is a mass transit system offering 20,000 passengers an hour <b>capacity,</b> <b>trams</b> offer 3000 - 7000 passengers an hour capacity.|$|R
2500|$|KKS {{started a}} grain tram service in 1918, which linked Statkorn's silo at Vippetangen to Bjølsen Valsemølle. This {{transport}} took place using three dedicated trams, which were rebuilt from trams no. 49, 50 and 66. The motors, undercarriage, platforms and frame were reused, while an all-new body were built. In addition, three trailers were converted. The <b>trams</b> had a <b>capacity</b> for [...] of grain and entered service on 27 April 1918, February 1919 and 2 October 1920. A fourth conversion of a motor {{car to a}} trailer took place in 1925. The grain trams were retired from in 1932 when two new trams were delivered, although to motor cars and two trailers were kept as reserves. For a period in 1941 and 1942 one tram was leased to Bærumsbanen. The last of these were scrapped in 1950.|$|R
5000|$|... 32 eight-axle trams of type SL95, {{numbered}} 141-172 {{and delivered}} in 1998-2006. These double-articulated, partly low-floor trams can go backwards {{as well as}} forward due {{to the presence of}} driver cabs at either end and doors on both sides. They can therefore operate on the Ullevål line to Rikshospitalet and on the Lilleaker Line to Bekkestua which do not have a turning circle {{at the end of the}} line. However, the large turning radius and heavy weight of the tram makes it unsuitable for some of the lines to Majorstuen, which have poor tracks and sharp turns. The SL95s were delivered by the Italian company Ansaldo/Firema, now Ansaldobreda. The SL95 is 33.12 metres long, 2.6 metres wide, 3.62 metres tall and weighs 64.98 tons. The <b>tram</b> has a <b>capacity</b> for 212 passengers, 88 of which are seated.|$|R
50|$|Rail systems {{vary greatly}} in {{performance}} and route capacity, with metro systems having the highest <b>capacity.</b> <b>Tram</b> and light rail systems have in theory very high route capacities, {{but in practice}} route capacities of 12 trains per hour is a practical upper limit. For High Speed Rail a route capacity of up to 18 trains per hour may be possible. The Punggol metro line in Singapore uses a moving block system to achieve a headway of 90 seconds, so the route capacity is 40 trains per hour. Route capacity for a commuter rail system is typically around 12 to 16 trains per hour, which is lower than a metro, as the trains are longer, and the traffic is often mixed with other rail services such as freight and intercity trains. By contrast the Alameda Freight Corridor in Los Angeles has a route capacity of 150 freight trains per day, which is high in comparison to other rail freight systems, but low compared to metros.|$|R
40|$|Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) {{appears to}} be less {{expensive}} to build and operate than tram systems but can it really approach the performance level of a tram system {{and what is the}} environmental performance of comparable systems? This paper reports systematic research on these issues, particularly relating to where an urban transit system seeks to attract discretionary car users. A model has been developed to compare the implementation, operational costs and environmental impacts of a comparable tram and high quality guided BRT system. This models a UK situation, but draws upon information from elsewhere in Europe and North America. The design of the BRT system delivers equivalent performance to <b>trams</b> in <b>capacity</b> and passenger experience. This ‘equivalence’ model shows that the capital costs of the high-spec BRT system are two-thirds those of tram. This is less of a cost saving than is often claimed, suggesting that, in practice, BRT is built to a lower specification that tram systems. Operational costs do not significantly differ. Using hybrid-engine BRT vehicles, CO 2 emissions are similar, BRT has lower PM 10 emissions, but NOx from BRT remains higher than for trams. Although the cost differences for equivalent systems are less than is often claimed, there are substantial benefits in the flexible development of BRT, with it less vulnerable to variations from forecast ridership numbers, and development can be split into fundable stages, growing the business case for incremental upgrading. High-spec BRT can to be the new tram, but the ‘value for money’ case for BRT should not be at the expense of quality and transport planning impact...|$|R
