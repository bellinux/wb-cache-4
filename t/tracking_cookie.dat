5000|$|Once {{installed}} and enabled, Lightbeam records all <b>tracking</b> <b>cookies</b> saved on the user's computer {{through the}} Firefox browser {{by the various}} sites that the user visits. It differentiates between [...] "behavioural" [...] <b>tracking</b> <b>cookies</b> (those which record specific actions on a site) and other <b>tracking</b> <b>cookies.</b> At any time during a browsing session the user can open a separate tab, using the [...] "Show Lightbeam" [...] option of Tools, to display a graph of sites visited and cookies placed. This will show when a given cookie is used by multiple sites, thus enabling those sites to track the user from site to site. Lightbeam will also allow the user to see which advertisers or other third parties are connected to which cookies, and thus can develop information about the user's browsing from site to site.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{security}} firms classify Phorm's targeting cookies as adware.

Trend Micro {{said there was a}} [...] "very high chance" [...] that it would add detection for the <b>tracking</b> <b>cookies</b> as adware. PC Tools echoed Trend's concerns about privacy and security, urging Phorm to apply an opt-in approach. Specialist anti-spyware firm Sunbelt Software also expressed concerns, saying Phorm's <b>tracking</b> <b>cookies</b> were candidates for detection by its anti-spyware software.|$|R

5000|$|Initial clickstream or click path data had to {{be gleaned}} from server log files.

5000|$|In an {{analysis}} titled [...] "Stealing Phorm Cookies", Clayton wrote that Phorm's system stores a <b>tracking</b> <b>cookie</b> for each website visited on the user's PC, {{and that each}} contains an identical copy of the user's UID. Where possible, Phorm's system strips its tracking cookies from http requests before they are forwarded across the Internet to a website's server, but it cannot prevent the UID from being sent to websites using https. This would allow websites to associate the UID to any details the website collects about the visitor.|$|E

50|$|Google {{has also}} {{released}} a browser plugin that turns off data about a page visit {{being sent to}} Google. Since this plug-in is produced and distributed by Google itself, it has met much discussion and criticism. Furthermore, the realisation of Google scripts tracking user behaviours has spawned the production of multiple, often open-source, browser plug-ins to reject <b>tracking</b> <b>cookies.</b> These plug-ins offer the user a choice, whether to allow Google Analytics (for example) to track his/her activities. However, partially because of new European privacy laws, most modern browsers allow users to reject <b>tracking</b> <b>cookies,</b> though Flash cookies can be a separate problem again.|$|R
40|$|Key Points •The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights only allows {{personal}} data processing if a data controller has a legal {{basis for the}} processing. •This paper argues that, in most circumstances, the only available legal basis for the processing of {{personal data}} for behavioural targeting is the data subject's unambiguous consent. •Furthermore, the paper argues that the cookie consent requirement from the e-Privacy Directive does not provide a legal basis for the {{processing of personal data}}. •Therefore, even if companies could use an opt-out system to comply with the e-Privacy Directive's consent requirement for using a <b>tracking</b> <b>cookie,</b> they would generally have to obtain the data subject's unambiguous consent if they process personal data for behavioural targeting...|$|E

2500|$|An HTTP cookie is {{data stored}} on a user's {{computer}} that assists in automated access to websites or web features, or other state information required in complex web sites. [...] It {{may also be}} used for user-tracking by storing special usage history data in a cookie, and such cookies—for example, those used by Google Analytics—are called <b>tracking</b> <b>cookies.</b> Cookies are a common concern in the field of Internet privacy. Although website developers most commonly use cookies for legitimate technical purposes, cases of abuse occur. In 2009, two researchers noted that social networking profiles could be connected to cookies, allowing the social networking profile to be connected to browsing habits.|$|R

25|$|In the past, {{web sites}} have not {{generally}} made the user explicitly {{aware of the}} storing of <b>cookies,</b> however <b>tracking</b> <b>cookies</b> and especially third-party <b>tracking</b> <b>cookies</b> are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories — a privacy concern that prompted European and US lawmakers to take action in 2011. Cookies can also have implications for computer forensics. In past years, most computer users were not completely aware of cookies, but recently, users have become conscious of possible detrimental effects of Internet cookies: a recent study done has shown that 58% of users have at least once, deleted cookies from their computer, and that 39% of users delete cookies from their computer every month. Since cookies are advertisers' main way of targeting potential customers, and some customers are deleting cookies, some advertisers started to use persistent Flash cookies and zombie cookies, but modern browsers and anti-malware software can now block or detect and remove such cookies.|$|R
