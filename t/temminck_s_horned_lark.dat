40|$|Horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) are ground-dwelling {{birds that}} are {{slightly}} larger than house sparrows. They are brown, with a yellowish face, black breast, black “whiskers,” and two small black “horns. ” Horned larks breed widely throughout North America, from northern Alaska to southern Mexico. In certain parts of California the <b>horned</b> <b>lark</b> is a serious crop pest. The food of the <b>horned</b> <b>lark</b> consists largely of seeds picked up from the ground. Vegetable crops damaged by <b>horned</b> <b>larks</b> include beets, broccoli, carrots, lettuce, peas, spinach, and tomatoes. Other field and truck crops damaged are alfalfa, grain, sugar beets, cantaloupes, and watermelons. Horned larks are classified as migratory nongame birds in the Code of Federal Regulations...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} larks, Temminck’s lark is a {{distinctive}} looking {{species on the}} ground, similar to the other, larger, member of its genus, the <b>horned</b> <b>lark.</b> The 14 to 15 cm adult is mainly reddish brown-grey above and pale below, {{and it has a}} striking black and white face pattern and a distinctive black patch on its breast. The summer male has black [...] "horns", which give this species its alternative name. The juvenile of this species is reddish above and pale below, quite unlike the juvenile <b>horned</b> <b>lark.</b> The adult Temminck’s lark differs from the <b>horned</b> <b>lark</b> in its reddish, rather than brown-grey plumage, and the lack of yellow in the face pattern. It has a similar but less harsh metallic call.|$|R

40|$|Winter canola is {{considered}} the most promising domestically produced oilseed feedstock for the biodiesel industry and for diversifying wheat-based cropping systems in the Inland Pacific Northwest. Winter canola field experiments conducted in east-central Washington were completely destroyed and commercial fields were damaged over several years by large flocks of <b>horned</b> <b>larks</b> that ate the cotyledon leaves of preemerged and newly emerged seedlings. Numerous control strategies were attempted in field experiments, including laying bird netting over the entire experiment, placing a lifesize predator decoy in a field experiment, blasting a loud propane-powered cannon, and mixing garlic with canola seed before planting followed by spraying garlic water on the soil surface. None of the attempted control methods were successful. This is the first report of <b>horned</b> <b>lark</b> damage to preemerged and newly emerged canola seedlings. We discuss questions relevant to our unique encounter and non-lethal chemical repellents {{for the protection of}} canola crops associated with <b>horned</b> <b>lark</b> depredation...|$|R
