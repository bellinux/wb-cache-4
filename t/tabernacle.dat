5|$|The first church {{built on}} the cathedral site also had a <b>tabernacle,</b> but its exact {{location}} is unknown. During {{the construction of the}} cathedral, the <b>tabernacle</b> was housed in what are now the Chapels of San Isidro and Our Lady of Agony of Granada. However, in the 18thcentury, it was decided to build a structure that was separate, but still connected, to the main cathedral. It is constructed of tezontle (a reddish porous volcanic rock) and white stone {{in the shape of a}} Greek cross with its southern facade faces the Zócalo. It is connected to the main cathedral via the Chapel of San Isidro.|$|E

50|$|According to 20th Century Catholic scholar Cardinal Jean Danielou, the Feast of <b>Tabernacles</b> was {{certainly}} kept by 2nd Century Jewish Christianity {{as by the}} Jews, where its celebration was tied to millenarianism {{as it is with}} many Christians who observe it today. Its observance was centered in the Asiatic environment to which both Papias and Cerinthus belonged. Cardinal Danielou also saw references to the Feast of <b>Tabernacles</b> in the Shepherd of Hermas, which would indicate that around that time some in Rome also observed it. According to Saint Jerome, Polycarp also kept the Feast of <b>Tabernacles</b> in the 2nd Century in Asia Minor.|$|R

5|$|The <b>tabernacle</b> has {{two main}} outside entrances; {{one to the}} south, facing the Zócalo and the other facing east toward Seminario Street. The {{southern}} façade is more richly decorated than the east façade. It has a theme of glorifying the Eucharist with images of the Apostles, Church Fathers, saints who founded religious orders, martyrs as well as scenes from the Bible. Zoomorphic reliefs can be found along with the anthropologic reliefs, including a rampaging lion, and the eagle from the coat of arms of Mexico. The east facade is less ambitious, but contains figures from the Old Testament {{as well as the}} images of John Nepomucene and Ignacio de Loyola. Construction dates for the phases of the <b>tabernacle</b> are also inscribed here.|$|E
5|$|Born to an African American {{family in}} North Carolina, {{he came to}} Philadelphia to serve as pastor of Mount Olivet <b>Tabernacle</b> Baptist Church, a black Baptist congregation.

5|$|Following the 1911 merger, the <b>Tabernacle</b> Pentecostal Church, {{originally}} the Brewerton Presbyterian Church, {{merged with the}} Pentecostal Holiness Church in 1915. Having Presbyterian roots and located mostly in South Carolina, this group of around 15 congregations was affiliated with Nickles Holmes Bible College in Greenville. After the mergers, the new denomination, which continued to go by the name Pentecostal Holiness Church, had about 200 churches with approximately 5,000 members. Property for the denomination's first headquarters was purchased in 1918 for $9,000 in Franklin Springs, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, an October {{snowstorm}} in Salida, Colorado, destroyed Sunday's tent—a special disaster because revivalists {{were typically}} paid with a freewill offering {{at the end}} of their meetings. Thereafter he insisted that towns build him temporary wooden <b>tabernacles</b> at their expense. The <b>tabernacles</b> were comparatively costly to build (although most of the lumber could be salvaged and resold {{at the end of}} the meetings), and locals had to put up the money for them in advance. This change in Sunday's operation began to push the finances of the campaign to the fore. At least at first, raising <b>tabernacles</b> provided good public relations for the coming meetings as townspeople joined together in what was effectively a giant barnraising. Sunday built rapport by participating in the process, and the <b>tabernacles</b> were also a status symbol, because they had previously been built only for major evangelists such as Chapman.|$|R

40|$|I offer a new {{approach}} to interpreting the Beautiful Gate of Acts 3 : 1 - 10. I argue that the adjective is better understood to indicate ripeness rather than beauty.

I also suggest that the Feast of <b>Tabernacles</b> provides a suitable lens through which to read Acts 3 : 1 - 10, and that the Hallel Psalms, set for recitation at <b>Tabernacles,</b> provide a key to understanding the narrative...|$|R
