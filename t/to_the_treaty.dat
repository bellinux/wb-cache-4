5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} as Secretary of State by Daniel Webster. In response to concerns raised {{by one of}} the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit, Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treaty.</b> Letcher brought these modifications to the Mexican diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking with the blessing of the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded {{that they would not be}} able to resist such action, but still refused to accept the modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treaty.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Parliament {{challenged}} {{this decision}} splitting their working arrangements, {{declaring that the}} division of its activities between three states was against the treaties and the natural prerogatives of a Parliament elected by direct universal suffrage, claiming {{the right to decide}} its own workings to its own efficiency.

5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again. However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaty.</b>|$|E

5|$|After 1529, {{resistance}} to John I in Transylvania was broken {{in a series}} of small campaigns. For instance, the last Transylvanian magnate to side with Ferdinánd I, Stephen Majláth went over to John I in early 1532, and Sibiu was occupied in 1536. On February 24, 1538, a secret pact was signed in Oradea by the representatives of the two kings of Hungary. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treaty,</b> both rulers were allowed to retain the territories which they then held, but the childless John I promised to recognize the Habsburgs' succession.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting and led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, the Maratha Empire {{expanded}} rapidly, claiming Konkan {{and much}} of eastern Gujarat from the disintegrating Mughal Empire. In western Gujarat, including Kathiawar and Kutch, the loosening of Mughal control allowed numerous local rulers to create virtually independent states. In 1737, Salsette was captured by Baji Rao I of the Maratha Empire from the Portuguese, and the Portuguese province of Bassein was ceded to the Marathas in 1739. The growth of the Bengal provinces soon undermined Bombay's supremacy. In 1753, Bombay was made subordinate to Calcutta. Thereafter, Bengal always maintained much greater importance relative to Madras and Bombay. Bankot (Fort Victoria) in Konkan was incorporated into Bombay Presidency in 1756. The First Anglo-Maratha War began with the Treaty of Surat, which was signed on 6 March 1775, between Raghunathrao of the Maratha Empire and the British. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treaty,</b> Raghunathrao ceded Salsette and Bassein to the British. The war ended when Salsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja were formally ceded to the British by the Treaty of Salbai, signed on 17 May 1782. These territories were incorporated into the Bombay Presidency. Also according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treaty,</b> Bassein and its dependencies were restored to Raghunathrao, while Bharuch was ceded to the Maratha ruler Scindia. The British annexed Surat on 15 May 1800. The British received the districts of Ahmadabad, Bharuch and Kaira in 1803 after British victory in the Second Anglo-Maratha War.|$|E
