5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and <b>tort</b> <b>law,</b> are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in <b>tort</b> <b>law.</b> In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{personal}} injury tort {{system in the}} People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China (PRC). The Chinese <b>torts</b> <b>law</b> {{has a number of}} unique features. To begin with, it is quite new — the legal framework of <b>torts</b> <b>law</b> was established only in 1986. The unique features of the Chinese <b>torts</b> <b>law</b> also stem from its long and difficult evolution over nearly 40 years. Equally important has been the remarkable blend of influences that have shaped its current law — a mixture of socialist objectives, capitalist pragmatism, and feudal doctrines combined with jurisprudential models taken from a range of western civil codes and, more recently, the common law. Part one of the article briefly analyses the most important features of the existing Chinese legal system. Part two provides a background to the enactment of the General Principles of Civil Law (GPCL), which incorporates Chinese <b>torts</b> <b>law.</b> The review looks at the development and drafting of the GPCL legislation, and the influences that guided the formulation of legal principles. Part three of the article provides an overview of the <b>torts</b> <b>law</b> provisions in the GPCL. Part four examines the law of personal injury established by the GPCL. Part five uses some case studies to illustrate the principles highlighted in the previous two parts and part six contains a brief conclusion and some pointers to the directions that Chinese <b>torts</b> <b>law</b> may take in the future. <br /...|$|R

5|$|The Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from {{granting}} injunctions {{against the}} Government {{or one of}} its officers. An injunction is an equitable private law remedy that restrains a public authority from doing an act that is wrongful or ultra vires. In place of an injunction, the Court may make a declaration concerning the parties' rights. At common law, there is no general right to claim damages – that is, monetary compensation – if rules of public law have been breached by an authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person {{must be able to}} establish a private law claim in contract or <b>tort</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the {{international}} comparison of modern <b>tort</b> <b>law,</b> common law jurisdictions based upon English <b>tort</b> <b>law</b> have foundational differences from civil law jurisdiction, {{which may be}} based on the Roman concept of delict. Even among common law countries, however, significant differences exist. For example, in England legal fees of the winner are paid by the loser (the English rule versus the American rule of attorney fees). Common law systems include United States <b>tort</b> <b>law,</b> Australian <b>tort</b> <b>law,</b> Canadian <b>tort</b> <b>law,</b> Irish <b>tort</b> <b>law,</b> and Scots Law of Delict. The Jewish law of rabbinic damages is another example although tort in Israeli law is technically similar to English law as it was enacted by British Mandate of Palestine authorities in 1944 and took effect in 1947. There is more apparent split between the Commonwealth countries (principally England, Canada and Australia) and the United States, although Canada may be more influenced by the United States due to its proximity.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tort</b> <b>laws</b> aim {{to deter}} risky medical {{practices}} and increase accountability for harm. This research examines {{their effects on}} deterrence of a high-risk obstetric practice in the United States: elective early-term (37 - 38 weeks gestation) induction of labor. Using birth certificate data from the Natality Detail Files and state-level data from publicly available sources, this study analyzes the effects of <b>tort</b> <b>laws</b> on labor induction with multilevel models (MLM) of 665, 491 early-term births nested in states. Results reveal that caps on damages are associated with significantly higher odds of early-term induction and Proportionate Liability (PL) is associated with significantly lower odds compared to Joint and Several Liability (JSL). The findings suggest that clinicians {{are more likely to}} engage in practices that defy professional guidelines in tort environments with lower legal burdens. I discuss the implications of the findings for patient safety and the deterrence of high-risk practices...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The recent rising cost of medical malpractice insurance premiums in many states has reportedly influenced some physicians to move or close practices, reduce high-risk services, or alter their practices to preclude potential lawsuits (known as defensive medicine practices). States have revised <b>tort</b> <b>laws</b> under which malpractice lawsuits are litigated to help constrain malpractice premium and claims costs. Some of these <b>tort</b> reform <b>laws</b> include caps on monetary penalties for noneconomic harm, such as for plaintiffs' pain and suffering. Congress is considering legislation similar to some states' <b>tort</b> reform <b>laws.</b> GAO examined how health care provider responses to rising malpractice premiums have affected access to health care, whether physicians practice defensive medicine, and how growth in malpractice premiums and claims payments compares across states with varying <b>tort</b> reform <b>laws.</b> Because national data on providers' responses to rising premiums are not reliable, GAO examined the experiences in five states with reported malpractice-related problems (Florida, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and West Virginia) and four states without reported problems (California, Colorado, Minnesota, and Montana) and analyzed growth in malpractice premiums and claims payments across all states and the District of Columbia. ...|$|R
