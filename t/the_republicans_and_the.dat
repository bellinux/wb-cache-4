5|$|In September and October 1945 Europeans and pro-Dutch Eurasians were {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} Indonesian mobs. Ferocious fighting erupted when 6,000 British Indian troops landed in the city. Sukarno and Hatta negotiated a ceasefire between <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British forces led by Brigadier Mallaby. Following the killing of Mallaby on 30 October, the British sent more troops into the city from 10 November {{under the cover of}} air attacks. Although the European forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought on until 29 November and thousands died as the population fled to the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Since {{before the}} Civil War, {{the two major}} parties were <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Democrats, and {{after the end of the}} Reconstruction Era in 1877, the {{national}} electorate was closely divided between them. Party membership was only partly based on ideology; party identification often reflected ethnic and religious background, as well as Civil War loyalties that were still keenly felt by many voters. Most Northern Protestants voted Republican, as did black Southerners. On the other hand, white Southerners and Northern Catholics generally voted Democratic.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1884, Ross's friends, {{including}} Victor M. Rose, {{the editor of}} the newspaper in Victoria, had encouraged Ross to run for governor. He declined and asked his friend George Clark to attend the 1884 state Democratic convention to prevent Ross from being named the gubernatorial candidate. Clark had to produce written authorization from Ross to convince the delegates to nominate someone else. Ross changed his mind in late 1885, announcing his candidacy for governor on February 25, 1886. During the campaign, he was variously accused of pandering to the Greenbackers, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Knights. Ross spent no money on his campaign other than traveling expenses, but still handily won the Democratic nomination. He won the general election with 228,776 votes, compared with 65,236 for the Republican candidate and 19,186 from the Prohibitionist candidate. Much of his support came from Confederate veterans.|$|E

5|$|On 18July 1936, {{war broke}} out on the Iberian {{peninsula}} as Spain dissolved {{into a state of}} civil war. After the chaos of the initial uprising, two opposing sides coalesced and began to consolidate their position—the Popular front (<b>the</b> <b>Republicans)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Nationalist front. In an early example of a proxy war, both sides quickly received support from other countries, most notably the Soviet Union and Germany as both wanted to test their tactics and equipment. The first shipment of foreign tanks, 50 Soviet T-26s, arrived on the 15 of October. The shipment was under the surveillance of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and Germany immediately responded by sending 41 PanzerI's to Spain a few days later. This first shipment was followed by four more shipments of PanzerI Ausf.B's, with 122 vehicles shipped in total.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failure}} to capture Madrid and the Republican counter attack at the Battle of the Corunna Road, the Nationalists sought to regain the initiative. A 25 mile wide strip of land in {{southern}} Spain along the Mediterranean Sea centering on Málaga, a base of the Spanish Republican Navy, was held by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Italian troops at the nearby port of Cádiz made an attack on Málaga logical.|$|E
25|$|The Republicans also imposed tariffs {{designed}} to protect the infant industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U.S. With the collapse of the Federalists as a party, the adoption of many Federalist principles by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> systematic policy of President James Monroe in his two terms (1817–25) to downplay partisanship, the nation entered an Era of Good Feelings, with far less partisanship than before (or after), and closed out the First Party System.|$|E
50|$|In 1904, he ran again, {{this time}} in a croos-endorsement deal {{alongside}} Democrat Edgar M. Cullen on both <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Democratic tickets, <b>and</b> was elected.|$|R
50|$|He was eighteenth New York State Comptroller from 1856 to 1857, elected on the American Party {{ticket in}} 1855. He won 33.98% of <b>the</b> vote over <b>the</b> <b>Republican,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two Democrats.|$|R
50|$|A tenuous {{balance between}} liberal and {{conservative}} forces was struck {{in the establishment of}} constitutional monarchy during 1874-1931 but brought no lasting solution, and Spain descended into Civil War between <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Nationalist factions.|$|R
25|$|Corbett {{believed}} that {{war with the}} Southern States was inevitable {{as soon as the}} South decided to withdraw from the union. He {{believed that}} {{the future of the country}} lay in its union and that the war should be prosecuted against the states in open hostility with their government. On his return to Oregon he went to work to unite <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Douglas or War Democrats. He was largely successful in this. He was then asked by them to become Governor of Oregon but declined.|$|E
25|$|The debate {{continued}} through the summer between the two as to which approach {{would be best for}} the Democratic Party. The Hamburg Massacre in July, although limited in fatalities compared to the total from later incidents at Ellenton, Charleston and Cainhoy, persuaded many whites that Governor Chamberlain's administration was unable to maintain order. In most of these events, blacks were killed in much greater number than whites, particularly at Ellenton. Populist Democrats ended hopes of supporting fusion with <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Straighouts became the dominant force within the Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{royal family}} went into exile on 14 April 1931 after {{municipal}} elections brought Republicans {{to power in}} most of the major cities, leading to the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. Alfonso XIII had hoped that his voluntary exile might avert a civil war between <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Monarchists. The royal family went to live in France and later Italy. Victoria Eugenie and Alfonso later separated, and she lived partly in the UK and, after being invited to leave Britain by its government, in Switzerland. She purchased a chateau, the Vieille Fontaine, outside Lausanne.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 20th century {{was a time of}} readjustment and contrast in Málaga with the expansion and improvement of agriculture, which had become the dominant economic sector. There was a progressive dismantling of industry accompanied by fluctuating commercial activity. All this occurred within a backward and barely literate society, where oligarchs exercised political control and manipulated the economy. Primary education in the city was plagued by funding deficits and a lack of schools and places for students and teachers, while secondary education was limited and university education nonexistent. Málaga faced the new century {{in the midst of an}} economic depression with the attendant social unrest and a weak structure of the state; meanwhile <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> labour movement found common ground.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut did not {{particularly}} sympathize with liberalism or conservatism, and mused on the specious simplicity of American politics. [...] "If {{you want to}} take my guns away from me, and you're all for murdering fetuses, and love it when homosexuals marry each other [...] you're a liberal. If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you're a conservative. What could be simpler?" [...] Regarding political parties, Vonnegut said, [...] "The two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers. The people don’t acknowledge this. They claim membership in two imaginary parties, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Democrats, instead." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{their agenda}} was {{obstructed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> appointed members of territorial government, especially Governor Sanford B. Dole, {{the former president}} of the Republic. In this session, the Home Rulers attempted to decentralize control away from the governor and empower local government by passing a bill creating the first counties in Hawaii. This county bill was defeated by Dole through a pocket veto after the prorogation of the regular session. The legislative assembly was later mockingly dubbed the [...] "Lady Dog Legislature" [...] because of extensive debate on House Bill No. 15, which pertained to the repealing of an 1898 tax on ownership of female dogs. This nickname was used by opponents of the Home Rulers to denigrate the group and the difficulties of the 1901 legislature would later be used as evidence of the incompetence of Native Hawaiian political leadership.

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1872 the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two {{candidates}} for governor, Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks. Massive fraud characterized the election, but Baxter was declared the winner and took office. Brooks never gave up, and finally in 1874 a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled {{to the office and}} swore him in. Both sides mobilized militia units, and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets. There was anticipation who President Grant would side with – either Baxter or Brooks. [...] Grant delayed, requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor, but Baxter refused to participate. Then, on May 15, 1874, President Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas, and the hostilities ceased. In fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter, and all <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Redeemers came to power. A few months later in early 1875, Grant astonished the nation by reversing himself and announcing that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872. Grant did not send in troops, and Brooks never regained office; instead Grant gave him the high-paying patronage job of postmaster in Little Rock. Brooks died in 1877. The episode brought further discredit to Grant.|$|E

2500|$|Because a {{majority}} of the town's men were away, engaged in fighting on behalf of the Republicans, the town {{at the time of the}} bombing was populated mostly by women and children. These demographics are reflected in the painting because, as Rudolf Arnheim writes, for Picasso: [...] "The women and children make Guernica the image of innocent, defenseless humanity victimized. Also, women and children have often been presented by Picasso as the very perfection of mankind. An assault on women and children is, in Picasso's view, directed at the core of mankind." [...] Clearly, the Nationalists sought to demoralize <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> civilian population as a whole by demonstrating their military might on a town that stood for traditional Basque culture and innocent civilians.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt alienated many {{conservative}} Democrats in 1937 by his unexpected plan to [...] "pack" [...] the Supreme Court via the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937. Following a sharp {{recession that}} hit early in 1938, major strikes {{all over the}} country, the CIO and AFL competing {{with each other for}} membership and Roosevelt's failed efforts to radically reorganize the Supreme Court, the Democrats were in disarray. Meanwhile, the GOP was united as they had shed their weakest members in a series of defeats since 1930. Re-energized Republicans focused attention on strong fresh candidates in major states, especially Robert A. Taft the conservative from Ohio, Earl Warren the moderate who won both <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Democratic primaries in California and Thomas Dewey the crusading prosecutor from New York. The GOP comeback in 1938 was made possible by carrying 50% of the vote outside the South, giving GOP leaders confidence it had a strong base for the 1940 presidential election.|$|E

The death of Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia in 1970 weakened the party, even though his brother Francisco Calderón Guardia then took control. [...] In the 1974 elections they ran Fernando Trejos Escalante for president, but he was easily defeated by Daniel Oduber Quirós, and altogether they won only 16 seats in the Legislative Assembly. Francisco Calderón Guardia died in 1977 which was the death knell for the party. [...] Most of the original coalition left the party, including <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> National Union Party. The National Unification Party's last gasp was the 1978 elections where they ran Guillermo Villalobos Arce for president, but he lost and the party took no seats in the Legislative Assembly. The National Unification Party had already been replaced by the temporary Unity Coalition, which metamorphosed into the Social Christian Unity Party.|$|E
