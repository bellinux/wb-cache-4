5|$|B.spinulosa {{does not}} appear to be under threat.

5|$|Python is {{intended}} to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, often using English keywords where other languages use punctuation.

Further, Python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.|$|E

5|$|These {{concerns}} aside, B.integrifolia {{does not}} appear to be under threat.

5000|$|Kleinberg is {{best known}} for his work on {{networks}} and particularly for his HITS algorithm, developed while he was at IBM. HITS is an algorithm for web search that builds on the eigenvector-based methods used in algorithms and served as the full-scale model for PageRank by recognizing that web pages or sites should be considered important not only if they are linked <b>to</b> by <b>many</b> <b>others</b> (as in PageRank), but also if they link <b>to</b> <b>many</b> <b>others.</b> Search engines themselves are examples of sites that are important because they link <b>to</b> <b>many</b> <b>others.</b> Kleinberg realized that this generalization implies two different classes of important web pages, which he called [...] "hubs" [...] and [...] "authorities". The HITS algorithm is an algorithm for automatically identifying the leading hubs and authorities in a network of hyperlinked pages.|$|R

5|$|Unlike most bony fish, {{sharks are}} K-selected reproducers, {{meaning that they}} produce {{a small number of}} {{well-developed}} young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. Fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle. Sharks mature slowly relative <b>to</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> fish. For example, lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13–15.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War {{the canal}} {{remained}} {{in a state}} of limbo – with minimal maintenance by the railway company – and was the haunt of fishermen and walkers. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, and the infrastructure remained in remarkably good order, compared <b>to</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> closed canals. The section near Creech St Michael was even used for swimming lessons for the local school children in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} {{of the power of the}} Howards, the county of Suffolk was controlled by an oligarchy of Protestant gentry by the 17th century and did not play a prominent part in the English Civil War that occurred between 1642–6.

Hitcham's bequest had meanwhile become entangled in the law courts and work did not begin on the poorhouse until the late 1650s, by which time the internal buildings of castle were being broken up for the value of their stone; the chapel had been destroyed in this way by 1657.|$|E
