40|$|Title of the paper: Influence {{of feeding}} on {{fattening}} performance and carcass quality of young Hungarian Grey and Holstein Friesian bulls The {{aim of this}} study was to analyse the effect of nutrition, genotype and nutrition x genotype interaction on growth performance and carcass quality using Hungarian Grey cattle bulls (HG) in comparison to Holstein Friesian bulls (HF) kept under extensive and intensive conditions. In groups extensive and intensive days on feed lasted for 221 and 201, respectively. Higher relative growth rate was recorded in Hungarian Grey than Holstein Friesian in extensively fed group and higher final weights were recorded in intensive groups compared to extensive groups. Differences between genotypes were not different. Carcass weight and length, amount of perinephric and <b>trimmed</b> <b>fat</b> were higher in intensive groups as well. Higher lean meat content in carcass was measured in Hungarian Grey breed. For treatments extensive and intensive means were 71, 0 % and 67, 5 %, respectively. The ratio of bone in carcass varied in line with the four feet percentage and weight. Similarly to the ratio of perinephric and <b>trimmed</b> <b>fat,</b> the amount of fat in carcass was lower in extensively fed groups, which proves the varied effect of different feeding. The tissue composition of carcass can be analysed by Computer-Tomography (CT) - examination of prime rib samples. These results are more representative as the EUROP-classification of evaluation for carcass quality. Findings reveal that considerations on the utilization of the native HG breed on development of novel beef cattle production systems especially on roughage-based diets seems to be justified...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{response}} to the increasing need to reduce the burden associated with chronic non-communicable diseases, a health club was developed in 2002 to promote healthy lifestyles in Khayelitsha, an urban township in Cape Town. The current study assessed {{the effectiveness of the}} health club in promoting healthy living by comparing club members practices of physical activity and eating habits with community controls. It also identified perceived barriers and enhancing factors in both groups. Data was collected through interviews using structured questionnaires. Fewer health club members (8 %) than non-members (23 %) walked for more than 30 minutes daily (p= 0. 025). Members were in general more active than non-members. Members (28 %) spent more time than non- members (8 %) engaged in light intensity daily activities for more than 2 hours (p= 0. 029). Fifty- eight percent of members and 20 % of non-members spent more than 3 hours daily engaged in moderate physical activity (p= 0. 002). Members mostly made healthier food choices and cooking methods than non- members. Sixty- nine percent of club members always <b>trimmed</b> <b>fat</b> from red meat whereas 79 percent of non-members never <b>trimmed</b> <b>fat</b> (p = 0. 000). More non-members (96 %) than members (39 %) ate soft rather than hard margarine (p= 0. 000). Thirty- six percent of members and 5 percent of non-members consumed less than 2 teaspoons of sugar in their tea/coffee (p = 0. 000). This study indicates that the health club had a positive effect in influencing healthy living among its members. However, socio-economic and environmental factors pose significant barriers in the adoption of healthy behaviours. Corresponding author...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{economic}} incentive for producing young and leaner carcasses, {{as well as}} demand for lean meat from progressively health conscious consumers, are considered drivers for change in carcass composition over time. Furthermore, many retailers <b>trim</b> visible <b>fat</b> from meat to various degrees and consumers increasingly remove visible fat from meat prior to, or after, cooking. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the composition of South African Bonsmara beef from four age groups from different production systems, as well as to extrapolate the effect of <b>fat</b> <b>trimming</b> on physical composition. Fat content of marketable beef has decreased notably since the 1930 s, and beef from the South African Bonsmara breed contains less than 10 g lipid per 100 g after <b>trimming</b> of subcutaneous <b>fat,</b> irrespective of age. Removal of all visible fat reduces the lipid content to less than 5 g per 100 g, comparing favourably with other lean animal products. Red Meat Industry.

40|$|Carcass {{data from}} one side of 1, 149 steers born from 1986 to 1990 were {{analyzed}} to develop means for carcass traits and retail product percentage by yield grades. Carcasses from 610 of these steers born from 1988 to 1990 were fabricated to two <b>fat</b> <b>trim</b> levels (. 30 and. 00 in.), with subcutaneous fat and intermuscular (internal) fat weighed separately. Subcutaneous fat from the primal round, loin, rib, chuck, brisket, and flank in excess of. 30 in. plus the kidney knob were considered to constitute an industry ‘hot-fat trim equivalent’ (HFTE). Quadratic regression curves were plotted for percent retail product (RP) and percent <b>fat</b> <b>trim</b> (FT) vs. USDA yield grade. In addition, prediction equations were developed for weights and percentages of RP and FT {{that could be used in}} plants that do hot-fat trimming and quality grading of carcasses. Percentage of RP, trimmed to either. 30 or. 00 in. of fat, decreased an average of 4 % for each full yield grade increase. Trimming to. 00 in. of fat instead of. 30 in. reduced RP about 5. 5 %. The average percentage of HFTE for a yield grade 3. 0 carcass was 8. 4 %. The range in percentage of RP at both trim levels was reduced by <b>trimming</b> <b>fat</b> to an HFTE basis, but considerable range still existed. The range in percentage of internal (seam) fat across yield grades was greater than the range in percentage of HFTE. An equation to predict percentage RP in HFTE carcasses using percentage of hot <b>fat</b> <b>trim,</b> carcass weight, ribeye area, and marbling score had an R 2 of. 75, which was considerably higher than that for an equation using USDA yield grade traits from untrimmed carcasses (R 2 =. 54).

Breed effects were important for growth traits; carcass traits; and retail product, <b>fat</b> <b>trim</b> and bone percentages, and weights. Even though mean slaughter weight was 126. 6 lb heavier for Simmental, Gelbvieh and Charolais breeds, they did not differ from Limousins in retail product weight because of their lower dressing percentages, higher <b>fat</b> <b>trim</b> percentages, and higher bone percentages. The effects of dietaryenergy density were important for most traits, and little interaction occurred between breed group and dietary energy density.

This paper reviews trends over the past 20 years that have influenced the red meat supply in response to consumer and health professional demands for lean meat, drawing on published survey data, marketing information, analyses of meat content and qualitative research commissioned by Meat and Livestock Australia. Results and Discussion: Separable fat is the greatest determinant of the saturated fat in Australian red meat, {{and changes in the}} processing and butchering practices have combined to produce red meat today with significantly lower separable fat. Nutrient analyses in 2002 showed the separable fat on raw retail samples was up to 38 % less than in comparable cuts in 1983. Further trimming by consumers prior to consumption is also increasing and in 2007 89 % of consumers reported buying meat trimmed or removing some or all fat prior to consumption. The 1995 national nutrition survey showed red meat contributed less than 10 % of dietary saturated fat intake in Australia, and continues to make an important contribution to intake of iron, zinc, omega 3 and vitamin B 12 intakes, as well as encouraging consumption of vegetables. Conclusions: Dietary messages and strategies for reducing saturated fat intake have increased <b>fat</b> <b>trimming</b> practices by retailers as well as consumers.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Twenty beef carcass sides varying in USDA quality and yield grades ere selected from commercial packing plants to study the physical and chemical composition of beef retail cuts. Thirteen cuts (in sets of four) were fabricated and assigned to one of four treatments: (1) 0. 3 cm external <b>fat</b> <b>trim,</b> raw; (2) 0. 0 cm external <b>fat</b> <b>trim,</b> cooked; (3) 0. 3 cm external <b>fat</b> <b>trim,</b> cooked; and (4) 0. 6 cm external <b>fat</b> <b>trim,</b> cooked. Retail cuts assigned to the cooked treatment were either braised, broiled, or roasted. Both the cooked and raw cuts were dissected into separable lean, external fat, seam fat, and waste (heavy connective tissue and bone). Chemical analyses were conducted on the separable lean to determine fat, moisture, protein, and ash content. In addition, cooking yields and fat retention were calculated using raw versus cooked data. Dissection data suggested that percentage separable lean increased as cuts were <b>trimmed</b> of external <b>fat</b> cover. Choice retail cuts had a higher percentage of seam fat than Select retail cuts. Arm roasts proved to yield the lowest percentage of separable lean, as well as the most seam fat and waste, even if all the external fat was removed before cooking. Trimming cuts of external fat before cooking had few significant (P < 0. 05) effects on chemical fat, moisture, protein, or ash content within a cut. The eye of round roasts showed a difference (P < 0. 05) between the 0. 0 cm and 0. 6 cm treatments for fat content. As anticipated, retail cuts from the Choice quality grade had higher chemical fat contents than Select cuts. Few significant differences were found for cooking yields and fat retention as influenced by USDA quality grade or trim level. Retail cuts that were braised had numerically lower cooking yields and percentage moisture than cuts that were roasted or broiled regardless of quality grade or trim level.

High yielding carcases deliver cuts that have a better shape and ensure retailers {{do not have to}} present products of overly fat animals for display and sale. For processors a high yielding animal represents increased efficiency in the boning room. These carcases require less labour to <b>trim</b> <b>fat</b> and there is less carcase wastage. For producers, higher yielding animals can be finished to heavier weights without becoming overly fat and accruing penalties. Additionally, fast growing, high yielding animals can be finished either faster or to heavier weights, in a shorter period of time, offering the producer savings on feed costs. The challenge is to produce a fast growing lamb that can be turned off quickly, that are of favourable conformation, and also gives a satisfactory return to the producer. It is increasingly important that price signals reflect not just more carcase as it may represent increasing amounts of fat. With continued evolution of the payment scheme of lamb there is the potential to improve profitability through the use of genetic selection for increased yield...|$|R

Pork with its <b>fat</b> <b>trimmed</b> is leaner than the meat of most domesticated animals, but is high in cholesterol and saturated fat.|$|R
