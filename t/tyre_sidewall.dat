40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the fracture toughness of a pneumatic <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewall</b> was developed. Conventional methods of fracture toughness determination require the structural material to be tested independently of the structure. The proposed method allows frature toughness to be measured directly from the type sidewall. Two advantages follow: (i) elimination {{of the need for}} duplicating the identical cured sidewall properties in the testpiece, and (ii) avoidance of the buckling inherent in thin sidewall test specimens. The pneumatic tyre chosen for the investigation was a 7. 75 - 14 bias passenger tyre with a two-ply nylon carcass. An artificial crack was created in the <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewall</b> and the cracked tyre was loaded by inflation pressure. The experimental parameters taken from the tyre include the inflation pressure, volume, and crack opening area at different crack lengths. Based on a quasistatic energy analysis, the pressure-volumecrack length diagram was used to graphically determine the sidewall fracture toughness. In addition, an equation based on the reciprocal theorem for a cracked body and netting analysis was derived and used to analytically determine the sidewall fracture toughness. The computed fracture toughness compares reasonaly well with the measured G values via the experimental approach. ...|$|E

The ring re{{presents the}} belt and the elastic foundation represents the <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewall.</b> The tyre model, which is implemented as a finite element model, is valid below the first treadband axial bending mode and includes a definition of the wheel flexibility and air cavity. The eigenfrequencies predicted by the model are within 5 % of the measured eigenfrequencies. The model is validated by comparing predicted with measured responses for both an unloaded and loaded tyre. status: publishe...|$|E

Our representation includes the effects of belt width, curvature and anisotropy, and also explicitly models the <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewalls.</b> Many of the associated numerical parameters are fixed by physical considerations; the remainder require empirical input.

40|$|In recent decades, the {{worldwide}} {{growth of the}} automobile industry and {{the increasing use of}} cars as the main means of transport have tremendously boosted tyre production. This has generated massive stockpiles of used tyres. Extensive research projects were carried out on how to use used tyres in different applications. In order to properly dispose these millions of tyres, the use of innovative techniques to recycle them is important.

40|$|In this project, {{attempts}} have been made to improve the properties of Natural rubber (NR) <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewall</b> compound, especially the ozone resistance by blending the rubber with Ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM). In view of this, various rubber compounds, containing the blends of NR and EPDM in the different proportions have been prepared, vulcanized and tested for their physical strength and ozone resistance. The results of this investigation reveals that the blends containing NR:EPDM in the range of ratios from 70 : 30 to 80 : 20 are most suitable for the production of tyre sidewalls with high strength and ozone resistance...|$|E
40|$|Blending of {{saturated}} ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) with highly unsaturated rubbers, such as natural rubber (NR) and (butadiene rubber) BR, is a rapidly developing area especially for <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewall</b> applications, where the saturated elastomer {{can be considered}} as a polymeric antioxidant for the diene rubbers. However, vulcanisates of such elastomer blends are generally poor in mechanical properties. These undesirable phenomena are generally the result of the thermodynamic incompatibility of these two types of rubber, cure incompatibility and heterogeneous filler distribution in each of the rubber phases. The objective of the project covered in this thesis is to overcome these incompatibility and reinforcement problems of the NR/BR/EPDM blends by various approaches and therefore improve the final mechanical properties of such blends. Besides the mechanical properties, the mechanisms involved are studied in the present work as well. In this research generally two approaches have been explored to solve the incompatibility and uneven-reinforcement problems of the NR/BR/EPDM blends and to improve the mechanical properties: adding a compatibilising agent and modification of the EPDM. Applying MAH-EPM as compatibilising agent leads to some improvements of the mechanical properties. However, ionic crosslinking resulting from MAH-EPM with ZnO, is not thermally stable, which limits the application at high temperatures. Different modification agents have been tried and it was found that APPS works by far most effectively. Significant improvements have been obtained with APPS-modified EPDM in blends with NR/BR. There is still some room for improvement, especially for the visco-elastic properties. But due to the excellent tensile, tear and fatigue properties, it can be a serious candidate for <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewall</b> applications. Considering the modification reaction of EPDM with APPS, the reaction mechanism is not clear yet and is worth to be further explored...|$|E
40|$|The {{static and}} dynamic {{stiffness}} of a <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewall</b> are calculated {{as a function}} of geometry, load parameters and frequency. Two different expressions were used for below and above the ring frequency. The air pressure and section aspect ratio are found to be the controlling influences below the ring frequency. This sidewall stiffness was inserted into previously obtained wave equations to obtain the dispersion relationships and impedances for a tyre belt with sidewalls. The stiffness and force transmission to the hub in the region of the contact patch was also calculated and compared with measured values. The sidewall stiffness in the region of the contact patch is found to be strongly dependent on the belt wavespeed, giving a stiffer value in the region of the contact patch above the ring frequency...|$|E
5000|$|... "Roller cam brakes" [...] are centre-pull {{cantilever}} brakes actuated by {{the cable}} pulling a single two-sided sliding cam. (First and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is {{most common and}} is described here.) Each arm has a cam follower. As the cam presses against the follower it forces the arms apart.

Since the cam controls the rate of closure, the clamping force can be made non-linear with the pull.

5000|$|Formula 1 has {{contracted}} {{a single}} supplier of tyres since the 2007 season. The supplier (currently Pirelli) supplies five specifications of slick dry-weather tyres (ultra soft, super soft, soft, medium and hard) (Ultra soft being introduced during Monaco 2016), of which two compounds are provided at each race; these {{are referred to}} as the [...] "Prime" [...] and [...] "Option" [...] tyres. The distinction between Prime and Option is that the teams are supplied with more sets of the Prime than the Option tyre for use throughout the weekend. Usually the Prime tyre is harder and therefore more durable than the Option tyre, while the Option tyre provides more grip and therefore allows faster lap times on fresh tyres; at some events the selection is reversed, with the Option tyre being harder than the Prime. The combination of longer lasting and faster tyres adds an element to each car's race strategy. Additionally, two wet-weather compounds are provided by the supplier: intermediate and full wet. Each compound is differentiated by a colour-coded band painted around the <b>tyre's</b> <b>sidewall</b> and including the supplier's logo; purple for ultra soft, red for super-soft, yellow for soft, white for medium, orange for hard, green for intermediate and blue for full wet.|$|R
40|$|Competitive {{aerodynamic}} {{performance of}} a Formula One car relies upon total understanding of the downstream wake of exposed rotating wheels. Sensitivities to the downstream vortices and low stagnation-pressure regions lead to subtle design decisions in bargeboards, side-pods and {{the leading edge of}} the highly sensitive floor region. A significant proportion of an F 1 aerodynamicist's time is spent dealing with front wheel wake structures and indeed much of the front wing is developed to provide pressure gradients and vortex structures to control this wake. Wind tunnel testing of scaled deformable tyres has become a common occurrence in F 1 in recent years although there is a significant lack of available literature, academic or otherwise. Due to high vertical loads experienced by a grand prix car and the relatively high levels of camber used for mechanical advantage, the use of a rigid tyre is no longer considered suitable for the accurate simulation of an F 1 wheel wake. This investigation has studied in detail the aerodynamic consequences born from sidewall bulge and contact patch parameters through the use of an innovative rotating sidewall scanning technique, static contact patch measurements, five-hole pressure-probe wake measurements, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and load-cell drag measurements. A table of three-dimensional coordinates for the maximum and minimum deformation levels has been included in this paper to enable further CFD studies to be undertaken. For longevity of tyre and moving ground plane, deformation levels are often fairly conservative in industrial and race team applications. The work presented here includes a full range of on-track axle heights, which far exceed those usually tested in the aforementioned settings and the aerodynamic consequences of under-deforming have been identified. It has been concluded that insufficient deformation of the <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewalls</b> leads to a significant overestimate in the width of the wake as well as the aerodynamic loads associated with it. As a result of this study, the most sensitive parameters of a deformable tyre relating to aerodynamic testing have been identified and summarised. For development of an F 1 car, a compromise in tyre pressure is considered less detrimental to the downstream wake compared to providing insufficient deformation with an incorrect axle height. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a structural model for an unloaded tyre, {{based on a}} three-dimensional flexible ring on an elastic foundation. The ring represents the belt and the elastic foundation represents the <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewall.</b> The model is valid till 300 Hz and includes {{a model of the}} wheel and the air cavity. This makes the model suitable for the prediction of structure borne interior noise. Unlike most ring models, which consider only in-plane modes, the presented model also predicts modes that involve torsion of the belt in the circumferential direction. The parameterization of the model, which does not require detailed knowledge about the tyre construction, is based on the main geometrical properties of the tyre and a limited modal test. Comparison between measured and calculated responses shows that the tyre-wheel model describes the dynamic behaviour with acceptable accuracy. Because the model is physical based, it could be applied to describe other operational conditions such as loading and rotation. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made, using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography, of the {{migration}} of TMQ (a quinoline type) and 6 PPD (a paraphenylenediamine type) antidegradants from a <b>tyre</b> <b>sidewall</b> compound into adjacent casing and liner compounds containing no antidegradant. Migration takes place at a rapid rate, even during the vulcanisation of the composite. After 4000 hours ageing in nitrogen at 100 oC, there is {{a higher level of}} antidegradants in the casing than in the sidewall. An equilibrium distribution is not obtained. After 114 days at 50 oC in 95 % relative humidity, the level of solvent extractable 6 PPD fell to zero, but subsequent ageing for 2 years in 50 pphm ozone showed no evidence of sidewall cracking. It is suggested that the antidegradant is still active but linked to the polymer chain. An analytical method, for the type and amount of sulphenamide accelerators in vulcanised rubber compounds, has been developed. During the vulcanisation process, the accelerators decay, liberating specific amines which have been solvent extracted, derivatised with 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene and the yellow coloured zwitter ion analysed using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography. The decay of the accelerator and sulphur during the vulcanisation process, has been studied. It has been demonstrated that the sulphur crosslinking with a styrenebutadiene polymer is a first order reaction, after an initial period during which the accelerator content falls to zero. Variations in sulphur to accelerator ratios gave consistent rate constants for the crosslinking, except for a sulphur level of less than 1 % by weight and a ratiio of accelerator to sulphur of 1 : 1. 3. The retention time of the reaction product between sulphur and accelerator from an HPLC column changes with cure time, showing that the precurser to crosslinking is an ever changing material. One of these reaction products has been analysed...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Current European legislation aims to limit vehicle noise emissions since many people are exposed to road traffic noise in urban areas. Vehicle pass-by noise is measured {{according to the international}} standard ISO 362 in Europe. More recent investigations of urban traffic have led to the proposal of a revised ISO 362 which includes a constant-speed test in addition to the traditional accelerated test {{in order to determine the}} pass-by noise value. In order to meet the legal pass-by noise requirements, vehicle manufacturers and suppliers must analyse and quantify vehicle noise source characteristics during the development phase of the vehicle. In addition, predictive tools need to be available for the estimation of the final pass-by noise value. This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of vehicle pass-by noise and of the characteristics of the vehicle noise sources contributing to pass-by noise. This is supported through an extensive literature review in which current pass-by noise prediction methods are reviewed as well. Furthermore, three vehicle noise sources are replicated experimentally under laboratory conditions. This involves an orifice noise source, represented by a specially designed loudspeaker on a moving trolley, shell noise, represented by a metal cylinder structure, and <b>tyre</b> cavity and <b>sidewall</b> noise, represented by an annular membrane mounted on a tyre-like structure. The experimentally determined directivity characteristics of the acoustically excited noise sources are utilised in the pass-by noise prediction method. The predictive results are validated against experimental measurements of the three vehicle-like noise sources made within an anechoic chamber...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Sound and Vibration [© Elsevier Ltd. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] noise which results from the interaction of pneumatic tyres with a rough road surface is a significant contributor to an increasing local environmental problem. Above a steady forward vehicle speed of 40 km/h this is the dominant noise source of a modern car in good working condition, and is a significant contributor to the overall radiated noise during acceleration. In order to determine the noise produced by a patterned tyre rolling on a rough road surface, the vibration characteristics of the tyre must be known. A method has been presented by O'Boy and Dowling [Tyre/road interaction noise: a 3 d viscoelastic multilayer model of a tyre belt, Journal of Sound and Vibration, volume 322, issues 4 - 5, 22 May 2009, pages 829 - 850] which provides these vibration characteristics for a tyre belt composed of multiple viscoclastic layers, each layer having a different thickness and material properties. In this paper, we use this model of the tyre belt to determine the parameters of an equivalent simple bending plate model which can be adapted to yield the response of a <b>tyre</b> which includes <b>sidewalls.</b> A method is then described which uses this response to determine the acceleration of the tyre surface as it rolls over a rough road. These accelerations are then used to predict the far-field radiated noise for a patterned tyre on two rough road surfaces. Comparisons with experimental data are provided at each stage.
