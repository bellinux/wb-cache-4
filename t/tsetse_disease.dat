30|$|Respondents {{reported}} {{that from the}} mid- 1920 s to late 1960 s, they were confronted with frequent outbreaks of sleeping sickness and nagana disease caused by the tsetse fly. The tsetse epidemic {{played a critical role}} in settlements and migration patterns of different ethnic groups around the Okavango Delta. To flee the ravages of the tsetse fly, people moved out into the sandveld with their livestock. Riverine lifestyles were disrupted and new settlements emerged. According to local informants in Sehithwa and Toteng, neither the colonial government nor the Tawana authorities were able to handle the problem. The only alternative for pastoralists was to move to unaffected areas in the sandveld. It was only in the mid- 1960 s under Sir Seretse Khama (Botswana’s first president from 1966 to 1980) that the tsetse was effectively controlled. According to Tlou (1985), the tsetse fly had the most devastating effects on the spatial distribution of the Ngamiland population because, unlike mosquito-borne malaria, the <b>tsetse</b> fly-borne <b>diseases,</b> sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) and nagana, afflicted both humans and cattle alike. Settlements such as Semboyo and Makakung emerged during this period as the Ovaherero migrated further into the sandveld.|$|R

Preliminary field trials indicated that the repellent could provide substantial protection to cattle. The repellent could also be integrated with other tsetse control tactics in a 'push-pull' strategy that uses repellents to `push' the flies away from their hosts, in conjunction with baited traps/targets, which `pull' and kill them. This study evaluated {{the efficacy of the}} 'push-pull' tactic in enhancing tsetse suppression rates and disease levels using on-host repellents to `push' and baited traps to `pull' the flies in Shimba Hills, Kwale District, Kenya. From cross-sectional surveys conducted in the area, livestock farmers considered livestock diseases; trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis, East Coast fever and foot-and-mouth disease to be the major constraints to livestock production in the area. Trypanosomosis was the most important compared to other diseases. Chemotherapy was the most widely used method of controlling the <b>disease.</b> Farmer-based <b>tsetse</b> control strategies were poorly adopted. Most farmers demonstrated awareness about trypanosomosis, its clinical symptoms, aetiology, correct treatment and control measures. Survey of the epidemiology of cattle trypanosomosis in the area indicated that, Glossina austeni, G. brevipalpis and G. pallidipes were found in the area. Trypanosoma congolense and T. vivax were diagnosed in cattle with infection prevalences in the animals varying between 0 and 25 %. A field trial conducted in the area {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} 'push-pull' tactic for tsetse and trypanosomosis control indicated that the 'push-pull' might be a more effective way of reducing <b>tsetse</b> populations, trypanosomosis <b>disease</b> incidences and trypanocidal drug use and improving herd health and productivity compared to `push' or `pull'. 'Push-pull' gave significantly higher reduction (62 %) in trypanosomosis incidence compared to `push' (59 %) and `pull' (53 %) (x 2 = 65. 4; df = 2; p < 0. 001). Risk of transmission of trypanosomosis in the controls was upto three times significantly (X 2 = 43. 2; df= 1; p < 0. 0001) higher than protected cattle. Body weight, body condition and packed cell volume levels were significantly (F = 48. 9; df = 1; p < 0. 01) higher in protected cattle than controls. Percentage reduction in G. pallidipes relative density in 'push-pull' was 83 % compared to 77 % in `pull' sites. Households with protected cattle recorded significant reduction in trypanocidal drug use (X 2 = 11. 8; df = 1; p = 0. 003). Following the trial, livestock farmers' perceptions on the impacts of the repellent and traps on tsetse challenge and trypanosomosis risk were assessed. Most farmers considered significant reduction in trypanocidal drug use, <b>disease</b> incidence and <b>tsetse</b> population to be the most important benefits of repellents and traps. Additional benefits included quieter grazing, protection of goats and opening up of previously avoided fields for grazing and crop production. Most farmers preferred repellents or traps or both to current methods of tsetse and trypanosomosis control. All farmers preferred repellents to traps. With a view of increasing the potency of the `pull' component, trials conducted to evaluate the attractiveness of aldehyde blends showed that the blends when used alone did not significantly increase trap catches (x 2 = 0. 61; df = 1; p = 0. 461), but when combined with cow urine and/ or acetone, they increased the catches, although this was not statistically significant (x 2 = 0. 85; df = 1; p = 0. 644).

40|$|Climate warming {{over the}} next century is {{expected}} to have a large impact on the interactions between pathogens and their animal and human hosts. Vector-borne diseases are particularly sensitive to warming because temperature changes can alter vector development rates, shift their geographical distribution and alter transmission dynamics. For this reason, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), a vector-borne disease of humans and animals, was recently identified as one of the 12 infectious diseases likely to spread owing to climate change. We combine a variety of direct effects of temperature on vector ecology, vector biology and vector–parasite interactions via a disease transmission model and extrapolate the potential compounding effects of projected warming on the epidemiology of African trypanosomiasis. The model predicts that epidemics can occur when mean temperatures are between 20. 78 C and 26. 18 C. Our model does not predict a large-range expansion, but rather a large shift of up to 60 per cent in the geographical extent of the range. The model also predicts that 46 – 77 million additional people may be at risk of exposure by 2090. Future research could expand our analysis to include other environmental factors that influence <b>tsetse</b> populations and <b>disease</b> transmission such as humidity, as well as changes to human, livestock and wildlife distributions.

Fotie et al., J. Med. Chem. 53 : 966 – 982, 2010). In the present study, we sought to provide further support for the hypothesis that OSU- 40 kills trypanosomes through oxidative stress. Inducible RNA interference (RNAi) was applied to downregulate key enzymes in parasite antioxidant defense, including T. brucei trypanothione synthetase (TbTryS) and superoxide dismutase B (TbSODB). Both TbTryS RNAi-induced and TbSODB RNAi-induced cells showed impaired growth and increased sensitivity toward OSU- 40 by 2. 4 -fold and 3. 4 -fold, respec-tively. Decreased expression of key parasite antioxidant enzymes was thus associated with increased sensitivity to OSU- 40, con-sistent with the hypothesis that OSU- 40 acts through oxidative stress. Finally, the dose-dependent formation of free radicals was observed after incubation of T. bruceiwith OSU- 40 utilizing electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.

Lumbar puncture to analyze cerebrospinal fluid will remain the only method of disease staging until reliable noninvasive methods are developed, but there is no widespread consensus as to what exactly defines biologically central nervous system disease or what specific cerebrospinal fluid findings should justify drug therapy for late-stage involvement. All four main drugs used for human African trypanosomiasis are toxic, and melarsoprol, the only drug that is effective for both types of central nervous system disease, is so toxic that it kills 5 % of patients who receive it. Eflornithine, alone or combined with nifurtimox, is being used increasingly as first-line therapy for gambiense disease.

40|$|The {{deployment}} of 4 odour baited traps per km 2 {{is used as}} a standard in tsetse control projects and was used at two sites, Luke and Asossa, in Ethiopia. The so-obtained data were used to build maps of tsetse distribution and to identify areas with increased fly densities, referred to as hot spot. To render the control system more efficient, a method that allowed to opti-mise monitoring scheme, by reducing the number of traps and maintaining the previously reached levels of tsetse occur-rence, was here described. From the original trap design, reduced trap arrangements were obtained, decreasing the number of traps from 33 % to 66 %. Variogram analysis and kriging interpolation of tsetse catches were performed and results ob-tained from reduced and complete arrangements were compared. At both sites, the geostatistical analysis showed that reli-able information on spatio-temporal tsetse occurrences can be obtained by using every second trap resulting to a decrease in labour costs. Moreover, the method allowed detection of hot spots similar to the ones detected with the standard method.

40|$|Background: Uganda has {{suffered}} {{from a series of}} epidemics of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), a <b>tsetse</b> transmitted <b>disease,</b> also known as sleeping sickness. The area affected by acute Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense HAT (rHAT) has been expanding, driven by importation of infected cattle into regions previously free of the disease. These regions are also affected by African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) demanding a strategy for integrated disease control. Methods: In 2008, the Public Private Partnership, Stamp Out Sleeping Sickness (SOS) administered a single dose of trypanocide to 31 486 head of cattle in 29 parishes in Dokolo and Kaberamaido districts. This study examines the impact of this intervention on the prevalence of rHAT and AAT trypanosomes in cattle from villages that had (HAT+ve) or had not (HAT-ve) experienced a recent case of rHAT. Cattle herds from 20 villages were sampled and screened by PCR, pre-intervention and 6 -months post-intervention, for the presence or absence of: Trypanosoma brucei s. l.; human infective T. b. rhodesiense; Trypanosoma vivax; and Trypanosoma congolense savannah. Results: Post-intervention, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of T. brucei s. l. and the human infective sub-species T. b. rhodesiense in village cattle across all 20 villages. The prevalence of T. b. rhodesiense was reduced from 2. 4 % to 0. 74 % (P[*]<[*] 0. 0001), with the intervention showing greater impact in HAT-ve villages. The number of villages containing cattle harbouring human infective parasites decreased from 15 / 20 to 8 / 20, with T. b. rhodesiense infection mainly persisting within cattle in HAT+ve villages (six/eight). The proportion of T. brucei s. l. infections identified as human infective T. b. rhodesiense decreased after the intervention from 8. 3 % (95 % CI[*]=[*] 11. 1 – 5. 9 %) to 4. 1 % (95 % CI[*]=[*] 6. 8 – 2. 3 %). Villages that had experienced a recent human case (HAT+ve villages) showed a significantly higher prevalence for AAT both pre- and post-intervention. For AAT the prevalence of T. vivax was significantly reduced from 5. 9 % to 0. 05 % post-intervention while the prevalence of T. congolense increased from 8. 0 % to 12. 2 %. Conclusions: The intervention resulted in a significant decrease in the prevalence of T. brucei s. l., human infective T. b. rhodesiense and T. vivax infection in village cattle herds. The proportion of T. brucei s. l. that were human infective, decreased from 1 : 12 [*]T. brucei s. l. infections before the intervention to 1 : 33 post-intervention. It is clearly more difficult to eliminate T. b. rhodesiense from cattle in villages that have experienced a human case. Evidence of elevated levels of AAT in livestock within village herds is a useful indicator of risk for rHAT in Uganda.

40|$|Background: Identifying {{hosts of}} blood-feeding insect vectors {{is crucial in}} {{understanding}} their role in disease transmission. Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis (rHAT), also known as acute sleeping sickness is caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and transmitted by <b>tsetse</b> flies. The <b>disease</b> is commonly associated with wilderness areas of east and southern Africa. Such areas hold a diverse range of species which form communities of hosts for disease maintenance. The relative importance of different wildlife hosts remains unclear. This study quantified tsetse feeding preferences in a wilderness area of great host species richness, Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, assessing tsetse feeding and host density contemporaneously. Methods: Glossina swynnertoni and G. pallidipes were collected from six study sites. Bloodmeal sources were identified through matching Cytochrome B sequences amplified from bloodmeals from recently fed flies to published sequences. Densities of large mammal species in each site were quantified, and feeding indices calculated to assess the relative selection or avoidance of each host species by tsetse. Results: The host species most commonly identified in G. swynnertoni bloodmeals, warthog (94 / 220), buffalo (48 / 220) and giraffe (46 / 220), were found at relatively low densities (3 - 11 /km 2) and fed on up to 15 times more frequently than expected by their relative density. Wildebeest, zebra, impala and Thomson’s gazelle, found at the highest densities, were never identified in bloodmeals. Commonly identified hosts for G. pallidipes were buffalo (26 / 46), giraffe (9 / 46) and elephant (5 / 46). Conclusions: This study {{is the first to}} quantify tsetse host range by molecular analysis of tsetse diet with simultaneous assessment of host density in a wilderness area. Although G. swynnertoni and G. pallidipes can feed on a range of species, they are highly selective. Many host species are rarely fed on, despite being present in areas where tsetse are abundant. These feeding patterns, along with the ability of key host species to maintain and transmit T. b. rhodesiense, drive the epidemiology of rHAT in wilderness areas...|$|R
40|$|Diminazene {{aceturate}} {{is one of}} {{a limited}} number of drugs currently being used in animals to treat the <b>tsetse</b> fly-transmitted protozoal <b>disease,</b> African trypanosomiasis. Efficacy of the drug at the recommended single IM administered doses of 3. 5 and 7. 0 mg/kg of body weight is widely acknowledged. However, resistance to the drug at these dosages has been reported. Although the mechanisms of resistance to diminazene are poorly understood, field and experimental data indicate that it may develop naturally through administration of subcurative doses, or as a result of cross-resistance. Evidence from other experimental studies indicates that there are additional mechanisms by which trypanosomes may develop resistance to diminazene aceturate. For instance, some populations ot Trypanosoma brucei and T. vivax are refractory to treatment because of their ability to invade the CNS, a site that is believed to be poorly accessible to diminazene. Furthermore, in recent studies carried out in goats, it has been documented that the ability of T. Congolense IL 3274 to survive treatment with diminazene depends on the stage of infection when treatment is administered; populations of the parasite reappeared in animals that were treated on day 19 after tsetse fly challenge, whereas all goats were cured when treated on day 1 of infection. Because trypanosomes are confined to the skin on day 1 after infection, but thereafter invade the blood circulation, {{it is possible that the}} efficacy of the treatment on day 1 is attributable to exposure of the small number of parasites, relative to later stages of infection, to higher concentrations of drug than those attained in blood. The objective of the study reported here was to determine whether diminazene's pharmacokinetics differ between plasma and lymph draining the skin of goats and therefore account for the variation in therapeutic activity of the drug at different stages of a tsetse fly-transmitted infection.

40|$|A key {{constraint}} {{for development}} of many East African agro-pastoral communities is African animal trypanosomiasis or nagana caused by Trypanosoma spp. and vectored by species of tsetse flies (Glossina spp.). Suppression of trypanosomiasis through trapping of tsetse fly populations was conducted from 1995 to 2005 at and near Luke, Southwest Ethiopia. Odor baited mass trapping technology was used to suppress adult fly populations to very low levels while tryponocidal drugs were used to treat trypanosome infections in cattle. Data on ecological, economic and social variables were collected and analyzed {{in the context of}} eco-social dynamics in the community. The bio-economic model of Regev et al. [Regev, U., Gutierrez, A. P., Schreiber, S. J., Zilberman, D., 1998. Biological and Economic Foundations of Renewable Resource Exploitation. Ecological Economics 26, 227 - 242] and Gutierrez and Regev [Gutierrez, A. P., Regev, U., 2005. The bioeconomics of tritrophic systems: applications to invasive species. Ecological Economics 52, 382 - 396] was used as a methodological framework for qualitative evaluation of the effects of tsetse/trypanosomiasis suppression on ecological, economic and social aspects. An objective function for single farmers was formulated to determine the optimal harvesting level of cattle, exposed to high and low levels of risk from tsetse/trypanosomiasis, as measured by the discount rate ([delta]) for a given base level pastoral resource (RÂ =Â pasture or forage for cattle). The socially optimal objective function for resource exploitation by all farmers is that which maximizes the present value of utility of individuals expending revenues (consumption) from the revenue stream in ways that enhance the quality of life and yet assures the persistence of the resource base over an infinite time horizon (i. e., renewable resource sustainability). The bio-economic model predicts that reducing risk ([delta]) from <b>tsetse</b> and <b>disease</b> increased the cattle populations and their marginal value. The model also predicts that the interaction of decreased [delta] and increased productivity ([theta]) can lead to increased human and cattle populations and hence to over-exploitation of base resources (pastures) that lower environmental carrying capacity and reduced sustainability. Trap catches indicated that tsetse populations were reduced to very low levels, while the disease prevalence decreased from 29 % to 10 %. This led to a substantial increase in cattle including oxen populations, increased calving rates, increased milk production and increased the per-capita income. The availability of oxen allowed an increase in cultivated land from 12 Â ha in 1995 to 506 Â ha in 2005. Revenues (consumption) were invested in the purchase of more cattle and the establishment of a school for educating village children. Increases in land allocated to crops and other sources of income were also found. The bioeconomic model predicts the solution of the trypanosomiasis problems so transforms the East African agro-pastoral communities that new social structures will be required to cope with the ecological, economic and social consequences of this technological changes on sustainable development (sensu [Goodland, R., 1995.

40|$|Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT; {{sleeping}} sickness) is {{a highly}} neglected disease in sub-Saharan Africa caused by two subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense [1]. The parasites are introduced into the mammalian host by the bite of an infected <b>tsetse</b> fly. The <b>disease</b> progresses from a haemolymphatic first stage, during which the parasites {{are found in the}} bloodstream, to a meningoencephalitic second stage, on which the parasites enter the central nervous system (CNS), giving rise to the classic symptoms of HAT such as dementia, epileptic attacks, coma, and, if left untreated, death. At the moment, there are five treatments available, although none of them are satisfactory, due to toxicity, treatment failures, and the requirement for parenteral administration that is inappropriate in a rural African setting [2]. Among the five licensed drugs, two are used against stage 1 disease, pentamidine and suramin, whereas against stage 2 disease melarsoprol, eflornithine and a combination of nifurtimox/eflornithine (NECT) can be used. Beyond these issues the lack of a single agent that is effective against both species and both stages leads to the requirement that speciation and staging remain critical aspects of diagnosis, and the therapy must be performed under the difficulty of rural community hospitals. This scenario requires the development of new small molecules aiming at both prevention and control of these parasite infections, since T. brucei has a number of novel metabolic pathways and unusual biological features that are under study for their potential in drug discovery programs. The chemistry of hydrazone-containing compounds is particularly intriguing because of its capability to easily furnish valuable chemotherapeutics such as anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiprotozoal agents as well as enzyme inhibitors. In continuation of our search for bioactive small molecules, we investigated if the 4 -acyl- 5 -pyrazolone-based hydrazone scaffold would generate novel templates which are likely to exhibit anti-T. brucei activity.

In addition cross-section surveys were carried out in Zanzibar (Tanzania), a former HAT-endemic island (n= 50) and in Kasongo (the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC), a current HAT-infected area (n= 50). Clinical experience was obtained in different health care centers and hospitals in Kinshasa (DRC) and Kasongo (DRC). We interviewed people on all levels working with HAT. E. g the health minister of Maniema, the leader of the Belgium partner (BTC-CTB) and mobile team workers in Kinshasa, and remote Kasongo. Results and principal findings: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) still poses a major problem in the remote and poorest parts of Africa. The lack of vaccine and prophylaxis against HAT makes it even more important with sufficient prevention and control programs. The disease is caused by the parasite of the species Trypanosoma brucei. Its vector is the <b>tsetse</b> fly. The <b>disease</b> is divided into two stages, separated by whether trypanosomes are present in the central nervous system or not. The first stage presents a fever illness. The second stage presents several of neurological symptoms, such as sleeping disorder. The clinical feature alone is insufficient to set the diagnosis, and the diagnostic tools presented today do not show enough accuracy. The treatment of late stage HAT has severe side effects. The last 60 years has only seen one new drug for HAT. We found the awareness of HAT in Zanzibar to be limited to 30 %. In Kasongo 78 % of the population were found to have knowledge of HAT. Among those who had knowledge, only 32 % knew that the tsetse fly was the transmitter. Conclusion: As the incidence of HAT is decreasing, so is the attention. HAT may well go from being a neglected disease to an ignored disease. Thus we cannot rule out the possibility of a new outbreak. To prevent an increase of HAT, or even a new epidemic, it is of great importance to maintain the prevention and control programs. The development of more specific diagnosis and staging tools is urgent. The Holy Grail will be the development of a vaccine, though there {{is still a long way}} to go...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tsetse</b> {{transmitted}} fatal <b>disease</b> of humans, sleeping sickness, {{is caused}} by two morphologically identical subspecies of the parasite T. brucei; T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense. Current distributions of the two forms of disease are not known to overlap in any area, and Uganda {{is the only country}} with transmission of both. The distribution of Rhodesian sleeping sickness in Uganda has expanded in recent years, with five districts newly affected since 1998. This movement has narrowed the gap between Rhodesian and Gambian sleeping sickness endemic areas, heightening concerns over a potential future overlap which would greatly complicate the diagnosis and treatment of the two diseases. An improved understanding of the social, environmental and climatic determinants of the distribution of Rhodesian sleeping sickness is required to allow more effective targeting of control measures and to prevent further spread and possible concurrence with Gambian sleeping sickness. The work presented in this thesis investigates the drivers of the distribution and spread of Rhodesian sleeping sickness in districts of central and eastern Uganda which form part of the recent disease focus extension. The spatial distribution of Rhodesian sleeping sickness was examined in Kaberamaido and Dokolo districts where the disease was first reported in 2004, using three different methodologies. A traditional one-step logistic regression analysis of disease prevalence was compared with a two-step hierarchical logistic regression analysis. The two-step method included the analysis of disease occurrence followed by the analysis of disease prevalence in areas with a high predicted probability of occurrence. These two methods were compared in terms of their predictive accuracy. The incorporation of a stochastic spatial effect to model the residual spatial autocorrelation was carried out using a Bayesian geostatistical approach. The geostatistical analysis was compared with the non-spatial models to assess the importance of spatial autocorrelation, to establish which method had the highest predictive accuracy and to establish which factors were the most significant in terms of the disease’s distribution. Links between Rhodesian sleeping sickness and landcover in Soroti district were also assessed using a matched case-control study design. Temporal trends in these relationships were observed using an annually stratified analysis to allow an exploration of the disease’s dispersion following its introduction to a previously unaffected area. This work expands on previous research that demonstrated the source of infection in this area to be the movement of untreated livestock from endemic areas through a local livestock market. With regards to the comparison of regression frameworks, the two-step regression compared favourably with the traditional one-step regression, but the Bayesian geostatistical analysis outperformed both in terms of predictive accuracy. Each of these regression methods highlighted the importance of distance to the closest livestock market on the distribution of Rhodesian sleeping sickness, indicating that the disease may have been introduced to this area via the movement of untreated cattle from endemic areas, despite the introduction of regulations requiring the treatment of livestock prior to sale. In addition, several other environmental and climatic variables were significantly associated with sleeping sickness occurrence and prevalence within the study area. The temporal stratification of the matched case-control analysis highlights the dispersion of sleeping sickness away from the point of introduction (livestock market) into more suitable areas; areas with higher proportions of seasonally flooding grassland, lower proportions of woodland and dense savannah and lower elevations. These findings relate to the habitat preferences of the predominant vector species in the study area; Glossina fuscipes fuscipes, which prefers riverine vegetation. The findings presented highlight the importance of the livestock reservoir as well as the climatic and environmental preferences of the tsetse fly vector for the introduction of Rhodesian sleeping sickness into previously unaffected areas, the subsequent spread of infection following an introduction and the equilibrium spatial distribution of the disease. By enhancing the knowledge base regarding the spatial determinants of the distribution of Rhodesian sleeping sickness within newly affected areas, future control efforts within Uganda may be better targeted to decrease prevalence and to prevent further spread of the disease.

40|$|Poverty {{and disease}} are bound {{together}} {{in rural communities}} of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) exacerbated by weak social services and conflict. The infectious disease burden in SSA combines the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and the 'big three' (malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis), so-called because they attract more global attention and hence funding. NTDs include human African trypanosomiasis (HAT or sleeping sickness), first noticed by the outside world during the slave trade era {{and later in the}} 2 -th century by widespread epidemics of <b>disease</b> across the <b>tsetse</b> fly belt. HAT describes two diseases: i) Gambian HAT caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is characteristically chronic with an infectious period lasting up to three years and ii) Rhodesian HAT caused by T. b. rhodesiense is an acute disease, killing its victim within weeks of infection. The two diseases are frequently considered together as both are transmitted by tsetse flies, the parasites are morphologically indistinguishable and the associated diseases are both fatal if left untreated. However, the two diseases are clinical, epidemiologically and geographical distinct, each requiring different control strategies. Under field conditions, where microscopy is the basic diagnostic tool, differentiation is simply by geographical location of the patient; the Great Rift Valley separates the Gambian disease present in West and Central Africa, from East and southern Africa's Rhodesian disease. Control strategies are also distinct; while the Belgian and French colonial strategies to control the disease were patient-centred, the British colonial powers in East Africa were motivated by the effect of <b>tsetse</b> borne <b>diseases</b> on animal health. Towards the end of the colonial ear, both types of disease were heading for elimination but during the immediate post-colonial era in the 1960 s, political instability compromised the rigid HAT control programs that had been put in place. For zoonotic Rhodesian sleeping sickness, complex tsetse control programmes proved difficult to maintain and to justify economically; for Gambian sleeping sickness the generalised breakdown of medical services allowed the disease to return, sometimes to devastating levels. The millennium development goals (MDGs) set out in 2000, highlighted specific challenges and opportunities for national and global development. HAT impacts national health goals of national development plans and MDGs and impedes rural development of SSA. NTDs were not addressed directly by MDGs but the World Health Organization (WHO) has reaffirmed its commitment not only to control of HAT but also to eliminate it as a public health problem by 2020. Currently there are 25 countries reporting HAT to WHO, and while the overall prevalence of HAT across Africa continues to fall, epidemics have been recorded, particularly from central Africa, South Sudan and Uganda. Uganda is uniquely, the only country affected by both T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense and until the present study, there was no evidence to suggest that the two parasite species co-existed in Uganda. The development of a new control paradigm for T. b. rhodesiese in South East Uganda has lowered the incidence of human infections and, more importantly, halted the northerly spread of this parasite. However, recurring epidemics in several established and new disease foci in central Uganda highlight the difficulties involved in eliminating this disease. The present study assesses past and present HAT control strategies centred on Dokolo, Kaberamaido and Soroti Districts located at the centre of Uganda. These districts are highly endemic for T. b. rodesiense, they represent the region of concern for overlap with T. b. gambiense foci in central Uganda, and are the current focus of the Stamp out Sleeping sickness control initiative. The point prevalence of T. brucei s. 1 in cattle reservoir from villages with (out) reported human disease located at specific distances to Otuboi, Chagwere and Ochero cattle markets, was evaluated before and six months after trypanocidal treatment, to assess the transferrable impact of zoonotic T. b. rhodesiense to the human population. Overall, the proportion of T. brucei s. 1 in cattle dropped significantly from 22 % at baseline to 9 % six months after trypanocide treatment (P < 0. 05, Chi-square + 17. 92, 95 % C. I. + 1. 71 to 4. 49). All villages located in sub-counties that received at least 80 % treatment coverage had a drop in T. brucei s. 1 prevalence from 30. 4 % (95 %, C. I + 22. 8 to 38. 0) before treatment was done, to 12. 9 % (95 %, C. I. + 7. 4 to 18. 4) six months after treatment. More specifically, impact on human infective T. b. rhodesiense was also halved. In fact only three cattle were detected with the parasite six months after treatment compared with six from those sampled as baseline. This study also utilises documented cases between 2009 and 2012 to assess the current HAT reporting system for monitoring and evaluating transmission dynamics of the disease. Using a questionnaire, capacity and preparedness of healthcare professionals to respond to disease epidemics was assessed. The point prevalence of sleeping sickness in the three districts in 2009 was determined by screening volunteers. Microscopic examinations detected trypanosomes in four volunteers (4 / 5311 or 0. 075 %) while PCR detected significantly more infections (24, p < 0. 001). Multiplex PCR showed that ten of the Trypanozoon infections were T. b. rhodesiense while nested PCR identified four infections as T. b. gamiense, indicating that the distribution of the two forms of sleeping sickness overlaps in Uganda. Second phase investigations followed up the PCR positive cases; these people were screened again, together with members of their homestead and the inhabitants of three neighbouring homes. Besides microscopy and PCR, study subjects were examined clinically for sleeping sickness and completed a questionnaire to assess community recognition of the disease. This extended screen revealed no new cases underlining the importance of stringent early screening that PCR techniques can provide. At local healthcare centres, 54 % of reported sleeping sickness cases were diagnosed only at the late stage, indicating a weakness in early diagnosis and hence early reporting. Interviews with local health workers also revealed weaknesses in recognition of clinical signs and a gap in diagnostic capacity. While records at treating hospitals remain a useful indicator for targeting active foci of infection, improvement in capacity to diagnose HAT at an early stage should contribute both to rural health and disease control strategies and also towards WHO's 2020 target of elimination of HAT...|$|R
40|$|African trypanosomiasis {{is caused}} by extra {{cellular}} parasitic protozoa that can be transmitted by the bite of a <b>tsetse</b> fly. The <b>disease</b> {{is caused by}} sub-species of Trypanosoma brucei, an extra-cellular eukaryotic flagellated parasite. There is no prophylactic chemotherapy or prospect of a vaccine and current treatment is inadequate. Drugs for late-stage disease are highly toxic. Livestock trypanosomiasis is caused by closely related Trypanosoma species. It has the greatest impact in sub-Saharan Africa, where the tsetse fly vector is common (WHO, 2002). The complication of genomics results and analysis caused a big shift of interest from genomics to proteomics. The main analytical tool used for protein separation in proteomics is two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DGE) (O'Farrell, 1975 and Fey and Larsen, 2001). This technique separates proteins according to their masses and charges. These independent attributes enables separation of thousands of proteins in a single run. Since numerous proteins of a whole cell (its 'proteome') connect the genotype with the phenotype, {{we set out to}} study the proteome of the bloodstream form in T brucei which are infectious and known to cause diseases in human and animals. Deviating protein patterns between the different stages could direct the attention to disease-specific proteins and genes, which might be involved in the expression of infection and cause of disease. After separation, most proteins can be identified by mass spectroscopy. In studies performed to identify specific proteins related to a given metabolic process or disease it is, however, much more efficient to detect and identify only differentiated protein groups of samples. In order to understand the molecular basis of the parasites differentiation, we were interested in characterization of specific proteins expressed in bloodstream forms. However, the vast evolutionary distance between trypanosomes and the higher eukaryotes presents significant problems with functional assignment based on sequence similarities, and frequently homologues cannot be identified with sufficient confidence to be informative. Direct identification of proteins in isolated organelles has the potential of providing robust functional insight and is a powerful approach for initial assignment. The cytoplasm protein fraction and membrane protein fraction of T. brucei were used in this work to analyse the protozoan proteomics. Proteomics is a rapidly developing technique, which allows the efficient isolation of multiple protein families and it is a valuable tool for global patterns of gene expression. It allows the studies of membrane as well as cytosolic proteins. The rapidly growing development of bioinformatics, for example the use of software's like The JVirGel will also transform the handling of the multitude of data accumulating in proteomic experiments. The JVirGel software creates and visualizes virtual two-dimensional (2 D) protein gels based on the migration behaviour of proteins in dependence of their theoretical molecular weights in combination with their calculated isoelectric points. Although, 9068 protein-coding genes and many pseudo genes have been identified, (science 2005) a number of potential new proteins are yet to be characterized. Analysis of T. brucei proteins using two-dimension gel electrophoresis, may offer prognostic analysis and information on disease mechanism. These results suggest the first step towards the generation of proteome profiles for use in future studies on protein expression, especially those accompanying the differentiation of the parasite. Comparison of the different stage-specific protein profiles will allow us to identify candidates as targets for drug action. Protein data using JVirGel software together with the provision of the complete genome sequence for T. brucei, the application of the genomic and post-genomic technologies should provide advances in the understanding of the biology of this parasite and the identification of key factors for virulence, drug resistance and infectivity. In this study the slender bloodstream form of T. brucei 221 were used because they are easy to grow in rats. These parasites can equally be cultivated at 37 °C to grow to a cell density of about 1 x 106 /ml. This approach allows the cultivation of high cell numbers without excessive expenditure of work and cost. I first had to establish a protocol for separating trypanosomal proteins by iso-electric focusing to produce a reference map for the first time. In this project, it was possible to identify many cytoplasmic and membrane proteins on the proteome-map of T. bruce. In proteomics the combination of the high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) is currently the method of choice for protein identification. More than 300 protein spots were detected on a silver-stained two-dimensional gel. Analysis of 50 spots among them those highly expressed when T. brucei when grown in the presence of arachidonic acid was carried out. The protein spots from gel were digested with trypsin in-gel digestion followed by subsequent MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in a process termed 'peptide mass fingerprinting'. Following a database search, 27 protein spots were identifield (belonging to different functional groups of proteins). 20 of the identified proteins are components of the main biological and cell regulation pathways located in T. brucei With this study, I established a partial data base and reference proteome map of the bloodstream form T. bruce. These data will facilitate further addition of information to T. brucei proteome, which may aid drug design in the treatment of patients with and control of trypanosomiasis and the control of infection. Future research based on this dissertation should mainly focus in the identification of different proteins between the bloodstream forms, the procyclic forms and the short stumpy forms of T. brucei. Trypanosoma brucei ist die Ursache für die afrikanische Schlafkrankheit (Trypanosomiasis), welche hauptsächlich die ärmsten Teile der Bevölkerung in den Entwicklungsländern in Zentralafrika und der Subsahara-Region bedroht. Trypanosoma brucei hat einen Mechanismus entwickelt, um der Immunabwehr des Wirts zu entkommen, der auf der Antigenvariation der über Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-Anker verbundenen Oberflächenproteine beruht. Die Genexpression ist hauptsächlich auf post-transkriptioneller Ebene reguliert. Die vollständige Aufklärung dieses Organismus wurde immer wieder erschwert durch Herausforderungen technischer Art. Dennoch ermöglicht der Fortschritt verschiedener Disziplinen wie Genomik, Proteomik und der Erstellung und Analyse von 2 D-Gelen verbunden mit Methoden wie der matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) einen neuen Ansatz um schnell funktionelle Daten über Proteine zu bekommen. Im Gegensatz zu konventionellen biochemischen Ansätzen, die auf die Beobachtung einiger weniger Proteine abzielen, lässt sich durch proteomische Methoden die globale Proteinexpression im großen Maßstab untersuchen. Aus der direkten Messung der verschiedenen Proteinexpressionslevel lassen sich Rückschlüsse auf die Aktivität relevanter Proteine unter verschiedenen Bedingungen ziehen. Die Methoden der Proteomik bieten ein wichtiges Werkzeug um differentielle Expression von Proteinen während der verschiedenen Lebenscyclus-Phasen und verschiedenen Kulturbedingungen des Parasiten zu beobachten...|$|R
