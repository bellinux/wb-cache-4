40|$|The {{measurement}} of alcohol craving began with single-item scales. Multifactorial scales developed {{with the intention}} to capture more fully the phenomenon of craving. This study examines {{the construct validity of}} a multifactorial scale, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for heavy drinking (Y-BOCS-hd). The study compares its clinical utility with a single item visual-analogue craving scale. The study includes 212 alcohol dependent subjects (127 males, 75 females) undertaking an outpatient treatment program between 1999 - 2001. Subjects completed the Y-BOCS-hd and a single item visual-analogue scale, in addition to alcohol consumption and dependence severity measures. The Y-BOCS-hd had strong construct validity. Both the visual-analogue alcohol craving scale and Y-BOCS-hd were weakly associated with pretreatment dependence severity.

40|$|Tobacco harm {{reduction}} (THR) is {{the substitution of}} low-risk nicotine products for smoking, {{with the expectation that}} users will self-administer the substitute products for a long period as an alternative to smoking rather than a short-term bridge to <b>total</b> nicotine <b>abstinence</b> (see our website, TobaccoHarmReduction. org, for more information). A policy promoting THR contrasts with the standard abstinence-only approach to nicotine use that dominates discourse on the subject, where substitute products are encouraged only for very short term use for weaning the user off of nicotine entirely. Whether we should promote THR as a matter of public policy is the subject of contentious debate. However, the normative ethical arguments that are made in that debate are usually left implicit, are unexplored as if they are self-evident, and are overshadowed by discussions of empirical results and assertions, which are often presented as if they substitute for policy analysis.

40|$|Introduction: Sodium oxybate (SMO) {{has been}} shown to be safe and {{effective}} in the treatment of patients with alcohol use disorders (AUDs); it was approved in Italy and Austria for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and for relapse prevention. The focus of this review is to discuss the clinical evidence on the therapeutic potential of SMO for AUDs. Areas covered: This review covers the studies in patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome who received SMO for the treatment of withdrawal symptoms and the studies in patients with AUDs who received SMO to achieve <b>total</b> alcohol <b>abstinence,</b> reduction of alcohol intake, and relapse prevention. Relevant medical literature on SMO was identified by searching databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE (searches last updated 20 September 2013), bibliographies from published literature, clinical trial registries/databases, and websites. Expert opinion: SMO has proved safe and effective in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and in the prevention of relapses. Craving for and abuse of SMO have been reported, in particular in some subtypes of alcoholic patients, e. g., those affected by co-addiction and/or psychiatric comorbidity. Future multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trials should be useful to optimize the treatments in relation with patients' characteristics, for example, pharmacogenetic, neurobiological, and psychological...|$|R
25|$|It takes {{around five}} days of <b>total</b> <b>abstinence</b> to unmask a food or chemical, {{during the first week}} on an {{elimination}} diet withdrawal symptoms can occur but it takes at least two weeks to remove residual traces.

Withdrawals are often associated with a lowering of the threshold for sensitivity which assists in challenge testing, but in this period individuals can be ultra-sensitive even to food smells so care must be taken to avoid all exposures.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginnings}} of the temperance movement {{can be traced to}} 1828–29 in Maryhill and Greenock, when it was imported from America. By 1850 it had become a central theme in the missionary campaign to the working classes. A new wave of temperance societies included the United Order of Female Rechabites and the Independent Order of Good Templars, which arrived from the US in 1869 and within seven years had 1,100 branches in Scotland. The Salvation Army also placed an emphasis on sobriety. The Catholic Church had its own temperance movement, founding Catholic <b>Total</b> <b>Abstinence</b> Society in 1839. They made common cause with the Protestant societies, holding joint processions. Other religious-based organisations that expanded in this period included the Orange Order, which had 15,000 members in Glasgow by the 1890s. Freemasonry also made advances in the late nineteenth century, particularly among skilled artisans.|$|E
50|$|Plotinus (c. 204 - 270 AD) {{was a major}} philosopher of {{the ancient}} world who is widely {{considered}} the founder of Neo-Platonism (along with his teacher Ammonius Saccas). His metaphysical writings have inspired centuries of Pagan, Christian, Jewish, Islamic and Gnostic metaphysicians and mystics. About 150 years later, Saint Augustine (354-430 AD) was heavily influenced by the teaching of Plotinus. As {{one of the most important}} figures in the development of Western Christianity, St. Augustine strongly endorsed asceticism, which meant self-denial of worldly pleasure and <b>total</b> sexual <b>abstinence.</b> Eventually, this reached its peak in monasticism. Those pursuing a monastic life are usually called monks or brethren (brothers) if male, and nuns or sisters if female. While similar activities existed previously in pre-Christian times, early Christian monasticism attracted a large number of followers due to its enormous prestige and high social status in the period where the Roman Empire was near collapse. St. Augustine is one of the very few saints considered important not only by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox religions, but by many Protestants as well (including Martin Luther and John Calvin). Christian Naturists do not believe that monasticism, along with its clothing requirements and isolation, is how Jesus taught us to live. If asceticism is practiced, it begins by living nude.|$|R
40|$|Alcohol use {{disorders}} (AUDs) may {{be associated}} with several psychological and affective disorders. It is controversial, however, if these symptoms are a cause or rather a consequence of alcohol dependence. There are few data testing simultaneously psychosocial and affective disorders before and after a period of alcohol abstinence. The aim {{of this study was to}} perform multiple psychometric evaluations in alcohol-dependent patients before and after 12 weeks of abstinence. Twenty-five alcohol-dependent patients were included in the study. The following psychometric tests were administered at baseline (T 0) and after 12 weeks (T 1) : addiction severity index (ASI), brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), social behavior scale (SBS), Sheehan disability scale (DISS), aggression questionnaire (AQ). At T 1, 16 (64 %) patients were abstinent, 5 (20 %) patients dropped out and 4 (16 %) patients relapsed. Compared to T 0, patients totally abstinent at T 1 showed a significant reduction of the scores related to BPRS, BPRS-E and its subscales (except BPRS 5), ASI 1, ASI 2, ASI 3, ASI 6, ASI 7, BSM, AQ, DISS 1, DISS 2, DISS 3 (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). No significant changes in ASI 4, ASI 5, DISS 4, and DISS 5, BPRS 5 scores were found at T 1 compared to T 0. The present study indicates that <b>total</b> alcohol <b>abstinence</b> improves psychometric features, such as alcohol addiction severity, psychiatric rating, social behavior, aggressiveness, and disability. Larger controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) enhances treatment as usual (TAU) in improving treatment outcomes {{in patients with}} alcohol use disorder (AUD) and comorbid affective disorder. Fifty-two participants {{were included in the}} study, of whom 26 were patients with AUD and either depression or bipolar disorder treated with ACT group therapy in parallel with TAU (inpatient integrated treatment) and 26 were matched controls who had received TAU alone. Drinking and craving outcomes were <b>total</b> alcohol <b>abstinence,</b> cumulative abstinence duration (CAD) and Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) scores at 3 and 6 months postintervention. Affective and anxiety outcomes were Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores at these follow-ups. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in both groups. Retention rates were high: 100 % of the ACT group were followed up at 3 and 6 months; 92. 3 % and 84. 6 % of the TAU alone group were followed up at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Patients in the ACT group reported significantly higher CAD at 3 and 6 months, significantly lower BDI and BAI scores at 3 and 6 months, and significantly lower OCDS scores at 3 months, than those who received only TAU. No other significant differences in treatment outcomes were found between the groups. ACT provides added benefit to TAU in improving drinking, craving, depression and anxiety outcomes in patients with AUD and comorbid affective disorder. Most treatment improvements were sustained over a 6 -month follow-up period...|$|R
25|$|Throughout its history, the Church of the Nazarene has {{maintained}} a stance supporting <b>total</b> <b>abstinence</b> from alcohol and any other intoxicant, including cigarettes. Primary Nazarene founder Bresee {{was active in the}} Prohibition cause. Although this continues to be debated, the position remains in the church. While the church does not consider alcohol itself to be the cause of sin, it recognizes that intoxication and the like are a 'danger' to many people, both physically and spiritually. Historically, the Nazarene Church was founded in order to help the poor. Alcohol, gambling and the like, and their addictions, were cited as things that kept people poor. So in order to help the poor, as well as everyone else, Nazarenes have traditionally abstained from those things. Also, a person who is meant to serve an example to others should avoid the use of them, in order not to cause others to stray from their 'walk with God,' as that is considered a sin for both parties.|$|E

40|$|Alcohol {{dependence}} {{represents a}} chronic and relapsing disease affecting nearly 10 % {{of the general}} population both in the USA and in Europe, with a widespread burden of morbidity and mortality. Alcohol dependence represents {{the most common cause of}} liver damage in the Western world. Although alcoholic liver disease is associated primarily with heavy drinking, continued alcohol consumption, even in low doses after the onset of liver disease, increases the risk of severe consequences, including mortality. Consequently, the ideal treatment of patients affected by alcohol dependence and alcoholic liver disease should aim at achieving long-term <b>total</b> alcohol <b>abstinence</b> and preventing relapse. The aim of the present review is to provide an update on the management of alcohol dependence in patients with alcoholic liver disease. Increasing evidence suggests the usefulness of psychosocial interventions and medications combined in order to reduce alcohol intake, promote abstinence and prevent relapse in alcohol-dependent patients. Disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate have been approved for this indication; gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is approved in Italy and Austria. However, these drugs have not been tested in patients with advanced liver disease. Amongst other emerging pharmacotherapies for alcoholism, topiramate, ondansetron, and baclofen seem the most promising ones. Both topiramate and ondansetron have a safe profile in alcoholic patients; however, none of them has been tested in alcoholic patients with advanced liver disease. To date, baclofen represents the only anti-craving medication formally tested in a randomized clinical trial in alcoholic patients affected by liver cirrhosis, although additional confirmatory studies are warranted...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: New {{methods of}} ultra-rapid opiate {{detoxification}} (URD) under intravenous sedation {{have been criticized}} because of limited data on safety and long-term follow-up. Premedication with buprenorphine has been advocated to improve safety by decreasing vomiting. Prior research has not explored URD in socially impaired patients. METHOD: Sixteen patients were detoxified with URD and prospectively evaluated over at least 30 months. Data of this procedure were {{compared with those of}} our previous study without buprenorphine preparation (Drug Alcohol Depend. 52 (3) (1998) 243). The 16 patients were followed up by a general practitioner (GP) before and after URD. The GPs also supervised the 7 -day course of buprenorphine treatment prescribed for the 16 patients prior to URD. RESULTS: During the procedure, only one episode of vomiting occurred instead of 13 out of 20 in our previous study. Post-procedure, only two patients experienced moderate withdrawal symptoms, such as persistent nausea, abdominal cramps and vomiting lasting from 24 to 48 h, in comparison with most patients in the previous study without buprenorphine. After a period of at least 30 months (36. 0 +/- 6. 38), the 16 patients were still alive and were regularly monitored by their GP. Only two of the 16 never relapsed after URD and reported <b>total</b> opiate <b>abstinence.</b> Fourteen patients relapsed; 12 of these were prescribed a licensed methadone substitution program and two were still using heroin. CONCLUSION: In this small sample, the data indicated that URD with buprenorphine preparation was safe and that it markedly decreased post-procedure morbidity. No patient died over a minimum 30 -month follow-up period. Furthermore, the procedure was employed with socially impaired patients. In the long term, a few patients were still free of opiates, while the majority opted for a methadone maintenance program, showing that URD can serve as one possible step in a long-term treatment program...|$|R
40|$|Drinking {{continues}} to be a major problem {{in many parts of the}} world. Significant effects on testicular morphology and function in animals as well as man have been well described. To further explore the impact of chronic ethanol exposure on the testes, we designed this study specifically to define whether or not there was complete recovery after abstinence by examining reproductive hormones, testicular histomorphometry, testicular antioxidants as well as semen parameters after ethanol exposure. Sexually mature male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, abstinent and non-abstinent groups. Alcohol was administered orally at 7  ml/kg body weight per day thrice in a week for 2, 4 and 8  weeks. Control animals received an equivalent amount of distilled water. Histological analysis of the seminiferous tubules of the animals in the non-abstinent group showed severe reduction of cells of the spermatogenic series, hypocellularity, tubular atrophy and significant reductions in the tubular diameter and cross-sectional areas (p <  0. 001). Testicular weight, sperm count and motility, were also significantly reduced (p <  0. 001) while testicular malondialdehyde (tMDA) levels increased significantly (p <  0. 001). Hormonal assay showed significant reductions in the levels of testosterone (TT) (p <  0. 05) while luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) remained unchanged. In the recovery or abstinent groups (group III), despite weeks of abstinence from alcohol, the groups still demonstrated high levels of tMDA, low sperm count and motility and significantly reduced (p <  0. 001) testicular diameter and cross sectional area values. However, increased TT levels and non-severe reduction in the seminiferous epithelium observed in these groups showed signs of epithelial regeneration and probable recovery tendencies. In conclusion, the present study shows that <b>total</b> alcohol <b>abstinence</b> following chronic ethanol administration failed to reverse completely alcohol-induced testicular damage...|$|R
