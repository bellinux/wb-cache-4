I was intended to carry between 23 and 30 aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and torpedo-bombers.|$|E

Aided by spotter aircraft from <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> , New Jersey engaged enemy targets, setting several enemy positions on fire and sealing one cave. On 14 October New Jersey shifted her gunfire to the coastal artillery sites on Hon Matt Island, destroying one battery on the island.|$|E

5|$|Goble {{suffered}} from hypertensive cerebrovascular disease {{and died in}} Heidelberg, Victoria, on 24 July 1948. He was cremated, leaving his wife Kathleen, and three sons.

Goble Street in Hughes, Australian Capital Territory, was named for Jimmy Goble. In 1994 he and Ivor McIntyre were honoured with the issue of a postage stamp by Australia Post, in a series depicting Australian aviators that also included Freda Thompson, Lawrence Hargrave, and Sir Keith and Sir Ross Macpherson Smith.|$|E
5|$|In Australian {{service the}} A-4Gs formed {{part of the}} air group of <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> , and were {{primarily}} used to provide air defence for the fleet.

The Skyhawks did not see combat, and a planned deployment of some of their pilots to fight in the Vietnam War was cancelled before it took place. Ten A-4Gs were destroyed as a result of equipment failures and non-combat crashes during the type's service with the Navy, causing the deaths of two pilots.|$|E

After receiving his master's degree he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School from June 1993 to June 1994.

In early October of that year, the carrier {{departed}} Japan {{to take part}} in the Guadalcanal Campaign. On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which were attempting to attack targets on Guadalcanal. American Grumman F4F Wildcats attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at Rekata Bay on Santa Isabel Island, and Harada had to dig himself out from underneath the wreckage of his plane with his bare hands. Harada was later returned to Japan on board a hospital ship.|$|E

5|$|On 6 March, Tirpitz, {{escorted by}} three destroyers, {{launched}} {{a raid on}} the British convoys to the Soviet Union. The Germans attempted to intercept convoys PQ-12 and QP-8, but the inclement weather prevented them from finding the convoys. The British located Tirpitz, and <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> Victorious launched a strike of twelve Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers. The aircraft were repulsed without having scored any hits on the German ships. Tirpitz and the destroyers were back in port by 12 March. The close call prompted Hitler to mandate that Tirpitz was not to attack another convoy unless its escorting aircraft carrier had been sunk or disabled.|$|E

5|$|Operation Leader was a {{successful}} air attack conducted by the United States Navy against German shipping {{in the vicinity of}} Bodø, Norway, on 4 October 1943, during World War II. The raid was executed by aircraft flying from <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> , which at the time was attached to the British Home Fleet. The American airmen located many German and Norwegian ships in this area, and are believed to have destroyed five and damaged another seven. Two German aircraft searching for the Allied fleet were shot down as well. Three American aircraft were destroyed in combat during the operation, and another crashed while landing.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier saw {{action in}} war again {{when it was}} {{deployed}} in the 1992–1995 conflict in Bosnia, part of the Yugoslav Wars. It launched raids on Serb forces and provided air-support for the international taskforce units conducting Operations Deny Flight and Deliberate Force against the Army of Republika Srpska. On 16 April 1994, a Sea Harrier of the 801 Naval Air Squadron, operating from <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> HMS Ark Royal, was brought down by a Igla-1 surface-to-air missile fired by the Army of Republika Srpska while attempting to bomb two Bosnian Serb tanks.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> II was a {{proposed}} conversion {{project for the}} incomplete French cruiser De Grasse. The ship was laid down in November 1938 and lay incomplete in the Arsenal de Lorient shipyard when Germany invaded France in May 1940. In 1942, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine decided to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary aircraft carrier with a capacity for twenty-three fighters and dive bombers. Work ceased in February 1943, however, due to concerns with the ship's design, a severe shortage of material and labor, {{and the threat of}} Allied bombing raids. The ship was eventually completed as an anti-aircraft cruiser in 1956 by the French Navy.|$|E
