Based on this discussion, this research was started at a tomato greenhouse with artificial lights to analyse {{the impact of this}} gap. To determine the effectiveness of this gap, the air <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> the <b>Ventilation</b> Jet was measured with an air flow measurement device, the air <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> the gap at the central path was determined using air velocity sensors and horizontal temperature differences were measured with wireless temperature sensors.

40|$|Displacement {{ventilation}} uses air supplied at a temperature, typically around 19 Â°C for offices, {{which is}} only slightly cooler than the design temperature of the occupied zone. This is a much higher temperature than used for conventional mixed <b>flow</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems and creates opportunities for using fresh-air based âfree cooling â for {{a large proportion of}} the year. Conventional displacement ventilation design practice suggests that the cooling capacity of displacement ventilation in commercial offices with normal floor to ceiling heights (up to 3 m) is limited to around 25 W/m 2. For this reason it is fairly common in the UK to specify chilled ceilings in conjunction with displacement ventilation to meet typical office heat loads. However, recent BRE research has shown that displacement ventilation on its own using appropriate diffusers can deal with heat loads of around 50 - 55 W/m 2 in typical office environments without causing thermal discomfort outside the outflow zone. This opens up the possibility of using fresh-air free cooling for large parts of the year.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} detail of thermal comfort studies, models need {{to represent the}} effects of spatial and temporal changes in conditions around the human body. Convection heat transfer varies significantly on the human body due to local airflow patterns. In many non-uniform flow scenarios different modes of convection show up depending on the airflow conditions. For example, <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> displacement <b>ventilation</b> or by mixing ventilation are commonly encountered in buildings and all result in substantially different convection regimes. Furthermore, the models are relevant {{for a number of}} areas such as automotive, aircraft and railway industries where local and dynamic effects under non-uniform conditions become significant. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop reduced order models that predict the convective heat transfer coefficients locally in non-uniform indoor flow conditions. The main aim of this research is to develop a reduced order model database that approximates the convective heat transfer coefficients (hc) of different body segments for typical indoor flow responses in multiple applications. Each application constitutes a definite structure in the database. This paper presents a first prototype of the developed reduced order database model where displacement <b>ventilation</b> <b>flow</b> regimes in rooms are detailed. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology is used to model airflow and heat transfer and also further to computationally evaluate the convective heat transfer coefficients for different body segments by temperature gradient analysis. In order to obtain local hc a parametric multi-segmented human manikin model with 48 body segments has been developed. Benchmark validations and regression models development are demonstrated through an example application, taken from the displacement ventilation structure. Finally, discussions and the applicability of the displacement ventilation subdomain models are detailed...|$|R
40|$|The prone {{position}} is increasingly {{used to improve}} arterial oxygenation in intensive care patients with severe acute respiratory failure. This beneficial response is well documented but {{our understanding of the}} responsible mechanisms remains incomplete, as does our knowledge of the effect of posture on lung function in healthy individuals. The overall aim of the present thesis is to further our understanding of the effect of posture and gravity on regional lung blood <b>flow</b> and <b>ventilation</b> in normal subjects breathing spontaneously. The current work included {{the development of a new}} quantitative SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) method using 113 mIn labeled macroaggregates and Technegas (99 mTc) to simultaneously estimate the distributions of blood <b>flow</b> and <b>ventilation</b> for the whole lung in humans. Both radiotracers remain fixed in the lung tissue after administration. In the first study of the thesis the multiple inert-gas elimination technique (MIGET) and whole lung respiratory gas exchange were used as physiological evaluations of the SPECT method. We validated the new SPECT method through a good agreement between measured and SPECT-predicted exchange of MIGET and respiratory gases in healthy volunteers. In the second and third study, prone and supine healthy volunteers were exposed to hypergravity using the human centrifuge at Karolinska Institutet. Five times normal gravity (5 G) caused arterial desaturation in both postures, but the effect was significantly less when prone. We also marked regional lung blood flow in both postures at 3 G. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that hypergravity caused a paradoxical redistribution of blood flow from dependent to non-dependent lung regions. In the final two studies, SPECT was used to explore the effect of posture on regional blood <b>flow</b> and <b>ventilation</b> at normal gravity. Images were obtained in both the prone and supine postures after radiotracer administration in either posture. Regardless of posture at administration, we found greater blood <b>flow</b> and <b>ventilation</b> to regions dependent at the time of imaging. The results suggest that the shift in lung tissue with a change in posture has a major effect on the imaged distributions. Images obtained in one position, after radiotracer administration in sitting upright, prone and supine postures, were used to compare gradients of blood <b>flow</b> and <b>ventilation</b> per alveolus between postures. In supine and prone postures, blood <b>flow</b> and <b>ventilation</b> were evenly distributed between cranial and caudal regions, while when upright both blood <b>flow</b> and <b>ventilation</b> were greater in caudal regions. Posture had little effect on the ventral-to-dorsal distribution of blood <b>flow,</b> while <b>ventilation</b> of dorsal regions was greater in the horizontal postures compared to the upright posture. We conclude that: The SPECT method can be used for simultaneous measurements of regional blood <b>flow</b> and <b>ventilation.</b> During hypergravity, lung function is better preserved when prone compared to when supine and redistribution of blood flow is not the primary cause of arterial desaturation at 3 G. Gravity redistributes regional blood <b>flow</b> and <b>ventilation</b> when upright, while the influence is less in the supine and prone postures. Moreover, a change in posture shifts lung tissue, which constitutes the main effect on imaged blood <b>flow</b> and <b>ventilation</b> distributions...|$|R
