5|$|Linguist Ekkehart Malotki {{challenged}} Whorf's {{analyses of}} Hopi temporal expressions and concepts with numerous examples how <b>the</b> <b>Hopi</b> language refers to time. Malotki argues that in <b>the</b> <b>Hopi</b> language {{the system of}} tenses consists of future and non-future and that the single difference between the three-tense system of European languages and <b>the</b> <b>Hopi</b> system, is that the latter combines past and present to form a single category.|$|E
5|$|Sapir also {{encouraged}} Whorf {{to continue his}} work on the historical and descriptive linguistics of Uto-Aztecan. Whorf published several articles on that topic in this period, some of them with G. L. Trager, who had become his close friend. Whorf took a special interest in <b>the</b> <b>Hopi</b> language and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village living in Manhattan, New York. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on <b>the</b> <b>Hopi</b> language, although in 1938 he took a short field trip to the village of Mishongnovi, on the Second Mesa of <b>the</b> <b>Hopi</b> Reservation in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Comprising a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{located in}} the arid and sparsely {{populated}} Four Corners region, the Chacoan cultural sites are fragile – concerns of erosion caused by tourists {{have led to the}} closure of Fajada Butte to the public. The sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by <b>the</b> <b>Hopi</b> and Pueblo people, who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from Chaco and their spiritual relationship to the land. Though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs, tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service to share their knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture.|$|E

50|$|Two main {{versions}} {{exist as}} to <b>the</b> <b>Hopi's</b> emergence into <b>the</b> present Fourth World.

The people then climbed up the reed into this world, emerging from the sipapu. The location of the sipapu is given as in the Grand Canyon.|$|R

5|$|Anthropomorphised ants {{have often}} been used in fables and children's stories to {{represent}} industriousness and cooperative effort. They also are mentioned in religious texts. In the Book of Proverbs in the Bible, ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation. Aesop did the same in his fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. In the Quran, Sulayman {{is said to have}} heard and understood an ant warning other ants to return home to avoid being accidentally crushed by Sulayman and his marching army. In parts of Africa, ants are considered to be the messengers of the deities. Some Native American mythology, such as <b>the</b> <b>Hopi</b> mythology, considers ants as the very first animals. Ant bites are often said to have curative properties. The sting of some species of Pseudomyrmex is claimed to give fever relief. Ant bites are used in the initiation ceremonies of some Amazon Indian cultures as a test of endurance.|$|E
5|$|These {{sedentary}} peoples heavily exploited their surroundings, practicing {{logging and}} harvesting of other resources {{on a large}} scale. The construction of irrigation canals {{may have led to}} a significant change in the morphology of many waterways in the Colorado River basin. Prior to human contact, rivers such as the Gila, Salt and Chaco were shallow perennial streams with low, vegetated banks and large floodplains. In time, flash floods caused significant downcutting on irrigation canals, which in turn led to the entrenchment of the original streams into arroyos, making agriculture difficult. A variety of methods were employed to combat these problems, including the construction of large dams, but when a megadrought hit the region in the 14thcentury A.D. the ancient civilizations of the Colorado River basin abruptly collapsed. Some Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley of central New Mexico and south-central Colorado, becoming the predecessors of <b>the</b> <b>Hopi,</b> Zuni, Laguna and Acoma people in western New Mexico. Many of the tribes that inhabited the Colorado River basin at the time of European contact were descended from Puebloan and Hohokam survivors, while others already had a long history of living in the region or migrated in from bordering lands.|$|E
