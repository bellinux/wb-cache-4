25|$|One {{model that}} {{estimates}} {{the properties of}} an electron gas at absolute zero in metals is the Fermi gas. The electrons, being Fermions, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> high typical velocities, even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is {{of the order of}} 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical equipartition theorem for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In {{the pure}} {{fighting}} art of SMR, {{the aim is}} to use the staff defeat an opponent armed with one or two swords. The staff is a flexible weapon and can be used in several ways. A practitioner can use the greater length of the staff to keep the opponent at a distance. It is also used, when applicable, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> close to the opponent and then to control the opponent's arms or hands. The staff {{can be used in a}} manner that enables the wielder to defeat the opponent without killing him. Common methods include controlling the opponent's hands, wrists, and other targets by using the staff to either strike, thrust or otherwise manipulate the target-areas. When applicable, more lethal strikes are aimed at the opponent's more vital areas such as the head, solar plexus and temples.|$|E

25|$|For instance, {{medicine}} is traditionally {{one of the}} most popular courses in Portugal, and therefore {{one of the most}} selective, with some of the highest rated secondary school top students competing with the best of the best for a place in a medicine course. Normally, a student who wants to attend the Medical School (Faculdade de Medicina) at one of the Portuguese public universities which exclusively offer this graduation course, has <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> high grades in the entrance exams (it may include exams in fields like chemistry, biology, and mathematics) and to have done an almost-brilliant secondary school course. Admission marks of the applicants admitted in medicine, are never less than 180 out of 200. Architecture, economics, a number of engineerings, dentistry, law, pharmacy, or veterinary medicine at most public universities, are, in general, another examples of courses which are traditionally the most selective or popular. In contrast with these, like in any other educational system in the world, there are many courses offered by private universities, polytechnic institutes, and public universities, where the entrance requirements are sharply below the average. There are also some courses with low or even no demand and condemned to be extinguished.|$|E
25|$|The {{return to}} {{democracy}} allowed Peruvians {{to choose among}} strongly left, strongly conservative, or middle-of-the-road parties. They chose Belaúnde and his party as the middle road, but it led nowhere. The Belaúnde government tried to return the economy to a more open system by reducing barriers to imports, implementing financial reforms intended to foster private markets, and reversing the statist orientation of the Velasco system. But the new approach {{never had a chance}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> far because of a series of macroeconomic problems. On one side, the government was rightly concerned about continuing inflation but made the mistake of focusing the explanation on monetary growth arising from the export surplus it inherited at the start. That position made it seem undesirable to continue trying to promote exports and desirable to raise domestic spending and imports. On the other side, President Belaúnde's personal and political objectives included using public investment actively to develop the interior of the country and to answer evident needs for improved infrastructure. Seeing the export surplus as the key macroeconomic source of imbalance, the government decided to eliminate it by removing import restrictions, slowing nominal devaluation to allow the real exchange rate to appreciate, and increasing government investment spending.|$|E
25|$|All Batavian {{activity}} during the main {{phase of the}} battle was therefore on the British right flank, by the Batavian left wing. Here Daendels deployed his forces in three lines, as the front was too narrow to deploy more than two battalions in line at a time. He first had Col. Crass attack with the 1st and 3rd battalions of the 5th Demi-brigade, supported by cavalry and two pieces of horse artillery under Capt. d'Anguerand. He was opposed by the British 3rd Brigade (now under command of Gen. Coote, as Gen. Pulteney had received a wound in the arm and been forced to leave the field). The British had only enough room to deploy one battalion in line {{and there was a}} threat that they would be outflanked near Groote Keeten, where the main action was fought. However, the Batavians were severely hampered by the terrain. The horses sometimes sank to their bellies into the dune sand and the artillery was constantly immobilized by the loose sand. Besides, the British gunboats were able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> close to the beach and supported the British infantry vigorously, whenever they got sight of the enemy though gaps in the dunes. This British naval gunfire wrought havoc on the Batavian troops.|$|E

[...] But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> messy!" [...] Once his deception was uncovered, Sam attempted to salvage his romantic relationship with Chrissie, but was unsuccessful.

500|$|The fact is, I used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> involved, six {{or seven}} years ago, and before that, in {{questions}} of taxonomy of genre, and in the idea—which is ultimately a political idea—that a given writer, perhaps me, could in some objective way alter or reorganize the boundaries between genres.... Nowadays, I've come to feel that talking about categories, about [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", about genre and their boundaries and the blurring of those boundaries, all consists only of an elaborate way to avoid actually discussing what moves and interests me about books—my own, and others'. What I like are books in their homely actuality—the insides of the books, the mysterious movements of characters and situations and the emotions that accompany those movements. The play of sentences, their infinite variety.|$|E

Kensit explained: [...] "there's a scuffle and he pins her {{against the wall and}} practically tries to rape her. He ends up dead. It's the way she deals with it — she coolly steps over his body and leaves. It turns out similar things have happened before." [...] Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a relationship with cardiothoracic registrar Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers). The situation soon escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now. But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> messy!"

500|$|Following its 1983 release, {{the game}} was ported to various Japanese {{personal}} computers. A Famicom port was then released in 1985 {{and was the first}} adventure game to be released on that platform. The Famicom version was also the first collaboration between Yuuji Horii and Koichi Nakamura of Chunsoft, before Dragon Quest. The Famicom version was programmed by Nakamura, who was 19 years old at the time. This version of Portopia changed the interface, adopting the command menu system that Horii created for the 1984 adventure game [...] Due to frustration with text-based entry, admitting he was never able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> far in adventure games because of it, Horii created a command menu system for Hokkaido, which was later used in the Famicom version of Portopia. Horii also noted that, for the Famicom versions of both Portopia and Hokkaido, he wanted to make them appealing to a more mature audience, beyond the Famicom's typical younger audience. He was also playing Wizardry at the time, inspiring him to include a 3D dungeon maze in the Famicom version of Portopia. The game was never released in the Western world, largely due to its mature content, involving themes such as murder, suicide, fraud, bankruptcy, interrogation beatings, drug dealings, and a strip club. The lack of a Western release prompted ROM hacking group DvD Translations to develop an unofficial translation of the Famicom version.|$|E

The Review also recognized FAU's business program by naming the College of Business to their list of [...] "Best 296 Business Schools" [...] for 2009. For 2011, Florida Atlantic was ranked 249th in the nation by Washington Monthly. The magazine based its rankings on the following three criteria: [...] "how well a university performs as an engine of social mobility (ideally helping the poor to get rich rather than the very rich <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very,</b> very rich), how well a university does in fostering scientific and humanistic research, and how well a university promotes an ethic of service to country."

Anthony Russo expanded, [...] "in a lot of ways [...] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist on that level. We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated.

2500|$|Director of {{photography}} Matt Gray said he approached Broadchurch {{as if it}} were a documentary film, rather than a television drama. Strong and Gray settled on a visual theory about [...] "an emotional and physical landscape". Their goal was to depict the physical landscape in a way that differed visually from the emotions they were trying to depict. To do this, fixed television cameras were used to photograph the geographical landscape (beaches, cliffs, the estate field behind the Latimer house, etc.) and for establishing shots of interiors. A Steadicam or hand-held camera was used when the episode needed to depict the emotional relationships between people. This allowed the cinematographer <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> close to the actors without interfering with their performances.|$|E
