40|$|The {{study of}} the {{regulation}} and cellular dynamics of receptor kinase signaling in plants is a rapidly evolving field that promises to give enormous insights into the molecular control of signal perception. In this study, we have analyzed {{the behavior of the}} L 1 -specific receptor kinase ARABIDOPSIS CRINKLY 4 (ACR 4) from Arabidopsis thaliana in planta and have shown it to be present in two distinct compartments within cells. These represent protein export bodies and a population of internalized vesicles. In parallel, deletion analysis has shown that a predicted b-propeller–forming extracellular domain is necessary for ACR 4 function. Nonfunctional ACR 4 variants with deletions or point mutations in this domain behave differently to wild-type fusion protein in that they are not internalized to the same extent. In addition, in contrast with functional ACR 4, which appears to be rapidly turned over, they are stabilized. Thus, for ACR 4, internalization and turnover are linked and depend on functionality, suggesting that ACR 4 signaling may be subject <b>to</b> <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> via internalization and degradation. The observed rapid turnover of ACR 4 sets it apart from other recently studied plant receptor kinases. Finally, ACR 4 kinase activity is not required for protein function, leading us to propose, by analogy to animal systems, that ACR 4 may hetero-oligomerize with a kinase-active partner during signaling. Plant and animal receptor kinases have distinct evolutionary origins. However, with other recent work, our study suggests that there has been considerable convergent evolution between mechanisms used to regulate their activity...|$|R

30|$|Chapter 7 gives {{a useful}} {{overview}} and synthesis of disease interactions in the Serengeti. The various zoonoses and multispecies host reservoirs of pathogens are seen primarily {{in terms of}} diseases being introduced into the Serengeti from the surrounding human (tuberculosis) and domestic animal populations (rabies; canine distemper virus; now-extinct rinderpest). It is a moot point {{as to whether the}} multispecies nature of these diseases acts <b>to</b> exacerbate or <b>damp</b> <b>down</b> transmission. Intriguingly, disease among top predators may allow higher infectious disease transmission among prey populations, with ultimately adverse effects. Chapter 8 looks at food webs and models the implications of change. To manage the complexities involved, the author focuses on key components: two top predators (lion, hyena), two major herbivore species (wildebeest, buffalo) and two components of the grasslands (long and short grass associations). Interestingly, it suggests that the eruption of the wildebeest population, despite the positive effects on the extent and rate of grassland production, may be driving a long-term decline of other grazers such as Thompson's gazelle and buffalo.|$|R

40|$|Thisisthe {{third of}} three {{companion}} papersthat summarize the theoretical and experimental work {{carried out to}} develop a prototype smart panel with 16 decentralized vibration control units for the reduction of sound transmission/radiation. In this paper the control effectiveness of the smart panel has been assessed experimentally by measuring, in a anechoic chamber, the reduction of its total sound power radiation when it is mounted on a Perspex box with very thick and rigid side walls. The panel has been excited either by the acoustic field produced by a loudspeaker placed in the Perspex box or directly by a point force generated with a shaker. The vibration averaged over the panel surface has also been measured with a laser vibrometer. Laser measurements have also been taken at some specific frequencies, {{in such a way}} as to highlight the spatial vibration of the panel with the 16 decentralized control units. The various tests carried out have shown that the 16 control units can produce good reductions of the radiated sound power and averaged vibratory field over the panel surface, particularly when the panel is excited by the shaker. Indeed, when the panel is excited by the shaker, reductions of the sound radiation were measured in all the third octave bands in the frequency range 0 – 5 kHz and it was found that there were at least seven bands with reductions between 5 and 8 dB. Also, the averaged vibration field over the panel surface was found <b>to</b> be completely <b>damped</b> <b>down</b> in a frequency range between 0 and 1 kHz with reductions of about 10 dB in correspondence to all resonance frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{ballistic}} {{and collective}} beam echoes with diffusion effects are investigated theoretically.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{implement}} a Power System Stabilizer (PSS) and incorporate it to a Generator to enhance its dynamic performance. When a generator is connected to a power system the rotor angle oscillations due to small load changes can be observed This is due to fact that once a generator is constructed the damping effect of it is fixed and it is unable to offer additional damping <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> <b>down</b> these rotor angle oscillations. The power system stabilizer (PSS) provides supplementary damping for low frequency rotor angle oscillations ranging from 0. 1 Hz to 3 Hz which covers local mode, Inter area mode and inter unit mode power system oscillations. Here the PSS output is fed back to the excitation system summing point <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> <b>down</b> rotor angle oscillations. // In general, small load changes in a power system cause rotor angle oscillations. In order <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> <b>down</b> these oscillations an electrical torque should be produced on the rotor shaft, in phase with the speed deviation. Power system stabilizer adds a closed loop auxiliary feedback signal to the reference voltage of Automatic voltage regulator (AVR) in proportion to either speed deviation, frequency deviation or power deviation. // Normally the terminal voltage of a generator is adjusted by the AVR after computing the difference between reference voltage and feedback terminal voltage. In my project the PSS is designed to operate as follows. A voltage signal {{in proportion to the}} frequency deviation caused by small load changes is first produced. This voltage signal which represents the frequency deviation is then added to the reference voltage of AVR. This in turn causes an electrical torque to be added on the rotor shaft to enhance the small signal stability performance. // The developed PSS consists of a High pass filter (HPF), a Zero crossing detector (ZCD), a Frequency to voltage conveitor (F/V), a Summer I and a Summer 2. The frequency deviation is filtered by using the HPF in order to block steady changes in frequency. The filtered signal is sent through the ZCD to maintain a constant amplitude signal to the F/V converter because it responds to amplitude of input signal. The output of F/V converter and the voltage corresponding to base load frequency which is injected separately using a Calibration instrument, are summed in summer 1 to obtain a voltage deviation corresponding to frequency deviation. The output of summer I and reference voltage of AVR are summed in summer^ and fed back to LM 723, which is the main control chip of the AVR. // In order to analyze the effect of PSS, following parameters were observed. 1 Output of frequency to voltage convertor 2 Generator Current 3 Induction Motor Current Finally two MATLAB routines are used to extract actual low frequency oscillations from observed signals. 1 A low pass filter is designed using ellip() and filter() functions and observed signals are filtered with a cutoff frequency of 3 Hz.

40|$|H. pylori {{infection}} {{leads to}} gastric inflammation, characterised histologically by surface epithelial degeneration and infiltration of the gastric mucosa by acute and chronic inflammatory cells. H. pylori adherence, {{the production of}} a vacuolating cytotoxin and bacterial enzymes all contribute to epithelial damage. Recruitment and activation of immune cells in the underlying mucosa involves H. pylori chemotaxins, epithelial-derived chemotactic peptides (chemokines) such as IL- 8 and GRO-a, and pro-inflammatory cytokines liberated by mononuclear phagocytes (TNFa, IL- 1 and IL- 6) as part of non-specific immunity.
