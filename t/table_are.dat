5|$|Heavy metals {{up to the}} {{vicinity}} of iron (in the periodic <b>table)</b> <b>are</b> largely made via stellar nucleosynthesis. In this process, lighter elements from hydrogen to silicon undergo successive fusion reactions inside stars, releasing light and heat and forming heavier elements with higher atomic numbers.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} rows of this <b>table</b> <b>are</b> straightforward. The {{homotopy}} groups πi(S0) of the 0-dimensional sphere are trivial for i > 0, because any base point preserving map from an i-sphere to a 0-sphere is a one-point mapping. Similarly, the homotopy groups πi(S1) of the 1-sphere are trivial for i > 1, because the universal covering space, R, which has the same higher homotopy groups, is contractible.|$|E
5|$|The rows of the <b>table</b> <b>are</b> called periods; {{the columns}} are called groups. Six groups have {{generally}} accepted names {{as well as}} numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18, the noble gases. The periodic table {{can be used to}} derive relationships between the properties of the elements, and predict the properties of new elements yet to be discovered or synthesized. The periodic table provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behaviour, and is widely used in chemistry and other sciences.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} sizes and styles of pool and billiard <b>tables.</b> Generally, <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> {{rectangles}} {{twice as long}} as they are wide. Most pool <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> known as 7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side. Full-size snooker and English billiard <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> 12 ft long on the longest side. Pool halls tend to have 9 ft tables and cater to the serious pool player. Pubs will typically use 7 ft <b>tables</b> which <b>are</b> often coin-operated. Formerly, 10 ft <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> common, but such <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> now considered antique collectors items; a few, usually from the late 19th century, can be found in pool halls from time to time. Ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games. The slates on modern carom <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> usually heated to stave off moisture and provide a consistent playing surface.|$|R

50|$|A <b>table</b> <b>is</b> a {{homogeneous}} collection of records, where each record {{has the same}} set of columns. Each <b>table</b> <b>is</b> identified by a table name, whose scope is local to the database in which the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> contained. The amount of disk space allocated to a table within a database is determined by a parameter given when the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> created with the CreateTable operation. Tables grow automatically in response to data creation.|$|R
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, {{is relatively small}} and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but {{the expansion of the}} Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing <b>table</b> <b>are</b> pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.|$|E
5|$|It {{is notable}} for a carved roof, with lions {{and a small}} cider barrel purportedly carved by the monks of Muchelney Abbey. Sir John Betjeman was also {{inspired}} by an inscription on the candelabra. The church is quite plain on the outside but inside {{is one of the}} finest wooden carved roofs in the county. It is shallow pitched with massive, richly decorated tie beams and short king posts. The whole area of the roof is divided into square carved panels set in the framework of the structural timbers which are decorated with carved bosses where they intersect. There are 640 panels each carved with the same quatrefoil design. In the triangular spaces above each beam are dragon-like beasts. It is said there are bullet holes in the timbers, caused by soldiers who camped in the church in 1646 before the Battle of Langport. The 17th century pulpit and altar <b>table</b> <b>are</b> Jacobean woodwork. There are five other churches in the town, including Catholic and Methodist groups.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>table</b> <b>are</b> {{various other}} pieces of {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E

5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in Ramadan where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or trays) of a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner <b>table</b> <b>are</b> bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food to provide for their neighbors and the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the four blocks of the long- or 32-column form of the {{periodic}} <b>table</b> <b>are</b> a series of linking or bridging groups of elements, located approximately between each block. These groups, like the metalloids, show properties in between, or that are a mixture of, groups to either side. Chemically, the group 3 elements, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium behave largely like the alkaline earth metals or, more generally, s block metals but {{have some of the}} physical properties of d block transition metals. Lutetium and lawrencium, {{at the end of the}} end of the f block, may constitute another linking or bridging group. Lutetium behaves chemically as a lanthanide but shows a mix of lanthanide and transition metal physical properties. Lawrencium, as an analogue of lutetium, would presumable display like characteristics. The coinage metals in group 11 (copper, silver, and gold) are chemically capable of acting as either transition metals or main group metals. The volatile group 12 metals, zinc, cadmium and mercury are sometimes regarded as linking the d block to the p block. Notionally they are d block elements but they have few transition metal properties and are more like their p block neighbors in group 13. The relatively inert noble gases, in group 18, bridge the most reactive groups of elements in the periodic table—the halogens in group 17 and the alkali metals in group 1.|$|E
