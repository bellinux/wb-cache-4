40|$|Among those {{individuals}} who habitually wear precision tints, reading speed can vary {{as a function of}} the chromaticity of the illuminating light. The reading speed decreases as the chromaticity departs from optimum, whether in saturation or in hue. When the distance in the CIE 1976 UCS diagram between the chromaticity of the illuminating light and that optimal for reading exceeds about 0. 08, the colour has little residual benefit. We attempt to answer two questions numerically: (1) how is reading speed affected by the variation in the colour provided by the tint under different lighting conditions? (2) how many different tints does an ophthalmic <b>tinting</b> <b>system</b> need to be able to provide? Analysis of 1000 recent prescriptions suggests that, for most, the variation in colour with illumination is sufficient to reduce, but not eliminate, the beneficial effects of the tints. The number of trial tints required by an ophthalmic <b>tinting</b> <b>system</b> is a power function of the degree of efficacy desired, and for an average efficacy> 95 % of optimum, the number of trial tints needs to exceed 1000. In practice this requirement can readily be achieved by combining trial lenses and by appropriate dyeing techniques...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the effectiveness of individual user performance for an extended sev-tutoring task in a time-shared computing facility. The investigation is an experimental case history of one individual (the author) following the TINT self-tutoring user manual from beginning to end in the SDC Q- 32 Time-sharing System at a Teletype console. (TINTis a user-oriented dialect of JO VIAL, an interpretive language adapted to time-sharing with many self-teaching features.) The methodology featured measurement of natural user behavior in which the user sewed as his own control in succes-sive console sessions. The sample included 1. 861 user input commands collected over I 8 hours at the teletypewriter terminal. The quantitative results revealed some evidence for systematic learning and reinforcement effects; there were progressive tendencies toward higher productivity and lower error rates with increasing TINT experience. The qualitative findings revealed that the numerous and diversified exercises facili-tated familiarity with the elementsand the varied services of the <b>TINT</b> <b>system.</b> The chief drawback was exclusive reliance of the tutoring method on literal reproduction of the text by the user at his console. The paper concludes with recommendations for more genuine interactive involvement between the user, the central system. and self-tutoring aids...|$|R
50|$|The main {{differences}} between the two are that the Caravelle was sold as an eight-passenger version, while the Combi was available as a nine-passenger version, the Caravelle was only painted in metallic colors, while the Combi was only available in non-metallic colors, and the Caravelle was fitted with an AM/FM stereo cassette sound <b>system,</b> <b>tinted</b> windows, velour upholstery, reading lights, mid and rear headrests, and wheel covers from the European T25 model.|$|R
50|$|His father John Bartholomew Senior {{started a}} cartographical {{establishment}} in Edinburgh,Scotland {{and he was}} educated in the work. He was subsequently assistant to the German geographer August Petermann, until in 1856 he took up the management of his father's firm. For this establishment, {{now known as the}} Edinburgh Geographical Institute, Bartholomew built up a reputation unsurpassed in Great Britain for the production of the finest cartographical work. Bartholomew was an in-house cartographer for George Philip.Bartholomew is best known for the development of colour contouring (or hypsometric <b>tints),</b> the <b>system</b> of representing altitudes on a graduated colour scale, with areas of high altitude in shades of brown and areas of low altitude in shades of green. He first showcased his colour contouring system at the Paris Exhibition of 1878; although it initially met with skepticism, it went on to become standard cartographical practice.|$|R
50|$|For the Sundance's first year, it was {{available}} in a single base model. For 1988, a higher-end RS model {{was available}}. The RS model, which stood for Rally Sport, came with standard features that included two-tone paint, fog lights, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. It was also available with a turbocharged 2.2L I4 engine, and other amenities like an Infinity sound <b>system,</b> <b>tinted</b> window glass, and dual power mirrors. For 1991, the base split into two distinct models: entry-level America and mid-level Highline, {{in addition to the}} high-end RS. The stripped-down America, had previously been offered for the Plymouth Horizon's final year in 1990.|$|R
50|$|In 1842 Alexander Keith Johnston (1804-1871) visited Gotha {{to discuss}} several {{projects}} with Perthes. These negotiation first {{resulted in the}} publication of the National Atlas of General Geography, which contained 4 maps by Berghaus. Though Berghaus deemed the commercial and scientific climate in England not ready for scientific maps Johnston persisted in wanting to publish a translation of the Physikalischer Atlas, on which he requested aid from Berghaus. With a letter of recommendation by von Humboldt in October 1844 Heinrich ‘Henry’ Lange joined Johnston in Edinburgh for this purpose. Petermann stayed behind in Gotha and became teacher in the 2nd course of Berghaus’ school. In April 1845 he followed Lange, who received him in his house in Edinburgh and acquainted him with the friends he had made. Together they made a tour through the Grampians, applying what they had learned by using barometers for height measurements and taking geological and botanical samples. Meanwhile, they also worked on the Johnston’s Physical atlas (Physical geography, illustrating in a series of original designs, the elementary facts of geology, hydrology, meteorology and natural history etc.) and several other cartographic publications.During his time in Edinburgh he may have come into contact with the publisher G.H. Swanston, for whom he constructed several maps for The Royal Illustrated Atlas, Of Modern Geography, 1st edition published in 27 parts 1854-62. and republished probably in 1872. He also may have met in Edinburgh with John Bartholomew Jr. (1831-1893), who created many maps in the same atlas. John Bartholomew became Petermann’s student in Gotha from 1855 till he was recalled to his father’s firm in 1856. The German school of cartography was pre-eminent, and four generations of Bartholomews widened their knowledge by studying with the German masters. John George’s son Ian studied in Leipzig (1907-8) with Oswald Winkel. His grandson John Christopher carried on the tradition, studying with Eduard Imhof, the great Swiss cartographer, in Berne and Zurich in 1960, and his son John Eric followed in 1977 with Imhof’s pupil, Ernst Spiess."Bartholomew is best known for the development of colour contouring (or hypsometric <b>tints),</b> the <b>system</b> of representing altitudes on a graduated colour scale, with areas of high altitude in shades of brown and areas of low altitude in shades of green. He first showcased his colour contouring system at the Paris Exhibition of 1878; although it initially met with skepticism, it went on to become standard cartographical practice". However, he might have picked up this idea during his time in Gotha as the colour scheme was first introduced by Emil von Sydow (1812-1873) in 1838 when he developed a color methodology for landscape features using hachures, where green was depicted for lowlands and brown used for highlands. The white for the higher reaches might later have been used by Hermann Haack (1872-1966) for his Perthes’ wall maps.Several maps have been co-constructions of Petermann and Bartholomew.|$|R
