5000|$|At <b>the</b> <b>gallop,</b> <b>the</b> horse {{breathes}} {{in rhythm}} with every stride: as the abdominal muscles pull the hind legs {{forward in the}} [...] "suspension phase" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>gallop,</b> <b>the</b> organs within the abdominal cavity are pushed backward from the diaphragm, thereby bringing air into the lungs and causing the horse to inhale. As the neck is lowered during the extended phase of <b>the</b> <b>gallop,</b> <b>the</b> hind legs move backward and the gut contents shift forwards, pushing into the diaphragm and forcing {{air out of the}} lungs.|$|R

40|$|It is pivotal {{to find an}} {{effective}} mathematical model revealing <b>the</b> <b>galloping</b> mechanism. And {{it is important to}} compare the difference between the existing mathematical models on <b>the</b> conductor <b>galloping.</b> In this paper, the continuum cable model for transmission lines was proposed using the Hamilton principle. Discrete models of one DOF, two DOFs, and three DOFs were derived from the continuum model by using the Garlekin method. And the three models were compared by analyzing <b>the</b> <b>galloping</b> vertical amplitude and torsional angle with different influence factors. The influence factors include wind velocity, flow density, span length, damping ratio, and initial tension. The three-DOF model is more accurate at calculating <b>the</b> <b>galloping</b> characteristics than <b>the</b> other two models, but the one-DOF and two-DOF models can also present <b>the</b> trend of <b>galloping</b> amplitude change from the point view of qualitative analysis. And the change of <b>the</b> <b>galloping</b> amplitude relative to the main factors was also obtained, which is very essential to the antigalloping design applied in the actual engineering...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{aeroelastic}} <b>galloping</b> of a cantilever with attached prism {{has recently}} {{attracted the attention}} of several researchers as a way to harvest energy from an airstream.
