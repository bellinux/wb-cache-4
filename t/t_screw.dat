40|$|Die wear, {{which is}} defined as a surface damage or removal of {{material}} from one or both of two solid surfaces in a sliding, rolling or impact motion relative to one another, is considered the main cause of tool failure. Wear is responsible for 70 % of tool failure and a potential source of high costs; as much as 30 % per forging unit in the forging industries [1]. This paper presents a unique wear prediction and measurement method for open die forging using a modified Archard equation, 3 D FE simulation (to represent the actual forging process precisely) and an industrial scale forging trial. The proposed tool and experimental design is aimed at facilitating a cost effective method of tool wear analysis and to establish a repeatable method of measurement. It creates a platform to test different type of lubricants and coatings on industrial scale environment. The forging trial was carried out using 2100 <b>T</b> Schuler <b>Screw</b> press. A full factorial experiment design was used on 3 D simulation to identify the process setting for creating a measurable amount of tool wear. Wear prediction of 28. 5 μm based on the simulation correlated with both Infinite Focus Optical Microscope and Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) measurement results of the practical trial. Thermal camera reading showed temperature raise on the area with maximum wear, which suggests that increase in contact time, causes thermal softening on tool steel. The measurement showed that abrasive wear and adhesive wear are dominant failure modes on the tool under these process conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOur {{objective}} was to describe the management and prevention of thoracic aortic injuries caused by a malposition of pedicle screws in corrective surgery of major spine deformities. Positioning pedicle screws in thoracic vertebras by posterior approach exposes {{to the risk of}} injury of the elements placed ahead of the thoracic spine, as the descending thoracic aorta. This complication can result in a cataclysmic bleeding, needing urgent vascular care, {{but it can also be}} totally asymptomatic, resulting in the long run in a pseudoaneurysm, justifying the systematic removal of the hardware. We report the case of a 76 -year-old woman who underwent spinal correction surgery for thoraco-lumbar degenerative kypho-scoliosis. Immediately after the surgery, a thoracic aortic injury caused by the left <b>T</b> 7 pedicle <b>screw</b> was diagnosed. The patient underwent a two-step surgery. The first step was realized by vascular surgeons and aimed to secure the aortic wall by short endovascular aortic grafting. During the second step, spine surgeons removed the responsible screw by posterior approach. The patient was discharged in a rehabilitation center 7 days after the second surgery. When such a complication occurs, a co-management by vascular and spine surgeons is necessary to avoid major complications. Endovascular management of this kind of vascular injuries permits to avoid an open surgery that have a great rate of morbi-mortality in frail patients. Nowadays, technologies exist to prevent this kind of event and may improve the security when positioning pedicle screws...|$|R

Preoperative axial magnetic resonace images (MRI) in 12 consecutive patients with right thoracic adolescent scoliosis, all with King type 3 curves, were analyzed {{in order to}} evaluate {{the relationship between the}} inserted pedicle screw position to pleura, spinal cord, aorta. Axial vertebral images for each thoracic level were scanned and the simulation of pedicle screw insertion was performed using a digital measurement programme. The angular contact value for each parameter regarding the pleura and spinal cord was measured {{on both sides of the}} curve. The aorta-vertebral distance was also measured. Aorta-vertebral distance was found to be decreasing gradually from the cephalad to the caudad with the shortest distance being measured at T 12 with a mean of 1. 2  mm. Concave-sided <b>screws</b> on <b>T</b> 5 –T 9 and convex-sided <b>screws</b> on <b>T</b> 2 –T 3 had the greatest risk to spinal cord injury.

40|$|Objective : Tomographic {{analysis}} of the T 1 vertebra in children from 0 to 12 years of age, {{in order to obtain}} anatomical parameters that assist intralaminar fixation in this pediatric population. Methods : Retrospectively {{analysis of}} the spine with CT (cervical and thoracic) of individuals aged between 0 and 12 years old, of both sexes, without anatomical deformities. The CT scans were evaluated separately, on each side, for length and thickness of the laminas as well as spinolaminar angle. The morphometric analysis was performed with iSite PACS Philips Healthcare Informatics(r) program and the values were expressed in millimeters (mm). The variables were correlated with age groups and sex of individuals. Statistical analysis was performed using t test and the results were considered significant when p< 0. 05. Results : By means of tomographic analysis of 24 patients it was found that age has no correlation with the angle of attack for intralaminar <b>screws</b> <b>T</b> 1. However, the length and thickness of the T 1 lamina increase proportionally with age. The total average length of the laminas was 28. 62 ± 4. 42 mm.

CBCT was performed before treatment (T 1), {{immediately after the}} stabilization of expander <b>screw</b> (<b>T</b> 2) and after the retention period of 6 months (T 3). The scans were managed in Dolphin Imaging® 11. 0 software, where landmarks (right and left condylion, right and left gonion, and menton) were positioned and measured in relation to sagittal, coronal and axial plane to verify, respectively, transverse, anteroposterior and vertical displacement of the mandible. Paired Student&# 8217;s t-test was used to identify significant differences (p< 0. 05) between T 1 and T 2, T 2 and T 3, and T 1 and T 3. After RME, right and left gonion moved downward (1. 11 mm and 0. 89 mm) and menton displaced downward (1. 90 mm) and backward (1. 50 mm). During the retention period, only anteroposterior displacement was significant, with {{the right and left}} gonion (0. 97 mm and 1. 26 mm) and the menton (2. 29 mm) moving forward. Three-dimensional assessment of the mandible in Class II Division 1 patients subjected to RME showed a transitory backward and downward mandibular positioning, without any lateral displacement.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} computer-assisted pedicle screw installation and its clinical benefit as compared with conventional pedicle screw installation techniques. MethodsTotal 176 thoracic pedicle screws placed in 42 thoracic fracture patients {{were involved in the}} study randomly, 20 patients under conventional fluoroscopic control (84 screws) and 22 patients had screw insertion under three dimensional (3 D) computer-assisted navigation (92 screws). The 2 groups were compared for accuracy of screw placement, time for screw insertion by postoperative thin-cut CT scans and statistical analysis by χ 2 test. The cortical perforations were then graded by 2 -mm increments: Grade I (good, no cortical perforation), Grade II (screw outside the pedicle 2 mm). ResultsIn computer assisted group, 88 (95. 65 %) were Grade I (good), 4 (4. 35 %) were Grade II (2 mm) violations. In conventional group, there were 14 cortical violations (16. 67 %), 70 (83. 33 %) were Grade I (good), 11 (13. 1 %) were Grade II (2 mm) violations (P< 0. 001). The number (19. 57 %) of upper thoracic pedicle <b>screws</b> (<b>T</b> 1 -T 4) inserted under 3 D computer-assisted navigation was significantly higher than that (3. 57 %) by conventional fluoroscopic control (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Aim Bacterial {{adherence}} to implants {{is considered to}} be an important event in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections. In fact, this infection process is a first stage of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis, and a positive correlation has been found between oral hygiene and marginal bone loss around implants in the edentulous mandible. Surface properties of transgingival implant components are important determinants in bacterial adhesion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize the biofilm formation, in vivo, on healing screws made of titanium alloy or coated with a combination of anatase and Bactercline® product. Materials and methods Twenty-five patients, between 21 - 37 years, in excellent systemic health, participated in this study. In each of the 25 participants, one anatase-Bactercline® coated healing <b>screw</b> (<b>Test)</b> and one titanium alloy (TI 6 Al 4 V) healing screw (Control) were adapted to two different implants. Quantitative and qualitative biofilm formation on healing abutments was analyzed by culture method. Results Bacterial {{adherence to}} the two different healing screws used in this study were compared. Statistically significant differences were found between the Control and the Test group for both aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts (p< 0, 05). The microflora consisted both of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and displayed a high variability. The anaerobic S. intermedius, potentially “pathogenic”, was isolated only from the Control group. Both healing screws harbored primarily Gram-positive rods as Actinomyces spp, A. naeslundii, A. viscosus and the Gram-negative rods (Fusobacterium spp, Prevotella spp, Capnocythophaga spp) were mostly found on the Control healing screws.

40|$|Pedicle screw {{fixation}} {{in the upper}} cervical spine is a difficult and high-risk procedure. The screw is difficult to place rapidly and accurately, {{and can lead to}} serious injury of spinal cord or vertebral artery. The aim {{of this study was to}} design an individualized 3 D printing navigation template for pedicle {{screw fixation}} in the upper cervical spine. Using CT thin slices data, we employed computer software to design the navigation template for pedicle screw fixation in the upper cervical spine (atlas and axis). The upper cervical spine models and navigation templates were produced by 3 D printer with equal proportion, two sets for each case. In one set (<b>Test</b> group), pedicle <b>screws</b> fixation were guided by the navigation template; in the second set (Control group), the screws were fixed under fluoroscopy. According to the degree of pedicle cortex perforation and whether the screw needed to be refitted, the fixation effects were divided into 3 types: Type I, screw is fully located within the vertebral pedicle; Type II, degree of pedicle cortex perforation is 1 mm or with the poor internal fixation stability and in need of renovation. Type I and Type II were acceptable placements; Type III placements were unacceptable. A total of 19 upper cervical spine and 19 navigation templates were printed, and 37 pedicle screws were fixed in each group. Type I screw-placements in the test group totaled 32; Type II totaled 3; and Type III totaled 2; with an acceptable rate of 94. 60 %. Type I screw placements in the control group totaled 23; Type II totaled 3; and Type III totaled 11, with an acceptable rate of 70. 27 %. The acceptability rate in test group was higher than the rate in control group. The operation time and fluoroscopic frequency for each screw were decreased, compared with control group.

40|$|This is an {{experimental}} study on human cadaver spines. The {{objective of this}} study is to compare the pullout forces between three screw augmentation methods and two different screw designs. Surgical interventions of patients with osteoporosis increase following the epidemiological development. Biomechanically the pedicle provides the strongest screw fixation in healthy bone, whereas in osteoporosis all areas of the vertebra are affected by the disease. This explains the high screw failure rates in those patients. Therefore PMMA augmentation of screws is often mandatory. This study involved investigation of the pullout forces of augmented transpedicular screws in five human lumbar spines (L 1 –L 4). Each spine was treated with four different methods: non-augmented unperforated (solid) screw, perforated screw with vertebroplasty augmentation, solid screw with vertebroplasty augmentation and solid screw with balloon kyphoplasty augmentation. Screws were augmented with Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The pullout forces were measured for each treatment with an Instron testing device. The bone mineral density was measured for each vertebra with Micro-CT. The statistical analysis was performed with a two-sided independent student <b>t</b> test. Forty <b>screws</b> (10 per group and level) were inserted. The vertebroplasty-augmented screws showed a significant higher pullout force (mean 918. 5  N, P =  0. 001) than control (mean 51  N), the balloon kyphoplasty group did not improve the pullout force significantly (mean 781  N, P >  0. 05). However, leakage occurred in some cases treated with perforated screws. All spines showed osteoporosis on Micro-CT. Vertebroplasty-augmented screws, augmentation of perforated screws and balloon kyphoplasty augmented screws show higher pullout resistance than non-augmented screws. Significant higher pullout forces were only reached in the vertebroplasty augmented vertebra. The perforated screw design led to epidural leakage due to the position of the perforation in the screw. The position of the most proximal perforation is critical, depending on screw design and proper insertion depth. Nevertheless, using a properly designed perforated screw will facilitate augmentation and instrumentation in osteoporotic spines...|$|R
40|$|Summary of Background Data: Multilevel {{posterior}} cervical instrumented fusions {{are becoming}} more prevalent in current practice. Biomechanical characteristics of the cervicothoracic junction may necessitate extending the construct to upper thoracic segments. However, fixation in upper thoracic spine can be technically demanding owing to transitional anatomy while suboptimal placement facilitates vascular and neurologic complications. Thoracic instrumentation methods include free-hand, fluoroscopic guidance, and CT-based image guidance. However, fluoroscopy of upper thoracic spine is challenging secondary to vertebral geometry and patient positioning, while image-guided systems present substantial financial commitment and are not readily available at most centers. Additionally, imaging modalities increase radiation exposure to the patient and surgeon while potentially lengthening surgical time. Materials and Methods: Retrospective review of 44 consecutive patients undergoing a cervicothoracic fusion by a single surgeon using the novel free-hand <b>T</b> 1 pedicle <b>screw</b> technique between June 2009 and November 2012. A starting point medial and cephalad to classic entry {{as well as new}} trajectory were utilized. No imaging modalities were employed during screw insertion. Postoperative CT scans were obtained on day 1. Screw accuracy was independently evaluated according to the Heary classification. Results: In total, 87 pedicle screws placed were at T 1. Grade 1 placement occurred in 72 (82. 8 %) screws, Grade 2 in 4 (4. 6 %) screws and Grade 3 in 9 (10. 3 %) screws. All Grade 2 and 3 breaches were < 2 mm except one Grade 3 screw breaching 2 - 4 mm laterally. Only two screws (2. 3 %) were noted to be Grade 4, both breaching medially by less than 2 mm. No new neurological deficits or returns to operating room took place postoperatively. Conclusions: This modification of the traditional starting point and trajectory at T 1 is safe and effective. It attenuates additional bone removal or imaging modalities while maintaining a high rate of successful screw placement compared to historical controls...|$|R

Fortunately, neurologic injury associated with pedicle screw malposition is rare. Case presentationA 19 -year-old boy was surgically treated for severe right thoracic scoliosis associated with a Chiari Type 1 malformation and a C 6 to T 7 syringomyelia. Six months after the initial surgery, the patient was referred to our institution after three weeks of gait disturbances and repeated falls. Imaging showed the gross misplacement of the left <b>T</b> 5 pedicle <b>screw,</b> which crossed {{the center of the}} vertebral canal. The initial surgery used a freehand technique of pedicle screw insertion, with anteroposterior and lateral postoperative X-ray control. During the surgery, no SEP modifications were noted during pedicle screw placement. However, after insertion of the second rod and scoliosis correction by posterior translation technique, SEP responses decreased considerably. Revision surgery was performed to remove the misplaced screw. During the first three months after screw removal, repeated clinical examinations showed progressive recovery of the neurological deficits. Gait and bladder functions were normal six months after screw removal, and clinical signs of spasticity disappeared. SEP explorations performed at final follow-up showed similar responses to those performed before the initial surgery for scoliosis correctionDiscussion and evaluationNeurologic injury associated with pedicle screw malposition is rare. In early or delayed neurological status worsening, intraoperative or postoperative imaging must be done to detect pedicle screw misplacement. In the current case, thanks to cobalt-chromium and titanium use, MRI and CT scan allowed good visualization of the spinal canal and spinal cord. Experimental studies have shown that neurophysiological monitoring of the spinal cord does not detect moderate compression. In that way, neurophysiological monitoring is an all-or-nothing technique which can misdiagnose early stage of spinal cord injuries. Major penetration of the spinal canal by pedicle screw may conduct to hardware removal.
