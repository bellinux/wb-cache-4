50|$|Although {{the names}} for {{operating}} mode may differ, WAFs are basically deployed inline {{in three different}} ways. According to NSS Labs, deployment options are transparent bridge, transparent reverse proxy, and reverse proxy. 'Transparent' refers {{to the fact that}} the HTTP <b>traffic</b> is <b>sent</b> straight to the web application, therefore the WAF is transparent between the client and server. This is in contrast to reverse proxy, where the WAF acts as a proxy and the client’s <b>traffic</b> is <b>sent</b> directly to the WAF. The WAF then separately sends filtered traffic to web applications. This can provide additional benefits such as IP masking but may introduce disadvantages such as performance latency.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1999, Inktomi CEO David Peterschmidt {{said that}} Inktomi {{would become an}} [...] "arms merchant" [...] to {{a growing number of}} Content Delivery Network (CDN) service providers. Merchants paid Inktomi a {{percentage}} of sales and/or a cost per click for <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> to their websites, a model that later became known as pay per click and was perfected by Google and Yahoo! Search Marketing.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, the Army Signal Intelligence Service (later the Army Security Agency) began intercepting Soviet {{intelligence}} <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> {{mainly from}} New York City—assigning the code name Venona to the project. By 1945, some 200,000 messages had been transcribed, {{a measure of}} Soviet activity. On 20 December 1946, Meredith Gardner made the first break into the Venona code, revealing the existence of Soviet espionage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.|$|E
50|$|Operational {{tasks of}} the {{intercept}} stations were assigned {{based on the}} metrics: geographical location, their size and equipment {{and the quality of}} reception in the short, medium and long wave band. Interest was focused not only on normal tactical targets (<b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> from enemy ship maneuvers or training), but radio traffic dealing with orders and reports Main Intercept Station Navy Radio South was eventually created, placed under a commanding officer and consisted of 3 Bereich.|$|E
50|$|The mineral <b>traffic</b> is <b>sent</b> {{down the}} {{inclines}} in trucks, without {{the assistance of}} a locomotive engine in front; but all the passenger traffic and the goods traffic proceeding from Rawyards to Airdrie is preceded by a locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Active {{networking}} places computation within packets {{traveling through}} the network. Software-defined networking decouples the system that makes decisions about where <b>traffic</b> is <b>sent</b> (the control plane) from the underlying systems that forward traffic to the selected destination (the data plane).|$|R
50|$|December: During the Melbourne Olympic Games, {{a record}} amount of <b>traffic</b> was <b>sent</b> over Australia's {{international}} telecommunications channels. 9,408,254 words were sent over 22 leased channels which operated for some 5465 hours. 6730 radiotelephone calls were handled and 2296 phototelegrams were sent. 285 hours of radio broadcasts were sent over R/T channels.|$|R
50|$|Adams {{founded a}} nonprofit {{telecommunications}} company, UUNET Communications Service, {{to reduce the}} cost of mail and Usenet <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> by UUCP, particularly for rural sites in America. (UUNET was founded with a $50,000 loan from the USENIX Association, which was subsequently repaid.) UUNET became an official gateway between UUCP mail and Internet email, as well as between North America and Europe. It hosted many related services, such as Internet FTP access for its UUCP clients and the comp.sources.unix archives.|$|E
50|$|OKW/Chi ran two {{distinct}} interception networks, which included legacy systems from previous agencies. One system concentrated on diplomatic messages sent in Morse code and most messages were encrypted and received from enemy and neutral states. Messages {{picked up on}} this system were sent to OKW/Chi for decipherment. The second network's mission was to monitor foreign news broadcasts, with all <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> in clear text, and included such news agencies as Reuters, and Domei. The second system was also used to testing of new or special equipment.|$|E

50|$|If a link becomes {{saturated}} to {{the point}} where there is a significant level of contention (either upstream or downstream) latency can rise substantially. Traffic shaping can be used to prevent this from occurring and keep latency in check. Traffic shaping provides a means to control the volume of <b>traffic</b> being <b>sent</b> into a network in a specified period (bandwidth throttling), or the maximum rate at which the <b>traffic</b> is <b>sent</b> (rate limiting), or more complex criteria such as GCRA. This control can be accomplished in many ways and for many reasons; however traffic shaping is always achieved by delaying packets. Traffic shaping is commonly applied at the network edges to control traffic entering the network, but can also be applied by the traffic source (for example, computer or network card) or by an element in the network.|$|R
5000|$|Traffic shaping is {{the control}} of {{computer}} network traffic to optimize or guarantee performance, improve latency (i.e., decrease Internet response times), and/or increase usable bandwidth by delaying [...] "packets" [...] that meet certain criteria. In practice, traffic shaping is often accomplished by [...] "throttling" [...] certain types of data, such as streaming video or P2P file sharing. More specifically, traffic shaping is any action {{on a set of}} packets (often called a stream or a flow) which imposes additional delay on those packets such that they conform to some predetermined constraint (a contract or traffic profile). Traffic shaping provides a means to control the volume of <b>traffic</b> being <b>sent</b> into a network in a specified period (bandwidth throttling), or the maximum rate at which the <b>traffic</b> is <b>sent</b> (rate limiting), or more complex criteria such as generic cell rate algorithm.|$|R
50|$|Visicom Media Network or VMN.net is a Web portal with {{a number}} of free {{services}} for users. Its headquarters is in Brossard, Quebec. Most of the <b>traffic</b> is <b>sent</b> to the urlseek.vmn.net subdomain, which seems to be associated with error-redirects of the VMN toolbar (installed in the enduser's web browser as part of various third-party products).|$|R
5000|$|Some home routers {{refer to}} a DMZ host. A home router DMZ host is a single address (e.g., IP address) on the {{internal}} network that has all <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> to it which is not otherwise forwarded to other LAN hosts. By definition {{this is not a}} true DMZ (demilitarized zone), since it alone does not separate the host from the internal network. That is, the DMZ host is able to connect to hosts on the internal network, whereas hosts within a real DMZ are prevented from connecting with the internal network by a firewall that separates them, unless the firewall permits the connection.|$|E
50|$|Hamachi is a {{proprietary}} centrally-managed VPN system, {{consisting of the}} server cluster managed by the vendor {{of the system and}} the client software, which is installed on end-user computers.Client software adds a virtual network interface to a computer, and it is used for intercepting outbound as well as injecting inbound VPN traffic. Outbound <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> by the operating system to this interface is delivered to the client software, which encrypts and authenticates it and then sends it to the destination VPN peer over a specially initiated UDP connection. Hamachi currently handles tunneling of IP traffic including broadcasts and multicast. The Windows version also recognizes and tunnels IPX traffic.|$|E
5000|$|MAC address {{authentication}} {{in combination}} with discretionary DHCP server settings allow a user {{to set up an}} [...] "allowed MAC address" [...] list. Under this type of security, the access point will only give an IP Address to computers whose MAC address is on the list. Thus, the network administrator would obtain the valid MAC addresses from each of the potential clients in their network. Disadvantages to this method include the additional setup. This method does not prevent eavesdropping <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> over the air (there is no encryption involved). Methods to defeat this type of security include MAC address spoofing, detailed on the MAC address page, whereby network traffic is observed, valid MACs are collected, and then used to obtain DHCP leases. It is also often possible to configure IP for a computer manually, ignoring DHCP, if sufficient information about the network is known (perhaps from observed network traffic).|$|E
5000|$|In the beginning, all <b>traffic</b> was <b>sent</b> by Morse code ("CW") using {{hand-operated}} Morse keys. Devices {{were introduced}} to allow messages to be typed or [...] "punched" [...] onto a paper tape {{so that they could}} be sent automatically at any time. Station IDs and other repeated announcements pre-recorded by this method are called [...] "wheels".|$|R
50|$|The 13.716 m {{diameter}} satellite uplink dish {{was located}} on a perfectly flat concrete pad shielded by the Radar Dome. The dish had electro-mechanical actuators and was constantly tracking a NATO satellite positioned in geosynchronous orbit {{off the coast of}} Africa which broadcast a signal in the Super High Frequency. In this signal there could be 10,000 different channels of information which was received at SGT Folly Lake by a low-noise amplifier located on the dish. The amplified signal was then sent to a de-multiplexer which translated the signal into the appropriate channels and routed them to their correct destinations. Military NATO communications <b>traffic</b> was <b>sent</b> to the Telegraph Automated Relay Equipment (TARE) located at CFS Debert (until 1994), while civilian NATO communications <b>traffic</b> was <b>sent</b> through the local telecommunications company MT&T. The system allowed voice, video, faxes, teletype, and digital information to be sent.|$|R
50|$|A {{bearer channel}} is a DS-0 that carries call content i.e. {{one that does}} not carry {{signaling}}. In the common-channel signaling scheme for telecommunications, signaling is sent out-of-band, while all other traffic rides bearer channels. When a call is set up, the Bearer Capability is negotiated, and this is used to determine what type of <b>traffic</b> is <b>sent</b> across the bearer channel.|$|R
50|$|From the start, it {{appeared}} that David Pearson {{was on his way}} to his first Daytona 500 victory as he built a sizable lead on second place Benny Parsons late in the race. However, Richard Petty, who was eight laps behind the leaders on his way to finishing seventh, and Parsons hooked up in a draft and began reeling in Pearson who was slowed by lapped traffic. The key moment of the race occurred two laps from the end when contact with Cale Yarborough in <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> Pearson spinning on the backstretch. Parsons avoided the accident and went on to take the win. As per the list below, 26 of the 40 drivers failed to finish the race for various reasons, including a huge crash on the fourth lap, which took out nine cars, nearly one quarter of the field. Among those involved were famous country music singer Marty Robbins, who also crashed out of the 1973 Daytona 500.|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} {{is for the}} SP to use 802.1ad in their network. They assign a single, unique outer VLAN tag ID of 100 for Acme, and a unique outer VLAN ID of 101 for XYZ. All <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> from Acme A to the SP network (sent on A1, destined for Acme B) will have a tag of ID=100 pushed. The inner tag will be either 10,11,12, the original Acme tag. The traffic will be sent through S12 in this format, and just before it exits S-Switch #2 bound for Acme B (link A2), all traffic will undergo a single pop operation, removing the outer VLAN tag with the ID 100. This pop operation is the inverse of the former push operation, with the net result of no change to the traffic. The traffic passes through the SP network as 802.1ad frames, but no 802.1ad frames are sent to or received from the customer.|$|E
50|$|As clients {{connect to}} the network, both the rogue and legal DHCP server will offer them IP {{addresses}} as well as default gateway, DNS servers, WINS servers, among others. If the {{information provided by the}} rogue DHCP differs from the real one, clients accepting IP addresses from it may experience network access problems, including speed issues as well as inability to reach other hosts because of incorrect IP network or gateway. In addition, if a rogue DHCP is set to provide as default gateway an IP address of a machine controlled by a misbehaving user, he can sniff all the <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> by the clients to other networks, violating network security policies as well as user privacy (see man in the middle). VMware or virtual machine software can also act as a rogue DHCP server inadvertently when being run on a client machine joined to a network. The VMware will act as a rogue DHCP server handing out random IP addresses to the clients around it on the network. The end result can be that large portions of the network are then cut off from both the Internet {{and the rest of the}} domain without any access at all.|$|E
50|$|Website {{monetization}} is {{the process}} of converting existing <b>traffic</b> being <b>sent</b> to a particular website into revenue. The most popular ways of monetizing a website are by implementing pay per click (PPC) and cost per impression (CPI/CPM) advertising. Various ad networks facilitate a webmaster in placing advertisements on pages of the website to benefit from the traffic the site is experiencing.|$|R
40|$|Accessing the Internet {{in current}} {{telecommunications}} systems is done using dial-up services. A {{circuit switched connection}} is established to the Internet Service Provider (ISP) and a tunnel across the connection is set up. IP <b>traffic</b> is <b>sent</b> from the accessing node to the ISP using e. g. PPP-tunnel [1]. The ISP takes the traffic out from the tunnel and forwards it to the Internet...|$|R
50|$|Interception {{can also}} be {{performed}} using Cisco's WCCP (Web Cache Control Protocol). This proprietary protocol resides on the router and is configured from the cache, allowing the cache to determine what ports and <b>traffic</b> is <b>sent</b> to it via transparent redirection from the router. This redirection can occur {{in one of two}} ways: GRE Tunneling (OSI Layer 3) or MAC rewrites (OSI Layer 2).|$|R
5000|$|The new {{station was}} {{provided}} with three platform faces: a bay platform with a run-round loop for the Sutton line, a single platform for down services {{on the main}} line and an island platform for up services. A canopy covered both the bay and up platform. The main station buildings, consisting of a parcels office, stationmaster's office, ticket office, general waiting room, ladies' waiting room, porters' room and toilets, were situated on the up platform and branch platform. Another ladies' waiting room was located on the down platform. Two signal boxes were brought into service: one controlling the junction and bay and one controlling the crossing and goods yard movements. The second box was located behind the down platform, near a footbridge over the main line and the level crossing. The goods yard remained in its original position, but was provided with a goods shed and four sidings (two {{on either side of}} the line): one set was for coal traffic and the other for milk <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> out daily by the Clover Dairy factory. In 1937, milk was dispatched to [...] in a van picked up by the 4.19 pm [...] to [...] passenger working.|$|E
40|$|The Guaranteed Frame Rate service {{recently}} {{defined by}} the ATM Forum allows users to send data in excess of their guaranteed service rate but only guarantees that such traffic will be delivered {{within the limits of}} available network resources, that is, it is transported on best effort. In order to distinguish <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> in line with the guaranteed service rate from <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> in excess, a frame-based version of the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm is employed. This paper presents an analytical approach that forms the basis for dimensioning traffic descriptors related to the Frame-Based Generic Cell Rate Algorithm. The approach is based on a discrete-time analysis technique...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work {{is based on}} IEEE 802. 15. 4 / Zigbee wireless sensor network. The main aim {{of this research is}} to analyze the performance of Zigbee network topologies in beacon enable mode by giving the random waypoint mobility model to its nodes. The scenarios have investigated the performance of network by varying speed and mobility of nodes. Results are evaluated using parameters throughput, data <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> and data traffic received and number of hops. The simulation is done by OPNET modeler 14. 5. The results conclude that tree topology give good performance in case of data <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> and data traffic received, the throughput is also efficient. Hence tree topology constructs a robust network using mobile nodes...|$|E

50|$|The {{new line}} {{attracted}} almost no business at first. The mine owners near Llancaiach continued {{to send their}} coal to Cardiff over Smith's tramroad and the canal, although that required physical transshipment at the canal wharf; the Taff Vale charges were stated to be too high. Duncan & Co.'s colliery at Llancaiach started to use the line from 30 June 1842 and in 1843 more <b>traffic</b> was <b>sent</b> by the railway.|$|R
