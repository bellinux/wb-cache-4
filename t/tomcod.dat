5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic <b>tomcod</b> and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
25|$|Salmon as food, herring as food, smelt, halibut, flounder, <b>tomcod,</b> pike, and capelin were gutted and air dried or smoked. The fish heads {{they made}} into qamiqurrluk (cut and dried fish heads), and some they made into tepa (aged fish heads). Fish eggs (roe) were dried and stored.|$|E
25|$|The fishing {{industry}} in the adjacent community of Northport is a significant economic activity, with landings by fishing boats totalling 3 million kilograms of species such as American lobster, mussels, snow crab, soft shell clams, cod, herring, American plaice, mackerel, sea scallop, yellowtail, eel, winter flounder, smelt, rock crab, <b>tomcod,</b> silversides, porbeagle, and blue shark.|$|E

5000|$|A {{similar study}} {{was also done}} {{regarding}} the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that pollute {{the waters of the}} Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, Virginia. This chemical is a product of creosote, a type of tar. The Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) has evolved a resistance to PAHs involving the AHR gene (the same gene involved in the <b>tomcods).</b> This particular study focused on the resistance to [...] "acute toxicity and cardiac teratogenesis" [...] caused by PAHs.that mutated within the <b>tomcods</b> in the Hudson River.|$|R
25|$|According to Arthur Ahkinga, {{who lived}} on Little Diomede island {{at the turn of}} the 1940s, the Iñupiat on the island made their living by hunting and carving ivory which they traded or sold. Fish they caught were bullheads, <b>tomcods,</b> bluecods and a few others, {{although}} the fishing was not so common. During the winter time they used fur parkas and skin mukluks made out of hunted animals to protect themselves from cold and wind. Recreations were skating, snowshoeing, handball, football and Inuit dancing. After dark, people spent the rest of the evening telling jokes and old-time stories. In summer time they travelled with skin boats equipped with outboard motors to either Siberia or Wales, Alaska. Winter travel was limited to neighboring Big Diomede due to weather conditions. Between July and October half the population went to Nome for selling their carving and skin sewing and trading for supplies.|$|R
25|$|The Atlantic <b>tomcod</b> are {{a unique}} species that adapted {{resistance}} to the toxic effects of the PCBs polluting the river. Scientists identified the genetic mutation that conferred the resistance, {{and found that the}} mutated form was present in 99 percent of the tomcods in the river, compared to fewer than 10 percent of the tomcods from other waters.|$|E
25|$|The Nunivak Eskimos (Nuniwarmiut in Cup'ig, Nunivaarmiut in Yup'ik and Cup'ik) ate {{frequently}} {{in the course of}} a 24-hour period. They went to bed at sundown or early evening in the spring and fall, and well before sundown in summer, but arose early, often at 3:00 or 4:00a.m. and regularly at 5:00 or 5:30. The time of rising depended on the sea tide and the time when <b>tomcod</b> or other fish would be running. The first meal of the day was eaten at this time and another about 11:00a.m., with snacks once or twice in between depending on the work schedule and the availability of food. The evening meal was usually at 4:30 or 5:00p.m. with additional snacks between the main meals. In winter the entire meal schedule was likely to be moved forward, with the first meal of the day being eaten at 10:00 or 10:30a.m. The most common food was dried or frozen fish dipped in seal oil. The evening or late afternoon meal, the hot meal of the day, frequently consisted of boiled fish or other boiled food and tea.|$|E
500|$|Six {{species have}} {{disappeared}} from the river since the mid-1980s. The Petitcodiac River was the only known Canadian habitat of the dwarf wedgemussel, and was later isolated to just nine American watersheds after its elimination from the Petitcodiac. The Atlantic salmon is no longer present in the watershed, and has since been listed as an endangered species in Canada. The American shad was a favourite with fishermen, and represented two-thirds of the entire Canadian shad landings from 1870 to 1900; catches peaked at million kilograms (two to sixmillion pounds) per year. Three other species have been eliminated from the river: the striped bass, the Atlantic sturgeon, and the Atlantic <b>tomcod.</b> However, a project of the Petitcodiac Riverkeeper, funded by the Government of Canada's Environmental Damage Fund in 2005, noted that {{the removal of the}} causeway would result in a [...] "good" [...] chance of bringing back the eliminated species, and an [...] "excellent" [...] chance of increasing the numbers of species deemed to have been reduced in numbers. No data has been released for the Atlantic salmon or the striped bass.|$|E

60|$|Busy as {{his life}} now was, Ben still {{found time to}} keep company with his former schoolfellows. He and the other boys were very fond of fishing, and spent many of their leisure hours on {{the margin of the}} mill-pond, {{catching}} flounders, perch, eels, and <b>tomcod,</b> which came up thither with the tide. The place where they fished is now, probably, covered with stone pavements and brick buildings, and thronged with people and with vehicles of all kinds. But at that period it was a marshy spot {{on the outskirts of the}} town, where gulls flitted and screamed overhead and salt-meadow grass grew under foot.|$|E

50|$|Biodiversity of the estuary and gulf of Saint Lawrence River {{consists}} of an aquatic mammal wildlife, of which most goes upriver through the estuary and the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park until the Île d'Orléans (French for Orleans Island), such as the blue whale, the beluga, the minke whale and the harp seal (earless seal). Among the Nordic marine animals, there are two particularly important to cite: the walrus and the narwhal.Inland waters are populated by small to large fresh water fish, such as the largemouth bass, the American pickerel, the walleye, the Acipenser oxyrinchus, the muskellunge, the Atlantic cod, the Arctic char, the brook trout, the Microgadus <b>tomcod</b> (<b>tomcod),</b> the Atlantic salmon, the rainbow trout, etc.|$|E
50|$|Although the Gaspereau {{is a short}} river, the {{riverbed}} habitat and connecting lakes form an important and productive breeding ground for several species of migratory fish including Gaspereau (Alewife), Rainbow Smelt and Atlantic Salmon.

50|$|Like most gulls, {{they also}} capture fish with some {{regularity}} and will readily capture any fish smaller than itself found {{close to the}} surface of the water. Whether caught or eaten after death or injury from other sources, stomach contents of great black-backed gulls usually show fish to be the primary food. On Sable Island in Nova Scotia, 25% of the stomach contents were comprised by fish but 96% of the regurgitations given to young was made up fish. Similarly, on Great Island in Newfoundland, 25% of the stomach contents were fish but 68% of regurgitants were fish. The most regularly reported fish eaten in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morrhua), Atlantic <b>tomcod</b> (Microgadus <b>tomcod),</b> Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus). Other prey often includes various squid, Jonah crabs (Cancer borealis), rock crabs (Cancer irroratus), sea urchins, green crabs (Carcinus maenas), starfish (Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens) and other echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks when they come across the opportunity. From observations in northern New England, 23% of observed prey was echinoderms and 63% was crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|These {{waters are}} laden with nutrients, after having {{filtered}} through 32 kilometers of river, {{and tons of}} dead plant matter and grasses. The Mi'kmaq, who lived inland, travelled by canoe down the Tusket River to the sea. They depended, seasonally, {{on the availability of}} some staples. They harvested seals, sea bird eggs, cod, shellfish, smelts, gaspereau, sturgeon, salmon, eels, <b>tomcod,</b> waterfowl, beaver, otter, rabbits, deer, moose, caribou and bear. All of these still inhabit the Tusket River system, except for the caribou.|$|E
50|$|Marine {{and other}} species {{reported}} from the bay have {{been a source of}} sustenance {{for the people of the}} area. The species reported are <b>tomcod</b> (a small fish) and herring. The hair of the seals caught from the bay area were woven into a fur cloth and the skin of the ogruk, a thick skinned seal, was used for making footwear worn by the Mukluk inhabitants of the area. Walrus has also been found is during the spring season which are caught and used as food.|$|E
50|$|An example {{involving}} the direct observation of gene modification due to selection pressures is {{the resistance to}} PCBs in codfish. After General Electric dumped polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Hudson River from 1947 through 1976, tomcods (Microgadus <b>tomcod)</b> living in the river {{were found to have}} evolved an increased resistance to the compound's toxic effects. The tolerance to the toxins is due to a change in the coding section of specific gene. Genetic samples were taken from the cods from 8 different rivers in the New England region: the St. Lawrence River, Miramichi River, Margaree River, Squamscott River, Niantic River, the Shinnecock Basic, the Hudson River, and the Hackensack River. Genetic analysis found that in the population of tomcods in the four southernmost rivers, the gene AHR2 (aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2) was present as an allele with a difference of two amino acid deletions. This deletion conferred a resistance to PCB in the fish species and was found in 99% of Hudson River tomcods, 92% in the Hackensack River, 6% in the Niantic River, and 5% in Shinnecock Bay. This pattern along the sampled bodies of waters infers a direct correlation of selective pressures leading to the evolution of PCB resistance in Atlantic <b>tomcod</b> fish.|$|E
50|$|The PCBs caused {{extensive}} {{contamination of}} fish in the river and apparently triggered a rapid evolutionary change in the Atlantic <b>tomcod,</b> which after about 50 years of exposure evolved a two amino acid change in its AHR2 receptor gene, causing the receptor to bind more weakly with PCBs than normal. The mutation does not prevent the tomcods from accumulating PCBs in their bodies and passing them on to striped bass and whatever else eats them. This system of passing contamination on to larger organisms {{is also known as}} biomagnification. The toxic chemicals also accumulated in sediments that settled to the river bottom.|$|E
5000|$|Zmudowski State Beach is {{a popular}} fishing area and tourist attraction. Some of the fish found in this {{location}} are the perch, kingfish, sole, flounder, halibut, bocaccio (<b>tomcod),</b> jacksmelt, lingcod, cabezon, salmon, steelhead, and occasional rockfish. The beach features the Pajaro River estuary, where a natural preserve has been set aside for nature and wildlife exploring. Families go to this state beach to picnic and use the beach area. The sandy beach is also popular with bird watchers and equestrians. Horses are only allowed near the waterline. Swimming and water sports such as surfing are hazardous because of strong rip-currents.|$|E

50|$|Fish {{species of}} Pacific {{sandlance}} (Ammodytes personatus) {{is found in}} fairly large number in the harbor. They feed on crustaceans, barnacle larve, copepods, and chaetognaths. They in turn are the food chain and form the feed source for marine mammals, birds and other species of fish. Seals are spotted, ringed, and bearded species; spotted is seen when the sea is calm (seals and seal oil form the staple diet {{of the people who}} live on the shores of the harbor in towns like Teller). Herring, whitefish, starry flounder, pike and <b>tomcod</b> are netted during spring, fall and midsummer. All five salmon species are found here of which red salmon is the primary catch and they migrate inland to the Salmon Lake to breed. Chum salmon migrate to the Pilgrim River and Agiapuk River. King salmon are rare.|$|E
5000|$|During {{his first}} decade of whaling, 1864 to 1873, Lindholm managed to catch sixty-five whales, which {{produced}} 4,710 barrels of oil and 15 tons of bone. The catch {{at the end of}} the season was shipped to Honolulu or San Francisco by a chartered vessel. Lindholm and his men usually wintered at Tugur in the 1860s and at Mamga in the 1870s, while the schooners were hauled up the riverbank at high tide either at the mouth of the Tugur or Mamga River to protect them from being damaged by the ice. During the spring and fall Lindholm traveled to Nikolayevsk for supplies and men, either by reindeer or canoe when the ground was bare and the navigation was open, or by snowshoe and dog sled when sufficient snow had fallen and the ice was solid fast. They also hunted game - including ducks and geese, reindeer, moose, and foxes - and fished for <b>tomcod</b> in the Tugur River to provide additional fare - the sled dogs, meanwhile, were given salmon and seal or whale meat.|$|E
