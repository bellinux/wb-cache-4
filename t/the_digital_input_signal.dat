The performance of the digital signal processing and communication systems is generally limited by the speed and precision of <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> which is achieved at the interface between analog and digital information. The analog to digital converter (ADC) has become a critical component for advanced telecommunication systems. The desire to move the analog to digital interface closer to the sensor has resulted in more stringent performance requirements for high speed, and high resolution ADCs. High speed ADCs have become the bottle neck for achieving high performance signal processing systems. This has motivated many researchers and scientists to continuously work on the development of innovative ADC architectures and new techniques.

40|$|This paper compares three {{single-ended}} distributed amplifiers (DAs) {{realized in}} an in-house InP/InGaAs double {{heterojunction bipolar transistor}} technology featuring an f(ind t) and f(ind max) larger than 200 GHz. The amplifiers use five or eight gain cells with cascode configuration and emitter follower buffering. Although the technology is optimized for mixed-signal circuits for 80 Gbit/s and beyond, DA results could be achieved that demonstrate the suitability of this process for the realization of modulator drivers. The results are documented with scattering parameter, eye diagram, and power measurements. This includes amplifiers featuring a 3 -dB bandwidth exceeding 80 GHz and a gain of over 10 dB.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{directed}} towards {{the development of}} a digitally-assisted radio frequency power amplifier (RF PA) {{which is one of the}} potential solutions to realize a multiband and multimode transmitter with high efficiency for handset applications. To improve efficiency and linearity in multiple conditions, PA circuits and digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms are co-designed. In the dissertation, a proposed architecture employs a current- mode class-D (CMCD) configuration for high efficiency, and a polar modulation scheme driven by <b>digital</b> <b>inputs.</b> Detail design, fabrication and experimental results are given for circuit implementation and DSP of this architecture. First, a multiband watt-class complementary metal-oxide- semiconductor (CMOS) PA is demonstrated using 0. 15 um CMOS integrated circuits (ICs), off-chip inductor and balun. To obtain high breakdown voltage, stacked field effect transistors (FETs) are used. The CMCD PA is tuned by band- switching capacitors, operating in the 0. 7 - 1. 8 GHz frequency band. The overall efficiencies of 27. 1 / 25. 6 % are achieved at 30. 2 / 28. 9 dBm CW output powers and 0. 85 / 1. 75 GHz carrier frequencies, respectively. Next, to achieve wide output power dynamic range, an architecture consisting of small segmented unti-cells is introduced into the PA, where multiple three-state unit-cells are used and the state of each unit-cell is controlled to provide a specific output power. The overall dynamic ranges are expanded to approximately 90 dB and 85 dB at and 0. 85 / 1. 75 GHz, respectively. The dissertation then presents <b>digital</b> modulation algorithms. <b>The</b> <b>digital</b> compensation techniques are developed to maintain linearity of an envelope modulator of the polar transmitter. A new digital pulse width modulation algorithm is also shown to partially suppress spurious <b>signals</b> associated with <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>input</b> envelope <b>signal.</b> When wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA) modulation is implemented, spur suppression of 9 - 10 dB is achieved while maintaining adjacent channel leakage power ratios within 3 rd generation partnership project specification...|$|R

Electronic Integrated Circuits (ICs) are now playing a primary role in the economy of vehicles, especially since special laws and strict safety requirements have been introduced. The aim of the thesis, developed within Austramicrosystem design centre of Navacchio (PI), is the design and the verification of a digitally controlled output stage. Output stages are the final components of many sensor-based ICS. In fact their typical typical signal-chain starts from the sensing of a physical phenomenon, passing by its transduction in an electrical quantity, its digital conversion and processing, and ends with the drive of an actuator.

Then, to experimentally validate this control algorithm, an Integrated Circuit has been designed, realized and lastly measured.
