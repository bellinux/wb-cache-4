5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 24, the ROK 1st Infantry Division {{advanced}} towards the town of Taechon with its 11th and 12th Infantry Regiment on point. Although Chinese booby traps and mortar fire tried to delay <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> along the way, the 1st Infantry Division still managed to envelop the town by the dusk of November 24. But unknown to <b>the</b> <b>Koreans,</b> the 1st Infantry Division was marching into a Chinese assembly area, and the resistance around Taechon immediately increased as the result. On the night of November 24, the defending PVA 66th Corps counterattacked <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> with infantry and cavalry charges, and the Chinese and Korean troops were soon locked in a seesaw battle from November 25 to 26.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} troops escorting Choe and his Korean party reached Jiantiao Battalion on March 8; on {{the next}} day, they travelled by boat across Sanmen Bay to reach the Yuexi Police Station and Post House. On March 10, the party travelled along the postal route to Baiqiao Station, a courier centre between Taizhou and Ningbo prefectures. The courier officials were eager to see <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> off, since a party of 43 was a somewhat large group for a courier station to provide sudden accommodations for.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{analyzed}} through a survey carried out targeting <b>the</b> <b>korean</b> school teachers {{for the present}} status and <b>the</b> improvement of <b>Korean</b> Language Textbooks {{that are used in}} <b>the</b> <b>korean</b> school in Japan. In summary, the results are as follows. First, korean school teachers use <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> Language Textbook developed in Korea more than the one developed in Japan. Second, the good points of <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> Language Textbook developed in Korea was found to have a systematic curriculum. Third, <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> Language Textbook developed in Korea was pointed out that this does not include the local circumstances of Japan. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> Language Textbooks that are used in <b>the</b> <b>korean</b> school in japan should consider the distinct characteristics of the area and <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> resident in Japan. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> Language Textbooks that are used in <b>the</b> <b>korean</b> school in japan should include information regarding <b>the</b> Identity of <b>Korean</b> Nation. <b>The</b> results of this study could be used as basic informations to consider when developing a Korean Language Textbook for <b>the</b> <b>korean</b> school student in Japan...|$|R

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> were {{preparing}} their defensive {{positions on the}} dusk of November 25, the two Chinese corps were mobilizing for a decisive counterattack against the Eighth Army's right flank. The PVA 38th Corps planned to attack in full force against the ROK 7th Infantry Division's center and right flank, while two divisions from the 42nd Corps started to march through the hills in order to bypass the ROK 8th Infantry Division's right flank. Given {{the importance of this}} assault, Han Xianchu, one of Peng's deputies, personally commanded the 38th and 42nd Corps {{for the rest of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} epoch, the Chinese lost their secret to <b>the</b> <b>Koreans,</b> the Japanese, and, later, the Indians, as these {{cultures}} discovered {{how to make}} silk. Allusions to the fabric in the Old Testament show that it was known in western Asia in biblical times. Scholars believe that starting in the 2nd century BCE the Chinese established a commercial network aimed at exporting silk to the West. Silk was used, for example, by the Persian court and its king, Darius III, when Alexander the Great conquered the empire. Even though silk spread rapidly across Eurasia, {{with the possible exception}} of Japan its production remained exclusively Chinese for three millennia.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} sudden {{appearance}} of the overwhelming Chinese forces, the ROK 1st Infantry Division tried to establish defensive positions by capturing the hills around Unsan. The South Koreans soon {{found themselves in a}} seesaw battle with the PVA 360th Regiment during the night of 25 October. The next day, the PVA 39th Corps arrived at the west of Unsan while cutting the road between Unsan and Yongsan-dong, completely surrounding the ROK 1st Infantry Division. Aided by airdrops, the US 6th Medium Tank Battalion and the US 10th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group, the ROK 1st Infantry Division reopened the road on 27 October. Several more attempts to advance north by <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> made little progress, and the fighting stopped by 28 October.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, an {{expedition}} of five warships commanded by Rear Admiral John Rodgers {{was sent to}} Korea to obtain an apology for the murders of several shipwrecked American sailors and secure a treaty to protect shipwrecked foreigners in the future. After a small skirmish, Rodgers launched an amphibious assault of approximately 650 men on the forts protecting Seoul. Despite the capture of the forts, <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> refused to negotiate, and the expedition {{was forced to leave}} before the start of typhoon season. Nine sailors and six marines received Medals of Honor for their acts of heroism during the Korean campaign; the first for actions in a foreign conflict.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, {{advanced}} to Hadong and captured the village which was lightly defended {{by a group}} of South Korean police, as no military was available due to manpower shortages. <b>The</b> <b>Koreans,</b> members of the NK 6th Division, set up in roads east of the village and began sending probes and scout parties to the east. The move {{was part of a larger}} coordinated operation by the 6th Division to take Chinju, and then Masan, in hopes of flanking the UN lines at their vulnerable southern limit. Thinking the UN units were disorganized and suffering low morale, NK 6th Division commander General Pang Ho San ordered his forces to aggressively advance to Chinju as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} success of the Chinese counterattack against ROK II Corps, the PVA 40th Corps was {{assigned}} the mission of protecting the PVA 38th Corps' flank against the US 2nd Infantry Division. To accomplish this mission, the PVA 119th Division of the 40th Corps would first attack Somin-dong and to prevent the Americans from reinforcing <b>the</b> <b>Koreans.</b> The 120th Division would then fight its way across the Ch'ongch'on River and tie down the bulk of the US 2nd Infantry Division. Finally, the 118th Division would flank the Americans from the west and capture Kujang-dong from the rear.|$|E

5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> were {{advancing}} {{towards the}} Yalu River, the Chinese were {{also trying to}} deploy their units for the upcoming First Phase Campaign. As the PVA Commander Peng Dehuai scrambled to set up his new command post at Taeyudong, the planned advance by the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment threatened to overrun his position. Without any KPA units nearby to hide {{the presence of the}} Chinese, Peng was forced to start the First Phase Campaign early by moving the PVA 40th Corps to intercept the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment near Onjong. On the night of October 24, the 118th Division of the 40th Corps arrived at its designated blocking position. Meanwhile, the Chinese had set up numerous ambush positions on the ridges overlooking the Onjong-Pukchin road.|$|E
5|$|At 1 p.m. on November 27, Peng {{ordered the}} PVA 66th Corps {{to destroy the}} ROK 1st Infantry Division before <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> could retreat to the Ch'ongch'on River. On the evening of November 27, the PVA 66th Corps {{launched}} a massive attack against the ROK 1st Infantry Division, the US 5th Regimental Combat Team of the 24th Infantry Division and the US 35th Infantry Regiment. After midnight, the Chinese attacks broke through the Korean lines and captured Yongsan-dong, resulting {{in the loss of}} the ROK 11th, 15th and US 35th Infantry Regiment's command posts. The ROK 11th and 15th Infantry Regiment were soon scattered while the retreating US 35th Infantry Regiment was blocked at Yongsan-dong with Chinese forces attacking from behind. Under heavy pressure, the US 35th Infantry Regiment fought its way through the town and rejoined the US 25th Division on the afternoon of November 28. At the same time, Paik rallied the broken ROK regiments and recaptured Yongsan-dong. The ROK 1st Infantry Division held the town against the subsequent Chinese attacks until it withdrew from the battle on November 29.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Onjong, the Chinese recognized the ROK II Corps as the most vulnerable unit of the Eighth Army. Besides lacking the firepower of their US counterpart, the ROK II Corps also held the most difficult terrain on the UN right flank. At 10 a.m. on November 24, the ROK 7th Infantry Division on the II Corps' left flank attacked north from Tokchon. At the same time, the ROK 8th Infantry Division on the II Corps' right flank advanced north from Yongwon. The stubborn defenses by the PVA 38th and 42nd Corps soon ground the Korean advances to a halt, and the continuous fighting for the next two days failed to create any gains for <b>the</b> <b>Koreans.</b> During the advances, the Chinese defenses managed to create a wedge {{in the center of the}} ROK 7th Infantry Division, forcing the division to commit most of its reserves on the front line. Meanwhile, the ROK 6th Infantry Division in the II Corps' rear could only offer its 2nd Infantry Regiment as the corps' reserve due to the earlier losses at Onjong.|$|E

5|$|North Korean forces, meanwhile, flanked the American {{positions}} {{under cover}} of fog. <b>The</b> <b>Koreans</b> passed around the Americans' right flank and attacked the mortar positions in the rear. T-34 tanks also joined in the fight, and also passed around the American flanks while obscured by the fog. Around 0900 the North Korean forces in Chonui initiated a frontal assault on the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry's positions. An observer with the unit called in artillery and pushed back the North Korean infantry inflicting heavy casualties on the assaulting force. By 1100, the North Korean infantry, supported by several T-34s, was pressing on A Company's position, which was undermanned. At 1125 the requested airstrike came in; American aircraft rocketed the T-34s to no effect while strafing the Korean forces attacking A Company. The aircraft were able to push back the attack for several minutes before running out of ammunition and being forced to leave. The North Korean troops immediately resumed their assault.|$|E
5|$|At noon on October 30, the 15th Corps bombarded <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> with 133 large-caliber guns, 22 rocket {{launchers}} and 30 120mm heavy mortars in {{the largest}} Chinese artillery operation of the Korean War. When the bombardment ended at midnight, 10 infantry companies from the 45th and the 29th Divisions swarmed over the ROK 31st Regiment's positions and pushed the South Koreans off the summit. In {{the aftermath of the}} fighting, only 175 South Koreans survived the onslaught out of the three defending infantry companies. With the PVA 91st Regiment of the 31st Division, 12th Corps, arriving as reinforcement on November 1, the Chinese forces chased the remaining South Korean defenders off Jane Russell Hill and beat off the subsequent counterattack. Responding to the losses, the US IX Corps ordered the ROK 30th Regiment of the ROK 9th Infantry Division to take back Triangle Hill on October 31. The South Koreans launched continuous attacks for the next five days to no avail. Although the South Koreans failed to recapture the hill, the resulting heavy casualties forced the Chinese to call in the 93rd Regiment of the 31st Division as reinforcement on November 5. On the same day, Lieutenant General Reuben E. Jenkins, commander of the US IX Corps, suspended further attacks on Triangle Hill to prevent more casualties and to protect Sniper Ridge.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, Colonel Joseph R. Russ of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment {{took over}} the {{operational}} command from Moses. He was also given the 2nd Battalion of the US 17th Infantry Regiment to reinforce his right wing. After arriving on the battlefield, the US 2nd Battalion managed to wrestle Jane Russell Hill away from the Chinese on October 16, but the Americans soon {{came under heavy fire}} from Chinese machine guns in the valley below, and were forced to withdraw to the slope behind the hill on October 18. The Chinese continued to harass the American positions with small raiding parties and grenade barrages throughout that night. <b>The</b> <b>Koreans</b> fared somewhat better. A joint attack by 2nd Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment captured Sniper Ridge and held it against subsequent Chinese counterattacks. For {{the first time since the}} combat began, UN forces had gained firm control of the surface, with the exception of Pike's Peak. On the afternoon of October 17, the 3rd Battalion of the US 17th Infantry Regiment relieved the 2nd Battalion of the US 31st Infantry Regiment on the left wing, while the 1st Battalion of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment was withdrawn from the pacified center.|$|E
