50|$|The {{backing of}} the quilt is {{attached}} by sewing pins, a snap system, or zippers to a third roller, known as the “take-up” roller. The <b>take-up</b> <b>roller</b> is the region onto which the quilted layers can be moved to allow the quilter {{to gain access to}} a new region of quilt top. The backing, quilt top, and batting are commonly basted together by a single-row of stitching, but can also be pinned together onto the muslin leader on the <b>take-up</b> <b>roller.</b> The stretched region of fabric that spans between the <b>take-up</b> <b>roller</b> and the feeder rollers is the area over which the fabric layers are actually sewn together into the finished product. The longarm quilting machine typically comes with electronic controls that allow the user to adjust the fabric that spans the area over which the machine runs.|$|E
5000|$|Die forming {{typically}} occurs {{immediately after}} polymer melt has exited an [...] extruder. The most basic process involves guiding {{the stream of}} molten polymer under pressure through a die, which three distinct regions: manifold, approach, and lip. The 'manifold' serves to channel the polymer melt from its initial extrusion point to a near-net-shape of the final product. The 'approach' region further guides the melt into the final shape, and begins to correct for any non-uniform [...] flow. Finally, the 'lip' forms the melt into the final desired cross section and compensates for any remaining flow asymmetry. After exiting {{the lip of the}} die, the polymer melt will undergo die swell before curing. Die swell is an expansion of the melt as the pressure is released, and is dependent on polymer chemistry and die design. After curing, the solid, continuous part is drawn onto a <b>take-up</b> <b>roller</b> or cut into transportable lengths, {{depending on the type of}} part. This process may vary significantly depending on the type of die and extrusion process.|$|E
30|$|During {{hybrid yarn}} {{preparation}} in hollow spinning, the core component {{had to be}} kept in high tension for winding the cover properly around the core. To achieve the required tension in case of copper core samples (A 1 and B 1), a draft of 1.3 between the front drafting roller and the <b>take-up</b> <b>roller</b> had to be maintained. Since copper has very less elasticity due to its high modulus, this draft during spinning made it permanently elongated, hence the elongation values in the hybrid yarn sample A 1 and B 1 were reduced. This is also reflected in the resultant count of the sample A 1 and B 1 in Table  2. The resultant count of 75 Tex copper wire and 31.60 Tex polyester turned out to be 89.40 Tex only (sample A 1). Similarly, 320.80 Tex copper with 78.52 Tex AW yarn blend in hybrid yarn B 1 was only 354.56 Tex.|$|E
5000|$|Tube forming dies {{allow for}} {{continuous}} extrusion of thick walled (relative to blown film extrusion) tubes and [...] pipes. [...] The dies themselves are {{almost identical to}} those used in blown film extrusion; the only major difference is {{the gap between the}} inner mandrel and outer die wall. Once the polymer melt is extruded from the die, it is pulled away by <b>take-up</b> <b>rollers.</b> Cooling is accomplished through the use of water baths, or a large number of cooling fans. After cooling, the tube is either wound onto large spools (if flexible), or cut into pre-set lengths and stacked (if stiff).|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} prevent fiber {{distortion}} in textile materials employed in a modified weaving process. In a first embodiment, a tacifier {{in powder form}} {{is applied to the}} yarn and melted while on the fabric. Cool air is then supplied after the tacifier has melted to expedite the solidification of the tacifier. In a second embodiment, a solution form of a tacifier is used by dissolving the tacifier into a solvent that has a high evaporation rate. The solution is then sprayed onto the fabric or fill yarn as each fill yarn is inserted into a shed of the fabric. A third embodiment applies the tacifier in a liquid form that has not been dissolved in a solvent. That is, the tacifier is melted and is sprayed as a liquid onto the fabric or fill yarn as it is being extracted from a fill yarn spool prior to the fill yarn being inserted into the shed of the fabric. A fourth embodiment employs adhesive yarns contained {{as an integral part of}} the warp or fill yarn. Additional tacifier material is not required because a matrix is used as the tacifier. The matrix is then locally melted using heating elements on clamping bars or <b>take-up</b> <b>rollers,</b> is cooled, if necessary, and solidified...|$|R
40|$|Defects in {{polyethylene}} film {{are often}} caused by contaminant {{particles in the}} polymer melt. In this research, particle properties obtainable from in-line melt monitoring, combined with processing information, are used to predict film defect properties. “Model ” particles (solid and hollow glass microspheres, aluminum powder, ceramic microspheres, glass fibers, wood particles, and cross-linked polyethylene) were injected into low-density polyethylene extruder feed. Defects resulted when the polyethylene containing particles was extruded through a film die and stretched by a <b>take-up</b> <b>roller</b> as it cooled to form films 57 to 241 m in thickness. Two off-line analysis methods were further developed and applied to the defects: polarized light imaging and interferometric imaging. Polarized light showed residual stresses in the film caused by the particle as well as properties of the embedded particle. Interferometry enabled measures of the film distortion, notably defect volume. From the images, only three attributes were required for mathematical modeling: particle area, defect area, and defect volume. These attributes yielded two ”primary defect properties”: averag...|$|E
