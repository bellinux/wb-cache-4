500|$|On January 15, 2014, Bruce Boxleitner {{stated in}} an interview: [...] "All I know is, they don’t <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything,</b> {{but they want}} to do it I would say {{probably}} the end of this year, for 2015 maybe," [...] Boxleitner said. [...] "They don’t have any dates but I’m thinking from the scuttlebutt I’m hearing that’s it, but I don’t know anything for sure other than they do have a script they love, they're still tweaking." [...] The film may also take place more in the real world than in the past according to the recent interview: [...] "That’s what I’m told, but you didn’t hear me say that," [...] Boxleitner joked. [...] "I think it’s {{going to be a lot}} about taking the company back because if you remember Sam Flynn says to Alan at the end, just before he rides his bike off into the sunrise with Quorra, says, ‘We’re going to take the company back.’ That’s not the end of the movie. That’s the beginning of the next one. That’s foreshadowing. And you don’t get Cillian Murphy to do an unscripted cameo" [...] and [...] "I got a feeling Eddie Dillinger Jr.’s going to be as bad as his dad was." ...|$|E
60|$|NORA. Yes: it's {{hard for}} me to know {{anything}} about you if you never <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay, don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> {{more about}} it, dear, till you have breakfasted. Here, eat this before you say another word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he muttered, [...] "I {{told you}} how it would be. I don't know, I'm sure--nobody <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything.</b> Are you {{sleeping}} here, my boy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't say. He never <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> nowadays. His ill-considered {{marriage}} {{seems to}} have completed that estrangement from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Garnished with suet at two {{thousand}} metres of profundity. Decidedly the Britannic Navy is well guarded.' Well, that's all right, Mr. Pyecroft. Would you mind <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> else {{of interest that}} happened?" ...|$|R
6000|$|No sooner {{were they}} in the {{carriage}} than she said, 'Violet, my dear, can you or Arthur <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> of this Mr. Gardner?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, dear! {{how many}} things I never thought of! Mamma said I was too young! These coals. Can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> about them?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> of the {{two ships}} to the southward of us?" [...] demanded the stranger, through his trumpet, without any preamble.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care a bit for Sir Thomas. I am {{not sure}} {{but he is the}} most good-natured, though he is so podgy. Of course, when Aunt Emmeline <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> I do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have asked}} him. I {{come to you}} as a last resource. But without your <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> definite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service if you would {{enlighten}} me on one point." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{know nothing}} about it," [...] he said; [...] "nobody <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything.</b> Soames {{ought to be able}} to take care of himself. If he can't take care of himself he mustn't look to me--that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am much {{obliged to}} you, Stanbury; very much;--but I {{do not know}} that I need trouble you to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{told me they}} lent a hand {{to put out the}} fire--I {{think those}} were George's words--but they did not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> else." ...|$|E
6000|$|She hesitated. Then, {{lifting her}} eyes to his, [...] "I don't believe," [...] she said softly, [...] "that you would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> that was not true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know," [...] I {{attacked}} her suddenly, [...] "if you don't intend <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything,</b> you must say so distinctly, and then, of course, {{it shall be}} final. But I won't play at delicacy. I ask you point-blank for all the details." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. Oh dear, Ted never <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> any more. I don't {{understand}} what's {{come over}} the children of this generation. I {{used to have to}} tell Papa and Mama everything, but seems like the children to-day have just slipped away from all control." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard you'd married," [...] said Ethel, [...] "but I didn't {{know what}} had become of you until the other day. Jim never <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything.</b> It appears that he's seen {{something}} of you. But it wasn't from Jim that I heard about you first. You'd never guess who told me you were here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come! Somewhere--out of the crowd!" [...] cried Neale, {{dragging}} at Slingerland. [...] "Don't talk. Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything.</b> Wait!... I've {{a letter}} here--that's {{going to be}} hell!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must go, and at once," [...] I said, [...] "or {{we shall}} never be {{back before the}} doctor gets down. Come, Cecil! Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing! I think I {{will go to}} bed, mamma. Why are you unkind to me? Do <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Anything</b> {{is better}} than {{that you should be}} unkind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was lying}} lifeless {{in the street}} from starvation," [...] said Romola. [...] "I revived him with bread and wine. I brought him to our door, {{but he refused to}} come in. Then I gave him some money, and he went away without <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything.</b> But he had found out that I was your wife. Who is he?" ...|$|R
60|$|This part was, indeed, likely enough; and {{the kind}} Quaker, without <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> of the matter, caused her man to place himself just {{at the corner of}} Whitechapel Church wall every Saturday in the afternoon, that being the day when the {{citizens}} chiefly ride abroad to take the air, and there to watch all the afternoon and look for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Algernon! Algernon!" [...] says Miss, in teers, [...] "what is this dreadful mystery--these fearful {{shocking}} quarrels? <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> has <b>anything</b> happened? Where, {{where is}} the chevalier?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I don't {{want you}} to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> of the sort,' Laura interrupted. 'Especially as you were just now so pained by the license of my own allusions.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, sir, can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> about him? Can {{you tell}} me where he lodges? For my poor uncle was too much weighed down with trouble to remember." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't oblige you," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "I couldn't spare {{more than a}} minute now for a {{railroad}} director. You can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> you want after supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Shadow is a well-informed young man," [...] M. Peyron answered, {{with easy}} French sprightliness. [...] "As for my donkey of a valet, he never {{by any chance}} knows or <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything.</b> I had just sent him out--the pig--to learn, if possible, your {{nationality}} and name, and what hours you preferred, as I proposed {{later in the day}} to pay my respects to mademoiselle, your friend, if she would deign to receive me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] said Mrs. Conant. [...] "Peter never <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> {{about the}} private affairs of his clients, and I never ask him. But {{of one thing}} I am sure, my dear, {{and that is that}} Peter Conant would not act as Colonel Weatherby's lawyer, and try to shield him, unless he {{believed}} him innocent of any crime. Peter is a little odd, in some ways, but he's honest to the backbone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course! He was at Eton with me. It was I {{who first}} brought him here to dine. Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>anything</b> has {{happened}} to Jim Atcheson!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't need to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> {{about that}} part of your career," [...] she interrupted, with a little smile almost of {{proprietory}} pride. [...] "I never forget it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> I may be ignorant of in that subject. You must have learnt a lot of {{everything}} from your dear dead friend!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. H. Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> about her! She won't {{care for}} you, {{and when you}} come back, after having made an {{exhibition}} of yourself, you'll find me occupied with-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In the meanwhile, I {{will try}} to do nothing that could make you sorry you married me; and you have only to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> when <b>anything</b> does not please you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] the Duchess declared, [...] "that it is {{perfectly}} scandalous. Our police system must be in a disgraceful state. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> Prince,--could <b>anything</b> like that happen in your country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guilty," [...] Nigel confessed. [...] "You are an observant man, Prince. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> whether <b>anything</b> {{strikes you}} about the Bond Street of to-day, {{compared}} with the Bond Street of, say, ten years ago?" ...|$|R
