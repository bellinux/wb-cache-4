5000|$|Fernandes {{academic}} {{career at the}} UNSW at ADFA has been primarily focused on intelligence matters and Australian’s relations with Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Timor Leste. Since 2007 he has undertaken an exhaustive effort <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> by the Australian Government to block the release of documents in National Archives of Australia that would demonstrate Australia's knowledge of violence perpetrated against the Timorese in the early 1980s. His efforts were stifled by significant delays and vague arguments {{on the part of}} success governments to deny the release of documents beyond the 30 year rule because it would allegedly damage Australia's relations with Indonesia in the present time. “Cabinet of the day not only looked away from calamity, but participated enthusiastically in the subjugation of Timor.” Fernandes, 2013. Fernandes was embroiled in an intellectual dispute with Associate Professor Philip Mendes, from Monash University Faculty of Medicine, in 2005. Mendes responded to an article Fernandes had written about Chomsky in Overland magazine, arguing Fernandes had overlooked the implicit anti-semitism of Chomsky's notorious involvement in the Faurisson affair, when he said anti-holocaust deniers where not for that fact alone anti-Semitic. Responding in the same edition, Fernandes used Chomsky's own words to explain his often misunderstood argument and highlight Mendes' bias: [...] "Chomsky notes that the US public believes Vietnamese casualties in the Vietnam War to be approximately 100,000 although the official figure is two million and the actual figure is probably four million. But this does not necessarily imply that the entire US public are anti-Vietnamese racists. Similarly, most westerners deny, despite massive historic and demographic evidence, the genocide of approximately ten million Native Americans in North America and approximately one hundred million in South America. They are not necessarily anti-Native American racists... Racism is not the sole reason; others include ignorance, misinformation or incredulity." [...] Fernandes has also written a book about Chomsky, whom he has met, entitled Peace with Justice : Noam Chomsky in Australia. A review of academic Robert Manne's years as editor of Quadrant magazine, 1989-1997, written by Fernandes, attacked the academic's timidity in addressing the complicity of successive Australian governments with the Indonesian regime in East Timor. This review later received comment on the ABC. [...] "Mr Manne railed against crimes that he had no ability to stop, while largely ignoring a privileged opportunity to struggle against crimes in which his government was complicit. This is morally comparable to a Soviet commissar denouncing racism in the USA while saying little about the USSR's support for tyranny in Eastern Europe. Perhaps the comparison is unfair... to the commissar, who had reason to fear for his physical wellbeing in a way that a Western intellectual did not." [...] In 2016, the National Library of Australia awarded Fernandes a fellowship for his work, The bi-partisan consensus in Australian foreign policy, 1983.|$|E

Secession is an act to withdraw formally from a union, especially from a religious organisation. The secession of Lebowakgomo congregation from Lerato congregation took a decade before it was implemented. The secession was delayed by technical problems such as the expulsion of the minister, the death of an eider's son, the arrival of three ministers and various interpretations of the Church Order. The Process of secession was affected by the legacy of change within the community. That is, the idea of secession was introduced to the congregation by the minister in trying to curb congregation administration problems. This process could not take off because some of the congregants had not fully conceptualised the idea. The process of secession ended into conflicts of ideology and also in the interpretation of the Church Order of which lead to additional attitudinal developments within the management structures of the NGKA. The church council of Lebowakgomo also developed an attitude against the Synodical commission which lead to the involvement of the court of law as an arbitrator. The hypothesis tested in this thesis is: "Is Lebowakgomo congregation a legitimate congregation within the structures of the NGKA?" Lebowakgomo congregation is the first <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> made by the Synod. It is the first to demand its rights through the court of law. This was a drastic change with regard to the Church history of the NGKA. Thus, this study has traced the development of Lebowakgomo secession until it was legitimised by the court of law. The main thrust {{of this study was to}} provide academic reasoning to the following questions, Is secession legitimised after being approved by: - the Church council? - the Presbytery council? - after a secession ceremony was held? - after registration by the Synodical commission secretary? - after being published in the Church news paper? The positive ruling by the court of law in legitimising Lebowakgomo congregation within the structures of the NGKA, was noted in spite of dissatisfaction expressed by some church structures and church management. This clearly indicated that the role of church managers in a changing society is one in constant metamorphosis with regard to reconstructing and developing church organisation and management.

The Copyright Commission conducts the proceedings essentially based on the provisions amended by the Constitutional Tribunal in its judgment of 24 January 2006 case file SK 40 / 04, in which it ruled on the unconstitutionality of Article 108 (3) of the aforementioned Act on Copyright regarding proceedings before the Commission on the approval of the remuneration tables for the use of objects of copyright or performances submitted by collective management organizations. As a result of the amendment, the binding regulations provide for defining the scope of proceeding before the Commission on the approval of rates submitted by collective management organizations with ensuring, in case of contesting a Commission’s decision, the possibility to continue the proceedings before a general court. In the legislation the participation of parties in determining the composition of the adjudicating panel of the Commission, the introduction of restrictions on the length of proceedings and the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> of the adjudicating panel of the Commission by filing a relevant application to the participant and to submit the case to court were exposed. In the assessment of the proceeding concerning the approval of remuneration tables for objects of copyright or related rights, its consistency and compatibility with the concepts of the modern settlement of disputes were indicated. Additionally, the compliance of the provisions with the EU law standards laid down in the latest EU legislation was underlined, including regulations aimed at ensuring the coordination of national provisions concerning the conditions for copyright and related rights management by collective management organizations to ensure a high level of management, transparency and reporting according to the objectives of Directive 2014 / 26 /EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use in the internal market. It can be concluded that it is possible and desirable to use the modern alternative methods of dispute resolution in the area of proceeding on the approval of remuneration tables, particularly in disputes concerning the application of the approved remuneration tables.

40|$|Interviews with 42 Prison Governors, an {{analysis}} of job descriptions from 98 Governors, and original material reveal that their role and duties have changed in recent years. The introduction of New Public Management (NPM) into the Prison Service has made Governors far more accountable for the operation of their prisons. They are now expected to achieve performance targets, deliver efficiency savings, and to compete with other prisons. Line management of Governors has become robust. More is now delegated to Governors, {{but at the same}} time scope for local discretion has diminished. The administrative burden on Governors has increased significantly. Changes in the environment in which Governors operate have also had an impact on their work. In particular, recent years have seen a more punitive approach by the media, politicians, public and judiciary, and an increase in the ability and willingness of prisoners (and pressure groups) <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>a</b> Governor's <b>decision.</b> Governors today are at the same time: general managers (managing budgets and people, undertaking strategic planning, auditing and monitoring); leaders (acting as a figurehead, representing their establishment, providing vision and direction); operational commanders (dealing with incidents); and prison specialists (maintaining security, achieving order through effective control, and providing positive regimes). A key aspect of Governors' work has however remained unchanged over the years. This sui generis element involves balancing and regulating their prisons by exercising power, authority, influence and discretion in a way that protects individuals and mitigates the negative aspects of a closed institution. Governors must craft prison culture, blend the various approaches to maintaining order, and demonstrate clear moral and ethical standards. Governors still require 'grounded professionalism'. They manage their institutions based on their accumulated knowledge, practical experience and personal judgment. In doing so, they seek to ensure that prisoners are treated in a decent and humane way, their institutions are safe and clean, and opportunities exist for rehabilitation...|$|R
2500|$|The {{right to}} secure employment, either in one's current job or {{in a job}} that utilises a person's skills in the most {{socially}} productive way, is usually seen as crucial {{for the success of}} the economy and human development. The aim is to counterbalance the destructive effect on productivity and social costs that come from abuse of managerial power. Consistent with minimal international standards, employees in the United Kingdom have three principal job security rights, introduced originally by the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 and the Industrial Relations Act 1971. First, after one month's work an employee must have at least one week's notice before any dismissal, unless there has been gross misconduct. This minimum rises to two weeks after two years, three weeks after three years, and so on, up to twelve weeks after twelve years. Second, after two years' work, the dismissal must be fair. This means the employer must have a justification based on an employee's capability, conduct, redundancy or another good reason, or the employee can claim damages or the job back from an Employment Tribunal. Third, also after two years' work and if dismissed because the enterprise no longer needs someone doing the employee's job, there is a right to a redundancy payment. Like the notice period, redundancy pay increases according to the number of years worked. Contracts should usually go beyond this bare minimum, but cannot go below. Compared to its European and Commonwealth counterparts, jobs in the UK are relatively insecure. Workers have few ways, except pressure through collective bargaining, <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>a</b> management's <b>decision</b> about dismissals before they take place. When collective redundancies are proposed, however, EU law has introduced a requirement that employers consult on changes. EU law also introduced a rule that if a business is transferred, for instance, during a merger or acquisition, employees may not have their terms worsened or lose their jobs without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. If employees do lose their work, they may fall back on a minimal system of state insurance, funded primarily through income tax or National Insurance, to collect a [...] "jobseekers allowance", and may make use of public employment agencies to find employment again. The UK government has in the past aimed to create [...] "full employment" [...] however this goal has not necessarily translated into secure and stable work.|$|R

"May 2011 "The No Child Left Behind legislation of 2001 required 98 % of students in the United States to be assessed annually. No Child Left Behind along with the Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act of 2004 allowed for the most profoundly disabled two to three percent of students in each school district to be assessed by alternative processes. The State of Missouri uses the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP and MAP-A) to assess students as required by federal legislation during the spring of each year. When not qualifying in alternative assessment, certain accommodations to administration, setting, timing, and response can be provided to students with documented disabilities. Students <b>challenged</b> by <b>a</b> disability which moderately to severely affects their learning are among the most impacted by the requirements of federal and state government to be assessed annually. Likewise, the team making the decision for accommodations or alternative assessment is faced with the <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> for <b>a</b> testing route that provides the most leveled playing field possible for the student. This research targeted decision-making teams who made decisions about assessment for its third, fourth, and fifth graders who were <b>challenged</b> with moderate <b>to</b> severe disabilities. The purpose of this mixed method {{study was to examine the}} training, knowledge, and procedures used to make these decisions. This study used surveys and interviews with IEP team members and key school district leadership...|$|R
