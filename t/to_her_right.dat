5|$|The Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele {{is a large}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} completed around 1434–36 by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It {{shows the}} painting's donor, Joris van der Paele, within an apparition of saints. The Virgin Mary is enthroned at {{the centre of the}} semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with the Christ Child on her lap. St. Donatian stands <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>right,</b> Saint George—the donor's name saint—to her left. The panel was commissioned by van der Paele as an altarpiece. He was then a wealthy clergyman from Bruges, but elderly and gravely ill, and intended the work as his memorial.|$|E

She then heard another gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E

50|$|Ritsuko Okazaki {{was born}} in Hashima Island, Nagasaki Prefecture on 29 December 1959. She was born left-handed. During her childhood, she was forced by <b>her</b> mother <b>to</b> use <b>her</b> <b>right</b> hand. However, after hearing that it was bad <b>to</b> force <b>her</b> <b>to</b> use <b>her</b> <b>right</b> hand, <b>her</b> mother quickly advised <b>her</b> <b>to</b> use <b>her</b> natural hand. During her school days, she spent time in the bakery where she worked part-time, and practiced with her band, Eleanor. She was then {{in charge of the}} chorus and piano.|$|R

25|$|After {{stopping}} at the accident scene, Hugh Smith examined the singer, who was lying {{in the middle of}} the road with obviously severe injuries. He estimated she had lost about a half pint of blood and immediately noted a major traumatic injury <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> arm; it had been almost completely severed at the elbow. He stated that this injury alone did not cause her death. Although the light was poor, he observed only minor head injuries. He attributed her death to extensive and severe crush injuries to the entire right side of her body, consistent with a sideswipe collision.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the human}} pyramid {{to the right}} has a {{vigorous}} vertical thrust. The writhing of the woman tied to the horse, the upward reaching stretch of the figure to her left, the shocking mane of the horse, and the twisting and commanding figure of the soldier upon it, all give dynamism to the grouping as it rises. But {{at the foot of}} the pyramid, an old woman raises her head to gaze into the sky, and <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> a baby seeks maternal comfort from a clenched-fisted corpse. Body parts including a hand and forearm, and an indistinct, congealed bloody mass hover grimly above the infant.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} depicts complex {{personality and}} devotion to Mary. Her head is gently leaning <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>right,</b> {{her eyes are}} half closed, her hands are crossed in devotion; this reminds {{that she is a}} virgin, humble servant of the Lord, merciful mother and patron of the people. At the same time, her head is surrounded by an aureola with golden rays and her body is usually covered in elaborate gold and silver clothes and crowns; these are the symbols of her divine and majestic role as the Queen of Heaven. The painting also reminds of Tota pulchra es (You are all beautiful), an old Catholic prayer.|$|E

She caught an injury <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> hand during the {{marathon}} third set in the fourth round of the Wimbledon Championships against Cibulkova. “Unfortunately the right hand injury I suffered at Wimbledon is not 100 percent (fine) and my medical team has advised me to rest,” said Radwańska. She, however, was able to get back in shape before Rogers Cup in Montreal. At Rogers Cup, she defeated Monica Niculescu in straight sets before losing to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the third round.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} results the {{concluded}} that Genie's brain had completed lateralization and that, because Genie had received no stimulation in her language center {{when she was}} a child, it had atrophied and her language functions had instead lateralized <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> hemisphere. Her results on their non-language tests suggested to them that her hemispheric dominance was not simply reversed. They believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and attributed the extreme imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory stimulation as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile. Previous observations of right-hemisphere language acquisition in adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients consistently showed that both populations were much better at learning vocabulary, although they were able to learn some basic grammar. Linguists noted these subjects had an advantage over Genie because, unlike her, their right hemispheres had already acquired at least a small amount of basic language.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} slab, BM 536, {{the battle is}} evenly balanced, one Amazon and one Greek having the better of the {{fighting}} {{in a pair of}} duels. On the following slab, BM 533, appears the first casualty, BM 533:1, an Amazon probably holding the handle of an axe in her right hand as she collapses. Her helmet lies on the ground <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> side. The dress of the dying Amazon here, an overgirt peplos and mantle, distinguishes her from the other Amazon warriors who wear the more typical chitoniskos. The axe and helmet identify her as a combatant, and the peplos therefore must indicate that {{she is one of the}} three Amazonian queens who take part in the battle. As a queen and the first casualty she must be Melanippe, and the Greek who kills her must be Telamon. Telamon, BM 533:2, stands adjacent to his victim but now has tumed his spear to another.|$|E

25|$|Tea Time is an oil {{painting}} on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, {{seated at a}} table with a cup of tea. In the 'background', the upper left quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses the shape of the stretcher. The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears to be off <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>right,</b> with some reflected light {{on the left side of}} her face. Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here shoulders are coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's Divisionist period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E
25|$|Hantuchová beat Tatiana Golovin in {{straight}} sets, before losing to Dinara Safina. The following week, {{she reached the}} quarterfinals of Stuttgart with an easy victory over the then top-10 player Safina in the second round. This was both her first victory over a top-10 player and first appearance in a quarterfinal since January. In October 2006, Hantuchová reached {{the final of the}} Zurich Open. In the first round, she upset sixth seed Patty Schnyder. In the second round, she defeated her doubles partner Ai Sugiyama. Hantuchová was then scheduled to play world No. 1 Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals. However, Mauresmo withdrew due to a right shoulder injury. In the semifinals, Hantuchová upset world No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetsova, 6–4, 6–2, to reach the final of the Tier I event. In the final, Hantuchová lost in a tight three-setter to second seed Maria Sharapova, 1–6, 6–4, 3–6. The results in this tournament were the culmination of Hantuchová's up-turn of form, which kept her in the top 20, as she had arrived in Zurich outside the top group {{for the first time in}} over 11 months. The injury she suffered <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> rib after Mary Pierce hit a shot at her in doubles, caused her the most serious injury of her career and also forced her to retire in her match against Vesnina the following week in Linz. Hantuchová finished the year ranked No. 17 in the world, with a 34–25 record. She went 24–17 on hard courts, 5–4 on clay, 3–2 on grass, and 2–2 on carpet. She was 4–6 against top-10 players, beating Schnyder twice, Safina, and Kuznetsova, with losses to Sharapova (twice), Clijsters, Henin-Hardenne, Dementieva, and Nadia Petrova.|$|E

500|$|Only {{a few of}} Lavigne's tattoos {{are unique}} to her; the rest are matched with those of her friends.

500|$|An {{old woman}} sits {{to the right}} of the goat; her back to the viewer. Her face is half hidden, and she wears a white-hooded headdress {{resembling}} a nun's habit. She sits alongside bottles and vials on the ground <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>right.</b> Art critic Robert Hughes wonders if they [...] "contain the drugs and philtres needed for the devilish ceremonies". The eyes of some figures are lined with white paint. The faces of the two main figures– the goat and the woman to the far right– are hidden. The woman is separated from the group, she is perhaps a postulant about to be initiated into the coven. She may represent Goya's maid and probable lover Leocadia Weiss, whose full-length portrait appears in the same series.|$|E
