Using a modified tight-binding formalism that incorporates the effect of <b>tin</b> <b>alloying</b> on conduction band changes, we calculate how threshold current density and slope efficiency are affected by <b>tin</b> <b>alloying</b> in the presence of tensile strain and n-type doping. Our results show that while there exists a negative interaction between <b>tin</b> <b>alloying</b> and n-type doping, tensile strain can be effectively combined with <b>tin</b> <b>alloying</b> to dramatically improve the Ge gain medium in terms of both reducing the threshold and increasing the expected slope efficiency.

50|$|Pure {{aluminium}} naturally forms a thin {{surface layer}} of aluminium oxide on contact with {{oxygen in the}} atmosphere through a process called oxidation, which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in most environments. Aluminium alloys, however, offer little protection against corrosion. There are three main ways to passivate these alloys: alclading, chromate conversion coating and anodizing. Alclading {{is the process of}} metallurgically bonding a thin layer of pure aluminium to the aluminium alloy. Chromate conversion coating is a common way of passivating not only aluminum, but also zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and <b>tin</b> <b>alloys.</b> Anodizing forms a thick oxide coating. This finish is more robust than the other processes and also provides good electrical insulation, which the other two processes do not.|$|E
50|$|Chromate {{conversion}} coating {{is a type}} of {{conversion coating}} used to passivate steel, aluminum, zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and <b>tin</b> <b>alloys.</b> It is primarily used as a corrosion inhibitor, primer, decorative finish, or to retain electrical conductivity. The process is named after the chromate found in chromic acid, also known as hexavalent chromium, the chemical most widely used in the immersion bath process whereby the coating is applied. However, hexavalent chromium is toxic, thus, highly regulated, so new, non-hexavalent chromium-based processes are becoming more readily available at a commercial level. One alternative contains trivalent chromium. In Europe the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive is commonly referred to regarding elimination of hexavalent chromium in electrical and electronic equipment, and the REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals") Directive to wider applications including chromate conversion coating processes, paint primers and other preparations.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the first}} metal {{artifacts}} that archaeologists have identified have been tools or weapons, as well as objects used as ornaments such as jewellery. These early metal objects were made of the softer metals; copper, gold, and lead in particular, as the metals either as native metal or by thermal extraction from minerals, and softened by minimal heat (Craddock, 1995). While technology did advance {{to the point of}} creating surprisingly pure copper, most ancient metals are in fact alloys, the most important being bronze, an alloy of copper and <b>tin.</b> <b>Alloys</b> are mixtures of different metals created either by smelting or by forging. It {{is important to note that}} an ore does not necessarily constitute an alloy; ore is a collection of minerals and alloyed metals. As metallurgical technology developed (hammering, melting, smelting, roasting, cupellation, moulding, smithing, etc.), more metals were intentionally included in the metallurgical repertoire.|$|E

40|$|Zirconium anodizes {{similarly}} to tungsten {{in respect to}} the change of interference colors with applied voltage. However, the oxide layer on tungsten cannot reach as great a thickness. Hafnium does not anodize {{in the same way}} as zirconium but is similar to tantalum. By measuring the interference color and capacitative thicknesses on zirconium (Grades I and III) and a 2. 5 wt. % tin ailoy, the film was found to grow less rapidly in terms of capacitance than in terms of iaterference colors. This was interpreted to mean that cracks develop in the oxide as it thickens. The effect was most pronounced on Grade III zirconium and least pronounced on the <b>tin</b> <b>alloy.</b> The reduction in capacitative thickness was especially noticeable when white oxide appeared. Comparative measurements on Grade I zirconium and 2. 5 wt. % <b>tin</b> <b>alloy</b> indicated that the thickness of the oxide film on the <b>tin</b> <b>alloy</b> (after 16 hours in water) increased more rapidly with temperature than the film on zirconium.

Research and development of thermoelectric generators have been actively carried out to use waste heat. Electrodes are necessary {{to take out the}} electrical power from the thermoelectric couples. However, large portion of the generated electrical power is often lost at the interface between electrode and thermoelectric materials. Though oxide materials are promising for a thermoelectric generator at a high temperature, they are not practically used as the joining technique is not established.

30|$|In wire flame spraying, {{the main}} purpose of flame is to melt the {{feedstock}} material which is then driven with the stream of atomized air onto the workpiece [84]. The spray rates are generally in the range of 0.5 – 9  kg/h. Again, the material such as zinc and <b>tin</b> <b>alloys</b> which have lower melting point sprays at much higher rates. Substrate temperature varies from 95 to 205  °C because of the extra energy input essential for flame melting. Less than 10 % of the input energy is actually used to melt the feedstock material in most of the thermal spray processes. The spraying cost is low and the particle velocity is from 50 to 100  m/s. The efficiency of spray is quite low due to overspray and other losses. With this technique, coatings with high porosity are obtained [85].|$|E

40|$|Today's Photovoltaic module {{production}} {{is driven by}} cost. Due to its high conductivity and solderability the precious metal silver is used in standard solar cell production as base material for solder pads. The need for replacing the costly silver emerges in various PV metallization techniques On the rear side, these solder pads (busbars) locally prevent {{the formation of a}} back-surface-field (BSF) leading to a decrease in open-circuit voltage. We therefor aim at reducing the silver content in solar cells while maintaining the solderability. To face this challenge we developed an interconnection method based on ultra-sonic (US) soldering to contact the aluminum on standard crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. The method consists of a two-step process where first a <b>tin</b> <b>alloy</b> is employed directly on the aluminum and second conventional interconnectors are soldered onto the applied <b>tin</b> <b>alloy.</b> We investigate the adhesion of five different metallization pastes on the solar cells and compare it to the adhesion of soldered interconnector ribbons with our two-step US-soldering method on these metallizations. We find the adhesion of the solder joints to be independent of the metallization/cell adhesion. Metallographic analyses reveal that the <b>tin</b> <b>alloy</b> forms a direct contact to the Al-Si-eutectic underneath the metallization during our US process. The measured adhesive forces range from 0. 5 N/mm to 16 N/mm of the metallization/cell interface and from 1 N/mm to 2 N/mm for the US-solder joints.

40|$|Abstract. The {{microstructure}} {{and texture}} in dynamically recrystallized copper and two copper – <b>tin</b> <b>alloys</b> (2 wt % and 4. 5 wt % tin) has been investigated.

Dynamic recrystallization was initiated by the bulging of pre-existing high angle grain boundaries (HAGB), and occurred primarily by strain induced boundary migration (SIBM) and twinning. The addition of tin led to an increase in the temperature at which dynamic recrystallization initiated, and furthermore to a smaller dynamically recrystallized grain size. This was attributed to the effects of solute drag causing lower HAGB mobility. Dynamic recrystallization was observed to weaken the deformation texture components of brass and Goss, as well as introduce a cube texture component which generally tended to strengthen with temperature but weaken with increasing tin additions...|$|E

40|$|The LHC superconducting cables are {{submitted}} to a 200 °C heat-treatment in air {{in order to increase}} the resistance between the crossing strands (RC) within the cable. During this treatment the as-applied Sn-Ag alloy strand coating is transformed into a CuSn intermetallic compound layer. The microstructure, the surface topography and the surface chemistry of the non-reacted and reacted coatings have been characterised by different techniques, notably focused ion beam (FIB), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Based on the results obtained by these techniques the different influences that the intermetallics have on RC are discussed. The desired RC is obtained only when a continuous Cu 3 Sn layer is formed, i. e. a sufficient wetting of the Cu substrate by the <b>tinning</b> <b>alloy</b> is crucial. Among other effects the formation of the comparatively hard intermetallics roughens the surface and, thus, reduces the true contact area and it strongly affects the oxide growth on the strand surface.

The various microstructures that result from the slow cooling rate during the casting process enhance mechanical properties and were carefully examined.

30|$|SnO 2 {{has been}} {{examined}} as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries {{with a high}} theoretical capacity of 782 [*]mAh g− 1 [12]. SnO 2 forms metal alloys when reacting with lithium, leading to reversible transformations between lithium <b>tin</b> <b>alloys</b> (LixSn) and tin metal when the lithiation and delithiation proceed. However, the capacity of bulk SnO 2 electrode fades quickly during prolonged cycling [13]. To further improve the electrochemical performance and the cycle life of SnO 2 electrodes for long-term cycling, one approach is to synthesize nanosized SnO 2 crystals with different morphologies, such as nanowires [14], nanotubes [15], and mesoporous structure [16]. These nanostructured SnO 2 materials were reported to deliver greatly enhanced specific capacities with durable cycling stabilities. In order to mechanically buffer the volume expansion associated with the charge/discharge processes in the lithium-ion cells, the formation of SnO 2 /graphene nanocomposites has also been proved to be feasible. Many methods have been implemented to distribute SnO 2 nanocrystals on graphene nanosheets, including in situ chemical preparation [13, 17], reassembling process [18], gas–liquid interfacial synthesis [19], as well as hydrothermal and solvothermal methods [20, 21].|$|E
