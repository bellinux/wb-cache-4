5|$|Chas. H. Ross and Mr. Haybeck then {{testified to}} the {{articles}} he recovered from the Spray. The prosecutor, William H. Jelliffe, asked for another adjournment to await the arrival of Willis <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> the collision. Voorhees opposed the adjournment and moved for Jackalow's immediate release {{on the ground that}} there was no jurisdiction because no crime had been proved to have been committed. Jeliffe replied that he intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E
5|$|Private {{investigator}} George Newman {{claimed in}} 2001 that Chobert had recanted his testimony. Commentators {{also noted that}} police and news photographs {{of the crime scene}} did not show Chobert's taxi, and that Cynthia White, the only witness at the trial <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> seeing the taxi, had previously provided crime scene descriptions that omitted it. Cynthia White was declared to be dead by the state of New Jersey in 1992, but Pamela Jenkins claimed that she saw White alive as late as 1997. Mumia supporters often claim that White was a police informant and that she falsified her testimony against Abu-Jamal.|$|E

5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.|$|E

25|$|Gacy had {{attempted}} to convince the doctors that he suffered from a multiple personality disorder. His lawyers opted to have Gacy plead {{not guilty by reason}} of insanity to the charges against him, and produced several psychiatric experts who had examined Gacy the previous year <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> their findings. Three psychiatric experts appearing for the defense at Gacy's trial testified they found Gacy to be a paranoid schizophrenic with a multiple personality disorder.|$|E
25|$|On 4 May (5 {{days before}} Meinhof's death) the four {{defendants}} requested to provide {{data about the}} Vietnam War. They claimed that since the military intervention in Vietnam by U.S (and indirectly FRG), had violated international law, the U.S. military bases in West Germany were justifiably targets of international retaliation. They requested several politicians (like Richard Nixon and Helmut Schmidt) {{as well as some}} former US agents (who were willing <b>to</b> <b>testify)</b> <b>to</b> be called as witnesses.|$|E
25|$|According {{to federal}} prosecutors, Peter Milano once {{discussed}} in the 1980s {{with members of the}} Cleveland crime family a plot to have Dragna murdered for violating the oath of Omertà. During Milano’s arrest in 1987, prosecutors were going to call Cleveland crime family underboss-turned-government witness Angelo Lonardo <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> this allegation. Milano’s lawyer strongly denied these allegations, stating that if it were true, Dragna would have received a formal warning from the FBI. Milano pleaded guilty to racketeering charges and a trial never took place.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mishnah and Tosefta, in the Maccabean, Herodian, and Mishnaic periods, new {{months were}} {{determined}} by the sighting of a new crescent, with two eyewitnesses required <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> the Sanhedrin to having seen the new lunar crescent at sunset. The practice {{in the time of}} Gamaliel II (c. 100 CE) was for witnesses to select the appearance of the moon from a collection of drawings that depicted the crescent in a variety of orientations, only a few of which could be valid in any given month. These observations were compared against calculations.|$|E
25|$|A celebration to God’s {{glory and}} to the dignity of man. All that’s left most artists seem to feel these days, is man. Naked, poor, forked radish. There aren’t any celebrations. Ours, the {{scientists}} keep telling us, is a universe, which is disposable. You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark where we have been, <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> what we had it in us, to accomplish.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecutors}} {{presented a}} case that indicated Gacy was sane and fully in control of his actions. To support this contention, they produced several witnesses <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> the premeditation of Gacy's actions and the efforts he went {{to in order to}} escape detection. Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Two witnesses who testified were PDM employees, who confessed Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. One of these employees, David Cram, testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a drainage trench.|$|E

25|$|In 1990–1991 Ben-Menashe {{said that}} he had been {{personally}} involved in assisting the Republican campaign with its October Surprise (preventing the Iranian hostages being released before the 1980 election). He also gave Seymour Hersh information about Israel's nuclear program, which was published in Hersh's book The Samson Option. Ben-Menashe then fled to Australia, and in his application for refugee status declared himself a victim of persecution of the Israeli and US governments. For his return to the US in May 1991 <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> Congress, journalist Robert Parry received a tip from an intelligence source that the US was planning to divert Ben-Menashe to Israel, where Ben-Menashe feared he would be charged for revealing official secrets. With a delay to Ben-Menashe's flight, Congressional investigators were able to extract assurances from the US government.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent an}} {{uprising}} in Baltimore, a Union artillery garrison {{was placed on}} Federal Hill with express orders to destroy the city should Southern sympathizers overwhelm law and order there. Following the Baltimore riot of 1861, Union troops {{under the command of}} General Benjamin F. Butler occupied the hill {{in the middle of the}} night. This was against Washington orders. Butler and his men erected a small fort, with cannon pointing towards the central business district. Their goal was to guarantee the allegiance of the city and the state of Maryland to the federal government under threat of force. This fort and the Union occupation persisted for the duration of the Civil War. A large flag, a few cannon, and a small Grand Army of the Republic monument remain <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> this period of the hill's history.|$|E
25|$|Carlito is apprehended {{by police}} {{and taken to}} the office of District Attorney Norwalk (James Rebhorn), where he is played a tape of Kleinfeld {{offering}} <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> false criminal allegations against Carlito. Norwalk advises that he is aware of Carlito as an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders in an attempt to leverage him into betraying Kleinfeld to save himself, but Carlito refuses. Carlito visits Kleinfeld under police protection in the hospital, where he confesses to selling him out. Having noticed a suspicious man dressed in a police uniform waiting in the lobby, Carlito deftly unloads Kleinfeld's revolver and parts ways with him. The man turns out to be Tony T's other son, Vinnie (Joseph Siravo), seeking vengeance for his brother and father. Vinnie sneaks into Kleinfeld's room and executes him without incident because of Kleinfeld's empty gun.|$|E
