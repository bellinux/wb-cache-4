To reveal this, I developed a <b>teaching</b> <b>plan</b> consisting of four activities. In which the students were going to construct fraction problems, knowledge of reciprocal fractions and perceive knowledge of correlations between different representations of the same value. This representation was: fraction, decimal numbers, percentage and geometrical. The research questions for the study are: 1. How does a teacher evaluate a <b>teaching</b> <b>plan</b> emphasizing practical fraction activities? 2. How does a teacher evaluate use of practical activities in teaching of mathematics, and what are the reasons for teacher’s use or don’t use of such activities? Data collection in the study consist of three phases, two unstructured interviews, one before and one after the <b>teaching</b> <b>plan</b> was carried out in the classroom, and observations during the teaching. The teacher evaluated and had suggestions to the <b>teaching</b> <b>plan.</b> Subsequently I conducted a pre-analysis where I made changes in the <b>teaching</b> <b>plan.</b> In the second unstructured interview with the teacher, we discussed the teacher’s beliefs and attitude towards the completed <b>teaching</b> <b>plan</b> and general perceptions of the use of practical activities. The theoretical framework of the study is built upon perceptions and how teachers' beliefs influence teaching practice. Learning styles, the Dunn and Dunn learning style model and Böstrom research on perception preferences in my theoretical framework, highlights that students learn in different ways. The theory chapter also includes previous studies on perceptions and use of practical activities. The findings indicate that the teacher has a positive attitude towards use of practical activities, but that the use of these activities is limited by several factors where particularly the pressure on time and exam in the secondary schools are highlighted. The findings indicate that use of practical activities are elements of teaching that helps students experience increased motivation and interest in mathematics, but also that practical activities facilitates for different learning styles.

The historical usage of the term might not correspond with contemporary understanding of LGBT identities, while information on non-heterosexual sexuality and variations from gender roles as we understand them today has been substantially eradicated by Victorian morality brought by colonizers and Christian missionaries. Although circumstantial, there remains some evidence that takatāpui lived without discrimination in pre-European times. Some contemporary Māori LGBT people use the terms gay and lesbian as a convenience, while others self-identify as takatāpui to resist the colonization of their identities and bodies which would [...] "deny access to important ancestral knowledge". [...] Some use both terms depending on the context. Using takatāpui to self-identify requires acceptance of oneself as Māori as well as being LGBT. About one fifth of Māori are young people, but the state education system does not explicitly provide for exploring multiple identities.
