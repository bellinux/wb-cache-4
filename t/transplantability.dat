40|$|In {{this paper}} Dr Anthony Forsyth {{examines}} the long-standing conceptual debate in comparative law literature about whether, {{and if so}} in what circumstances, {{it is possible to}} ‘transplant’ laws from one legal system to another. The paper also focuses specifically on how the <b>transplantability</b> debate has played out in the field of labour law. The major contributions to the debate in the comparative law and comparative labour law literature are discussed in Parts II and III of the paper. In Part IV, these various approaches to legal <b>transplantability</b> are assessed, to determine which of them offers the greatest assistance in identifying the factors that are likely to affect whether laws can be successfully borrowed from overseas jurisdictions. The paper concludes that Teubner’s analysis of the interaction between law and various social systems provides the soundest conceptual framework for considering the <b>transplantability</b> of labour laws, and in particular, the potential for successful Australian adoption of European labour law concepts and institutions...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -It is {{confirmed}} that C 3 H mammary tumours {{are much more}} easily transplantable in histocompatible recipients when these have been reared on C 3 H milk, than when they have been reared on milk from the inbred Swiss/B strain. By contrast, A. CA mammary tumours transplanted in histocompatible hosts reared on A. CA or Swiss/B milk, grow almost equally well in both sorts of recipient. Thus, rearing on Swiss/B milk has different effects on the <b>transplantability</b> of mammary tumours of C 3 H and A. CA. On the other hand, recipients which were reared on C 3 H or A. CA milks accept grafts of C 3 H mammary tumours about equally, suggest-ing that milks from A. CA and C 3 H {{have the same effect}} on the <b>transplantability</b> of C 3 H mammary tumours. The different action of Swiss/B milk on tumours of C 3 H and A. CA seems best attributed to differences between C 3 H and A. CA tumours or between mouse strain genotypes.

40|$|Injection of DBA/ 2, C 57 Bl/ 6, or BALB/c mice with {{antibody}} to mouse interferon alpha/beta {{enhanced the}} i. p. <b>transplantability</b> of six different murine tumors, as manifested {{by an increase}} in the percentage of tumor-bearing mice and a decrease in survival time. The effect was observed in mice injected with antibody to interferon raised in three sheep, a goat, and a rabbit, but not with sheep antibody to "impurities" present in the mouse interferon preparations or with normal sheep or goat globulins. The enhancement in <b>transplantability</b> was most marked when tumor cells had been previously passaged in vitro and were of low tumorigenicity. Analysis of some of the experimental conditions using interferon-sensitive and interferon-resistant lines of Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC) showed that the enhancing effect was observed over a wide range of tumor cell inocula, was directly related to the amount of antibody to interferon injected and was most pronounced when antibody was administered at the time of tumor cell injection. Enhancement was also observed when FLC were injected subcutaneously (s. c.). Antibody did not act directly on the tumor cells in vitro. Although we were unable to demonstrate any biologically active interferon in mice before or after tumor cell inoculation, the results suggest that endogenous interferon is present and plays a role in inhibiting the <b>transplantability</b> of some murine tumors in immunocompetent mice...|$|E

40|$|Aim. To {{study in}} {{experiment}} {{the criteria for}} <b>transplantability</b> of multicellular spheroid microaggregates of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), prepared by the method of 3 D cell culture. Materials and Methods. 11 donor eyes (6 of adrenaline index «A», 5 of index «B») were used {{as a source of}} RPE cell cultures (group «A» – 6 cultures, group «B» – 5 cultures), of which over 2000 RPE spheroids were obtained by the method of three-dimensional cell culture. 1760 spheroids of them were selected for <b>transplantability</b> investigation (960 – group «A», 800 – group «B»). Among the selected spheroids were equal numbers of spheroids of different morphology («smooth» and «rough») and of the initial cell seeding number (500, 1000, 5000, 25 000, 125 000 cells per hanging drop).  We were taking out 12 spheroids of group «A» and 10 spheroids of group «B» of the 3 D culture in terms of 7,  14, 21, 28 days of 3 D culture to assess their viability. We were transferring the same number of spheroids in the same terms from 3 D to 2 D culture conditions to assess their adhesive properties. Viability of cells within spheroids was determined using the Trypan blue exclusion. The presence or absence of adhesion was determined by microscopic observation. Results. «Smooth» spheroids of 7 and 14 days of pretransplantation cultivation and derived from hanging drops containing 500 and 1000 cells showed the highest <b>transplantability</b> (cell viability varied from 0. 83 ± 0. 38 to 0. 94 ± 0. 24, a 100 % adhesion). «Rough» spheroids were untransplantable in all variants, despite their partial preservation of viability (in comparison to “smooth” ones p 0. 05 for low cell numbers, p 0. 05) on resulting spheroids transplantability. Conclusion.

40|$|THE {{ability of}} {{cortisone}} to expedite the induction, <b>transplantability</b> and metastasis {{of various types}} of epidermal and connective-tissue tumours is still somewhat debatable (see Baserga and Shubik, 1954; Ghadially and Green, 1954; Piccagli et al., 1954, and Gillman et al., 1955 for critical reviews of relevant literature). There is, however, some evidence that cortisone administration may alter somewhat the pathogenesis of methylcholanthrene-induced skin tumours (Boutwell and Rusch, 1953; Gillman et al., 1955). A careful analysis of the literature indicates that discrepancies in the various reported effects of cortisone on the induction, metastasis and <b>transplantability</b> of tumours are largely attributable, firstly, to differences in the times of initiation of cortisone treatment {{in relation to the}} application of carcinogens (Ghadially and Green, 1954) and, secondly, to the type of tumour being investigated (see Baserga and Shubik, 1954 for discussion).

By contrast, A. CA mammary tumours transplanted in histocompatible hosts reared on A. CA or Swiss/B milk, grow almost equally well in both sorts of recipient. Thus, rearing on Swiss/B milk has different effects on the <b>transplantability</b> of mammary tumours of C 3 H and A. CA. On the other hand, recipients which were reared on C 3 H or A.

40|$|These {{experiments}} set out {{to assess}} the role of NK and B cells in the resistance of nude mice to human tumor xenotransplantation. The <b>transplantability</b> of 9 fresh and 8 cultured human tumors was compared in 2 strains of mice with different genetic immune deficiencies: athymic NCr/Sed (nu/nu) nude mice, and nude-beige-xid (N:NIH-nu-bg-xid/Sed mice). Flow cytometric studies showed both strains to be deficient in Thy. 1. 2 (T) cells and unresponsive to stimulation by Concanavalin A (Con A) or direct T-cell-receptor triggering with anti-CD 3. The number of B cells was similar in the 2 strains, but the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was markedly reduced in the nude-beige-xid animals. The number of asialoGM 1 -positive cells (predominantly NK) detected by flow cytometry was also reduced in the nude-beige-xid mice. The <b>transplantability</b> of the human tumors {{was found to be}} equivalent in the 2 strains. Quantitative cell-transplantation assays performed for 2 of the tumor cell lines did not reveal any subtle transplantation advantage for the more broadly immune-deficient animals.

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem and}} {{progenitor}} cells (HSPC) for {{bone marrow transplantation}} are currently obtained directly from living voluntary donors or from cord blood units. However, a suitable donor is not always found. Because HSPC {{are known for their}} relative resistance to hypoxia, using an experimental murine model, we explored cadaveric bone marrow (BM) as their alternative source. After donor mice were sacrificed, BM was left in intact femurs at 37 °C, 20 °C, or 4 °C under ischemic conditions, resulting in combined oxygen and metabolic substrate shortage and the accumulation of metabolic waste products. BM cells were harvested after a set time period ranging from 0 to 48 hours. To determine the impact of delayed harvesting on the <b>transplantability</b> of HSPC, a competitive repopulation assay using a murine Ly 5. 1 /Ly 5. 2 congenic model in 2 different settings was used: after submyeloablative (6 Gy) or myeloablative (9 Gy) total-body irradiation, Ly 5. 2 hosts received cadaveric Ly 5. 1 cells or a mixture of cadaveric Ly 5. 1 cells and fresh Ly 5. 2 cells in a 1 : 1 ratio. Chimerism resulting from cadaveric donor cells, followed up to 6 months after transplantation, proved that the long-term repopulation ability of HSPC was fully preserved for 2 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours at 37 °C, 20 °C, and 4 °C of ischemia, respectively. A colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) clonogenic assay revealed a higher sensitivity of proliferating hematopoietic progenitors to ischemia compared to repopulating cells (STRC and LTRC). Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis in cadaveric BM demonstrated that the LSK (LinlowSca- 1 +c-Kit+) subpopulation, enriched in HSPC, contained less apoptotic and dead cells than the BM as a whole. Furthermore, the number of LSK SLAM (CD 150 +CD 48 −) and LSK SP (side population) cells (fractions highly enriched in hematopoietic stem cells) decreased in parallel with BM <b>transplantability.</b> As well as cadaveric BM cells, we also tested the <b>transplantability</b> and survival of BM cells after storage in a suspension in vitro without specific hematopoietic growth factors. HSPC did not display any decrease in <b>transplantability</b> after 2 days of storage at 37 °C or 4 days at 4 °C. A higher sensitivity of progenitors to unfavorable conditions was observed again using CFU-S and granulocyte macrophage-colony forming cell (GM-CFC) assays, especially at 37 °C.

40|$|THE HUMAN TUMOUR/nude mice {{model has}} been widely used in studies of human tumours, {{including}} screening systems of anti-tumour agents. However, because of the limited size of nude mice, this model is inconvenient for experiments requiring large quantities of human tumour cells, or repeated examinations of host blood. Larger experimental animals for the heterotransplantation of human tumours are therefore desirable.

The {{potential for}} liver metastasis was analyzed histopathologically from intrasplenic injections of tumor cell suspensions prepared from subcutaneous tumors. Tumor fragments prepared aseptically from 15 AFP-producing and 140 non-AFP-producing gastric cancers were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice with <b>transplantability</b> rates of 80 % (12 / 15 cases) and 50 % (70 / 140 cases), respectively. The mean tumor doubling times in the first generation were 10. 6 days for AFP-producing and 13. 2 days for non-AFP-producing gastric carcinomas. Serially transplantable tumor lines in nude mice were established from six AFP-producing and 10 non-AFP-producing carcinomas. When tumor cell suspensions prepared from the subcutaneous tumors were injected into spleens, all six AFP-producing carcinomas (two poorly differentiated and four tubular adenocarcinomas) but only four out of the 10 non-AFP-producing carcinomas (two poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, one mucinous carcinoma and one papillary adenocarcinoma) demonstrated a potential for liver metastasis. The results indicate AFP-producing gastric carcinomas to possess a higher potential for liver metastasis than do non-AFP-producing carcinomas, a distinguishing feature which thus reflects a poor prognosis.

40|$|In {{a review}} of the {{chromosome}} cytology of ascites tumors in rats, Makino (1957) with some available evidence has expressed the view that the stability of the stem-cells is not always permanent, though the constancy is very pronounced, and that the tumors have undergone numerical and structural changes of chromosomes in correlation with shift of the neoplastic condition. Evidently the genetic constitution of a rat ascites tumor is closely correlated with the chromosome pattern of its stem-cells. Change in the stemline Chromo-somes induce alteration of the tumor genotype, resulting in the rise of a new tumor. Accord-ing to Makino and Sasaki (1958), the Yoshida sarcoma subline D was a derivative of subline C produced through the inoculation of tumor cells subjected to freezing; these two ascites tumors differ from one another not only in their chromosome pattern, but also in their property such as <b>transplantability,</b> though they are cellular descendants from the stock tumor. The <b>transplantability</b> of Yoshida sarcoma subline C to rats of Fischer strain was about 0 per cent, though that of subline D was 80 per cent.

No evidence was obtained that the concentration of MMC below the above gained cytostatic effect by the addition of UK in vitro. 2) Definite suppression of take of the transplanted tumor cell and marked prolongation of interval between the transplantation and take were observed, when the combined intraperitoneal administration of MMC and UK was started in the day of the transplantation, compaired with that in mice MMC alone was samely given. The growth of the tumor was retarded in accordance with this suppression in the tumor take. It was also observed that the take of the tumor cell was diminished to some extent even in mice treated with UK alone. However, when the treatment was started 10 days after the transplantation, the growth of established tumors was not affected by the combined application of UK.

These cells appeared first in the spleen and later in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and liver. They consisted of a heterogeneous population at different degrees of malignancy as determined by successive transfers in vivo and in vitro. The observations clearly show that leukemias induced by Friend viruses evolve by multistep processes, in which different stages of malignancy can be detected...|$|E
40|$|Three {{tissue culture}} strains were {{established}} from MN-lymphosarcoma cells originally carried intraperitoneally in NA 2 female mice. They have been maintained by serial subcultivation {{for more than}} 16 months. There were no apparent differences except for cell size in morphological features among the 3 trains. When inoculated into mice intermittetly after prolonged maintenance in vistro, strain No. 1 and No. 3 cells induced ascites tumor formation and a mortality of 80 ～ 100 %. Strain No. 2 cells seemed to have lost their <b>transplantability.</b> When the cultured stain No. 1 cells were longer in the first passage, was shortened within a few geberations to that of tha original mouse-to-mouse passage. This result might be discussed on the hupothesis of a gradual transformaion of cells for adaptaion to growth in altered enviroment...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY-Normal prelactating mammary {{tissues from}} C 3 H/Crgl and A/Crgl female mice were cultured for 3, 5, or 15 days in media with no, minimal, or {{complete}} (secretion-inducing) hormone supplementation. His-tological integrity proved a poor indicator of subsequent development after transplantation: Disorganized and necrotic explants grew {{as well as}} those maintained in culture in an active secretory condition. -J Nat Cancer Inst 40 : 1267 - 1271, 1968. ALTHOUGH PRENEOPLASTIC mammary tis-sues (primary hyperplastic alveolar nodules and outgrowths derived from them) from mice have been successfully transplanted after various periods in organ culture (1 - 3), observations on the survival and growth potential of comparable normal tissues are lacking. The present note reports on the survival and subsequent <b>transplantability</b> of organ-cultured explants of prelactating mammary tissue. MATERIALS AND METHOD...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the complex}} {{cellular}} arrangement {{found in the}} bone marrow stroma there exists a subset of nonhematopoietic cells referred to as mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC). These cells can be expanded ex vivo and induced, either in vitro or in vivo, to terminally differentiate into at least seven types of cells: osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, tenocytes, myotubes, astrocytes and hematopoietic-supporting stroma. This broad multipotentiality, the feasibility to obtain MPC from bone marrow, cord and peripheral blood and their <b>transplantability</b> support the impact {{that the use of}} MPC will have in clinical settings. However, a number of fundamental questions about the cellular and molecular biology of MPC still need to be resolved before these cells can be used for safe and effective cell and gene therapies intended to replace, repair or enhance the physiological function of the mesenchymal and/ or hematopoietic systems...|$|E
40|$|It {{is by now}} {{a commonplace}} that {{we are living in}} a period of radical global transformation. Particularly in the {{developing}} world, this transformation has had two watchwords: markets and democracy. Indeed, the reascendant teleology of free-market democracy has redefined the very concept of underdevelopment-a term that has shed its exclusively Third World trappings and today joins in a single embrace countries from Algeria to Azerbaijan, from Pakistan to Poland. Marketization and democratization each have been the site of massive Western legal intervention in the developing world. Legal work on marketization ranges from structuring international project finance to drafting market-oriented laws to developing legal regimes that facilitate the transition from command to market economies. Work on democratization includes not only writing constitutions but also grappling with formidable issues such as the <b>transplantability</b> of Western social and political institutions and postcommunist state building...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Observations {{over the}} past two decades {{indicate}} that waterlogged conditions in the nursery can adversely affect the <b>transplantability</b> of loblolly pine (Pi us taeda) seedlings. Waterlogged seedbeds can occur when frequent rain falls over an extended period of time. Anaerobic conditions can result when warm soils remain saturated for just a few days. At some nurseries, rainfall exceeded 50 mm/week for a period of three weeks or more during November. Fertilization in October might exacerbate the problem due to an increase in respiration of soil microbes. An extended period of anaerobic conditions can alter both the physiology and structure of pine roots. When seedlings are lifted just after a period of anaerobic soil and transplanted in December or early January, a quick death can result due to a lack of new root growth (death often occurs from the roots up as opposed to from the tops down) ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>transplantability</b> of a xenografted human {{adenocarcinoma}} {{has been}} examined in mice {{that had been}} immune-suppressed by thymectomy and whole-body irradiation and {{the results have been}} compared with transplantation into athymic (nude) mice. Two alternative techniques were used to prevent marrow failure following whole-body irradiation: reconstituting the animals with a marrow graft, or protecting them by an injection of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) 2 days before the irradiation. The results show that the Ara-C-prepared mice were more receptive to transplantation than marrow-grafted or nude mice, and they were the only animals that developed regional metastases from implanted xenografts. Some recovery of immunity occurred in both types of immune-suppressed mice, which was evident more than 5 weeks after immune-suppression and which was more marked in females than in males. It was concluded that the immune-suppressed mice were superior to nude mice for short-term experiments but they may be less satisfactory for long-term experiments...|$|E
