30|$|Where {{there is}} {{significant}} yaw movement, part of the yaw rotation is manifested as a distributed curvature along the track bridge and part as concentrated rotations at the ends. The extent of each is governed by the lateral bending stiffness of the frame {{made up of the}} (longitudinal) rails and the (transverse) bearer bars. The fasteners that connect the rails to the bearer bars allow some rotation, and if fasteners with no longitudinal restraint are used, then the rotation is essentially free, so that system is flexible and promotes distributed curvature along the track bridge. Guard rails mounted rigidly in the <b>track</b> <b>panel</b> provide more frame action, make the track bridge stiffer, and thus force more of the total rotation into the concentrated rotations at the ends of the track bridge.|$|E
40|$|A {{sustainable}} energy supply {{is required in}} Malaysia to meet the increasing electricity demand with rapid growing in population and economy. Photovoltaic solar panel is most suitable alternative way to generate electricity in Malaysia where most of its location receives large number of solar radiation throughout the year. However, fixed solar panel is more preferred than <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> because it is cost effective. In present work, the power output and efficiency of single-axis <b>tracking</b> solar <b>panel</b> is compared with fixed solar panel by experimentally in East Coast Malaysia. A single-axis <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> produces higher power output than fixed panel up to 28 W. During this time, the average efficiency of <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> was about 66. 70 % and fixed panel was 39. 96 %. Hence, the percentage increment on average power output using <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> reached up to 66. 92 % compare to fixed panel during this period. The <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> module efficiency was higher than fixed panel {{for the same period}} and can reach up to 28. 9 % at 6. 00 p. m. In conclusion, single-axis <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> is more efficient than fixed panel in premeridian and postmeridian. Thus, it produces higher power output than fixed panel which means it utilize the most of available solar radiation effectively and this will reduce payback period of the initial investment cost...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the gain in {{extraterrestrial}} radiation received by a single-axis <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> {{relative to a}} fixed panel was systematically analyzed over a specific period of time. The dynamic angle that the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> should rotate by in order to follow the sun was derived {{through a series of}} spherical trigonometric procedures. The instantaneous incident angle of sunlight upon the panel was then calculated, assuming that the panel would simultaneously follow the sun's position. Thus, instantaneous increments of solar energy received by the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> relative to the fixed panel are originally presented. The results show that the angle the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> has to rotate by is 0 Â° at solar noon, and increases towards dawn or dusk. The incident angle of sunlight upon the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> is always smaller than that upon the fixed panel, except at solar noon. As for panels installed with a yearly optimal tilt angle in Taipei, the gains are between 36. 3 % and 62. 1 % for four particular days of year, between 37. 8 % and 60. 8 % for the four seasons and 49. 3 % over the entire year. The amount of radiation collected by the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> is enhanced as the maximum rotation angle is increased. The irradiation ratio of the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> to the fixed panel is close to 1. 5 for latitudes below 65 Â° and gradually increases for latitudes above this. The yearly optimal tilt angle of a south-facing fixed panel is approximately equal to 0. 9 multiplied by the latitude (i. e. 0. 9 Â xÂ [phi]) for latitudes below 65 Â° and is about 56 Â +Â  0. 4 Â xÂ ([phi]Â -Â  65) otherwise. <b>Tracked</b> <b>panel</b> Rotation angle Incident angle Extraterrestrial radiation Gain...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBallasted track {{sleepers}} have the important function of providing sufficient lateral resistance {{to prevent the}} lateral movement of rails. If the lateral force induced by the thermal expansion of steel rails overcomes the lateral resistance of sleepers, rail buckling may occur. More {{attention has been paid}} to this problem of lateral stability since the introduction of continuous welded rails. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the prediction of the lateral resistance of sleepers. In view of the foregoing, a series of laboratory tests was conducted on 1 / 5 -scale models to evaluate the lateral resistance of sleepers. Single-sleeper pullout tests and <b>track</b> <b>panel</b> pullout tests were conducted on different types of concrete sleepers. The results of the pullout tests revealed the effects of the sleeper shape, the sleeper spacing, and the number of sleepers on the lateral resistance. Based on the model test results, a new numerical method for evaluating the lateral resistance of sleepers is proposed...|$|E

The tracks are reinforced by suspending every other <b>track</b> <b>panel,</b> so that construction of the open cut tunnel foundation under the ballast bed can be executed without affecting safe operation of the railway; arch-shaped steel pipe supports are used to decrease the interchange of HV contact wire during the construction without affecting normal operation of the railway; arch lining trolley is created to lift, slide and be electricity-proof, so that the work above the contact wire would not contact with the wire, and construction of arch ring and changing formwork would not be obstructed by normal operation.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the study}} for the {{dimensioning}} {{as well as the}} selection of the individual materials constituting a railway track, the ballast and the substructure present residual deformations, directly related to the deterioration of the geometry of the track. The slighter the residual deformations and the slower their alteration over time is, the better the quality of the track. The actions acting on the <b>track</b> <b>panel</b> are almost proportionally dependent on the total track stiffness that is also influenced seriously by the fastening's and total track's stiffness. This implies that the average stress on ballast underneath the sleepers’ seating surface is also influenced by the stiffness. It is imperative to reduce as much as possible the average stresses at the sleepers’ seating surface, by increasing track's stiffness. In the Greek network since the late 1980 's up to 2000 an extended research program was performed due to cracks on twin-block concrete sleepers (over 60 % on the total number laid on track). In the frame of this investigation, a new approach for the actions on sleepers and the ballast has been developed, by taking into account the real conditions of the line (maintenance etc.) which led to the increase of the demands in the specifications for the use of very resilient fastenings...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{determine}} the energy losses in the shock absorber of the freight car whose wheel-set moves in the derailed state on the <b>track</b> <b>panel</b> depending on the axle load and structural parameters of spring suspension. Methodology. On the basis of spring suspension construction analysis and operating principle of the friction shock absorber of the freight car bogie the authors provide the method for determining the energy absorbed by it. The calculations take the maximum values of the absorber elements displacement and the regulatory values of spring suspension parameters. Findings. The authors obtained the calculated formula for determining the energy absorbed by shock absorber for regulation-set mounting schemes of elastic bogie elements depending on the axial load. The mentioned curves are parabolic. Originality. The work examines the crash mode of the wheel-set movement on the track panels after its derailment. It is shown that the energy dissipation in the shock absorbers is the reason for increase in resistance to rolling stock movement. The formulas for calculating the amount of energy dissipated in the shock absorber with a maximum displacement of its elements are derived. This energy depends on the axle load and structural parameters of spring suspension. Practical value. The proposed method allows setting the value of the additional resistance to motion that occurs in crash mode which makes it possible to increase the accuracy of traction calculations...|$|E
