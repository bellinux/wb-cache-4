'The Fly' feels different to me." [...] The video appears on the DVD for The Best of 1990-2000, along with the directors' commentaries.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 May 1953, Bunin left in {{his diary}} a note {{that proved to be}} his last one. [...] "Still, this is so dumbfoundingly extraordinary. In a very short while {{there will be no more}} of me– and of all the things worldly, of all the affairs and destinies, from then on I will be unaware! And what I'm left <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> dumbly try to {{consciously}} impose upon myself fear and amazement," [...] he wrote.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} anybody is <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> {{a man as}} mad as a March hare, and yet nobody can touch him. If {{it was not for}} the child, I should advise Emily to put him out of her head altogether." ...|$|E
60|$|Franklin (the chief mate's {{name was}} Franklin) felt disappointed; almost disillusioned. Silly thing <b>to</b> <b>do!</b> <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> a confounded old ship-keeper set talking. He snubbed the ship-keeper, {{and tried to}} think of that {{insignificant}} bit of foolishness no more; for it diminished Captain Anthony in his eyes of a jealously devoted subordinate.|$|R
6000|$|... "How can we {{tell what}} work {{he may have}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here?</b> He <b>is</b> not an idler {{travelling}} for his pleasure. His time may not be his own--nor yet his thoughts, perhaps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{pretty well}} in the exams, though, for Dad's sake," [...] {{answered}} Millicent, throwing aside her wraps. [...] "But I don't mean to kill myself studying, just the same. Time enough for that when exams draw nigh. They're comfortably far off yet. But I'm {{in a bit of}} a predicament, Worth, and I don't know what <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> two invitations for Saturday afternoon and I simply must accept them both. Now, how can I do it? You're a marvel at mathematics--so work out that problem for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Old Tom {{calls this}} sort of a wharf his door-yard," [...] {{observed}} Hurry, as he fastened the canoe, after he and his Companion had left it: [...] "and the gallants from the forts have named it the castle court though what a 'court' can have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> more than I can tell you, seeing {{that there is no}} law. 'Tis as I supposed; not a soul within, but the whole family is off on a v'y'ge of discovery!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{say with}} common felons! A downright robbery of twenty pounds, just {{as though he}} had broken into the bank! And so he did, with sly artifice, which is worse in such hands than a crowbar. And now what are we <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> Thursday, and {{something}} must be done before Sunday for the souls of those poor benighted creatures at Hogglestock." [...] Mrs. Proudie was ready for the battle, and was even now sniffing the blood afar-off. [...] "I believe it's a hundred and thirty pounds a year," [...] she said, before the bishop had collected his thoughts sufficiently for a reply.|$|E
60|$|Now what I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to theorize {{about this}} shadow, this chill and arrest, {{that seems to}} have come upon the flourishing and {{expanding}} civilization in which all of us were born and reared. I want to put a particular view of what is happening before you, and what it is that we are up against. I want to put before you for your judgment the view that this overstrain and breaking down and stoppage of the great uprush of civilization that has gone on for the past three centuries is due to the same forces and is the logical outcome of the same forces that led to that uprush, to that tremendous expansion of human knowledge and power and life. And that that breaking up is an inevitable thing unless we meet it by a very great effort of a particular kind.|$|E
60|$|Yours showing Sheridan's {{success of}} to-day is just {{received}} and highly appreciated. Having no great deal <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here,</b> I <b>am</b> still sending {{the substance of}} your despatches to the Secretary of War.|$|R

"How can {{you stand}} staring out of window when there <b>is</b> so much <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> all these trunks to pack, Maria in her bed with every tooth in a frightful state of inflammation, and that capable Jane What's-her-name gone off while I was putting a {{chamomile}} poultice on her face. If you are tired sit down and try on all your shoes, for though Mr. Peggit has your measure, those absurd clerks seem to think it a compliment to send children's sizes to grown women. I'm sure my rubbers were a perfect insult." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My poor Myles," [...] {{said the}} Prince, smiling, {{as the young}} knight bowed to the three, and then stood erect, as though on duty. [...] "It shames my heart, brother--and thou, uncle--it shames my heart to be one privy to this thing which we <b>are</b> set upon <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>be</b> we, the {{greatest}} Lords of England, making a cat's-paw of this lad--for he is only yet a boy--and of his blind father, for to achieve our ends against Alban's faction. It seemeth not over-honorable to my mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! one rubs along. But there's no Development--no growth. They {{just come}} along here and buy pills {{when they want}} 'em--and a horseball or such. They've got to be ill before there's a prescription. That sort they are. You can't get 'em to launch out, you can't get 'em to take up {{anything}} new. For instance, I've been trying lately--induce them to buy their medicines in advance, and in larger quantities. But they won't look for it! Then I tried to float a little notion of mine, sort of an insurance scheme for colds; you pay so much a week, and when you've got a cold you get a bottle of Cough Linctus {{so long as you}} can produce a substantial sniff. See? But Lord! they've no capacity for ideas, they don't catch on; no Jump about the place, no Life. Live!--they trickle, and what one has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to trickle too--Zzzz." ...|$|E
60|$|For let us {{take the}} whole matter nakedly as it lies before us, without the {{refinements}} of some people, with which we have nothing <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> a patent granted under the great seal of England, upon false suggestions, to one William Wood for coining copper halfpence for Ireland: The Parliament here, upon apprehensions of the worst consequences from the said patent, address the King to have it recalled; this is refused, and a committee of the Privy-council report to His Majesty, that Wood has performed the conditions of his patent. He then is left {{to do the best}} he can with his halfpence; no man being obliged to receive them; the people here, being likewise left to themselves, unite as one man, resolving they will {{have nothing to do with}} his ware. By this plain account of the fact it is manifest, that the King and his ministry are wholly out of the case, and the matter is left to be disputed between him and us. Will any man therefore attempt to persuade me, that a Lord Lieutenant is to be dispatched over in great haste before the ordinary time, and a Parliament summoned by anticipating a prorogation, merely to put an hundred thousand pounds into the pocket of a sharper, by the ruin of a most loyal kingdom.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was always}} a 'dandy nigger,'" [...] {{returned}} Pendleton, his face slightly relaxing as he glanced after his grizzled henchman, [...] "but his exaggeration of courtesy is a blank sight more natural and manly than the exaggeration of discourtesy which your superior civilized 'helps' think is self-respect. The excuse of servitude of any kind is its spontaneity and affection. When you know a man hates you and serves you from interest, you know he's a cur and you're a tyrant. It's your blank progress that's made menial service degrading by teaching men to avoid it. Why, sir, when I first arrived here, Jack Hammersley and myself took turns as cook to the party. I didn't consider myself any the worse master for it. But enough of this." [...] He paused, and, raising himself on his elbow, gazed for some seconds half cautiously, half doubtfully, upon his companion. [...] "I've got something to tell you, Hathaway," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "You've had an easy time with this Trust; your share of the work hasn't worried you, kept you awake nights, or interfered with your career. I understand perfectly," [...] he continued, in reply to Hathaway's deprecating gesture. [...] "I accepted to act as your proxy, and I HAVE. I'm not complaining. But it is time that you should know what I've done, and what you may still have <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> the record. On {{the day after that}} interview in the Mayor's office, the El Dorado Bank, of which I was, and still am, president, received seventy-five thousand dollars in trust from Mrs. Howard. Two years afterwards, on that same day, the bank had, by lucky speculations, increased that sum to the credit of the trust one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, or double the original capital. In the following year the bank suspended payment." ...|$|E
6000|$|I didn't repeat {{any more}} of the poem, though {{everybody}} was listening quite respectful without thinking of laughing, and as for Jone, I could see {{by the way he}} sat and looked about him that his tinder had caught my spark; but I knew that the thing for me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> not <b>to</b> give out but take in, and so, to speak in figures, I drank in the whole of Lake Vannachar, as we drove along its lovely marge until we came to the other end, and the driver said we would now go over the Brigg of Turk. At this up I jumped and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray {{spare me}} those {{classical}} allusions!" [...] burst out Razumov nervously. [...] "What comes Junius Brutus <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here?</b> It <b>is</b> ridiculous! <b>Do</b> you mean <b>to</b> say," [...] he added sarcastically, but lowering his voice, [...] "that the Russian revolutionists are all patricians and that I am an aristocrat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{could be}} quiet at night, {{sleeping}} in Mr. Nobbs's house, and yet I could not at once compose myself {{to think it}} all over, as I desired <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> And then I had much <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and <b>here</b> <b>was</b> the joy mingling with the sorrow.|$|R

5000|$|In The Art of Clear Thinking (1951), Flesch {{consolidated}} {{research data}} and findings in psychology and education, showing people {{how they can}} apply those ideas to their lives.

40|$|What I intend <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>are</b> {{closely related}} three things. First, in {{response}} to Searle’s “reply” comments on my previous article “Searle, Zhuang Zi, and Transcendental Perspectivism”, I will clarify and further elaborate {{one of the central}} points concerning the “perspective” dimension and “perspective-transcending” dimension of consciousness there. Second, more substantially, I will strengthen my point by explaining the “double-aboutness” character of consciousness which is intrinsically related to the foregoing two dimensions of consciousness concerning its “hooking-up-to-objects” capacity; through a semantic-ascent strategy, I will also explain how the point has substantial theoretic implications for exploring the issue of how the cross-perspective engagement is possible. Third, I will explain how bridging Searle’s and Zhuang Zi’s resources in view of the double-aboutness character of consciousness can contribute to our understanding and treatment of the foregoing issue...|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Butler {{wrote in}} real-time, a {{complete}} short story, [...] "This is Earl Sandt," [...] from first inspiration to final story, in a webcast of 17 two-hour sessions.

5000|$|Therriault {{claimed that}} the drug's effects are similar to LSD's, and too powerful, {{dangerous}} and unpredictable to leave it unrestricted. [...] "What I'm trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> be proactive instead of reactive to the newest drug on the scene," [...] he said. Theriault also communicated in an email to an individual expressing concern over the criminalization of this plant that [...] "we cannot have people worshiping plants" [...] which raises concern over his Baptist background and the separation of religion and State.|$|E

Our power, thanks to God, and the willing obedience of a loving people, is worth much, but there are some things which it cannot compass. We cannot, for example, command the affections of a giddy young girl, or make her love sense and learning better than a courtier's fine doublet; and we cannot control sickness, with which it seems this lady is afflicted, who may not, by reason of such infirmity, attend our court here, as we had required her <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> the testimonials of the physician who hath her under his charge, and the gentleman in whose house she resides, so setting forth." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Director's Cut was {{programmed}} by Andy Davidson {{and enhanced}} the engine, graphics and gameplay {{of the original}} Worms.

60|$|But {{at least}} one thing would have become clear, the little swarm of Owners and their claims {{standing}} in the way of any bold collective dealing with housing or any such public concern.
