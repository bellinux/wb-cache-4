5|$|In late 1888 he {{finished}} {{work on a}} fourth book, Pipes o' Pan at Zekesbury which was released to great acclaim in the United States. Based on a fictional town in Indiana, Riley presented many stories and poems about its citizens and way of life. It received mixed reviews among literary critics who wrote of it that Riley's stories were not of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>quality</b> as his poetry. The book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints.|$|E
5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{interpretation}} of the Upanishad is a qualified monism. Ramanuja interprets the Upanishadic literature to be teaching a body-soul theory, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, where the Brahman is the dweller in all things, yet also distinct and beyond all things, as the soul, the inner controller, the immortal. The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual souls to be of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>quality</b> as the Brahman, but quantitatively they are distinct.|$|E
5|$|As {{compensation}} for removing {{the track and}} field sections, the stadium company {{had to pay for}} a new municipal athletics venue at Mørkvedlia. The sales stadium's contract also required Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling to build new change room facilities for the training pitch so the uses from teams had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>quality</b> as the main pitch. The company was criticized by the municipality in 2002 for not prioritizing this obligation. The NOK170,000 it cost to move Grand's club house and build a change room for the artificial field was covered jointly by the municipality, Grand, Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling and one of Glimt's sponsors, Nordland Entreprenør.|$|E

5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>quality</b> as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita. There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E
5|$|Huntsman's {{process was}} only made {{obsolete}} in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's {{invention of the}} Bessemer converter, but production of crucible steel continued {{until well into the}} 20th century for special uses, as Bessemer's steel was not of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>quality,</b> in the main replacing wrought iron for such applications as rails. Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was underselling them to the extent of £20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum.|$|E

25|$|While a class {{hierarchy}} {{is reflected in}} stratified housing structures, military classism differs from traditional class structures in some significant ways - namely, schooling and access to quality healthcare.

Similarly, all military personnel receive <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>quality</b> of healthcare by the same providers.|$|E

25|$|The {{generation}} of artists after the pioneers, active during the Late Archaic period (circa 500 to 470 BC) brought the style {{to a new}} flourish. During this time, black-figure vases failed to reach <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>quality</b> and were pushed {{out of the market}} eventually. Some of the most famous Attic vase painters belong to this generation. They include the Berlin Painter, the Kleophrades Painter, and among the bowl painters Onesimos, Douris, Makron and the Brygos Painter. The improvement of quality went along with a doubling of output during this period. Athens became the dominant producer of fine pottery in the Mediterranean world, overshadowing nearly all other production centres.|$|E
25|$|Inequalities {{in health}} are also {{determined}} by these socioeconomic and cultural factors.

According to the WHO, healthcare systems can most improve health equality when institutions are organized to provide universal coverage, where everyone receives <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>quality</b> healthcare regardless of ability to pay, as well as a Primary Healthcare system rather than emergency center assistance.|$|E

The court agreed that including CSICOP was frivolous and dropped them from the action, leaving Randi to face the action alone, along with the legal costs. Geller was ordered to pay substantial damages, but only to CSICOP. The matter was subsequently settled out of court, and the details of the settlement have been kept confidential. The settlement also included an agreement that Geller would not pursue Randi for the award in the Japanese case or other outstanding cases.|$|E
