The repetitive unit cell models for the resin impregnated fiber tows and the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orthogonal</b> <b>woven</b> composites at the fabric microstructure level were established. In the micro/meso-repetitive unit cells model, a nonlinear viscoelastic relationship with switch rule is introduced to characterize the mechanical behavior of the resin for the loading/unloading conditions. The fiber/fiber tows are characterized with linear elastic models. And damage initiation and postdamage constitutive models are also included for matrix/fiber and matrix impregnated fiber tows in the finite element analysis. The fatigue model with the mechanical parameters transferred from micro-scale to meso-scale model is numerically simulated with user-defined material subroutine and incorporated into commercial finite element software ABAQUS/Standard. The calculated results manifest the multiscale fatigue behaviors of <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orthogonal</b> <b>woven</b> com-posites, such as the global stiffness degradation, decrease of peak stress, and even local damage behavior. The fatigue behaviors are also verified with the data in experimental and indicated that the model is an efficient strategy to predict the low-cyclic fatigue behaviors of polymer matrix composites...|$|R

The analytical method used {{is based on}} wave propagation and energy balance between the projectile and the target. Different damage and energy absorbing mechanisms for a typical <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orthogonal</b> <b>woven</b> composite are compression of the target directly below the projectile, compression in the surrounding region of the impacted zone, tension in the region consisting of primary yarns, tensile deformation in the region consisting of secondary yarns, shear plugging, bulge formation on the back face of the target, matrix cracking and friction between the target and the projectile. Experimental studies are also presented on high strain rate characterization, shear plugging behavior and high velocity impact behavior. For comparison, studies are also presented {{on the performance of}} two-dimensional plain weave E-glass/epoxy composites.

40|$|Damage {{initiation}} {{and evolution}} of <b>three-dimensional</b> (3 D) <b>orthogonal</b> <b>woven</b> carbon fibre composite (3 DOWC) is investigated experimentally and numerically. Meso-scale homogenisation of the representative volume element (RVE) is utilised to predict the elastic properties, simulate damage initiation and evolution when loaded in tension. The effect of intra-yarns transverse cracking and shear diffused damage on the in-plane transverse modulus and shear modulus is investigated while one failure criterion is introduced to simulate the matrix damage. The proposed model is based on two major assumptions. First, {{the effect of the}} binder yarns, on the in-plane properties, is neglected, so the 3 DOWC unit cell can be approximated as a (0 o/ 90 o) cross-ply laminate. Second, a micro-mechanics based damage approach is used at the meso-scale, so damage indicators can be correlated, explicitly, to the density of cracks within the material. Results from the simulated RVE are validated against experimental results along the warp (0 o direction) and weft (90 o direction). This approach paves the road for more predictive models as damage evolution laws are obtained from micro mechanical considerations and rely on few well-defined material parameters. This largely differs from classical damage mechanics approaches in which the evolution law is obtained by retrofitting experimental observations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{the virtual}} {{material}} characterization of three dimen-sional (3 D) <b>orthogonal</b> <b>woven</b> composite materials is investigated by large-scale finite element analyses {{to predict the}} elastic properties. To numerically model the complex geometry of 3 D <b>orthogonal</b> <b>woven</b> composites, a unit structure including the stuffer yarns, filler yarns, weaver yarns, and the resin region is generated based on direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the unit structures with the same pattern are assembled into an <b>orthogonal</b> <b>woven</b> composite structure composed of several millions of degrees of freedom. The influence of the geometrical irregularities, such as the inconsistent tow spacing and the waviness of the filler yarn, on the mechanical properties are also discussed by separately generating the yarns and the resin. From the numerical examples, it is shown that the pattern of tow distribution affects the shear modulus, and the direct modeling of the wavy yarns can produce more accurate stiffness knockdown. It is also emphasized that large-scale numerical analyses {{can be one of}} the methodologies sufficient for the material characterization of the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>woven</b> composites and can be more applicable in the realistic structure subject to complex loading compared to the unit cell approach.

By using the framework we show that, given a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orthogonal</b> shape of a graph (a description of the sequence of axis-parallel segments of each edge), finding the coordinates for nodes and bends such that the drawing has no intersection is NP-complete. Conversely, we show that if node coordinates are fixed, finding a shape for the edges that is compatible with a non-intersecting drawing is a feasible problem, which becomes NP-complete if a maximum of two bends per edge is allowed. We comment on the impact of these results on the two open problems of determining whether a graph always admits a drawing with at most two bends per edge and of characterizing orthogonal shapes admitting an orthogonal drawing without intersections...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} paper examines the damage mechanisms and reductions to the tensile properties of E-glass yarns during weaving of three-dimensional (3 D) fabrics for polymer-based composites. The paper also assesses {{the influence of}} weaving damage to load-bearing glass yarns on the tensile properties of 3 D <b>orthogonal</b> <b>woven</b> composites. It is found that damage occurs to yarns at most stages of the 3 D weaving process due to abrasion and breakage caused when sliding against the loom machinery, The abrasion damage causes a large reduction (similar to 30 %) to the tensile strength of the dry woven yarns, although the tensile stiffness remains unaffected. The damage and reduction to the tensile properties of the dry yarns at different weaving stages are described.

It is now well understood and appreciated that this type of advanced composites provides efficient delamination suppression, enhanced damage tolerance, and superior impact, ballistic and blast performance characteristics over 2 D fabric laminates. At the same time, this type of composites, having practically straight in-plane fibers, show significantly better in-plane stiffness and strength properties than respective properties of a "conventional" type 3 D interlock weave composites. One primarily important question, which has not been addressed yet, is how the in-plane elastic and strength characteristics of this type of composites compare with respective in-plane properties of "equivalent" laminates made of 2 D woven fabrics. This 2 -part paper presents a comprehensive experimental study of the comparison of in-plane tensile properties of two single-ply non-crimp 3 D <b>orthogonal</b> <b>weave</b> E-glass fiber composites {{on one side and a}} laminate reinforced with four plies of plain weave E-glass fabric on the other. Results obtained from mechanical testing are supplemented by acoustic emission data providing damage initiation thresholds, progressive cracks observation, full-field surface strain mapping and cracks observation on micrographs. The obtained results demonstrate that the studied 3 D non-crimp <b>orthogonal</b> <b>woven</b> composites have considerably higher in-plane ultimate failure stresses and strains, as well as damage initiation strain thresholds than their 2 D woven laminated composite counterpart.
