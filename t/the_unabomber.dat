5|$|FBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, {{where he}} was found in an unkempt state. A search of his cabin {{revealed}} a cache of bomb components, 40,000 hand-written journal pages that included bomb-making experiments, descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber</b> crimes and one live bomb, ready for mailing. They also found {{what appeared to be}} the original typed manuscript of Industrial Society and Its Future. By this point, <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber</b> had been the target of the most expensive investigation in FBI history.|$|E
5|$|After the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI received over {{a thousand}} calls a day for months {{in response to the}} offer of a $1million reward for information leading to the identity of <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber.</b> Many letters claiming to be from <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber</b> were also sent to the UNABOM Task Force, and thousands of suspect leads were reviewed. While the FBI was occupied with new leads, David Kaczynski hired private investigator Susan Swanson in Chicago to investigate Ted's activities discreetly. The Kaczynski brothers had become estranged in 1990, and David had not seen Ted for ten years. David later hired Washington, D.C., attorney Tony Bisceglie to organize evidence acquired by Swanson, and make contact with the FBI, given the likely difficulty in attracting the FBI's attention. He wanted to protect his brother from the danger of an FBI raid, such as the Ruby Ridge or the Waco Siege, since he assumed Ted would not take kindly to being contacted by the FBI and would be likely to react violently.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI held many {{press conferences}} asking {{the public to}} help identify <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber.</b> They were convinced that the bomber was from the Chicago area (where he began his bombings), had worked or had some connection in Salt Lake City, and by the 1990s {{was associated with the}} San Francisco Bay Area. This geographical information, as well as the wording in excerpts from the manifesto that were released before the entire manifesto was published, persuaded David Kaczynski's wife, Linda, to urge her husband to read the manifesto.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{publication}} of Industrial Society and Its Future, Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife Linda {{to follow up on}} suspicions that Ted was <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber.</b> David was at first dismissive, but began to take the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He browsed through old family papers and found letters dating back to the 1970s written by Ted and sent to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology and which contained phrasing similar to that found in Industrial Society and Its Future.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, {{computer}} store owner, {{was killed}} in 1985 by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed {{in the parking lot}} of his store. A similar attack against a computer store occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 20, 1987. The bomb, which was disguised as a piece of lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted to remove it from the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body. Kaczynski's brother, David—who would play a vital role in Kaczynski's capture by alerting federal authorities to the prospect of his brother's involvement in <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber</b> cases—sought out and became friends with Wright after Kaczynski was detained in 1996. David Kaczynski and Wright have remained friends and occasionally speak together publicly about their relationship.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, {{working with}} {{agents in the}} FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a {{psychological}} profile of the unidentified bomber which described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence with connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 {{in favor of an}} alternative theory developed by FBI analysts concentrating on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the bomber suspect was characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic. A 1-800 hotline was set up by the UNABOM Task Force to take any calls related to <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber</b> investigation, with a $1million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.|$|E

5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber</b> had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E

In the grande finale, each team captain and 2 team members of his choice divided this total multiplied by $10,000 in chips (choosing who would get the extra chips if {{it could not be}} divided evenly), each preliminary winner received $5,000, the winning team split $50,000, while the overall individual winner won $25,000. The James Woods Gang was led by celebrity and poker player James Woods, and had celebrities Nicole Sullivan and Bob Goen, plus poker players Kathy Liebert, Ted Forrest, and Susie Isaacs. <b>The</b> <b>Unabombers</b> were led by Phil Laak.

Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted. But Justice Department investigations into the FBI's roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to have been obstructed by agents within the Bureau. During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing. It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell, who was a private security guard at the venue, along with some media organizations, in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation; this had briefly led to his being wrongly suspected of the bombing.|$|E

500|$|Theodore John Kaczynski ( [...] ; born May 22, 1942), {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber,</b> is an American mathematician, anarchist and {{domestic}} terrorist.

500|$|The early {{hunt for}} <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber</b> portrayed a {{perpetrator}} {{far different from}} the eventual suspect. Industrial Society and Its Future consistently uses [...] "we" [...] and [...] "our" [...] throughout, {{and at one point}} in 1993 investigators sought an individual whose first name was [...] "Nathan" [...] due to a fragment of a note found in one of the bombs, but when the case was presented to the public, authorities denied that there was ever anyone other than Kaczynski involved in the crimes.|$|E

As stated in the affidavit, {{only a handful of}} people believed Kaczynski was <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber</b> before the search warrant revealed the abundance of evidence in Kaczynski's isolated cabin. The search warrant affidavit written by FBI Inspector Terry D. Turchie reflects this conflict, and is striking evidence of the opposition to Turchie and his small cadre of FBI agents that included Moss and Puckett—who were convinced Kaczynski was the Unabomber—from the rest of the UNABOM Task Force and the FBI in general: ...|$|E
500|$|Kaczynski was {{the target}} of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) longest and costliest investigation. Before his {{identity}} was known, the FBI used the title [...] "UNABOM" [...] (UNiversity & Airline BOMber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media calling him <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber.</b> The FBI (as well as Attorney General Janet Reno) pushed for the publication of Kaczynski's manifesto, which led to his sister-in-law, and then his brother, recognizing Kaczynski's style of writing and beliefs from the manifesto, and tipping off the FBI. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted to plead insanity {{in order to avoid the}} death penalty, as he did not believe he was insane. In 1998 a plea bargain was reached, under which Kaczynski pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.|$|E
50|$|A {{federal grand}} jury indicted Kaczynski in April 1996 on 10 counts of {{illegally}} transporting, mailing, and using bombs. He was also charged with three counts of murder for the killings of Scrutton, Mosser, and Murray. Initially, the government prosecution team indicated that it would {{seek the death penalty}} for Kaczynski after it was authorized by United States Attorney General Janet Reno. David Kaczynski's attorney asked the former FBI agent who made the match between <b>the</b> <b>Unabomber's</b> manifesto and Kaczynski to ask for leniency—he was horrified to think that turning his brother in might result in his brother's death. Eventually, Kaczynski avoided the death penalty by pleading guilty to all the government's charges, on January 22, 1998. Later, Kaczynski attempted to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing it was involuntary. Judge Garland Ellis Burrell Jr. denied his request. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld that decision.|$|R
