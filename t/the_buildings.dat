5|$|Pei {{also drew}} {{inspiration}} from the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples; he wanted <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings. To this end, {{he called for a}} rock-treatment process that could color <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> was {{purchased}} by Neil Parrish and Larry Phifer to develop <b>the</b> <b>building</b> into apartments. During the reroofing project, {{it was determined that}} there was significant water damage to <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> amount of money required to renovate <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was astronomical. Demolition activities began, but because <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was so well built, the demolition activities proved difficult. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> stood partially demolished until 1983. The university repurchased <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and completed <b>the</b> demolition. The concrete stairs leading up to <b>the</b> former <b>building</b> can still be seen today.|$|R
2500|$|Dow {{described}} his own philosophy of design as [...] "Architecture {{is more than}} the front face of <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> location of <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> plan of <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> construction of <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> heating and cooling of <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> furnishing of <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is <b>the</b> landscaping of <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It is, in its entirety, the manifestation of wholesome living."

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>buildings</b> along Alrov Mamilla Avenue are spaced irregularly {{rather than}} {{placed in a}} {{continuous}} line. The open areas between <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> accommodate different types of public areas, while the spaces themselves afford views of the historic landmarks beyond the avenue, such as the Tower of David and Jaffa Gate. <b>The</b> <b>buildings</b> lining the avenue range in height from three to six stories, with the higher stories set back from the street line. There is also a two-story, domed atrium housing shops and restaurants.|$|E

5000|$|The Wyandotte Odd Fellows used <b>the</b> <b>building</b> until 1938, when {{financial}} difficulties caused foreclosure on <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It was leased {{by the state}} of Michigan for a few years, but in 1942 the Wyandotte Masons purchased <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> Masons moved in in 1943, and in 1948 extensively renovated <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> Masons used <b>the</b> <b>building</b> until 2005, when the local Masons merged with another chapter.

5|$|A team of {{earthquake}} and engineering {{experts from the}} United States spent {{a period of time}} in Armenia in December 1988 and January 1989. The group, including a structural engineer who specialized in seismic-resistant designs, agreed that building inadequacies were the primary reason why the strong (but not huge) earthquake was so damaging, although the freezing temperatures also {{played a role in the}} unusually high death toll. The engineers who scrutinized the damaged buildings and the rescue workers who had dismantled <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> while extricating survivors ascribe both design shortcomings and improper construction methods for the failure of <b>the</b> <b>buildings.</b> The Soviets had modified their construction style to accommodate the known seismic risk in the area, but they acknowledged to the team that many of <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> were not built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude. An engineer with the team stated that the regulations for the area mandated that buildings be required to stand up against events measuring seven or eight on the twelve degree Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The earthquake's effects were assessed at ten on that seismic scale.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis deals about plan of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> Social and {{shopping}} {{center in the}} city Třebíč and about processing of documentation for this buliding as well. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> is situated in the city area called Borovina.

5000|$|In {{a simple}} example, [...] {{could be a}} building, and [...] could be {{the number of people}} in <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> surface [...] would consist of the walls, doors, roof, and {{foundation}} of <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Then <b>the</b> continuity equation states that {{the number of people in}} <b>the</b> <b>building</b> increases when people enter <b>the</b> <b>building</b> (an inward flux through the surface), decreases when people exit <b>the</b> <b>building</b> (an outward flux through the surface), increases when someone in <b>the</b> <b>building</b> gives birth (a source, [...] ), and decreases when someone in <b>the</b> <b>building</b> dies (a sink, [...] ).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> {{was used}} as the local public library until September 1966. In 1967 <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was leased from the city and {{converted}} into an art center.

5|$|After the {{war ended}} with the defeat of Japan in 1945, the ban on nonessential {{construction}} was lifted, and the state restarted construction and restoration activities in Constitution Square in 1948. These activities included restoring and re-roofing <b>the</b> <b>buildings,</b> adding furniture to <b>the</b> <b>buildings,</b> constructing walkways, erecting signs, and adding landscaping to the park. The restorations were completed in 1955. From 1960 to 1968, the state added a fence around the site, installed a new lighting and diorama system, constructed {{a replica of the}} square's original pillory, and renovated several buildings, including an early 19th-century brick schoolhouse which became the caretaker's residence.|$|E

5|$|Christchurch {{was under}} heavy {{development}} at this time, {{as it had}} just been granted city status and was the new administrative capital of the province of Canterbury. This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings in timber. <b>The</b> <b>buildings</b> were constructed from 1857–59, but in a more limited form than the original design. As the Provincial Council gained new functions with growth in the population and economy of the province, <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an iron clock tower from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65. <b>The</b> <b>buildings</b> today are {{regarded as one of}} Mountfort's most important works.|$|E
