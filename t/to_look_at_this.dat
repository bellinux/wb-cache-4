25|$|A common {{criticism}} of full cutoff lighting fixtures {{is that they}} are sometimes not as aesthetically pleasing <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> <b>This</b> is most likely because historically {{there has not been a}} large market specifically for full cutoff fixtures, and because people typically like to see the source of illumination. Due to the specificity with their direction of light, full cutoff fixtures sometimes also require expertise to install for maximum effect.|$|E

There are also three other rooms in this space, in which during the Closed Beta, users had to find out codes to the doors that accessed these rooms. The code entry to the rooms was also removed with the release of the Home Open Beta. The three other rooms are the [...] "Artifact Room", [...] "Archives", and [...] "Smuggler's Den". There is an artifact viewer in the Archives and Smuggler's Den rooms. Also in the Archives there is a video screen that previews Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.

This space was released to the European version on November 5, 2009, almost a year after the Open Beta release. Naughty Dog has also released a game space for Uncharted's sequel on October 23, 2009 making Uncharted the first game series to have a game space for both games in its series.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the sculpture's {{potential}} for controversy, {{the point that}} each country's piece was designed by an artist from that country was strongly stressed by the Czech government. According to Lidové noviny, Czech Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra remarked: [...] "The fact remains that we have provided a platform for free artistic expression {{and that is how}} Entropa must be viewed. But, had I known the circumstances were different than we had thought {{for a year and a}} half, I would not have authorized it." [...] Vondra attempted to distance the Czech government from Černý's work early on, saying,It is a piece of artnothing else... If Europe is not strong enough <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this,</b> it would be a tragedy. It is Europe through the eyes of 27 artists.

2500|$|Defense {{attorney}} Jose Baez told jurors {{his biggest}} {{fear was that}} they would base their verdict on emotions, not evidence. [...] "The strategy behind that is, if you hate her, if you think she's a lying, no-good slut, then you'll start <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> evidence in a different light", he said. [...] "Itold you {{at the very beginning}} of this case that this was an accident that snowballed out of control... What made it unique is not what happened, but who it happened to." [...] He explained Casey Anthony's behavior as being the result of her dysfunctional family situation. At one point as Baez spoke, Ashton could be seen smiling or chuckling behind his hand. This prompted Baez to refer to him as [...] "this laughing guy right here". The judge called a sidebar conference, then a recess. When court resumed, he chastised both sides, saying both Ashton and Baez had violated his order that neither side should make disparaging remarks about opposing counsel. After both attorneys apologized, the judge accepted the apologies but warned that a recurrence would have the offending attorney excluded from the courtroom.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter one, [...] "The Study of Folklore and the Reclamation of Paganism", {{offers a}} {{historical}} introduction to Contemporary Paganism, looking {{at its roots}} in the Classical World of Greece and Rome, and then the successive influences of Neoplatonism, Renaissance magic, the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment. Magliocco then looks at the influence that 18th and 19th century folkloristics and anthropology had on the Romanticists and then Pagan movement, in particular the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the Brothers Grimm and Sir James Frazer. Proceeding <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> relationship, she highlights the work of Charles Leland, Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner, who drew from folklore in their own books, all of which heavily influenced modern Paganism. Magliocco argues that Contemporary Paganism {{can be viewed as a}} [...] "folk tradition" [...] on two levels; firstly, because it continues to work with and propagate the spiritual traditions of western esotericism, and secondly, because it acts as a form of [...] "resistance culture" [...] in opposition to dominant trends in western culture. Finally, she borrows the concept of [...] "textual poachers" [...] from the French sociologist Michel de Certeau, arguing that the Pagan community fit this model well, collating elements from a wide variety of sources and composing them into something new, in this case a religious movement.|$|E

Navigating through a model created from such a supercomputer simulation, especially in stereo, enables those studying this process to better understand it.

2500|$|As {{an example}} of his later {{vaudeville}} career, during the off-seasons of 1892-93, which extended into the 1893 season, he appeared in January 1893 in New York at the Imperial Music Hall on West 29th Street. He was billed as [...] "King Kelly, the Monarch of the Baseball Field." [...] His trousers and shirt collar were too big and he buttoned his jacket wrong. [...] Also, his straw hat was a size too small. [...] "It was impossible <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> vaudeville make-up and not laugh", the New York Sun said. [...] "Kelly laughed, too, and shook a roll of music {{at a lot of}} friends up in the private boxes." [...] Kelly came on after two French singers of opera. Stage partner William [...] "Billy" [...] Jerome [...] "took off his hat to him, and introduced him as 'Mr. Kelly, the famous $10,000 peach.'" [...] They sang a parody. [...] Later, after reciting [...] "Casey at the Bat", he said, according to the Sun, [...] "I'm right at home with Casey." [...] Also, [...] "It's the first time I’ve been in these clothes, and I don’t quite understand them.

2500|$|The Court also issued [...] "advisory opinions", which {{arose from}} Article 14 of the Covenant {{creating}} the Court, which provided, [...] "The Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute {{referred to it}} by the Council or Assembly". Goodrich interprets that as indicating that the drafters intended a purely advisory capacity for the Court, not a binding one. Manley Ottmer Hudson (who sat as a judge) said that an advisory opinion [...] "was what it purported to be. It is advisory. It is not in any sense a judgement... hence {{it is not in}} any way binding on any state", but Charles De Visscher argued that in certain situations, an advisory opinion could be binding on the League of Nations Council and, under certain circumstances, some states; M. Politis agreed, saying that the Court's advisory opinions were equivalent to a binding judgment. In 1927, the Court appointed a committee <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> issue, and it reported that [...] "where there are in fact contending parties, the difference between contentious cases and advisory cases is only nominal... so the view that advisory opinions are not binding is more theoretical than real". In practice, advisory opinions were usually followed, mostly due to the fear that if this [...] "revolutionary" [...] international court's decisions were not followed, it would undermine its authority. The court retained the discretion to avoid giving an advisory opinion, which it used on occasion.|$|E
