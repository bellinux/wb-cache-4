There were technical limitations regarding computer-generated imagery, a vital aspect of the film that would be crucial {{in the creation of}} the T-1000 Terminator.

Perhaps more serious were the intellectual-property disputes between Hemdale Film Corporation, which owned the franchise and stymied efforts to produce a sequel, and Carolco Pictures.

"A {{few years}} ago we decided to make this project on the {{assassination}} of Rabin {{as a kind of}} a gesture about memory and even in the hope that sometimes when you resurrect memory, it can create movements. But we have to be modest about it: art is not {{the most efficient way to}} change reality. Politics or machine guns have a much more direct effect. But sometimes art has some delayed effect, because it conserves memory when big powers want to erase it, because they call for obedience, they don't want to be disturbed, they don't want dissent. But if artists are loyal to their inner truth, they produce works which voyage in time, which don't always have immediate effects, sometimes they have delayed effects.

The departure of such large signings was explained by Monaco's vice president Vadim Vasilyev as part of a new strategy; he said, [...] "There are two ways to go... One is either you invest {{a lot of money and}} do it quickly, the other is you build up an intelligent project and you have to base yourself on your academy and sound principles of working and scouting well and basically that's what we've decided to do." [...] The departure of star players and a decline in spending was also attributed by Vasilyev to the introduction of the UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations and the resultant threat of sanctions. Vasilyev said in an interview that Rybolovlev had told him that he was [...] "...already investing big money and if the club has to pay fines over and on top of <b>that,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is really not on. This really goes against any common sense". It was also reported by L'Equipe in September 2013 that the decline in investment was as a result of Rybolovlev's dissatisfaction at not receiving a Monegasque passport which might afford him greater protection from extradition to his native Russia than his Cypriot passport if such a situation were to occur. In a March 2015 interview with Nice Matin, Rybolovlev re-iterated his long-term commitment to the club and also expressed his delight at Monaco's successes since his arrival.|$|E

5000|$|This {{story is}} set in medieval times in Rajput Kingdom. Raja Nirgun Singh(Prem Chopra), at the {{ripe old age of}} 70, has a young wife Lavni(Konkana Sen). Lavni is not {{satisfied}} with this marriage and discusses this with her maid Kesara(Ila Arun). Kesara tells her that {{it is not uncommon for}} queens to ask for [...] "services" [...] from young and reliable subjects. Lavni tells her that she likes Chandresh(Arunoday Singh), who is one of the King's subjects and is a close friend of the King. Kesara passes on the message to Chandresh, who refuses it saying he cannot do this because this would be cheating on the king (he cannot tell the king about the queen's advances either as this would mean a death sentence). Kesara tells him that he shall be rewarded very generously by the Queen. On hearing this, Chandresh says that he is agreeable but he has a few conditions and shall reveal them one by one. All these conditions require completion of seemingly impossible tasks which he puts forward just to deter the Queen. But Lavni completes these tasks(from plucking the tooth of the king to getting rid of the king's pet cat). He sees the Queen's desperation and places one last task, that whatever [...] "happens" [...] must happen in front of the King. The Queen says yes to this one as well.One night the king and queen are sitting in the garden. Chandresh walks in and the queen asks him to fetch fruit from the tree in the garden. Chandresh climbs the tree and comes down asking for apology. The king asks him for what he saw, Chandresh replied that he saw the king and queen in sexual embrace. The queen rejects that claim angrily, saying <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has never ever happened, leave alone now (humiliating the king in the process). Chandresh says that, even then, his vision *can* still happen, if the tree is possessed by a spirit. Lavni dismisses that as a fairy tale, and instigates the king to verify this for himself. The old King, now with mixed feelings of embarrassment and anger, climbs the tree. Being old and frail, he climbs up with some difficulty and then gets stuck on top of the tree and can not easily come down. Meanwhile, Chandresh and Lavni down below get into a sexual embrace. The king sees them in the act from up on the tree but is stll unable to climb down the tree. When the king does eventually manage to come down, he sees the queen and Chandresh are fully dressed and sitting normally as if nothing had happened. The king is convinced that the sexual embrace he saw was just an unreal vision and orders the tree to be cut down, declaring it possessed.|$|E
