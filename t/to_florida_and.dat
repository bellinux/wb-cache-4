5|$|Like all Lactarius species, L.argillaceifolius is mycorrhizal. The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius argillaceifolius grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under hardwoods, especially oak, from July to October.

The species is found from eastern Canada south <b>to</b> <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> west to Minnesota and Texas. It is common in northeast Mexico. The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil (state of Santa Catarina) growing in association with pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations, where it has probably been introduced with pine seedlings brought by settlers. L.argillaceifolius var. megacarpus has been collected from Baja California, California, Oregon, and Washington, where it grows in association with coast live oak and tanoak.|$|E
5|$|The 1970 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} season in which reconnaissance aircraft flew into all four quadrants of a tropical cyclone. The season officially began on June 1 and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season was fairly average, with 10 total storms forming, of which five were hurricanes. Two of those five became major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale. The first system, Hurricane Alma, developed on May17. The storm killed eight people, seven from flooding in Cuba and one from a lightning strike in Florida. In July, Tropical Storm Becky brought minor flooding <b>to</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>and</b> {{other parts of the}} Southern United States, leaving one death and about $500,000 (1970USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} (Oryzomys palustris) is a semiaquatic North American rodent {{in the family}} Cricetidae. It usually occurs in wetland habitats, such as swamps and salt marshes. It is found mostly in the eastern and {{southern}} United States, from New Jersey and Kansas south <b>to</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>and</b> northeasternmost Tamaulipas, Mexico; its range previously extended further west and north, where {{it may have been}} a commensal in corn-cultivating communities. Weighing about , the marsh rice rat is a medium-sized rodent that resembles the common black and brown rat. The upperparts are generally gray-brown, but are reddish in many Florida populations. The feet show several specializations for life in the water. The skull is large and flattened, and is short at the front.|$|E

5|$|Variety subreticulatus, like variety boralis, has a {{generally}} darker coloration than the two-colored bolete, but varies {{much more than}} either. When fresh the coloration of the cap varies from a rose red, red, rose pink, dark red, and purple red. With age it changes to a cinnamon red or a rusty rose color, with yellowing toward the margin. The pore surface {{is similar to that}} of the main speciesyellow when fresh and with age changing to a dull ochre yellow; the bruising coloration is blue but is much lighter and sometimes not appearing to stain when bruised at all. The spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety subreticulatus is very similar to the distribution of the two-colored bolete in North America, and appears north to eastern Canada and south <b>to</b> <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> west to Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|James Spader reprises {{his role}} as Robert California, the new CEO of Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.

Angela is pregnant with her first son, also named Philip, with State Senator Robert Lipton (although it is implied that Dwight Schrute is actually the child's biological father). Darryl starts falling for new warehouse foreman Val. Dwight is tasked with traveling to Tallahassee, Florida in order to assist Sabre Special Projects Manager Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in launching a chain of retail stores, along with Jim, Ryan, Stanley, Erin, and new office temp Cathy Simms.

Robert later kills the retail store project, and Erin decides to stay in Florida as an elderly woman's live-in helper. Andy goes <b>to</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>and</b> wins back Erin, but this allows Nellie to claim the manager position as her own. Robert tells Andy that he has been demoted back to a salesman, but he refuses to accept the news, which causes him to be fired.
