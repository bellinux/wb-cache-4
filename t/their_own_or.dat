5|$|Camouflage can be {{achieved}} by different methods, described below. Most of the methods contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but mimesis and motion dazzle protect without hiding. Methods may be applied on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>or</b> in combination.|$|E

5|$|In The Kingdom of This World, Carpentier {{creates a}} {{succession}} of characters that engage in very similar actions. This repetition, a stylistic tool that resembles baroque writings, constructs a cyclical pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views. The succession of characters (as well as places) that replace each other without fully developing on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> (<b>or</b> blocked from developing, in a sense) represent Carpentier's view of the social context in which forces are preventing characters from developing.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin was a royal justiciar in 1203, {{as well as}} the {{custodian}} of {{the vacant}} diocese of Lincoln. He was a royal clerk as well as a canon of Wells, becoming a canon and a deacon by 1200. The previous bishop of Wells died in 1205, and on 3 February 1206, Jocelin was elected bishop. He was consecrated on 28 May 1206, at Reading by Bishop William of Sainte-MÃ¨re-Eglise of London. It is unclear if the cathedral chapters of Bath and of Wells took the action on <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>or</b> if King John was {{the driving force behind the}} election.|$|E
5|$|The victory {{strengthened}} Muhammad's {{position in}} Medina and dispelled earlier doubts among his followers. As a result, {{the opposition to}} him became less vocal. Pagans {{who had not yet}} converted were very bitter about the advance of Islam. Two pagans, Asma bint Marwan of the Aws Manat tribe and Abu 'Afak of the 'Amr b. 'Awf tribe, had composed verses taunting and insulting the Muslims. They were killed by people belonging to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>or</b> related clans, and Muhammad did not disapprove of the killings. This report, however, is considered by some to be a fabrication. Most members of those tribes converted to Islam, and little pagan opposition remained.|$|E

5|$|With the expiry of the copyrights, {{companies}} {{around the}} world have been free to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt them as they please for almost 50 years. Productions of Pinafore, both amateur and professional, range from the traditional, in the D'Oyly Carte vein, to the broadly adapted, such as that of the very successful Essgee Entertainment (formed by Simon Gallaher) in Australia and Opera della Luna in Britain. Since its original production, H.M.S. Pinafore has remained one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas. Productions continue in large numbers {{around the world}}. In 2003 alone, The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company rented 224 sets of orchestra parts, mostly for productions of Pinafore, Pirates and Mikado. This {{does not take into account}} other rental companies and the theatre companies that borrow scores or have <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>or</b> that use only one or two pianos instead of an orchestra. Hundreds of productions of Pinafore are presented every year worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Nurses are {{not truly}} doctor's assistants. This is {{possible}} in certain situations, but nurses more often are independently caring for their patients or assisting other nurses. Registered Nurses treat patients, record their medical history, provide emotional support, and provide follow-up care. Nurses also help doctors perform diagnostic tests. Nurses are almost always working on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>or</b> with other nurses. Nurses will assist doctors {{in the emergency room}} or in trauma care when help is needed.|$|E
25|$|To {{encourage}} {{investment in}} wind power, families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity within <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>or</b> an adjoining municipality. While this could involve purchasing a turbine outright, more often families purchased shares in wind turbine cooperatives {{which in turn}} invested in community wind turbines. By 1996 there were around 2,100 such cooperatives in the country. Opinion polls show that this direct involvement has helped the popularity of wind turbines, with some 86% of Danes supporting wind energy when compared with existing fuel sources.|$|E
