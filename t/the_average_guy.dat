2500|$|In 1979, Stern spotted an {{advertisement}} in Radio & Records for a [...] "wild, fun morning guy" [...] at rock station WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut.

Stern left WCCC in early 1980 after he was denied a [...] "lousy, stinking twenty-five-dollar-a-week raise". At the same time, local rival station WHCN had assembled tapes and press clippings of Stern and forwarded them to Burkhart/Abrams, a radio consulting firm, {{in an effort to get}} Stern out of the Hartford market as a rise in his ratings increased his threat to the station's numbers.

Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. When questioned if his presence made Late Registration any less hip-hop, Brion replied, [...] "There are colors and ideas that make [...] different from average hip-hop, but Kanye is already different from <b>the</b> <b>average</b> hip-hop <b>guy.</b> He's got this sense of pop record-making which is really solid, and he likes tracks with {{a lot of things going}} on in them — which is not necessarily common for hip-hop.
