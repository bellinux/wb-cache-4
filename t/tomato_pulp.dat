A total of 118 samples of laminated paperboard before filling were collected, being 68 before and 50 after the hydrogen peroxide bath. Seven molds, including heat-resistant strains (Penicillium variotii and Talaromyces flavus) with counts ranging between 0. 71 and 1. 02 CFU/cm(2) were isolated. P. variotii was more resistant to hydrogen peroxide than T. flavus and was inactivated after heating at 85 degrees C/ 15 min. When exposed to 35 % hydrogen peroxide at 25 degrees C, T. flavus (F 5 E 2) and N. fischeri (control) were less resistant than P. variotti (F 1 A 1). P. citrinum (F 7 E 2) was shown to be as resistant as P. variotti. The D values (the time to cause one logarithmic cycle reduction in a microbial population at a determined temperature) for spores of P. variotii (F 1 A 1) and N. fischeri (control) with 4 months of age at 85 and 90 degrees C were 3. 9 and 4. 5 min, respectively. Although the contamination of packages was low, the presence of heat-and chemical-resistant molds may be of concern for package sterility and product stability during shelf-life.

Samples (0. 5 g) of single feeds or mixtures were incubated for 96 h, in three replicates in individual bottles (310 mL), with 75 mL of buffered rumen fluid. Bottles were vented by an open-close valve when the internal pressure reached 3. 4 kPa. The metabolisable energy content of single feeds and mixtures was computed from GP at 24 h and feed chemical composition. Feed substrates were ranked for GP in the following way: byproducts, mixtures, and forages. The two forages did not differ for GP and metabolisable energy content, although differences were observed among byproducts and among mixtures. Both forages interacted positively with apple pomace from 6 h (P < 0. 001) to 24 h (P = 0. 029) of incubation and with citrus pulp at 12 h (P = 0. 005) and 24 h (P = 0. 012), whereas no associative effects were detected when forages were incubated with tomato peels.

40|$|Lactobacilli {{are known}} to use plant {{materials}} as a food source. Many such materials are rich in rhamnose-containing polyphenols, and thus it can be anticipated that lactobacilli will contain rhamnosidases. Therefore, genome sequences of food-grade lactobacilli were screened for putative rhamnosidases. In the genome of Lactobacillus plantarum, two putative rhamnosidase genes (ram 1 (Lp) and ram 2 (Lp)) were identified, while in Lactobacillus acidophilus, one rhamnosidase gene was found (ramA(La)). Gene products from all three genes were produced after introduction into Escherichia coli and were then tested for their enzymatic properties. Ram 1 (Lp), Ram 2 (Lp), and RamA(La) were able to efficiently hydrolyze rutin and other rutinosides, while RamA(La) was, in addition, able to cleave naringin, a neohesperidoside. Subsequently, the potential application of Lactobacillus rhamnosidases in food processing was investigated using a single matrix, <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp.</b> Recombinant Ram 1 (Lp) and RamA(La) enzymes were shown to remove the rhamnose from rutinosides in this material, but efficient conversion required adjustment of the <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp</b> to pH 6.

40|$|Lately, {{lycopene}} {{has attracted}} positive attention originating from the studies which suggest a possible inverse {{correlation between the}} consumption of lycopene rich foods {{and the risk of}} chronic diseases. Tomatoes are the major dietary source for lycopene. Furthermore, they {{are one of the most}} grown crops for processing. Industrial processing of tomatoes into different end-products includes mechanical treatments, several thermal treatment steps, and potentially the addition of other ingredients which might induce either desirable or undesirable quality changes. In this context, the present work aimed at an increased understanding of the effect of mechanical processing, more specifically high pressure homogenisation, and thermal processing on lycopene degradation, isomerisation, and bioaccessibility (i. e. availability for absorption). In addition, the impact of the presence of lipids during processing was investigated. In plain <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp,</b> lycopene demonstrated a high stability against degradation and isomerisation. High pressure homogenisation (80 - 1300 bar) hardly affected the total lycopene retention and isomeric distribution. Moreover, lycopene loss during thermal processing only occurred at treatment temperatures above 120 &# 176;C. Thermally induced isomerisation was also limited, even during heating at 140 &# 176;C. The decrease in lycopene bioaccessibility caused by high pressure homogenisation was shown to be related to microstructural changes. More specifically, the tomato network strength was inversely related to the lycopene bioaccessibility. It was hypothesised that the fibre network induced by high pressure homogenisation physically entrapped lycopene. Thermal processing increased the bioaccessibility of lycopene in plain <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp.</b> However, the increase was only significant after intense thermal processing (30 min at 130 and 140 &# 176;C). The results obtained clearly indicated that in plain <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp</b> lycopene bioaccessibility could only be increased by intense thermal processing at industrial irrelevant conditions which also (negatively) affect other quality parameters. Lycopene degradation and isomerisation reactions during heating were accelerated in the presence of lipids. Lycopene degradation in olive oil, fish oil and in an olive oil/tomato emulsion could be described by single response modelling using a fractional conversion model while multi response modelling was applied to describe lycopene isomerisation. In all media, lycopene degradation ceased after prolonged heating and a temperature dependent equilibrium state was reached. Lycopene degradation and isomerisation kinetic parameters depended on the reaction medium. Adding 5 % of lipids (coconut oil, palm oil, cocoa butter, olive oil, sunflower oil, or fish oil) to plain <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp</b> prior to in vitro digestion significantly increased the lycopene bioaccessibility. This increase was more pronounced after applying lipids containing mainly C 18, C 18 : 1, or C 18 : 2 fatty acids compared to applying lipids mainly consisting of C 12 and C 16 fatty acids. The degree of unsaturation of the composing fatty acids was shown not to be a determining factor. Adding 0 - 10 % of coconut oil, olive oil, or fish oil to <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp</b> demonstrated that not only the type of lipid but also the quantity influenced the lycopene bioaccessibility. Interestingly, the type of lipid leading to the highest lycopene bioaccessibility depended on the amount added. In general, processing <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp</b> in the presence of 5 % of lipids caused similar changes in the lycopene bioaccessibility compared to processing plain <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp.</b> Intense thermal processing (20 min at 120 &# 176;C) was necessary to significantly improve the lycopene bioaccessibility while heating 20 min at 90 &# 176;C was sufficient to increase the lycopene bioaccessibility when high pressure homogenisation was applied prior to the heating step. Pilot scale aseptic processing at industrial relevant conditions confirmed the results obtained under laboratory scale conditions. Moreover, the identified kinetic models proved to be applicable to predict lycopene losses and isomerisation. The present work indicates that the presence of lipids combined with processing conditions which remove structural barriers can improve lycopene bioaccessibility in tomato-based products, while lycopene degradation remains limited. Consequently, these intrinsic and extrinsic factors are the key factors to optimally benefit from the purported health effects of lycopene in tomato-based products. status: publishe...|$|E

In particular, recovery of the analytes in maize flour was >= 70 %, with the exception of vitamin C, pyridoxal- 5 '-phosphate and vitamin B 9 (ca 40 %); with <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp,</b> recovery was >= 64 %, except for vitamin C (41 %); with kiwi, recovery was >= 73 %, except for nicotinamide (ca. 30 %).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} addition of foaming agent and drying temperature on the powders characteristics produced using <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp.</b> The influence of the treatments on the pH, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, tapped density, solubility and hygroscopicity of the powders produced at drying temperatures of 60 ºC and 80 ºC, with addition of albumin and with no albumin were evaluated. Higher values of acidity and lower values of pH were observed for the treatments added with albumin in both temperatures were verified. The ascorbic acid content in the pulp was significant (p< 0. 05) decreased with the increasing oh the drying temperature compared to the pulp in natura. The application of albumin also contributes to a decrease in the ascorbic acid content. By the other hand, the albumin addition, with consequent foaming formation in the <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp,</b> favored the production of powder materials with lower density when compared to the control treatments without albumin. The presence of albumin also caused a significant reduction (p< 0. 05) in the powder materials hygroscopicity. The powders solubility was increased with addition of the foaming agent where significant difference (p< 0. 05) among the treatments with and without albumin in both temperatures were observed. ...|$|E
40|$|A complet {{factorial}} {{experimental design}} {{was applied to}} determinate {{the influence of the}} variable inlet air temperature, feed flow rate, and atomizer speed on the physical properties of the <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp</b> powder. Results showed that these variables had a significant positive effect on the moisture content, apparent density, and particle size and no significant effects on the porosity and true density. The best spray drying conditions to produce lower moisture content and higher apparent density tomato powder were inlet air temperature of 200 °C, feed flow rate of 276 g/min, and atomizer speed of 30000 rpm...|$|E
40|$|Introduction – Compounds exhibiting {{antioxidant}} activity {{have received}} {{much interest in}} the food industry because of their potential health benefits. Carotenoids such as lycopene, which in the human diet mainly derives from tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), have attracted much attention in this aspect {{and the study of}} their extraction, processing and storage procedures is of importance. Optical techniques potentially offer advantageous non-invasive and specific methods to monitor them. Objectives – To obtain both fluorescence and Raman information to ascertain if ultrasound assisted extraction from <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp</b> has a detrimental effect on lycopene. Method – Use of time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor carotenoids in a hexane extract obtained from <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp</b> with application of ultrasound treatment (583 kHz). The resultant spectra were a combination of scattering and fluorescence. Because of their different timescales, decay associated spectra could be used to separate fluorescence and Raman information. This simultaneous acquisition of two complementary techniques was coupled with a very high time-resolution fluorescence lifetime measurement of the lycopene. Results – Spectroscopic data showed the presence of phytofluene and chlorophyll in addition to lycopene in the tomato extract. The time-resolved spectral measurement containing both fluorescence and Raman data, coupled with high resolution timeresolved measurements, where a lifetime of 5 ps was attributed to lycopene, indicated lycopene appeared unaltered by ultrasound treatment. Detrimental changes were, however, observed in both chlorophyll and phytofluene contributions. Conclusion – Extracted lycopene appeared unaffected by ultrasound treatment, while other constituents (chlorophyll and phytofluene) were degraded...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In an {{experiment}} with 288 laying hens from a commercial strain (Hy-line W 36), {{the effect of}} partial and total replacement of soybean meal, corn grain, wheat grain and wheat bran with dried <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp</b> (DTP) on performance and egg quality was determined. In the 12 week experiment, hens (27 to 38 weeks of age) were allocated to four dietary treatments being: DTP 0, DTP 50, DTP 100 and DTP 150 of 72 birds each, and received a diet ad libitum. The diet for DTP 0 treatment had no DTP (control), while those for treatments DTP 50, DTP 100 and DTP 150 included 50, 100 and 150 kg/t of DTP, respectively. Inclusion of DTP at levels up to 100 kg/t in diets of laying hens increased egg production and egg mass by 2. 7 % and 4. 1 %, respectively, compared to the control and resulted in similar traits, relative to final BW, egg weight, daily feed consumption, egg shell weight, egg shell thickness, haugh units and yolk color. However, inclusion of DTP at higher level (150 kg/t of diet) decreased egg production and egg mass by 3. 6 % and 3. 0 %, respectively, and increased feed efficiency by 2. 9 % compared to the control. Thus, DTP {{can be used as}} an alternative feedstuff in laying hen diets, at inclusion levels up to 100 kg/t without negative effects on performance and egg quality.

40|$|Powdered tomato was {{produced}} by spray drying the <b>tomato</b> <b>pulp.</b> A full 2 ³ factorial design with the central point was used, varying the feed flow rate (127 - 276 g/min), air inlet temperature (200 - 220 ºC) and the atomisation speed (25, 000 - 35, 000 rpm). The responses analysed were: moisture content, solubility, wettability consistency and colour, but the factors only significantly affected the colour parameter. All the samples became significantly darker and less red with an increase of the variables under study. A low atomisation speed (25, 000 rpm) and lower inlet air temperature (220 ºC) produced the powders with a higher colour index (a/b) and less darkening...|$|E
