5|$|The {{discovery}} image {{gave the}} first hint that comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was an unusual comet, as it appeared to show multiple nuclei in an elongated region about 50arcseconds long and 10arcseconds wide. Brian G. Marsden of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams noted that the comet lay only about 4degrees from Jupiter as seen from Earth, and that although this could of course be a line of sight effect, its apparent motion in the sky suggested that it was physically close <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, he suggested that the Shoemakers and David Levy had discovered the fragments of a comet that had been disrupted by Jupiter's gravity.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there were}} no sitting justices at the {{beginning}} of Washington's term, he had the unique opportunity to fill the entire body of United States federal judges with his selections. Despite this, Washington appointed only 28 judges to the United States district courts, due to the smaller size of the judiciary at the time; there were far fewer states, most states had a single district court, and each district had a single judge assigned <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> intermediate federal appellate courts had not yet been established, this, combined with the Supreme Court appointments, constituted the total number of federal judicial appointments made by Washington. The number is roughly 10% of the record 376 judges appointed by Ronald Reagan from 1980 to 1988, when the judiciary was much larger, and less than 5% of the number of active federal judges serving as of July 2010. Richard Peters, Jr. served for over 36 years, the longest of Washington's appointments.|$|E
5|$|After {{his army}} crossed the Euphrates, {{following}} a route opened up by Lucullus {{over a hundred}} years before, he received envoys from Tiridates and Vologases. At the approach of such a large force, and aware of Corbulo's ability as a general, the two Arsacids were anxious to negotiate. Indeed, Corbulo, no doubt on instructions from Nero, reiterated the old Roman position: if Tiridates would accept his crown from Rome, then renewed war could be averted. Tiridates readily agreed to negotiations, and Rhandeia, the scene of last year's Roman defeat, was agreed upon as a meeting place. To the Armenians, this place was intended as a reminder of their strength, while Corbulo agreed <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> there he hoped to expunge the earlier disgrace, by peace or war. Once there, Corbulo put Paetus' son, who served under him as a legate, in charge of a party that was to gather the remains of the Roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial. On the agreed day, both Tiridates and Corbulo, each accompanied by 20 horsemen, met between the two camps. Tiridates agreed to travel to Rome and seek confirmation of his crown from Nero. In sign of this agreement, a few days later, both armies put on a display, arrayed in full parade gear. Tiridates approached the Roman camp, where a statue of the Emperor Nero had been erected upon a raised platform, and placed his royal diadem at its feet in submission.|$|E

Compliance can also be responsible for overshoot when carrying high payloads in which case acceleration would need to be reduced.|$|E
25|$|In Israel, {{a debate}} {{continues}} over the Law of Return. Some people wish to retain {{it as it}} stands, others want to modify it, and some to abolish the Law completely. Those who would abolish the Law object <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it grants Jews rights that members of other groups governed by the State of Israel do not have. Others argue that the law permits the entry of too many non-Jews, thereby undermining its purpose.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, the Laser {{was one of}} Ford Australia's most {{successful}} models and was manufactured in Ford's Homebush plant from 1981 until the plant's closure in September 1994.

Although Labour was soundly defeated, Tan {{remained}} committed <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of his belief in socialism, which the party shared. Tan helped Labour prepare memoranda submitted to the Reid Commission, which drew up the Constitution for Malaya, which achieved independence in 1957.|$|E
25|$|She {{applied for}} {{admission}} to various convents, but she was rejected because she could not afford a dowry. Eventually, the Poor Clares in Münster agreed to accept her, provided she would learn to play the organ. She went to the organist Söntgen in Coesfeld to study music and learn to play the organ, but she never got around <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> the poverty of the Söntgen family prompted her to work there to help them, and she sacrificed her small savings for that.

25|$|In Persian mythology, the Gaokerena world tree is a large, sacred Haoma tree which bears all seeds. Ahriman (Ahreman, Angremainyu) {{created a}} frog {{to invade the}} tree and destroy it, aiming to prevent all trees from growing on the earth. As a reaction, God (Ahura Mazda) created two kar fish staring at the frog to guard the tree. The two fish are always staring at the frog and stay ready to react <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> Ahriman is {{responsible}} for all evil including death, while Ahura Mazda is responsible for all good (including life) the concept of world tree in Persian mythology is very {{closely related to the}} concept of Tree of Life.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, New York and New Jersey had jointly {{acquired}} the Palisades, the cliffs {{along the west}} side of the Hudson in both states, to protect them from further damage due to quarrying. Making it a park for city residents to visit on hot summer weekends had not been part of the plan, but it quickly became one. Many residents could not get <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of insufficient ferry capacity. Its success as a park led to the establishment of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission and the construction of Palisades Interstate Parkway to allow nonstop drives through scenic and wooded areas through Palisades Park up to the Bear Mountain Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Pinot gris, Pinot grigio or Grauburgunder is a {{white wine}} grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera. Thought to be a mutant clone of the Pinot noir variety, it {{normally}} has a grayish-blue fruit, accounting for its name but the grapes can have a brownish pink to black and even white appearance. The word pinot supposedly could have been given <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> the grapes grow in small pine cone-shaped clusters. The wines produced from this grape also vary in color from a deep golden yellow to copper and even a light shade of pink, {{and it is one}} of the more popular grapes for skin-contact wine.|$|E

Much of the flashback was pitched by Conan O'Brien. The episode marks the first appearance of Superintendent Chalmers. The staff wanted to introduce a boss for Skinner, and Wallace Wolodarsky pitched his name. Much of the dialogue and interactions between Skinner and Chalmers were ad-libbed by Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, Charles Sternberg reevaluated the genera in Hadrosauridae, {{invoking the}} {{probability}} that Saurolophinae should be sunk into Hadrosaurinae. This greatly changed the classifications of the family, as the [...] "saurolophines" [...] were kept separate because of their supposedly [...] "footed" [...] ischium. Sternberg identified that the [...] "footed" [...] ischium assigned to Saurolophus was not found with the holotype, and was only assigned <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of {{the location of the}} find. Also, he noted that William Parks (1924) found a complete skeleton of Prosaurolophus clearly showing a [...] "unfooted" [...] ischium, which Sternberg realized meant that it was unlikely that Saurolophus possessed a [...] "footed" [...] ischium. Sternberg's reevaluation led to the abandonment of Saurolophinae.|$|E
