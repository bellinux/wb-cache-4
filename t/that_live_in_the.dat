5|$|The greater noctule bat also {{interacts with}} parasites <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees that they roost in and {{transfer}} {{themselves to the}} bats while they are sleeping. The greater noctule bat also interacts with the few nocturnal flying predators in its area, mainly owls that are {{much larger than the}} bat. Evidence of greater noctule bat bones have been found in owl pellets.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} large {{herbivore}} is the black-tailed deer, a subspecies of the mule deer. Elk and moose are less common. Mountain goats are well-adapted to steep terrain and cold temperatures, {{and are not}} usually found at lower elevations. There are eight species of bats <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Cascades.|$|E
5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species {{are present in the}} forest, with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E

5|$|Counter-illumination through {{bioluminescence}} on {{the underside}} (ventral region) {{of the body is}} found in many species <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish are}} covered with highly {{reflective}} scales, giving the appearance of silvered mirror glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by silvering.|$|E
5|$|Smilodon {{and other}} saber-toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored coats and with spotted {{patterns}} (which {{appears to be}} the ancestral condition for feliforms), both of which are considered possible. Studies of modern cat species have found that species <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open tend to have uniform coats while those that live in more vegetated habitats have more markings, with some exceptions. Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils.|$|E

5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and sequential. In the former, both spermatozoa and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, sea basses, flatheads, sea breams and lightfishes.|$|E
5|$|The Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau {{converge}} at Zion and the Kolob canyons. This, {{along with}} the varied topography of canyonâ€“mesa country, differing soil types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix {{of plants and animals}} <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species. These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the Park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.|$|E
5|$|The boardwalk {{is within}} the barker inlet aquatic reserve, where the taking of crabs {{shellfish}} and plants is prohibited and pets are not allowed. The mangroves, saltmarsh and adjacent lagoons form a habitat for over 200 bird species with the mangroves {{being part of a}} nursery area for most of the commercial and recreational fish species of Gulf St Vincent. The 2005 Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary Act established a sanctuary for the Bottlenose dolphins <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inlet and adjacent Port River. The sanctuary's northern extent is the boat channel and dolphins can sometimes be seen at high tide in the tidal creeks passing under the boardwalk.|$|E

5|$|The mockingbird's {{breeding}} range is from Maritime provinces of Canada westwards to British Columbia, practically the entire Continental United States {{south of the}} northern Plains states and Pacific northwest, {{and the majority of}} Mexico to eastern Oaxaca and Veracruz. The mockingbird is generally a year-round resident of its range, but the birds <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern portion of its range have been noted further south during the winter season. Sightings of the mockingbird have also been recorded in Hawaii (where it was introduced in the 1920s), southeastern Alaska, and twice as transatlantic vagrants in Britain. The mockingbird is thought to be at least partly migratory in the northern portions of its range, but the migratory behavior is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri was {{discovered}} during {{a survey of}} the endoparasites of Florida marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) by John Kinsella from 1970 to 1972, and is one of several new parasite species in this study, which was done because there were no previous comprehensive studies of the endoparasites of the species. Together with Danny Pence, Kinsella described the worm in a 1987 paper as Capillaria forresteri; the specific name honors Donald J. Forrester of the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida. Kinsella and Pence described it as one of many species of Capillaria, a large and taxonomically difficult genus. They suggested that it may be closest to some other small species <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> digestive systems of mammals, such as the very similar C.putorii, which is found in a variety of carnivorans in North America and Europe. In 1982, Moravec had placed Capillaria putorii and a number of related species in a separate genus, Aonchotheca, and in 1999 Pisanu and Bain transferred Capillaria forresteri and various other species to that genus from Capillaria. Thus, the species is now known as Aonchotheca forresteri.|$|E
5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds {{can be found on}} many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E
