The Immigration Authority must consult with regional Chambers of Commerce and regional and sector representatives on each application. This was to lower the standard and {{make it easier for}} immigrant entrepreneurs to qualify: the requirement of an investment of 250.000 and 5 jobs was replaced by these consultations. The amount of € 250.00 or 5 jobs is still indicative for an economic interest, but should in practice no longer be decisive. 24 The competent bodies for the planned business location, the competent trade and industry authorities, the representative bodies for public-sector professional groups and the competent authorities regulating admission to <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> <b>concerned</b> shall be involved in examining the application and they consider whether the specific region has a need for the offered services or business. So, there might be regional differences as regions have different economic needs. The {{discretionary power}} of the Immigration Authorities means {{that they do not have}} to follow the regional committees’ advice, it is as the word says, an advice. The advice given by the local Chamber of Commerce is the result of an internal procedure following the application. If the applicant would want to know in advance what his chance for success would be this is not possible, says the regional government of Stuttgart. 25 The advice is not communicated to the applicant. This means the reasoning might lack transparency and may put the applicant at a disadvantage if he were to appeal a rejection.|$|E

Sportswriting’s priorities have undergone enormous changes since Cardus’s heyday, not least in the premium placed on reporting the politics and business of sport, but thanks to the trail blazed by Cardus as well as the likes of American writers such as Paul Gallico and Damon Runyon, sports journalism remains the most literary branch of <b>the</b> <b>profession,</b> <b>concerned</b> as it still is with celebrating human endeavour, teamwork and the art and craft of competition. While many ballgames have long boasted such wordsmiths, two stand out for their traditional quality – cricket and baseball, in good part because of the sheer time each game consumes, permitting relatively leisurely reflection, but also because of the role each has historically played in helping define, respectively, English/Commonwealth and American identity. In addition to Cardus, cricket has given us John Arlott, Raymond Robertson-Glasgow, Alan Ross, David Foot, the Caribbean Marxist CLR James and the Australians Ray Robinson and Gideon Haigh; baseball reporting has been adorned by Grantland Rice, Ring Lardner, Roger Angell, Thomas Boswell, Roger Kahn and others.

40|$|This {{literature}} review for the Health Professions Council (HPC) {{focuses on the}} use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in the resolution of complaints or disputes between professionals and their clients. It provides an overview of the field before turning to issues of policy and practice such as the relationship between complaints handling and professional regulation; the ‘public interest’; apologies; and confidentiality. It reviews the use of ADR in a number of settings worldwide. Many of these studies show that initial responses to mediation are at best hesitant and at worst dismissive. However, once established, mediatory processes were judged by those involved to be both beneficial and effective. The literature indicates that a mediatory approach in a regulatory setting could add value to current processes for dealing with fitness to practise allegations. Certain conditions apply: for example, mediation needs to be offered early in the process, with an emphasis on face-to-face communication between the complainant and registrant, to facilitate explanation, apology (where appropriate and genuine) and plans for future learning and prevention. A ‘mediation manager’ plays a significant part in the success of those schemes that have been widely used, effectively acting as ‘champion’ during the introduction of an approach that may be unfamiliar or even regarded with suspicion by potential participants. The review also highlights two potential mechanisms for ensuring that mediated outcomes align with the HPC’s duty to protect the public: to refer these back to the Investigating Panel for ratification, and / or to have an HPC partner (with direct knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> <b>concerned)</b> as part of the mediation process...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCompetences {{represent}} {{a summary of}} key professional and personal skills/talents and behavioural patterns of an individual. They {{form the basis of}} any proficient working behaviour, and the level of their maturity is crucial for the successful performance of <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> <b>concerned.</b> From this point of view, the competences of university teachers are of exceptional importance, mainly because teachers constitute the basis for the creation of new knowledge and new values beneficial to the university as well as to students, and subsequently also to enterprises in the role of employers, who should be able to use reasonably and develop systematically the mature competences of their employees. The intention of the study is to analyse the professional-personal profile of university teachers and the competences they should have. The study also presents outcomes of a questionnaire-based survey conducted with a sample of 686 students of the University of Žilina, the Slovak Republic. The first stage of our survey (2012 / 2013, 395 students) focused on questioning as to which competences the teacher should have according to students. The second stage of our survey (2013 / 2014), which is dealt with in this study, focuses on defining the negative competences and characteristics of teachers, i. e. it focuses on the question as to which features the teacher should certainly not have. In addition to interesting outcomes of the survey, {{the most important part of}} the study is an originally created competence model of the university teacher. Such competence model should become a quality standard or a paragon of the positive indicators of the teacher's working behaviour. The model also needs to clearly define the negative indicators (undesirable behaviour) which teachers should eliminate from their performance and behaviour. Persistence of such behaviour should be strictly penalised by the management of the faculty or university...|$|E

Now, we have, in the Province of Quebec, an organism which is at the basis of this kind of system: the Parity Committees. The Parity Committees are born in our Province in 1934 from a law by which two groups or more of employers and employees who have agreed on labour and wage conditions in their proper trade, industry, commerce or occupation wheer they have acquired a preponderant significance and importance may ask the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to render obligatory to every establishment of the profession these conditions of labour and wages.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} cultural and historical implications of the long-held power of French haute cuisine in the public sphere. French culinary rule is understood to have a complex genealogy stretching back into modern European history where place, status, consumption practices and practices of consumption emerge entangled with meanings that outlast their time and place of birth. The argument focuses on the conjunction {{of a set of}} historical processes during the period 1870 - 1910, processes that explain the genesis and persistence of such a reign: the existence of French haute cuisine as a discourse and a commodity, the rise of the public sphere in Europe, and the development of <b>the</b> culinary <b>profession.</b> ^ <b>The</b> emergence of France as the ruler {{in the realm of the}} haute occurred among a transnational community of producers and consumers of haute cuisine located in France and England. An analysis of French haute cuisine 2 ̆ 7 s dominance in the public sphere perforce opens larger intellectual issues concerning definitions of culture, processes of class formation, notions about standards of taste, and the discourses of art and artistry. ^ Although the bulk of this project concerns the circumstances and contexts for the historical development of a culinary profession and a culinary discourse, the importance of culture, class and knowledge does not lie solely with the genesis of <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> <b>Concerns</b> about <b>the</b> power of France, the need to elevate <b>the</b> <b>profession,</b> and <b>the</b> emphasis on technical mastery continue in the contemporary milieu.

40|$|Valuation has {{a pivotal}} role in {{increasing}} the level of sustainability in the built environment. To date, sustainability has received limited attention in valuation practice, and as a result the relationship between sustainability and market value has not been clearly defined. As a consequence, the commercial investment community are hesitant to invest in sustainability beyond best practice management techniques. Valuers’ lack of acknowledgement of sustainability in valuation practice and its changing role in property investment in the built environment, has had a potentially detrimental impact by limiting investment in sustainability in commercial property. Consequently, this lack of acknowledgment and incorporation of sustainability in practice has the potential to cause chaos within the market in the future. It was found that valuers, per se, are inexperienced and have limited knowledge of sustainability in commercial property. Due to differences between generations of valuers, this paper examines whether ‘younger’ valuers’ 1 knowledge of sustainability, as a concept, measurement and any possible relationship with market value is more extensive than senior valuers. Or whether senior valuers experiences in the market are more sensitive to the change sustainability is having in the commercial property market. A key issue for <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> <b>concerning</b> sustainability and its effect on the market is the limited channels for knowledge development. The implications of this research are the need for increased curriculum in university education, so knowledge dissemination across <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> can be achieved.

As a consequence, this will increase the investment in sustainability in the commercial property market. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Thanks to {{the banking}} crisis, {{there has been}} a greater {{awareness}} that leading economic theories and models, as well as influential advanced textbooks in macroeconomics and monetary economics may have been amiss when they neglected to include banks in their analyses. Economists are now labouring to include banking in their models. However already sixteen years ago a paper was published in this journal which presented probably the simplest possible framework that incorporates the economic consequences of banking into a macroeconomic framework: The ‘Quantity Theory of Credit’ (QTC, Werner (1997)). It resolves a number of perceived ‘anomalies’ in macroeconomics and finance, can be used to explain and predict banking crises, and carries a number of policy implications about how to enhance financial stability and deliver sustainable growth.

Foram entrevistadas 100 cirurgiãs-dentistas, da cidade de Araçatuba, SP, utilizando-se um formulário com 30 perguntas. Os resultados mostraram que 87 % disseram não ser {{a principal}} fonte de renda de sua família, 38 % possuem renda mensal inferior à R$ 1. 500, 00; 44 % afirmaram que a renda obtida com o exercício profissional não é suficiente.

Results showed statistically significant differences between gender and vets' reactor detection: male vets were more likely to detect animal disease than female vets.
