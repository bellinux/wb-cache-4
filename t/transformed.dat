40|$|The paper {{presents}} the novel hybrid wavelet <b>transform</b> generation technique using two orthogonal <b>transforms.</b> The orthogonal <b>transforms</b> {{are used for}} analysis of global properties of the data into frequency domain. For studying the local properties of the signal, the concept of wavelet <b>transform</b> is introduced, where the mother wavelet function gives the global properties of the signal and wavelet basis functions which are compressed versions of mother wavelet are used to study the local properties of the signal. In wavelets of some orthogonal <b>transforms</b> the global characteristics of the data are hauled out better and some orthogonal <b>transforms</b> might give the local characteristics in better way. The idea of hybrid wavelet <b>transform</b> comes in to picture in view of combining the traits of two different orthogonal <b>transform</b> wavelets to exploit the strengths of both the <b>transform</b> wavelets.
