40|$|This paper {{describes}} an extension to ditroff/ffortid, {{a system for}} formatting bi-directional text in Arabic, Hebrew and Persian. The previous version {{of the system is}} able to format mixed left-to-right and rightto -left text using fonts with separated letters or with connecting letters and only connection stretching, achieved by repeating fixed-length baseline fillers. The latest extension adds the abilities <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>letters</b> themselves, as is common in Arabic, Hebrew and Persian calligraphic printing, and to slant the basefines of words, as is common in Persian calligraphic printing. The extension consists of modilications in ffortid that allow it to interface with (1) dynamic POSTSCRIPT fonts to which one can pass to the outline procedure for any stretchable and/or connected letter, parameters specifying the amounts of stretch for the letter itself and/or for the connecting parts of the letter, and (2) POSTSCRIPT fonts whose characters are slanted so that merely applying,,how to a word ends up printing that entire word on a single slanted basefine. As a self-test, this paper was formatted using the described system, and it contains many examples of text written in Arabic, Hebrew and Persian. Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Lt...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{contribution}} is to present a program that allows the composition of variablesized curved symbols such as those occurring in mathematics. This application, called CurExt, extends {{the capabilities of the}} well-known TEX system designed by D. E. Knuth for typesetting. Big delimiters, such as brackets, or special curved symbols, such as the Arabic mathematical summation symbol, can be built automatically according to the size and the shape of the concerned mathematical expression. CurExt will make it possible <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> Arabic <b>letters</b> according <b>to</b> calligraphic rules in order to draw the kashida. It follows a useful tool for justifying texts written with the Arabic alphabet. Unlike in Latin alphabet based writing, where the justification is done through inserting small blanks among characters, cursive writing fills in the space between characters with the kashida.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is about a}} typeface for implementing Persian calligraphy called Nastaliq. The main purpose for developing this font was <b>to</b> handle <b>stretching</b> of <b>letters</b> {{in order to achieve}} line justification through a dynamic font. Therefore, a PostScript Type 3 font was developed. However, as the research progressed, it came clear that Nastaliq’s stretching cannot be implemented in a dynamic font. Therefore, the research’s purpose changes to implementing a font containing all the needed glyphs of all needed stretchings of all stretchable letters to allow achieving line justification. For this propose a mathematical formulation to model handwritten Nastaliq was necessary. The result was a PostScript font containing more than 1200 glyphs. To make it possible to use this font in the future, a regular expression grammar was developed to identify and name each glyph as a positioned letter in a particular context. This thesis describes all the steps taken to build the font...|$|R

The problem Variable-sized symbols Besides xed size symbols, such as characters of Latin alphabet in a given font or basic mathematical symbols (e. g., +, ¡), there are symbols with a context dependant size. Some mathematical symbols, such as delimiters or Arabic characters, are examples of these variable-sized symbols. The variation of size can concern: the width of the symbol, such as in: the various parts of some symbols (e. g.,E or,)). A horizontal <b>stretching,</b> according <b>to</b> the expression covered by the operator, is sometimes necessary; the kashida for some characters of the Arabic alphabet (e. g.,,) or certain Arabic mathematical symbols such as th-ose found in the abbreviations of usual fun-ctions (e. g.,,,) in mathematical expressions. The kashida, a small curve, is used <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> some characters in order to cover the concerned mathematical expression or to break the line when the left margin is reached; some diacritics or accents (e. g., abc; abc; cabc; fabc;Ã¡abc;¡!abc; z}|{abc; abc|{z} o...|$|R
