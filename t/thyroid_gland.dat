5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are small}} {{endocrine}} glands {{in the neck}} of humans and other tetrapods that produce parathyroid hormone. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, variably located {{on the back of}} the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin (one of the hormones made by the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland)</b> have key roles in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.|$|E
5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{variable in}} number: {{three or more}} small glands, and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. Rarely, the parathyroid glands may be within the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> itself, the chest, or even the thymus.|$|E
5|$|Desiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> extract, most {{commonly}} from pigs. It {{is a combination}} therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3. It also contains calcitonin (a hormone produced in the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are not present in synthetic hormone medication. This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its use today is unsupported by evidence; British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use.|$|E

5|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is an autoimmune {{disorder in}} which the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> is infltrated by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. These progressively destroy the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's {{is more common in}} females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease vitiligo.|$|E

5|$|When present, {{the thyroid}} ima's chief supply is the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> though it also {{supplies}} the trachea. The artery may extend and supply the parathyroid glands. An infrequently observed artery, {{it is more}} frequently reported {{in the context of}} enlarged parathyroid glands (parathyroid adenomas). The artery ends by supplying the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> or the parathyroid glands, as a single unit or as multiple branches. The artery is also found to be the only supply of the parathyroid gland in rare cases.|$|E

5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E

5|$|The <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> {{or simply}} the thyroid, is an {{endocrine}} gland in the neck, {{consisting of two}} lobes connected by an isthmus. It is found {{at the front of}} the neck, below the Adam's apple. The <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> secretes thyroid hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis. The hormones also have many other effects including those on development. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are created from iodine and tyrosine. The thyroid also produces the hormone calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium homeostasis.|$|E

5|$|In medicine, a {{saturated}} solution of potassium iodide {{is used to}} treat acute thyrotoxicosis.

5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} {{often have}} no or only mild symptoms.

40|$|The {{significance}} of intrathyroidal lymphocytic infiltration is not known. However, several indirect lines of evidence suggest that interstitial or intraepithelial lymphocytes are the effector or thyroid autoantibody-producing lymphocytes in Graves' disease. This {{has not been}} investigated in vivo. Changes of nuclear volume of endocrine cells have previously {{been shown to be}} a reliable parameter of functional stimulation of endocrine glands. Therefore we investigated this parameter near and off lymphocytic aggregates, loosely distributed plasma cells and memory T cells in paraffine sections of Graves' disease <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> In 21 Graves' disease <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> we found significant increases of thyroid epithelial cell nuclear volume near plasma cells (198. 4 μm 3) as well as near lymphocytic aggregates (219. 1 μm 3) compared with thyroid epithelial cell nuclear volume one microscopic field away (160. 1 and 137. 7 μm 3 respectively). Similar nuclear volume differences were observed after propanolol and thiourelene antithyroid drug treatment. These nuclear volume differences could not be observed in 10 control <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> and around CD 45 R 0 -positive memory T cells in Graves' disease <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> These direct in vivo investigations of regional functional stimulation of thyroid epithelial cells in Graves' disease show local stimulation near lymphocytic aggregates and diffusely distributed plasma cells. Therefore our in vivo data do not permit to identify stimulatory lymphocytes only interstitially or intraepithelially as previously suggested. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|The <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> {{needs no}} more than 70μg/day to {{synthesise}} the requisite daily amounts of T4 and T3.

5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> Unlike iodine, astatine also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E

5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis).

40|$|One {{approach}} to prevent tissue destruction by autoimmune attack in organ-specific autoimmune diseases {{is to protect}} the target tissue from autoimmune reaction, regardless of its persistent activity. To provide proof-of-principle for the feasibility of this approach, the immunoregulatory molecules, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase, were expressed in the <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> using adenovirus vector in nonobese diabetic-H 2 (h 4) mice that spontaneously develop thyroiditis. Mice were anesthetized, and the <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were exposed by neck dissection, followed by in situ infection with adenovirus vector (5 x 10 (10) particles per mouse) twice or thrice, starting 1 d or 4 wk before mice were supplied with sodium iodine (NaI) water. After 8 wk NaI provision, the extent of thyroiditis, serum titers of antithyroglobulin antibodies, and cytokine expression in the spleen were examined. In situ infection of adenovirus expressing TRAIL or indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase, but not green fluorescent protein, significantly suppressed thyroiditis scores. However, antithyroglobulin antibody titers and expression levels of cytokines (interferon-gamma and IL- 4) in the spleen remained unaltered. Importantly, adenovirus infection 4 wk after NaI provision was also effective at suppressing thyroiditis. The suppressive effect of TRAIL appears to be mediated at least partly by accumulation of CD 4 (+) Foxp 3 (+) regulatory T cells into the <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> Thus, localized expression of immunoregulatory molecules efficiently protected the <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> from autoimmune attack without changing the systemic autoimmunity in nonobese diabetic-H 2 (h 4) mice. This kind of immunological intervention, although it does not suppress autoimmune reactivity, may have a potential for treating organ-specific autoimmune diseases...|$|R
