5|$|In 1916, Harry Frazee {{purchased}} <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sox, on credit, for $500,000. Despite Ruth's {{success with}} <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sox, owner and Broadway producer Frazee lost his patience with Ruth, who {{had threatened to}} hold out {{in lieu of a}} larger contract and become a distraction. After <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sox finished sixth in the American League in 1919, Frazee, needing money to finance a Broadway musical, No, No Nanette, sold pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth to the Yankees. Frazee received $125,000 and a loan of $300,000—secured on Fenway Park, <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sox' home stadium—for Ruth, despite Ruth having set the record for home runs with 29 in 1919. This began a series of deals with the Yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sox while the Yankees began their dynasty.|$|E
