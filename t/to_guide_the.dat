5|$|Two main {{surgical}} procedures {{exist in the}} treatment of IIH: optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration and shunting. Surgery would normally only be offered if medical therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated. The choice between these two procedures depends on the predominant problem in IIH. Neither procedure is perfect: both may cause significant complications, and both may eventually fail in controlling the symptoms. There are no randomized controlled trials <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>the</b> decision as to which procedure is best.|$|E
5|$|When Parseghian {{arrived at}} Northwestern, its {{football}} program was in transition. Bob Voigts had quit {{as head coach}} in February 1955, leaving his assistant Lou Saban <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>the</b> team. Under Saban, a former Browns teammate of Parseghian's, Northwestern finished at 0–8–1, the worst-ever record in its history at the time. Ted Payseur, the school's athletic director, resigned after the season under pressure from alumni {{and was replaced by}} Stu Holcomb. One of Holcomb's first moves was to fire Saban and replace him with Parseghian.|$|E
5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired a Harpoon Missile, {{a booster}} propelled the missile {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target.

These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.|$|E

5|$|When {{the system}} was first being {{proposed}} {{it was not clear}} whether the phased-array systems could provide the accuracy needed <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>the</b> missiles to a successful interception at very long ranges.

In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|E
5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>the</b> pollen to the seed.|$|E

5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>the</b> female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} Murder on the Orient Express is Poirot, {{who serves as}} a hint system for the {{duration}} of the game. The player can access Poirot at any time during the game, and can receive hints to help them proceed. The game has two difficulty levels, and the player can determine which one they prefer to play at soon after the murder occurs. Poirot challenges the player, allowing them to choose to either readily accept help from him and allow him <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>the</b> player through the game, or alternatively try to outsmart the famous sleuth by solving the mystery with obscure, and in some cases nonexistent hints. If the player has trouble once they have chosen the more difficult setting, Poirot will gradually become more forthcoming with information.|$|E
5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>the</b> cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E

5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>the</b> baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>the</b> helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
