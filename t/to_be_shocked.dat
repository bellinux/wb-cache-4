40|$|The {{financial}} accelerator hypothesis (FAH) {{states that}} following aggregate shocks, financially constrained firms find {{it harder to}} access external finance and therefore have to reduce invest-ment. We test three forecasting implications of the FAH with a new variable (Goliath versus David), which is the annual change in {{the weight of the}} largest firms in the aggregate stock market. First, we show that is countercyclical and forecasts stock market returns and investment growth. In fact, is the only variable that predicts stock market returns and investment growth both in-sample and out-of-sample among nine traditional predictors in the literature. Second, we find that both investment growth and aggregate market returns respond more strongly <b>to</b> <b>’s</b> <b>shocks</b> during economic downturns. Third, the investment growth of firms with poorer access <b>to</b> external finance <b>is</b> more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>’s</b> <b>shocks.</b> Moreover, we show that ’s predictive ability is robust and not due to information contained in tradi-tional variables, such as SMB and net payout.

We were initially encouraged by his progress at Walter Reed Hospital, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> by the news on 8 February that his health had suffered a grave new blow.

2500|$|By early 2002, the long-simmering {{feud with}} Martin {{came to a}} head. A {{particular}} concern that had badly strained relations between the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister by early 2002 was Martin's control of the Liberal Party apparatus, especially his control over the issuing of membership forms, which he reserved largely for his own supporters. In January 2002, Brian Tobin complained to Chrétien that the Liberal Party machinery had been [...] "captured" [...] by Martin's followers {{to the extent that}} it was now virtually impossible for anyone else to sign up their own followers. This posed a major problem for Chrétien as the Liberals were due to hold a leadership review in February 2003 and owing to Martin's control of the party machinery that it was quite possible that Chrétien would win by such a slim margin that it would be humiliating or even lose the leadership review. In January 2002, an incident occurred which was to greatly damage Chrétien's relations with the Liberal caucus. After Chrétien reorganized the Cabinet in late January 2002, the Liberal M.P. Carolyn Bennett criticised Chrétien at a caucus meeting for not appointing more women to the Cabinet. Chrétien exploded with rage at Bennett's criticism, saying that as a mere backbencher she did not have the right to criticise the Prime Minister in front of the caucus, and attacked her with such fury that Bennett collapsed in tears. Health Minister Anne McLellan recalled in an interview that: [...] "He just blew up. Right off the Richter scale!". Even after Bennett had broken in tears and was so distraught that she could no longer stand, Chrétien gave no mercy and continued to shout abuse at her, leading Intergovernmental Affairs minister Stéphane Dion to conclude that Chrétien wanted to stop his outburst, but was so angry at Bennett that he could not bring himself to do so. Bennett claimed that the Prime Minister's outburst was due to the influence of his communications director, Françoise Ducros, saying that [...] "Francie was probably telling him what a bitch I was" [...] in pressing for more female ministers (Ducros and Bennett were known to very much dislike each other). After the meeting had ended, much of the Grit caucus went over to offer support for Bennett while pointedly ignoring Chrétien while the same night Paul Martin and his wife took Bennett and her husband out to dinner at one of Ottawa's more expensive restaurants as consolation. The Liberal M.P. Bonnie Brown was one of the few MPs who defended Chrétien's tongue-lashing of Bennett, saying [...] "at every single cocktail party she was at, Carolyn Bennett was bad-mouthing the Prime Minister", suggested that Bennett only criticised Chrétien because he refused to appoint her to the Cabinet, and that [...] "You can't have people in your Cabinet who don't have respect. He's very big on respect". The Bennett incident convinced much of the Liberal caucus that Chrétien had become a power-crazed bully, and that it was time for the Liberals to have a new leader. Reflecting their displeasure with Chrétien, in early February 2002 the Liberal caucus elected as their chairman, the outspoken pro-Martin M.P. Stan Keyes (who had already openly mused in 2001 about how it was time for Chrétien to go), who defeated the pro-Chrétien M.P. Steve Mahoney. Chrétien had expected Mahoney to win, and was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> when he learned of Keyes's victory, which now given Martin control of the caucus.|$|E
