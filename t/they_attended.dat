5|$|In 1955, a {{redistribution}} divided Whitlam's electorate of Werriwa in two, {{with his}} Cronulla home {{located in the}} new electorate of Hughes. Although Whitlam would have received ALP support in either division, he chose to continue standing for Werriwa and moved from Cronulla to Cabramatta. This meant even longer journeys for his older children to attend school, since neither electorate had a high school at the time, and <b>they</b> <b>attended</b> school in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|The Australian press {{attacked}} the team, {{and called for}} changes, including the omission of the captain, Johnson. Johnson, Miller and Gil Langley were the tour selectors. Langley and Miller were willing to omit Johnson only if the captain volunteered to stand aside. Johnson did not volunteer, so the others did not discuss the topic. Miller and Johnson had both been appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours, and between the Tests <b>they</b> <b>attended</b> their formal investiture.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Ape Escape lasted approximately two-and-a-half years.

Intrigued by the potential of the controller, the team implemented its use in Ape Escape, making it the first video game to require the use of the DualShock for gameplay. Conceptualizing the controls for the controller's analog sticks was the greatest challenge for the team, and the controls underwent great testing prior to finalization.|$|E

5|$|Alonso and Arteta were {{ambitious and}} dreamed of playing {{alongside}} each other for Real Sociedad when they were older. Though <b>they</b> <b>attended</b> different schools, the two young players joined forces at the local youth side Antiguoko, playing games at the weekend. Their performances {{attracted the attention of}} scouts from top Spanish sides and the young Donostiarras separated ways, ending nine years of friendly rivalry, as Alonso went to Real Sociedad and Arteta moved to Catalan giants Barcelona. Alonso's move to Real Sociedad, however, was not a companionless one, as his older brother Mikel, who had also become an adept player, had joined the club one year earlier.|$|E

5|$|Fischer and Cristina {{often did}} outdoor {{activities}} together, but Fischer's stepmother {{thought they were}} only friends. She said that she never saw them hold hands or behave {{in a way that}} suggested intimacy. According to his friends, Fischer went with Cristina to South Padre Island, Texas, during spring break and had sex with her in her parents' condominium. They said that he did not brag about it, and in fact seemed to regret his decision. Cristina denied this ever happened. Later that year <b>they</b> <b>attended</b> St. Joe's prom together. In June 1992, Fischer broke up with Cristina; he told one of his friends that their relationship was only physical, and he did not feel an emotional attachment to her. Fischer had given Cristina his ring while they were dating, and once they broke up he asked her to return it. Cristina refused.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the Duke and Duchess visited London as the Duke {{required}} eye {{surgery for}} a detached retina; Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, visited them. The Duke's sister, the Princess Royal, also visited just 10 days before her death. <b>They</b> <b>attended</b> her memorial service in Westminster Abbey. Later, in 1967, the Duke and Duchess joined {{the royal family}} in London for the unveiling of a plaque by Elizabeth II to commemorate the centenary of Queen Mary's birth. Both Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles visited the Windsors in Paris in the Duke's later years, the Queen's visit coming only shortly before the Duke died.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1945 several hundred {{veterans}} of the battle were detached from operations in Norway and returned to Arnhem {{to take part in}} filming for the war movie Theirs Is the Glory. While there <b>they</b> <b>attended</b> the first commemorative event at the cemetery. This event continued every year, and was attended by veterans, local residents and over 1000 school children who laid flowers on the graves of the dead. After the 25th anniversary in 1969, the Parachute Regiment approached Dutch organisers to suggest ending the ceremony, believing the battle to have passed sufficiently into history. The Dutch were vehemently and emotionally opposed to the idea and thus the ceremony continues to be held annually.|$|E

5|$|Ngoia Pollard {{began her}} {{contemporary}} artistic career by assisting her husband, who painted with Papunya Tula artists {{for several years}} prior to his death. In 1997, Ngoia Pollard began painting independently, and in 2004 won the first prize in a central Australian painting competition supported by the region's major newspaper, the Centralian Advocate. In 2006, Ngoia Pollard won the painting prize in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, with her work Swamps west of Nyirripi. Another of her works painted in the same year, and carrying the same title, was acquired by the Art Gallery of South Australia. 2006 was also marked by an artist's residency in Copenhagen, shared with fellow Indigenous artist Lilly Kelly Napangardi, whom she had known since <b>they</b> <b>attended</b> school together in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Melbourne Club {{decided that}} the team should wear red, white and blue colours on their {{clothing}} for the game. Although they had {{a long time to}} prepare, the MCC had some difficulty in assembling enough men to represent Port Phillip; many potential players were unable to spare the time to travel to Van Diemen's Land. Even as the team prepared to depart, only ten people had been found, and the eleventh, Duncan Cooper, only joined as they left on the steamer Shamrock. The eleven Victorian players, accompanied by many acquaintances, both men and women, arrived in Launceston on 9 February. On the evening of their arrival, <b>they</b> <b>attended</b> a dinner at the Cornwall Hotel with 100 paying guests. The following day, the team won a match against Bishopthorpe College. There was little time to practise before the intercolonial game.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{approach}} for Carnivàle {{was to find}} the best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much. Carnivàles casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. <b>They</b> <b>attended</b> theater showcases, approached smaller agents or hired some actors directly to find people with unique and distinct looks, which was trying as Los Angeles is a stronghold of good-looking actors. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions for established actors such as Adrienne Barbeau (Ruthie).|$|E
