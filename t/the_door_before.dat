5|$|The goal in each cavern is {{to locate}} both {{the end of}} level door and the special pillar which unlocks it. When stepped on, the pillar {{activates}} a countdown timer, during which the door is open. Once the timer is active, the player must get to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>before</b> the timer ends and the door re-closes. There are multiple bonus games in between levels where the player can amass more treasure. Later levels include caveman villages where the player can purchase new tools with collected treasure as a currency.|$|E
5|$|After the Simpsons {{have left}} the museum, they head for Krusty Burger where they {{discover}} Krusty crying in a ball pit. Krusty is encouraged by them into making a comeback, and they inform him that they met an agent that can help him out. However, when they all go to Annie's office, Annie instantly recognizes Krusty and angrily slams <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>before</b> he {{gets a chance to}} enter. It is revealed that Annie was the one who discovered Krusty, became his first agent, and was responsible for his rise to success. They also had a romantic relationship together. However, once he achieved fame, Krusty fired Annie and replaced her with a more acclaimed agent, and as a result their relationship ended. Back in the present, he begs her to take him back as a client, and she eventually accepts.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the player}} visits the Moogle's shop and discovers {{it has been}} {{attacked}} by a giant Heartless. The player helps four Keyblade wielders chase down the Heartless in the sewers but it proves to be very powerful while in water. While the four Keyblade wielders hold it off, the player drains out the water and defeats the giant Heartless. Afterwards, they return to the Moogle's shop just as the Moogle has repaired the damage and returns to chat with the four Keyblade Wielders, who now admit that they are friends and continues {{to assist them in}} various missions (either together, separately, or alone). Throughout this point, significant scenes are shown as the player progresses (which actually take place in the real world either before or after the Keyblade War): the first scene takes place {{after the end of the}} Keyblade War, where Ephemer meets up with Skuld, revealing that they are two of the five people selected to become new Foretellers. Two others selected Keyblade Wielders, Ventus and Brain, appear to greet them followed by the fifth selected person, Lauriam (who is the original form of Marluxia). Later, they come to the Foreteller's room where they learn that they must start their own unions and to avoid the terrible incidents that happened in the past, they decide to create Spirit Dream Eaters to help the other Keyblade Wielders. The second shows a flashback of the Master of Masters instructing Ava to form the Dandelions and select five of them to be the new Foretellers, who also plans to give the Book of Prophecies to one of them. Ava later informs this to Ephemer and plans to have him and four others become the new Foretellers. The third shows Chrithy informing Ephemer and Skuld that the player's character is dreaming and Ephemer warns them that a stronger source of darkness is coming and plans to form the Union Cross to stop it while encouraging Chrithy to protect the player. The fourth introduces Strelitzia, a Dandelion Keyblade Wielder who has secretly been following the player on their quest until being recruited by Ava, revealing that she is the true fifth selected Keyblade Wielder. She is skeptical of this but is encouraged by her Chrithy to do so, despite also having doubts. After realizing that the player is not a Dandelion, she decides to find and convince them to join the Dandelions. While searching a dark building, she and her Chrithy are ambushed by an unseen person, who steals the book that Ava gave her. The dying Strelitzia carries her Chrithy towards <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>before</b> they fade from existence. Later (taking place after the player fights Master Aced), the story itself goes through an entirely different plot after that. The player and Chrithy later meet another Chrithy, who entrusts them a gift from the Foretellers, a Spirit Dream Eater.|$|E

50|$|After Morrison’s {{death in}} 1971, Krieger, Manzarek and Densmore carried on as a trio. They {{released}} two more albums as <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> <b>before</b> disbanding in 1973, {{though they did}} reconvene {{a few years later}} to create music for poetry that Morrison had recorded shortly before his death, released as the 1978 album An American Prayer.|$|R
25|$|Williams {{made the}} hole {{big enough to}} get into the next room, which was {{occupied}} only by patient Private Waters, and dragged the patients through. The last man out was Hook, who killed some Zulus who had knocked down <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>before</b> he dived through the hole. John Williams once again went to work, spurred on {{by the fact that the}} roof was now ablaze, as Hook defended the hole and Waters continued to fire through a loophole.|$|E

The Doctor then takes the goods and closes <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>before</b> The Brute can get inside.|$|E
500|$|Puccini's {{score is}} built around a series of motifs which recur through the opera, {{generally}} representing characters, situations and moods though sometimes without specific associations. The opening motif is a rapid burst of rhythmic music, described by Greenfield as of [...] "almost Stravinskian sharpness", which quickly transforms into a mock-solemn dirge depicting the hypocritical grief of the Donati relatives. This juxtaposition of the humorous and the solemn pervades the opera; critic Ernest Newman suggests that it [...] "keeps us perpetually suspended between the comic and the tragic". Other principal motifs include the theme associated with the lovers Rinuccio and Lauretta, introduced in Rinuccio's first solo [...] "Salvati! Salvati!", and a short, formal woodwind statement which represents Donati's will. Rinuccio sings the name [...] "Gianni Schicchi" [...] to a jaunty four-note phrase which becomes Schicchi's personal motif, and it is heard again as Schicchi knocks on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>before</b> his first appearance. The best-known theme in the opera, that associated with Lauretta, is introduced {{in the second part}} of Rinuccio's aria [...] "Avete torto". The theme is briefly played on clarinet and violin as Lauretta enters with Schicchi, before its full expression in O mio babbino caro.|$|E

2500|$|A {{white man}} was {{reported}} by a lone witness to have walked halfway up to King's door and thrown something against <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>before</b> running back to his car and speeding off. Ernest Walters, the lone witness, did not manage to get the license plate number because of how quickly the events transpired. Both of the couple's fathers contacted them over the bombing. The two arrived nearly at the same time, along with her husband's mother and brother. Coretta's father Obie said he would take her and her daughter back to Marion if his son-in-law did not take them to Atlanta. Coretta refused the proclamation, and insisted on staying with her husband. Despite Martin Luther King, Sr. also advocating that she leave with her father, King persisted in leaving with him. Author Octavia B. Vivian wrote [...] "That night Coretta lost her fear of dying. She committed herself more deeply to the freedom struggle, as Martin had done four days previously, when jailed {{for the first time}} in his life." [...] Coretta would later call it the first time she realized [...] "how much I meant to Martin in terms of supporting him in what he was doing".|$|E
2500|$|On October 28, 1962, Barry and Greenwich married, {{and shortly}} {{afterwards}} {{decided to write}} songs exclusively with each other — a decision that disappointed Tony Powers as well as Barry's main writing partner, Artie Resnick. Barry was subsequently signed to Trinity Music, and he and Greenwich were given their own office with their names on <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>Before</b> the end of 1963, Barry-Greenwich had scored hits with songs such as [...] "Be My Baby" [...] and [...] "Baby, I Love You" [...] (The Ronettes), [...] "Then He Kissed Me" [...] and [...] "Da Doo Ron Ron" [...] (The Crystals), [...] "Not Too Young To Get Married" [...] (Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans), and [...] "Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)" [...] by Darlene Love, all co-written and produced by Phil Spector. Greenwich and Barry also recorded singles and an album under the name The Raindrops, with Greenwich providing all the female vocals through overdubbing, and Barry singing backgrounds in a bass voice. In addition to [...] "What A Guy" [...] (actually a demo, with Greenwich on piano and Barry on drums, sold to Jubilee Records and released as the first Raindrops single) and the U.S. Top 20 hit [...] "The Kind Of Boy You Can't Forget," [...] the couple wrote and recorded [...] "Hanky Panky", which later became a hit for Tommy James and the Shondells in 1966 and, in 1964, [...] "Do Wah Diddy Diddy", {{was taken to the}} No. 1 spot on the charts, in both the UK and the US, by Manfred Mann. Toward the end of 1963, the Raindrops recorded [...] "That Boy John", a catchy fusion of jazz and rhythm and blues that reached the middle of the charts; President John F. Kennedy had just been assassinated and, according to Barry and Greenwich, radio stations were loath to play the song. Barry and Greenwich also penned songs for Connie Francis and in 1964 charted with two Lesley Gore hits, [...] "Maybe I Know" [...] and [...] "Look of Love." ...|$|E

Furthermore, the flight crew confirmed that they had encountered difficulty closing <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>before</b> take-off. As <b>the</b> air pressure differential increased with altitude, the few locks that were working correctly were unable to bear the load, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> failed.|$|R
