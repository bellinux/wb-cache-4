5|$|Secretariat was by Bold Ruler, {{who led the}} North America sire list eight times, {{more than}} any other {{stallion}} in the 20th century. He also led the juvenile (two-year-old) sire list a record six times. Before Secretariat's Triple Crown run, Bold Ruler was often categorized as a sire of precocious juveniles that lacked stamina or did not train on past age two. However, even before Secretariat, Bold Ruler actually had sired 11 stakes winners of races at 10 furlongs or more. Ultimately, seven of the ten Kentucky Derby winners in the 1970s traced directly to Bold Ruler in their <b>tail</b> <b>male</b> lines, including Secretariat and fellow Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Cokayne was preoccupied by {{questions}} of inheritance and the consequent family disputes. He was possibly aware of his impending death when in the Spring of 1438 he levied a fine of lands to compel the tenants of his manors of Calton, Staffordshire, and Ballidon, Derbyshire, to recognise the rights of Isabel, his second wife, as joint landholder. He had conditionally leased Ballidon to John and Robert Taylor, two local men, the previous year, probably in preparation for this legal stratagem. Similarly Calton was leased to Richard Bingham and Richard Bromley, who agreed to recognise John and Isabel as joint holders of the estate. Bingham and John Manchester were similarly used as lessees to levy fines on other Derbyshire and Warwickshire properties. The aim seems to have been to speed Isabel's succession on Cokayne's death but to secure the estates in <b>tail</b> <b>male,</b> thus avoiding losses due to his heir's minority.|$|E
500|$|Concern {{exists that}} the closed stud book and tightly {{regulated}} {{population of the}} Thoroughbred is at risk of loss of genetic diversity because {{of the level of}} inadvertent inbreeding inevitable in such a small population. According to one study, 78% of alleles in the current population can be traced to 30foundation animals, 27 of which are male. Ten foundation mares account for 72% of maternal (tail-female) lineages, and, as noted above, one stallion appears in 95% of <b>tail</b> <b>male</b> lineages. [...] Thoroughbred pedigrees are generally traced through the maternal line, called the distaff line. The line that a horse comes from is a critical factor in determining the price for a young horse.|$|E
