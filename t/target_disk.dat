40|$|With {{the help}} of the double-anchoring theory of {{lightness}} (Bressan, 2006 Psychological Review 113 526 - 553), we investigated the occurrence and reversal of simultaneous contrast in the dungeon illusion (Bressan, 2001 Perception 30 1031 - 1046). In this display, <b>target</b> <b>disks</b> surrounded by contextual disks contrast with them rather than with the immediate background. We show that the dungeon illusion reverses if the luminance of the target is either lower (double decrement) or higher (double increment) than the luminances of both the background and contextual disks, rather than in-between them. We also show that remote luminances outside the display of primary interest affect these inverted-dungeon displays in ways that depend on the strength of grouping between <b>target</b> and contextual <b>disks.</b> As a consequence, the double-decrement inverted-dungeon illusion decreases, and the double-increment inverted-dungeon illusion increases, with remote luminance. We conclude that far-away luminances that are normally ignored as of marginal importance can {{play a critical role in}} lightness...|$|R
40|$|In various {{versions}} of the dungeon illusion (P. Bressan, 2001), we show that grouping between <b>targets</b> and contextual <b>disks</b> determines whether remote luminances affect target lightness or not. In the dungeon illusion, <b>target</b> <b>disks</b> surrounded by contextual disks contrast with them rather than with the immediate background. We formally establish {{the existence of this}} illusion and show that it reverses when the luminance of the targets is either lower (double decrement) or higher (double increment) than the luminances of both the background and the contextual disks rather than in between them. On the basis of the double-anchoring theory of lightness (P. Bressan, 2006 a), we predict and show that grouping gates the effects of remote luminances {{in such a way that}} they go in opposite directions in the double-decrement and double-increment inverted-dungeon illusions. Our results support the double-anchoring theory and demonstrate that luminances that are far away from the targets are irrelevant in some conditions but critical in others...|$|R

Although the bursts are very short-lived in any individual gas element, pressure effects stimulate neighboring gas elements to burst, which can result in a sustained enhancement in the net star-formation rate. The results are capable of explaining the high far-infrared fluxes observed in righ galaxies and provide clues to the development of starburst activity in other colliding galaxies...|$|R

40|$|Peripherin- 2 is {{a member}} of the tetraspanin family of {{membrane}} proteins that plays a critical role in photoreceptor outer segment disk morphogenesis. Mutations in peripherin- 2 are responsible for various retinal degenerative diseases including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP). To identify determinants required for peripherin- 2 <b>targeting</b> to <b>disk</b> membranes and elucidate mechanisms underlying ADRP, we have generated transgenic Xenopus tadpoles expressing wild-type and ADRP-linked peripherin- 2 mutants as green fluorescent fusion proteins in rod photoreceptors. Wild-type peripherin- 2 and P 216 L and C 150 S mutants, which assemble as tetramers, <b>targeted</b> to <b>disk</b> membranes as visualized by confocal and electron microscopy. In contrast the C 214 S and L 185 P mutants, which form homodimers, but not tetramers, were retained in the rod inner segment. Only the P 216 L disease mutant induced photoreceptor degeneration. These results indicate that tetramerization is required for peripherin- 2 targeting and incorporation into disk membranes. Tetramerization-defective mutants cause ADRP through a deficiency in wild-type peripherin- 2, whereas tetramerization-competent P 216 L peripherin- 2 causes ADRP through a dominant negative effect, possibly arising from the introduction of a new oligosaccharide chain that destabilizes disks. Our results further indicate that a checkpoint between the photoreceptor inner and outer segments allows only correctly assembled peripherin- 2 tetramers to be incorporated into nascent disk membranes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHuman {{observers}} show remarkable {{efficiency in}} statistical estimation; they are able, for instance, {{to estimate the}} mean size of visual objects, even if their number exceeds the capacity limits of focused attention. This ability has been understood {{as the result of}} a distinct mode of attention, i. e. distributed attention. Compared to the focused attention mode, working memory representations under distributed attention are proposed to be more compressed, leading to reduced working memory loads. An alternate proposal is that distributed attention uses less structured, feature-level representations. These would fill up working memory (WM) more, even when target set size is low. Using event-related potentials, we compared WM loading in a typical distributed attention task (mean size estimation) to that in a corresponding focused attention task (object recognition), using a measure called contralateral delay activity (CDA). Participants performed both tasks on 2, 4, or 8 different-sized <b>target</b> <b>disks.</b> In the recognition task, CDA amplitude increased with set size; notably, however, in the mean estimation task the CDA amplitude was high regardless of set size. In particular for set-size 2, the amplitude was higher in the mean estimation task than in the recognition task. The result showed that the task involves full WM loading even with a low target set size. This suggests that in the distributed attention mode, representations are not compressed, but rather less structured than under focused attention conditions...|$|R

The relocation of NTTL operations from the Pinellas Plant to the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in Los Alamos, New Mexico, was addressed in the Non-nuclear Consolidation Environmental Assessment (EA) of June 1993. This EA analyzes a Proposed Action to relocate the NTTL operations at LANL from Building 209 at TA- 21 to Building 450 at TA- 16. The Proposed Action would require the remodeling of Building 450 and some modifications to Buildings 205 and 205 A, collectively {{referred to as the}} Weapons Engineering Tritium Facility (WETF) in TA- 16. The construction of a change room addition would also be required to connect Building 450 and the WETF to take advantage of existing tritium control and confinement systems. Other construction activities and site modifications would include a new electrical substation, a new mechanical and electrical room, minor demolition work, two additional transportable buildings and a new parking area. An alternative to the Proposed Action includes keeping the NTTL operations at TA- 21 (No Action). Alternatives considered but dismissed include {{the construction of a new}} NTTL laboratory at LANL, and the renovation of an alternative facility to Building 450 for conducting NTTL operations. None of the alternatives would enable the DOE to meet its mission responsibilities at LANL in a timely manner. The principle environmental issues associated with the Proposed Action include a minor amount of air emissions associated with construction activities and tritium operations and a small quantity of construction and low-level radioactive wastes. Human health and cumulative effects are expected to be negligible. On-site transportation of tritium between TA- 21 and TA- 16 to support NTTL operations would be eliminated...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the Grid data access patterns in distributed analysis in the CMS experiment at the LHC accelerator. This study ranges from the deep analysis of the historical patterns of access to the most relevant data types in CMS, to the exploitation of a supervised Machine Learning classification system to set-up a machinery able to eventually predict future data access patterns - i. e. the so-called dataset “popularity” of the CMS datasets on the Grid - with focus on specific data types. All the CMS workflows run on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WCG) computing centers (Tiers), and in particular the distributed analysis systems sustains hundreds of users and applications submitted every day. These applications (or “jobs”) access different data types hosted on disk storage systems at a large set of WLCG Tiers. The detailed study of how this data is accessed, in terms of data types, hosting Tiers, and different time periods, allows to gain precious insight on storage occupancy over time and different access patterns, and ultimately to extract suggested actions based on this information (e. g. <b>targetted</b> <b>disk</b> clean-up and/or data replication). In this sense, the application of Machine Learning techniques allows to learn from past data and to gain predictability potential for the future CMS data access patterns.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{how human}} subjects plan {{a sequence of}} rapid movements in a foraging-like task and compared performance to an optimal model based on maximum expected gain. On each trial, three <b>targets</b> (<b>disks)</b> carrying monetary rewards coded by color were presented for 1600 ms in fixed locations on a computer screen. The subject had to choose which targets to attempt to hit and what sequence to attempt them in. The key challenges for the subject were, what sequence to choose and whether to try for all three targets. The key question for us was, do subjects select the sequence that maximizes their expected gain? To compare subjects' performance to optimal, we have to first measure how accurately they can execute each possible sequence of length 2 or 3 on three targets. The experiment consisted of two sessions. In the first session, four naïve subjects were trained until their performance was stable. We then measured each subject's performance for all 12 possible sequences of lengths 2 or 3. We refer to the targets as A,B,C. The dependent variable was the probability of hitting each target (pA, pB, pC) and {{is a function of}} sequence. It might be (. 9,. 9,. 3) for sequence ABC but (. 9,. 1,. 6) for sequence ACB. The sequence ABC offers the higher probability of hitting all three targets but, if C is made valuable enough, the sequence ACB has higher expected gain. In the second session, the values of the targets were altered by amounts that varied from trial to trial. Subjects were told the values of the color-coded targets before each trial and were free to choose any sequence they wished. The values in the second session were chosen so that an ideal mover maximizing expected gain would change sequence for some value combinations. Two out of four subjects varied their movement sequences so as to maximize expected gain. The other two subjects exhibited highly consistent strategies across different reward values but did not maximize expected gain...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{its nuclear}} nonproliferation mission, the U. S. Department of Energy’s Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) is working to develop a {{sustainable}} means for producing the critical medical isotope molybdenum- 99 (99 Mo) without using highly enriched uranium (HEU). 99 Mo is the parent product of technetium­ 99 m (99 mTc), a radioisotope used in approximately 50, 000 medical diagnostic tests per day in the U. S. The primary uses of this product include detection of heart disease, cancer, study of organ structure and function, and other applications. 99 Mo has a short half-life (66 hours) and cannot be stockpiled. U. S. demand is approximately 50 % of the world market. The objective of the domestic 99 Mo project is to accelerate existing commercial projects to meet at least 100 % of the U. S. demand of 99 Mo produced without HEU {{by the end of}} 2016. New methods for generating 99 Mo are being explored in an effort to eliminate proliferation issues and provide a domestic supply of 99 mTc for medical imaging within the United States. For this project, electron accelerating technology is used by sending an electron beam through a series of 100 Mo targets. During this process a large amount of heat is created, which directly affects the operating temperature set for the system. The wall temperature along the target section must be maintained between 550 ℃ and 650 ℃. This temperature range is dictated by the tensile stress limit of the wall material. To maintain the required temperature range, helium gas is used to server as a cooling agent that flows through narrow channels between the <b>target</b> <b>disks.</b> This thesis investigated the cooling performance on a series of new geometry designs of the cooling channel by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS FLUENT 14. 5. An experiment was also conducted to conclude whether the CFD model is valid and able to predict the right physics of the cooling channels. As a result, a new optimal geometry for the cooling channels will be selected for the purpose of the 99 Mo project.
