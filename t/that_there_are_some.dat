5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied. When nest density was greater, the females {{tended to be}} larger, which is more accurately explained by density-dependent mate preference and mating competition, as opposed to predation and resource competition. Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with one high and one low, {{there was no significant}} difference in brood survival between the two; however, the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. This indicates <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> other costs with breeding in an environment with high population density, an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E

25|$|Indians {{have been}} living in Indonesia for centuries, {{from the time of the}} Srivijaya and Majapahit Empire both of which were Hindu and heavily {{influenced}} by the subcontinent. Indians were later brought to Indonesia by the Dutch in the 19th century as indentured labourers to work on plantations located around Medan in Sumatra. While the majority of these came from South India, a significant number also came from the north of India. The Medan Indians included Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. They have now been in Indonesia for over four generations and hold Indonesian passports. While local statistics continue to suggest <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> 40,000 PIOs in Sumatra, the vast majority are now completely assimilated into Indonesian society, though some elements of the Tamil, Punjabi and Odia communities still maintain their cultural traditions.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{on a first}} date, women’s {{goals are}} related more to {{establishing}} friendships and having fun. Mongeau, in his 2004 study found that 60 percent of women go on first dates mainly to have fun and 59 percent go on dates to reduce uncertainty. (Note, however, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> errors in the mathematical calculations done in the study, and the study is statistically invalid as it uses the convenience sampling method.) Women's goals {{tend to be more}} relationship-oriented than men’s goals. Also, unlike men, women are usually more reserved {{when it comes to the}} sexual aspect and having sex. Women are more likely to express companionship, friendship, and romantic relationship goals than men and are also more likely to consider the first date in terms of their relational implications than men.|$|E

She described these tracks as [...] "songs that {{have the power to}} feed people’s relationships and states of mind and states of spirit".

[...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] deals with issues of longing, regrets and loneliness. Shakira said these songs are written [...] "in such a personal and intimate way that at that moment. I'm not really thinking much. I'm just letting it all out".|$|E

500|$|The {{resemblance}} between {{the deaths of}} Saint Sebastian and St Edmund was remarked upon by Abbo: both saints were attacked by archers, although only Edmund {{is supposed to have}} been decapitated. His death bears somes resemblance to the fate suffered by other saints: St Denis was whipped and beheaded and the body of Mary of Egypt was said to have been guarded by a lion. Gransden describes Abbo's Passio as [...] "little more that a hotch-potch of hagiographical commonplaces" [...] and argues that Abbo's ignorance of what actually happened to Edmund would have led him to use aspects of the Lives of well known saints such as Sebastian and Denis as models for his version of Edmund's martydom.
