5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store information such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> each actor's body that were left running all day. For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking {{only three or four}} takes of each scene, but found he could do more at night.|$|E
5|$|The episode ends when Stanley (Leslie David Baker) {{attempts}} to get a cookie from a blood drive nurse at the drive by claiming he gave blood earlier and showing a cotton ball <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> his arm as proof. The nurse recognizes he is lying because they are using band-aids; a frustrated Stanley leaves, and tells Phyllis, {{who is about to}} try the same trick. In the final scene, Creed (Creed Bratton) is seen leaving the blood mobile with a bag of donated blood in his coat pocket.|$|E

5|$|Nearly 300 {{households}} {{were members}} by 2006, {{and in the}} same year, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation awarded the synagogue a grant of $350,000 for exterior restoration of the sanctuary. The grant was part of a million-dollar capital campaign that the membership intended to carry out in 2008, as the synagogue building still required extensive repairs: the roof leaked, causing interior damage, and (along with the gutters) needed to be replaced; interior columns were <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> prevent plaster from falling off them; the sanctuary doors needed to be replaced; and the stained glass windows needed to be removed, the metal holding them repaired, and their wooden framing replaced. In 2007 the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites Program awarded Baith Israel Anshei Emes grants totaling $17,500, for copper roof and masonry restoration.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} {{revision}} of the Mac Mini G4, the internal mezzanine board was upgraded to accommodate the AirPort Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology onto one chip. In prior models, the Mac Mini included an AirPort Extreme card <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> the mezzanine board and a separate Bluetooth module. This new Wi-Fi card also no longer uses an MMCX-Female connector for the antenna (as the prior models did) but rather a proprietary Apple one.|$|E
25|$|The United States Air Force Pararescue and Swedish {{armed forces}} combat medics utilize lollipops with fentanyl. Navy corpsmen {{working with the}} United States Marine Corps in Afghanistan use Fentanyl lollipops on combat {{casualties}} from IED blasts and other mechanisms of injury. The lollipop is <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> the casualty's finger and inserted in between the teeth and cheek (buccal area) of the patient. When enough of the medication has been absorbed the finger will generally fall from the patient's mouth, thereby indicating that the medication has become effectively administered.|$|E

25|$|The {{cover of}} the album {{was created by the}} Zurich artist Ernst Gamper, with whom Yello had been working since 1982. Gamper painted the picture of a face on a sheet of celluloid, which he then <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> the window of his studio {{overlooking}} Lake Zurich and photographed at sunset, with the setting sun shining through the unpainted eye to create a 'glowing eye' effect. The CD inlay booklet featured a photograph of Blank and Meier standing by the same window, with the painting visible on the window between them.|$|E
25|$|The Minox cameras project {{an image}} of 8×11mm onto the negative. The film is in strips 9.2mm wide, or less than one-quarter the size of 35 mm film, and unlike 35mm film, it has no {{sprocket}} holes. This film strip is rolled up in the supply side chamber of a small twin chamber cartridge, with the film leader <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> a take-up spool in the take up chamber. The film strips can be up to 50 frames in length for Riga Minox and Minox II, III, IIIs and B cameras. From Minox BL and C cameras onward the Minox film cartridge holds 15, 30, or 36 exposures.|$|E
25|$|It is {{typically}} constructed from a short piece or tuft of yarn {{placed in the}} free air stream where it is visible to the pilot. In closed cockpit aircraft, it is usually <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> the aircraft canopy. It may also be mounted on the aircraft's nose, either directly on the skin, or elevated on a mast, in which case {{it may also be}} fitted with a small paper cone at the trailing end. They are commonly used on gliders, but may also be found on jet aircraft (especially fighters), ultralight aircraft, light-sport aircraft, autogyros, airplanes and helicopters. Its usefulness on airplanes with a tractor configuration (single propeller at the nose) is limited because the propeller creates turbulence and the spiral slipstream displaces the string to one side.|$|E

500|$|Bruce and Utsler did {{not expect}} many of their fans to attend Woodstock 1999, and were {{surprised}} when thousands of people chanted [...] "I-C-P! I-C-P!" [...] {{as they waited for}} the group to perform. Bruce told his stage crew that he would pay $2,000 to each person who ran around the stage naked, and two people took up his offer. Insane Clown Posse also brought naked women on stage. Bruce and Utsler felt that because the tickets to the event were over-priced, they needed to [...] "give something back." [...] According to Bruce, [...] "We brought along these big beach balls. We announced to the crowd that they each had a hundred dollars <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> them, and then we proceeded to kick about thirty of them into the crowd. Then we rolled out these bigger giant-ass beach balls and announced, 'These ones have five hundred bucks <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> them!' We booted a gang of them into the human sea." [...] Bruce also recounts that their set had multiple technical problems, and the audience was not allowed to get close to the stage, which made the duo feel less connected with them.|$|E
500|$|The {{post-production}} {{tasks were}} as challenging as the production itself. Sound editors {{had to listen}} to the entire uncut tracks from the recorders <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> the actors' bodies in order to find the dialogue. Content proprietary to Disney, such as the lyrics to [...] "It's a Small World" [...] and footage from Soarin', was removed from the film to avoid copyright infringement. Composer Abel Korzeniowski contributed a light, airy score similar to those used in Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E

500|$|As {{the video}} opens, Rihanna is dragged into a press conference, {{where she is}} covered {{with plastic wrap and}} <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> a wall. Microphones and gagged reporters {{surround}} her. In an outdoor scene, she wears a cream-colored latex dress and leads a gagged Perez Hilton around by a dog leash. Rihanna is then shown seated and surrounded by CCTV surveillance cameras; her chair begins to rotate, and she stands and begins to whip reporters, who are <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> the wall of the room. She then rolls on the floor, her hands and feet bound with rope. As the bridge of the song approaches, Rihanna wears a white latex bikini and rabbit ears, while images of headlines are projected against her body and the wall behind her. After the chorus, she appears in a newsroom. Reporters take photographs of her while she sprawls across a desk wearing a pink latex dress. Scenes of Rihanna and others in bondage gear are interspersed with images of the singer wearing a feather boa and a tube top with [...] "censored" [...] printed across it. The video then alternates between previous scenes and images in which Rihanna eats bananas, strawberries and cream, and jewel-covered ice cream. In the final scene, she lies on a newsroom desk, with a smiley face emblem over one eye and a Rolling Stones tongue logo over her mouth.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after forming, {{they gave}} their first public {{performance}} on October 23, 1991, at the Quad of California State University, Northridge. The {{blueprint for the}} group's major-label debut album, demo tape Rage Against the Machine, was laid on a twelve-song self-released cassette, the cover image of which featured newspaper clippings of the stockmarket section with a single match <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> the inlay card. Not all 12 songs made it onto the final album—two were eventually included as B-sides, while three others never saw an official release. Several record labels expressed interest, and the band eventually signed with Epic Records. Morello said, [...] "Epic agreed to everything we asked—and they've followed through... We never saw a [...] conflict {{as long as we}} maintained creative control." ...|$|E

500|$|Due to her addiction, Marge spends {{every waking}} {{moment at the}} casino and neglects her family. For instance, she forgets to help Lisa make a costume for her {{geography}} pageant. Enraged, Homer bursts into the casino and barges around searching for Marge. The security cameras capture Homer's rampage, and when Mr. Burns sees him he demotes {{him back to his}} old job at the power plant. After realizing how much he misses the plant, Mr. Burns decides to return. Homer confronts Marge with her behavior, and she finally realizes that she has a problem. Lisa does win a special prize in the geography pageant, as Homer's poor costume design gives Lisa the appearance that she did the work all by herself. Ralph receives the same prize, as his costume is simply a note <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> his shirt that reads [...] "Idaho".|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} {{sequence}} of the episode, the Peanuts gang scurry by as trick-or-treaters, à la It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. Marge's hair in the opening segment recalls Elsa Lanchester's character in Bride of Frankenstein. The plot of Lisa's nightmare is a reference to W. W. Jacobs's short story The Monkey's Paw, and The New Twilight Zone episode [...] "A Small Talent for War". Near {{the beginning of the}} segment, Moroccan soldiers stop and search the Simpsons, finding souvenirs <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> Homer's body which he was attempting to smuggle out of the country. This is a reference to the opening drug-smuggling scene of the film Midnight Express. A billboard advertisement with Bart saying [...] "Get a Mammogram, Man!" [...] can be seen.

A newspaper clipping with a story and photo of Andy is <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> {{the wall of his}} shoeshine stand. This is a reference to the Pawnee Journal article written about him in the previous episode, [...] "The Possum". A stand selling Sweetums nutrition bars is visible during one of the park scenes.
