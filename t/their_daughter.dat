40|$|Abstract Background Mothers have {{a primary}} {{role in the}} {{prevention}} of cervical cancer in Korea. This study aimed to determine the awareness and health beliefs of mothers about preventing cervical cancer in <b>their</b> <b>daughters,</b> <b>their</b> intention to recommend the Pap test to <b>their</b> <b>daughters,</b> and the factors influencing this intention. Methods A cross-sectional survey design was employed, and the study enrolled mothers (n[*]=[*] 1, 581) of pubescent girls aged 13 to 18  years who were living nationwide in Korea. The six health-beliefs variables related to preventing cervical cancer in <b>their</b> <b>daughters,</b> awareness of the importance of cervical cancer prevention methods, and the intention to recommend the Pap test to daughters were investigated. The impacts of these health beliefs of the mothers and the sociodemographic factors influencing their intention to recommend the Pap test to <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results Almost one-quarter (23. 7  %) of the mothers had talked about the Pap test, 69. 2  % were intending to recommend the Pap test to <b>their</b> <b>daughters,</b> and 38. 5  % considered that the Pap test could be necessary if <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> became sexually active. The significant health beliefs influencing the intention to recommend the Pap test were the perceived barriers [odds ratio (OR) [*]=[*] 1. 47, 95  % confidence interval (95  % CI) [*]=[*] 1. 03 – 2. 11] and benefits (OR[*]=[*] 2. 25, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 55 – 3. 25). The significant sociodemographic factors of mothers were their education (OR[*]=[*] 1. 52, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 08 – 2. 13), their experience of talking about the Pap test with <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> (OR[*]=[*] 2. 11, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 23 – 3. 64), their regularity of undergoing the Pap test themselves (OR[*]=[*] 1. 98, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 30 – 3. 03), and their age when they first underwent the Pap test (OR[*]=[*] 1. 60, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 43 – 0. 82). Conclusions The mothers perceived HPV vaccination as the most important of the five methods for preventing cervical cancer in <b>their</b> <b>daughters.</b> Mothers perceived the importance of <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> undergoing the Pap test regardless of the presence of HPV vaccination, and most of the mothers had an intention of recommending the Pap test to <b>their</b> <b>daughters.</b> Strategies for increasing the intention of mothers to recommend the Pap test to <b>their</b> adolescent <b>daughters</b> could be promoted by increasing their perceptions of the benefits while reducing their perceptions of barriers toward <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> undergoing the Pap test, and by empowering active communication about the Pap test between mothers and daughters...|$|R
