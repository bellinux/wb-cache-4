2500|$|With unlabelled protein {{the usual}} {{procedure}} is {{to record a}} set of two dimensional homonuclear nuclear magnetic resonance experiments through correlation spectroscopy (COSY), of which several types include conventional correlation spectroscopy, <b>total</b> <b>correlation</b> spectroscopy (TOCSY) and [...] nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY). A two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiment produces a two-dimensional spectrum. The units of both axes are chemical shifts. The COSY and TOCSY transfer magnetization through the chemical bonds between adjacent protons. The conventional correlation spectroscopy experiment is only able to transfer magnetization between protons on adjacent atoms, whereas in the <b>total</b> <b>correlation</b> spectroscopy experiment the protons are able to relay the magnetization, so it is transferred among all the protons that are connected by adjacent atoms. Thus in a conventional correlation spectroscopy, an alpha proton transfers magnetization to the beta protons, the beta protons transfers to the alpha and gamma protons, if any are present, then the gamma proton transfers to the beta and the delta protons, and the process continues. In <b>total</b> <b>correlation</b> spectroscopy, the alpha {{and all the other}} protons are able to transfer magnetization to the beta, gamma, delta, epsilon if they are connected by a continuous chain of protons. [...] The continuous chain of protons are the sidechain of the individual amino acids. Thus these two experiments are used to build so called spin systems, that is build a list of resonances of the chemical shift of the peptide proton, the alpha protons and all the protons from each residue’s sidechain. Which chemical shifts corresponds to which nuclei in the spin system is determined by the conventional correlation spectroscopy connectivities and the fact that different types of protons have characteristic chemical shifts. To connect the different spinsystems in a sequential order, the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiment has to be used. Because this experiment transfers magnetization through space, it will show crosspeaks for all protons that are close in space regardless of whether they are in the same spin system or not. The neighbouring residues are inherently close in space, so the assignments can be made by the peaks in the NOESY with other spin systems.|$|E

2500|$|Correlation {{spectroscopy}} is one {{of several}} types of two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or 2D-NMR. This type of NMR experiment is best known by its acronym, COSY. Other types of two-dimensional NMR include J-spectroscopy, exchange spectroscopy (EXSY), Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), <b>total</b> <b>correlation</b> spectroscopy (TOCSY) and heteronuclear correlation experiments, such as HSQC, HMQC, and HMBC. In correlation spectroscopy, emission is centered on the peak of an individual nucleus; if its magnetic field is correlated with another nucleus by through-bond (COSY, HSQC, etc.) or through-space (NOE) coupling, a response can also be detected on the frequency of the correlated nucleus. Two-dimensional NMR spectra provide more information about a molecule than one-dimensional NMR spectra and are especially useful in determining the structure of a molecule, particularly for molecules that are too complicated to work with using one-dimensional NMR. [...] The first two-dimensional experiment, COSY, was proposed by Jean Jeener, a professor at Université Libre de Bruxelles, in 1971. [...] This experiment was later implemented by Walter P. Aue, Enrico Bartholdi and Richard R. Ernst, who published their work in 1976.|$|E

40|$|The {{intriguing}} {{phenomenon of}} many-body localization (MBL) has attracted significant interest recently, but a complete characterization is still lacking.

We demonstrate that the <b>total</b> <b>correlations</b> of the diagonal ensemble provides a meaningful diagnostic tool to pin-down, probe, and better understand the MBL transition and ergodicity breaking in quantum systems. In particular, we show that the <b>total</b> <b>correlations</b> has sublinear dependence on the system size in delocalized, ergodic phases, whereas we find that it scales extensively in the localized phase developing a pronounced peak at the transition. We exemplify the power of our approach by means of an exact diagonalization study of a Heisenberg spin chain in a disordered field. By a finite size scaling analysis of the peak position and crossover point from log to linear scaling we collect evidence that ergodicity is broken before the MBL transition in this model...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagonal}} ensemble is {{the infinite}} time average of a quantum state following unitary dynamics. In analogy {{to the time}} average of a classical phase space dynamics, it is intimately related to the ergodic properties of the quantum system giving information on the spreading of the initial state in the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. In this work we apply a concept from quantum information, known as <b>total</b> <b>correlations,</b> to the diagonal ensemble. Forming an upper-bound on the multipartite entanglement, it quantifies the combination of both classical and quantum correlations in a mixed state. We generalize the <b>total</b> <b>correlations</b> of the diagonal ensemble to more general α-Renyi entropies {{and focus on the}} the cases α= 1 and α= 2 with further numerical extensions in mind. Here we show that the <b>total</b> <b>correlations</b> of the diagonal ensemble is a generic indicator of ergodicity breaking, displaying a sub-extensive behaviour when the system is ergodic. We demonstrate this by investigating its scaling in a range of spin chain models focusing not only on the cases of integrability breaking but also emphasize its role in understanding the transition from an ergodic to a many body localized phase in systems with disorder or quasi-periodicity.

In contrast, we show that the <b>total</b> <b>correlations</b> capture the dynamics more succinctly, and further reveal a fundamental difference in the dynamics governed by the ergodic versus many-body localized phases, with the latter exhibiting dynamical oscillations. Finally, we consider an initial state composed of several singlet pairs and show that by fixing the correlation properties, while the dynamics do not reveal noticeable differences between the phases, the long-time values of the correlation measures appear to indicate the critical region.
