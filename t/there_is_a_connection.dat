5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E
5|$|There {{is about}} 125-150mL of CSF {{at any one}} time. This CSF circulates within the {{ventricular}} system of the brain. The ventricles {{are a series of}} cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, the CSF passes through the interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings – the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures. CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.|$|E

25|$|Some fifty {{pieces of}} printed matter {{have been found}} in Egypt printed between 900 and 1300 in black ink on paper by the rubbing method in the Chinese style. Although there is no {{transmission}} evidence, experts believe <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It was {{definitely}} believed, however, at least after the Sons of Malta's decline, that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> {{between the two}} organizations: ...|$|R
50|$|From 1852 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> at Bamberg {{with the}} new Ludwig's Western Railway towards Würzburg, Aschaffenburg and, by 1854, the Hessean {{frontier}} at Kahl.|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to the Bentley Canal, {{which in}} turn {{connected}} to the Anson Branch and thence the Walsall Canal, but the former closed in 1961.|$|R
25|$|Crossan’s theory {{provides}} {{further evidence}} that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between these two sources and if we find some of Q in Thomas {{that it is possible}} that these common sayings came from an earlier source. This evidence provides further evidence of the existence of the Common Sayings Source.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} data {{indicate}} that the basaltic lava flows of the Central Atlantic magmatic province in Morocco were erupted at c. 200nbsp&Ma and spanned the Tr-J boundary. Thus, it is very possible that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between this magmatic event and the Tr-J boundary climatic and biotic crisis {{that led to the}} mass-extinction.|$|E
25|$|At 73rd Street and Broadway, on {{the north}} side of Roosevelt Avenue, a set of stairs from each of the IRT Flushing Line {{platforms}} lead down to a landing below the elevated structure. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to the Queens Boulevard Line mezzanine via three long, narrow escalators, where there are exits from the below-ground fare control points.|$|E
50|$|Fudenberg <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{proponent of}} the discredited theory that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the MMR vaccine and autism. In 1995 Fudenberg's medical license was {{suspended}} for improperly obtaining controlled substances.|$|R
50|$|From 1905 to 1950 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to the Horton Light Railway {{which had}} been built to {{transport}} building materials to the cluster of hospitals in the Horton Lane area.|$|R
5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> {{nothing in}} the saga sources to {{indicate}} either that Ketill was active in Ireland or that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the Gallgáedil and the Scottish islands in the Irish sources.|$|R
25|$|Armstrong {{also argues}} that {{contradictory}} beliefs show that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between beliefs and knowledge. He gives {{the example of a}} woman who has learned her husband is dead but cannot bring herself to believe her husband is dead. She both believes and disbelieves her husband is dead: it just happens that one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.|$|E
25|$|According to Hindu tradition, the Rigvedic hymns were {{collected}} by Paila {{under the guidance of}} , who formed the Rigveda Samhita as we know it. According to the , the number of syllables in the Rigveda is 432,000, equalling the number of muhurtas (1 day = 30 muhurtas) in forty years. This statement stresses the underlying philosophy of the Vedic books that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> (bandhu) between the astronomical, the physiological, and the spiritual.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between Dejection and Frost at Midnight in {{everything}} but its form. This is primarily true {{of the original}} version, {{but many of the}} personal elements of the poem continue over into the published version. The trimming of the poem allows for Coleridge to emphasize the most important poetic aspects of the original and to create a separation of the form from the subject area which allows for a strong incongruity not in the original.|$|E
50|$|The Rothaarbahn railway {{reaches the}} town from the south, ending there. Until 31 May 1981 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> from Bad Berleburg to Allendorf and Frankenberg by the Upper Edertalbahn and the Ruhr-Eder-Bahn.|$|R
50|$|Often in {{the plots}} of Jeff Hawke <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between {{extraterrestrial}} entities, archaeological mysteries and even supernatural creatures. The god Pan and the devil, among others, appeared in Jeff Hawke strips.|$|R
50|$|Probably in the Roman period, but {{no later}} than at the time Louis IV, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the Via Claudia in the Lech Valley to the Brenner road in the Loisach Valley.|$|R
25|$|Grothendieck's work {{includes}} {{the invention of}} the étale and l-adic cohomology theories, which explain an observation of André Weil's that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties. For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a finite field reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the complex numbers. Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck.|$|E
25|$|The Briskeby Line {{consists}} of a concurrent section with the Skøyen Line from Jernbanetorget to it leaves Henrik Ibsens gate at Inkognitogata. This segment {{is known as the}} Southern String. West-bound trams run along Fred. Olsens gate and Prinsens gate before reaching Stortingsgata. East-bound trams run from Stortingsgata along Nedre Vollgate, Tollbugata and Strandgata to Jernbanetorget. Along these sections there are three stations: Dronningens gate (east-bound only), Kongens gate (west-bound only) and Wessels plass (east-bound only). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to Stortorvet through Kirkegata (west-bound) and Kongens gate (east-bound). The Vika Line deviates from the Briskeby Line through Akersgata.|$|E
25|$|The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the Leo Castelli Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the Park Place Gallery were {{important}} showcases for Color Field painting, shaped canvas painting and Lyrical Abstraction in New York City during the 1960s. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> with post-painterly abstraction, which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis {{on making the}} act of painting itself dramatically visible – {{as well as the}} solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and Minimal art were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to the Grant Street Station from Laughlin Junction near Greenfield, {{until the}} 1990s, when {{the station was}} removed and the {{connecting}} rail right-of-way was turned into the Eliza Furnace Trail.|$|R
50|$|Once <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{sufficient}} <b>connection</b> {{between the}} Act {{and the head}} of power, proportionality is irrelevant for non-purposive powers. Whether or not <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sufficient <b>connection</b> does not rely on the desirability of the legislation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} built by the Aberystwith [...] and Welsh Coast Railway and opened on 3 July 1865 as Barmouth Junction. From 1899 to 1903 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> with the Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway.|$|R
25|$|His basic {{assumptions}} {{were very}} similar to those of Le Sage and Preston, but he gave a more detailed application of the kinetic theory. However, by asserting that the velocity of the corpuscles after collision was reduced without any corresponding increase in the energy of any other object, his model violated the conservation of energy. He noted that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the weight of a body and its density (because any decrease in the density of an object reduces the internal shielding) so he went on to assert that warm bodies should be heavier than colder ones (related to the effect of thermal expansion).|$|E
25|$|The Cryogenian {{period was}} {{followed}} by the Ediacaran period, which was characterized by a rapid development of new multicellular lifeforms. Whether <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the end of the severe ice ages and the increase in diversity of life is not clear, but it does not seem coincidental. The new forms of life, called Ediacara biota, were larger and more diverse than ever. Though the taxonomy of most Ediacaran life forms is unclear, some were ancestors of groups of modern life. Important developments were the origin of muscular and neural cells. None of the Ediacaran fossils had hard body parts like skeletons. These first appear after the boundary between the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic eons or Ediacaran and Cambrian periods.|$|E
25|$|While in the {{downtown}} scene in New York's East Village 10th Street galleries artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. Claes Oldenburg had his storefront, and the Green Gallery on 57th Street began to show Tom Wesselmann and James Rosenquist. Later Leo Castelli exhibited other American artists including {{the bulk of the}} careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction and seen in ordinary comic books and in paintings like Drowning Girl, 1963, in the gallery above. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the radical works of Duchamp, and Man Ray, the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like Alex Katz (who became known for his parody's of portrait photography and suburban life), Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.|$|E
50|$|Between Hurst Green and Lingfield (in Surrey) <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> {{with the}} Redhill to Tonbridge line until 1965.

5000|$|For {{almost half}} a century, from 1891 to 1939, the {{municipality}} enjoyed {{the service of the}} Lokalbahn, a single-track narrow-gauge [...] railway. This ran from Frankenthal railway station, where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> with the Reichsbahn, westwards to Großkarlbach.|$|R
50|$|The first {{motor bus}} service was from Chester-le-Street to Low Fell, via Birtley where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to the Gateshead trams; the service, however, was quickly {{extended}} to Gateshead {{and within a}} few years crossed the River Tyne to finish in Newcastle.|$|R
