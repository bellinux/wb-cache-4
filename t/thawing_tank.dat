25|$|The factory used {{a system}} of metal cans filled with water that were lowered into a tank filled with a calcium {{chloride}} brine solution. The brine solution was cooled by coils within the tanks, which were filled with a liquid ammonia refrigerant. After ice formed in the cans, they were placed in a <b>thawing</b> <b>tank,</b> after which the ice would separate from the cans and float to the top. The ice was then crushed and delivered to trawlers at Grimsby's seaport.|$|E
50|$|On June 10 {{they turned}} on the air heaters. The cosmonauts relied on the Soyuz T-13 air {{regeneration}} system until they could get the Salyut 7 system back in order. On June 13 the attitude control system was successfully reactivated. This was cause for jubilation, as it meant Kosmos 1669 (a Progress supply spacecraft) bearing replacement parts could dock with Salyut 7. The station’s water <b>tanks</b> <b>thawed</b> {{by the end of}} June - freezing had destroyed the water heater, so the cosmonauts used a powerful television light to heat fluids. Wall heaters were turned on only after all the frost had evaporated, in order to prevent water from entering equipment. Normal atmospheric humidity was achieved only at the end of July, nearly two months after docking.|$|R
40|$|Cryopreservation {{of sperm}} cells is an {{essential}} process applied for long-term conservation of aquatic genetic resources. The goal {{of this research was}} to determine effect different of straws volumes and thawing rates on the post-thaw quality and fertilization ability of cryopreserved common carp (Cyprinus carpio) sperm. In this study, semen was cryopreserved according to conventional slow freezing protocol. For this aim, the cryosolution contained 75 mM NaCl, 70 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2, 1 mM MgSO 4 and 20 mM Tris (pH: 8) supplemented with 10 % MeOH. Following equilibration at + 4 °C for 10 min, semen was packed into 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 5 mL straws and frozen in liquid nitrogen vapour (for 10 min at - 120 ºC) and finally stored in liquid nitrogen (- 196 ºC) <b>tank.</b> <b>Thawing</b> of cryopreserved semen process was performed at 30 ºC for 10, 20 and 30 seconds in a water bath. Fertilization was performed using ratio of 1 x 105 spermatozoa/egg. The highest fertility (68. 4 ± 2. 5 %) was determined with cryopreserved sperm packed in 1. 5 mL straws that thawed at 30 ºC for 30 s. According to the results of this research, sperm cryopreserved with ionic extender containing 10 % methanol and packed in 1. 5 mL straws are suitable to achieve high fertilization of common carp eggs...|$|R
