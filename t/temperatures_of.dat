5|$|Massive main {{sequence}} stars can have surface <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> 50,000K. Smaller {{stars such as}} the Sun have surface <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> a few thousand K.

5|$|Capable {{of growing}} at a {{multitude}} of angles {{on a variety of}} surfaces, Physcia caesia also tolerates a wide range of environmental extremes from the high <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> desert locations to the low <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> the Antarctic. It grows on both dry stone and that moistened by seepage, and can survive being irregularly submerged for extended periods underwater. Like many lichens that grow on rock, Physcia caesia is able to extract nutrients from the substrate upon which it grows, as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust. It is threatened by habitat loss through development, as well as trampling or overgrowth of its location. A number of lichenicolous species are known parasites.|$|E
5|$|Deuterium {{was also}} {{detected}} {{in many other}} hydrogen compounds in the comet. The ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to compound, which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in interstellar clouds, {{rather than in the}} solar nebula. Theoretical modelling of ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that comet Hale–Bopp formed at <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> around 25–45kelvins.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> a {{conventional}} reactor design {{is the average}} <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the fuel, {{the vast majority of}} which is not reacting at any given instant.

50|$|Thermally {{developed}} flow {{results in}} reduced heat transfer compared to developing flow because {{the difference between}} the surface <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the pipe and the mean <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the flow is greater than the temperature difference between surface <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the pipe and the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the fluid near the pipe boundary.|$|R
5|$|Iridium {{has been}} used in the {{radioisotope}} thermoelectric generators of unmanned spacecraft such as the Voyager, Viking, Pioneer, Cassini, Galileo, and New Horizons. Iridium was chosen to encapsulate the plutonium-238 fuel in the generator because it can withstand the operating <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> up to 2000°C and for its great strength.|$|E
5|$|Once the monsoons subside, average {{temperatures}} gradually fall across India.

5|$|The active atmospheres and {{closeness}} of these stars {{means that they}} are among the brightest x-ray sources in the sky.

5|$|There are no dates {{available}} for post-caldera lava domes, which probably arose from magma ascending through the caldera forming conduits, seeing as these domes are found only inside the caldera.

At high pressure (~20GPa) diamond can be heated up to 2500°C, and a report published in 2009 suggests that diamond can withstand <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> 3000°C and above.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{responsible}} for the degradation of fish and shrimp in the creek. The sources for chlorine in urban runoff include irrigation and car washing. The only remaining fish species in the creek is carp, which can withstand high amounts of chlorine. Carp up to 18inches (1.5feet / 45cm) long have been found in Aliso Creek near the mouth. <b>Temperatures</b> <b>of</b> the creek near the mouth have been known to exceed , although the temperature at the outflow is often much colder because it has been mixed with seawater.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{abundant}} {{throughout the world}} and live {{in a wide range}} of environments, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Cockroaches can withstand extremely cold temperatures, allowing them to live in the Arctic. Some species are capable of surviving <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> −188°F (−122°C) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol. In North America, 50 species separated into five families are found throughout the continent. 450 species are found in Australia. Only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests.|$|E
5|$|Further {{purification}} is {{effected by}} a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, hafnium reacts with iodine at <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> 500°C, forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of 1700°C the reverse reaction happens, and the iodine and hafnium are set free. The hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament, and the iodine can react with additional hafnium, {{resulting in a}} steady turn over.|$|E
5|$|HD 93083 is {{an orange}} dwarf star of {{spectral}} type K3V that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. It has a planet that {{was discovered by}} the radial velocity method with the HARPS spectrograph in 2005. About as massive as Saturn, the planet orbits its star with a period of 143 days at a mean distance of 0.477 AU. WASP-66 is a sunlike star of spectral type F4V. A planet with 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter orbits it every 4 days, discovered by the transit method in 2012. DEN 1048-3956 is a brown dwarf of spectral type M8 located around 13 light-years distant from Earth. At magnitude 17 it is much too faint {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye. It has a surface temperature of about 2500 K. Two powerful flares lasting 4–5 minutes each were detected in 2002. 2MASS 0939-2448 is a system of two cool and faint brown dwarfs, probably with effective <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> about 500 and 700 K and masses of about 25 and 40 times that of Jupiter, though {{it is also possible that}} both objects have <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> 600 K and 30 Jupiter masses.|$|E

5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Low {{atomic number}} also makes {{beryllium}} relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, {{it is used}} to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the Tevatron and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.|$|E
