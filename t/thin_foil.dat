5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of einsteinium {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target {{is attached to a}} <b>thin</b> <b>foil,</b> and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|E
5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a <b>thin</b> <b>foil</b> of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
25|$|At Rutherford's behest, Geiger and Marsden {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments where they pointed a beam of alpha particles at a <b>thin</b> <b>foil</b> of metal and measured the scattering pattern by using a fluorescent screen. They spotted alpha particles bouncing off the metal foil in all directions, some right back at the source. This should have been impossible according to Thomson's model; the alpha particles should have all gone straight through. Obviously, those particles had encountered an electrostatic force far greater than Thomson's model suggested they would, which in turn implied that the atom's positive charge was concentrated in a much tinier volume than Thomson imagined.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tensile {{properties}} of rolled and annealed copper <b>thin</b> <b>foils</b> were investigated {{based on the}} grain size and thickness. Yield strength was higher in the <b>thinner</b> <b>foil</b> than in the thicker foil at as-rolled state. Difference of yield strength between the <b>thinner</b> <b>foil</b> and the thicker foil becomes small at annealed state. Tensile strength was higher in the <b>thinner</b> <b>foil</b> than in the thicker foil at as-rolled state, but it was reversed at annealed state. Strain to fracture or elongation increased with increasing thickness in the annealed state. A knife edge type of fracture was characterized in both the as-rolled state and the annealed state. A higher tensile strength and strain to fracture of the annealed thicker foil was attributed to the higher number of grains per thickness. From this work, {{it was concluded that}} mechanical {{properties of}} <b>thin</b> <b>foils</b> were dependent upon the number of grains per thickness...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLaser spot joining of <b>thin</b> {{metallic}} <b>foils</b> in {{the order}} of 100 micrometer and below has a number of interesting applications in electronic industry. However, high thermal conductivity and thermal expansion of common materials largely prohibit spot joints with a sufficiently large contact area needed to satisfy mechanical and electrical requirements. Of the numerous possibilities to positively influence the process of such joints we investigateusing a pulsed Nd:YAG laser to generate spot joints of <b>thin</b> <b>foils</b> in combination with a beam shaping optic to tailor the temperature profile during laser spot joining of <b>thin</b> <b>foils.</b> This allows for increased contact area, stabilized process behavior and offers the potential for joining ultra <b>thin</b> <b>foils</b> far below 100  μm.

25|$|Materials {{that have}} {{dimensions}} {{small enough to}} be electron transparent, such as powdered substances, small organisms, viruses, or nanotubes, can be quickly prepared by the deposition of a dilute sample containing the specimen onto films on support grids. Biological specimens may be embedded in resin to withstand the high vacuum in the sample chamber and to enable cutting tissue into electron transparent thin sections. The biological sample can be stained using either a negative staining material such as uranyl acetate for bacteria and viruses, or, {{in the case of}} embedded sections, the specimen may be stained with heavy metals, including osmium tetroxide. Alternately samples may be held at liquid nitrogen temperatures after embedding in vitreous ice. In material science and metallurgy the specimens can usually withstand the high vacuum, but still must be prepared as a <b>thin</b> <b>foil,</b> or etched so some portion of the specimen is thin enough for the beam to penetrate. Constraints on the thickness of the material may be limited by the scattering cross-section of the atoms from which the material is comprised.|$|E
500|$|Once the nobelium-255 is produced, {{it can be}} {{separated}} out {{in a similar way}} as used to purify the neighboring actinide mendelevium. The recoil momentum of the produced nobelium-255 atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a <b>thin</b> <b>foil</b> of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum: this is usually combined by trapping the nobelium atoms in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and carrying them along with a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the nobelium atoms can be transported over tens of meters. The thin layer of nobelium collected on the foil can then be removed with dilute acid without completely dissolving the foil. The nobelium can then be isolated by exploiting its tendency to form the divalent state, unlike the other trivalent actinides: under typically used elution conditions (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) as stationary organic phase and 0.05Mhydrochloric acid as mobile aqueous phase, or using 3Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant from cation-exchange resin columns), nobelium will pass through the column and elute while the other trivalent actinides remain on the column. However, if a direct [...] "catcher" [...] gold foil is used, the process is complicated by the need to separate out the gold using anion-exchange chromatography before isolating the nobelium by elution from chromatographic extraction columns using HDEHP.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, two New York Times reporters {{published}} Blind Man's Bluff, a book {{providing a}} rare {{look into the}} world of nuclear submarines and espionage during the Cold War. One lengthy chapter deals extensively with Scorpion and her loss. The book reports that concerns about the Mk 37 conventional torpedo carried aboard Scorpion were raised in 1967 and 1968, before Scorpion left Norfolk for her last mission. The concerns focused on the battery that powered the torpedoes. The battery had a thin metal-foil barrier separating two types of volatile chemicals. When mixed slowly and in a controlled fashion, the chemicals generated heat and electricity, powering the motor that pushed the torpedo through the water. But vibrations normally experienced on a nuclear submarine were found to cause the <b>thin</b> <b>foil</b> barrier to break down, allowing the chemicals to interact intensely. This interaction generated excessive heat which, in tests, could readily have caused an inadvertent torpedo explosion. The authors of Blind Man's Bluff were careful to say they could not point to this as the cause of Scorpions loss– only that it was a possible cause and that it was consistent with other data indicating an explosion preceded the sinking of Scorpion. Notably, the authors cite examples of hot running torpedo incidents that had occurred on other U.S. submarines prior to the loss of Scorpion. (Although none of those incidents caused the loss of a submarine.) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the micro}} bending process, <b>thinner</b> <b>foils</b> may {{indicate}} larger springback {{due to the}} size effect of strain gradient. Heat-assisted micro bending is an effective process to reduce the springback and improve {{the accuracy of the}} products. In order to investigate the mechanism of springback behavior of pure titanium foils under elevated temperature, experimental and numerical analysis were carried out for different thickness foils (0. 02, 0. 05, and 0. 1 mm) with the same hardness. The results show that the springback angle decreases with increasing temperature. In the experiments, it is observed that the springback angle increases with decreasing foil thickness at room temperature, while the springback angle decreases with decreasing foil thickness at temperatures of 300 oC or higher. This tendency cannot be found in the results from numerical analysis, which is explained by the surface layer model and strain gradient theory. It is suggested that the influence of surface grains on the properties of the material is the dominating factor for the less springback of <b>thinner</b> <b>foils</b> at elevated temperatures.
