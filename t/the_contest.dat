After 1998 Grissemann stepped down from the commentary and was replaced by Andi Knoll.

5|$|After a {{successful}} first contest, the second faced several location problems. The event originally {{should have been}} organised by British broadcaster ITV in Manchester. ITV then announced that due to financial and scheduling reasons, <b>the</b> <b>contest</b> would not {{take place in the}} United Kingdom after all. It is also thought that another factor to their decision was the previous years' audience ratings for ITV which were below the expected amount. The EBU approached Croatian broadcaster HRT, who had won the previous contest, to stage the event in Zagreb; though it later emerged that HRT had 'forgotten' to book the venue in which <b>the</b> <b>contest</b> would have taken place. It was at this point, with five months remaining until the event would be held, that Norwegian broadcaster NRK stepped in to host <b>the</b> <b>contest</b> in Lillehammer.|$|E

While Hebner was tied upside down, Hakushi interfered and performed a diving headbutt to Hart. Lawler won the match when he rolled-up Hart for the pinfall.|$|E

5|$|Maria {{competed in}} the Diva Search in 2004, {{deciding}} to enter <b>the</b> <b>contest</b> after seeing an advertisement while watching Raw.
