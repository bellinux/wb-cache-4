5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface}} of the cell. This specificity restricts <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E

5|$|The American robin is a known {{reservoir}} (carrier) for West Nile virus. While crows and jays {{are often}} the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus, the American robin is suspected {{to be a key}} host, and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the American robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> humans and other species.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} view {{holds that}} unsafe medical practices in Africa during years following World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic, and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector that allowed <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> adapt to humans and spread.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antiviral}} drugs target {{different stages}} of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> become infectious. There is a class of drugs called protease inhibitors, which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E

50|$|When aphids {{feed on the}} phloem of <b>the</b> leaf, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is {{transmitted}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> phloem cells. Once inside <b>the</b> plant, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> begins <b>to</b> replicate and assemble new virions. This process requires significant metabolic input from the plant, and causes the symptoms of barley yellow dwarf disease.|$|R
50|$|File infectors <b>viruses</b> {{are made}} <b>to</b> infect files {{of on the}} computer. File infectors spread once the user runs the {{infected}} file. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> copies itself <b>to</b> locations on the computer {{where it can be}} executed; usually in RAM. The file infector will continue to infect files while granting <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infect files.|$|R
5|$|The disease runs most {{rampant in}} the {{subtropical}} conditions which encourage reproduction of its mosquito vectors among which Culex tarsalis is most significant. Mortality rates {{appear to be}} higher than those in other birds, causing local population losses of up to 72% in a single season. Because of this, American crows are a sentinel species indicating the presence of West Nile virus in an area. Crows cannot transmit <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> humans directly.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> enter.|$|E

Encouraged by Navarro, Roman opens the sarcophagus, exposing himself to an {{airborne}} virus. As he begins to turn, Navarro guns him down and orders his men to secure the statue {{so that he can}} sell <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> the highest bidder on the black market. Nate jumps onto the net carrying the treasure which is connected to the transport chopper while a captive Elena gets the pilot killed, causing it to crash on Navarro's cargo ship. Nate kills the remaining mercenaries and attempts to rescue Elena, only to be attacked by Navarro. After a fistfight, he pulls her out of the chopper and pushes it overboard, taking Navarro, whose leg is tangled in the rope connected to the net, and the statue with it {{to the bottom of the}} sea.|$|E

5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
5|$|Stone brought Terry Hayes {{to write}} the {{screenplay}} entitled Return of the Apes. Set in the near future, a plague is making humans extinct. Geneticist Will Robinson discovers the plague is a genetic time bomb embedded in the Stone Age. He time travels with a pregnant colleague named Billie Rae Diamond {{to a time when}} Palaeolithic humans were at war {{for the future of the}} planet with highly evolved apes. The apes' supreme commander is a gorilla named Drak. Robinson and Billie Rae discover a young human girl named Aiv (pronounced Eve) to be the next step in evolution. It is revealed that it was the apes that created <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> destroy the human race. They protect her from the virus, thus ensuring the survival of the human race 102,000 years later. Billie Rae gives birth to a baby boy named Adam.|$|E

5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The viral envelope contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the viral envelope. The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E
5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} is {{irrelevant}} {{to the shape of}} the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. However, all segments are not required {{to be in the same}} virion for <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are green, (red in Rush mode in the iOS mobile version) spiky {{circles that}} split cells larger than them into many pieces (16 or fewer, {{depending}} on the mass) and smaller cells can hide underneath a virus for protection against larger cells. Cells in 16 pieces can eat viruses without splitting, though it is usually dangerous moving in many pieces, as the cells are smaller and easier to eat.. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but players can make new viruses by feeding a virus, i.e. ejecting {{a small fraction of}} a player's cell's mass into the virus a few times, causing <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> split and hence create another virus.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{proposed}} high-risk transmission channels, allowing <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> {{adapt to}} humans and {{spread throughout the}} society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic {{with the emergence of}} colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} {{advantage of}} the therapeutic approach of blocking viral entry (as opposed to the currently dominant approach of viral enzyme inhibition) {{is that it may}} prove more difficult for <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> develop resistance to this therapy than for <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> mutate or evolve its enzymatic protocols.|$|E
