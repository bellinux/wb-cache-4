50|$|In the Fajans method, {{named after}} Kazimierz Fajans, {{typically}} dichlorofluorescein {{is used as}} an indicator; the end-point is marked by the green suspension turning pink. Prior to the end-point of the titration, chloride ions remain in excess. They adsorb on the AgCl surface, imparting a negative charge to the particles. Past the equivalence point, excess silver(I) ions adsorb on the AgCl surface, imparting a positive charge. Anionic dyes such as dichlorofluorescein are attracted to the particles, and undergo a color change upon adsorption, representing the end-point. Eosin (<b>tetrabromofluorescein)</b> is suitable for titrating against bromide, iodide, and thiocyanate anions, giving a sharper end-point than dichlorofluorescein. It is not suitable for titrating against chloride anions because it binds to AgCl more strongly than chloride does.|$|E
40|$|The seminal root of rice seed {{grows in}} {{oxygen-rich}} part of bed. It is believed ordinarily {{to display the}} downward growth by geotropism, but the geotropism is able to be reversed by anti-auxin absorbed. Anti-geotropism induced by anti-auxin causes not only the retardation of growth of seminal root but also the lying down (j. e. lodging) of seedling. The present paper mentions about the studies on the anti-geotropism of seminal root of rice seed germinated in the eosin solution. Eosin is a growth inhibitor consisted of <b>tetrabromofluorescein...</b>|$|E
40|$|The use of {{liposomal}} nanoparticles with an incorporated {{active substance}} is an innovative and promising approach to diagnostics and therapy. The application of liposomal nanoparticle-based drugs allows for targeted localized delivery, overcomes the natural barriers {{within the body}} effectively, and minimizes possible side effects. Liposomes are able to contain a variety of ingredients with practically no limitations to their chemical composition, chemical properties, or size of constituent molecules. This study evaluated {{the ability to control}} the passage of fluorescent dye-filled liposomes through the intestinal mucosal barrier after oral administration. For this purpose, the increase in transcutaneous registered fluorescence from <b>tetrabromofluorescein</b> dye was recorded and analysed. Fluorescence intensity was measured at the proximal end of the tail of an animal model after oral administration of the liposomes. Measurements were taken at the excitation wavelengths of 365 and 450 [*]nm. The fluorescence intensity in the group treated with the fluorescent contrast agent encapsulated in liposomal particles increased 140 % of the initial level, but in the group treated with pure contrast agent, the increase in detected fluorescence intensity did not exceed 110 %. Mice that received empty liposomes as well as the control group did not demonstrate statistically significant changes in fluorescence intensity. A potential application of our results is an express laser optical method of monitoring the transport of orally administered liposomal particles. The results can be used to help create new optical tools for use in the development of new drugs and in high-throughput screening used during their testing...|$|E
