5|$|At {{the drivers}} meeting held the Friday before the event, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Race Director Charlie Whiting {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>any</b> potential blocking manoeuvres that {{interfered with the}} World Championship battle {{would result in a}} driver being shown a waved black and white flag, before giving a black flag to signal disqualification from the race. The penalty also had a potential ban for up to three Formula One World Championship events for any driver found to have breached the new ruling. Ralf Schumacher agreed with the penalties. However, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis was more vocal in opposing the new rules as he believed they were arbitrary and were against choosing team tactics. He was also unhappy with the inclusion of Italian lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward because Dennis held the view <b>that</b> <b>any</b> decision would be biased towards Ferrari.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of the ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed that members of the clergy should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled <b>that</b> <b>any</b> members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and <b>that</b> <b>any</b> party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able {{to reduce the amount of}} religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites.|$|E

5|$|Defence from thermal {{weapons and}} fire attacks was usually water or other liquids such as urine; hides were soaked and draped over {{vulnerable}} wooden hoardings and siege engines, and vats and barrels of liquid were collected and stored by defenders and attackers.

5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site {{would allow them to}} clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented <b>that</b> <b>any</b> decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied <b>that</b> <b>any</b> deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.|$|E
