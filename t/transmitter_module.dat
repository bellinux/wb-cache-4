40|$|This thesis for the Master of Science degree was {{performed}} at Solectron Corporation in Norrköping. The {{background for the}} thesis was a need to develop and build two test fixtures to automatize testing and adjusting of <b>transmitter</b> <b>modules</b> (TX-fixture) and receiver modules (RX-fixture) which are head devices in DWDM-systems. The basic elements for the test fixtures are: Test board, switch board and DC/DC board. The main function of the test board is to handle communication between the <b>transmitter</b> and receiver <b>modules</b> and supply voltage to these modules. The test board was insufficient and modified with a microprocessor to handle the communication between the PC and the receiver module. There are two connectors (NexLev) on test board to connect the receiver and <b>transmitter</b> <b>modules.</b> The switchboard {{has been used in}} fixtures for testing and adjusting both the receiver and <b>transmitter</b> <b>modules</b> for data rate up to 2. 5 Gbit/s. This board has been modified for use in new fixtures for data rate up to 10 Gbit/s. Because the power consumption of the test module will be measured with the amperemeter in the power supply, the reference module and the test module cannot be supplied by the same power supply. Because of high cost and the fact that no current is measured it is unacceptable to use a power supply to feed the reference module. The solution is to build a DC/DC board. Because the NexLev connector has a durability of 30 - 40 times it was necessary to have a connector with higher durability. This connector is located between the test board and the test module. Without this connector the project will not be profitable for the company. Some parts in RX- and TX-fixture have been used in older versions of fixtures for data rate up to 2. 5 Gbit/s. These parts have been updated for the new test demands of the new fixtures...|$|R

Although the 14th Institute had previously successfully developed solid state L-band transceivers, the new S-band with shorter wavelength presented greater challenge in that the new transceiver must be more compact and more resistant to interference.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the design procedure of a SerDes <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> for PCI e-gen 1 applications. The <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> has programmable features: impedance, amplitude and pre-emphasis. Design {{was performed in}} 130 nm CMOS technology (process IBM cmrf 8 sf). The design of the <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> is divided in three stages as follow: First, a behavioral model of <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> was created in Verilog-A language. This model has 2 inputs and two complementary outputs. This behavioral model was used to verify the proper system-level response of the <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> alone. Simulations based on behavioral model were performed using Spectre simulator in Virtuoso-Cadence. Simulations {{results show that the}} three features: impedance, amplitude and pre-emphasis could be properly modulated with the developed Verilog-A code. The behavioral model of <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> was also assembled with other modules of SerDes system in order to perform mixed-signal simulations and validate the correct response of the entire SerDes system for PCI-e gen 1 specifications. As second stage, the <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> was designed at transistor level with two complementary outputs. For this, we used pCells (transistors, resistors and capacitors, and vias for interconnecting devices) from CMRF 8 SF technology process. <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> is composed by several blocks such as Mux, Decoders, basic digital cells, buffers, and pseudo-analog cells among others. Transistors of digital cells were sized by applying the basic scaling theory while transistors of pseudo-analog cells were sized by analytic calculations in an iterative way. Mux and Decoders were assembled with digital cells. To validate the correct response of each designed internal block, test-benches were created to test each block. Transient simulations were performed using Spectre in Virtuoso Cadence. After verifying the proper response of internal block alone, they were assembled to form more complex blocks such as Decoders, ZAP UNIT and others and they were also tested. Finally, all internal blocks of <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> were assembled and tested at nominal PVT conditions. Critical PVT corners were evaluated and it was verified that response was under tolerance range. The third stage of design was the layout creation in a custom way. A similar bottom-up methodology followed to design at schematic-level of internal modules was applied to design the layout of each internal block of the <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module.</b> Keeping in mind the integration of internal blocks, the low–level digital cells were designed with the same height. The layout of each internal block was verified for DRC and LVS using Calibre tool and design rules of CMRF 8 SF process. Extraction of parasitics from layout using Calibre-PEX was done for each internal block. Post-layout response was compared to the pre-layout one; for this, Spectre simulation was performed of each internal blocks using simultaneously the extracted Calibre view and schematic view. Once the correct response was verified, the internal blocks were assembled and routed in order to build the entire layout of <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module.</b> Finally, the layout of <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> was folded in order to generate the two complementary outputs. At this top level, the layout of <b>Transmitter</b> <b>module</b> was also checked for DRC and LVS...|$|E

40|$|With the {{explosive}} growth of the wireless market, the demand for low-cost and highly-integrated radio frequency (RF) transceiver has been increased. Keeping up with this trend, complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) has been spotlighted {{by virtue of its}} superior characteristics. However, there are challenges in achieving this goal, especially designing the transmitter portion. The objective of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of fully integrated CMOS <b>transmitter</b> <b>module</b> which includes power amplifier (PA) and transmit/receive (T/R) switch by compensating for the intrinsic drawbacks of CMOS technology. As an effort to overcome the challenges, the high-power handling T/R switches are introduced as {{the first part of this}} dissertation. The proposed differential switch topology and feed-forward capacitor helps reducing the voltage stress over the switch devices, enabling a linear power transmission. With the high-power T/R switches, a new transmitter front-end topology - differential PA and T/R switch topology with the multi-section PA output matching network - is also proposed. The multi-stage PA output matching network assists to relieve the voltage stress over the switch device even more, by providing a low switch operating impedance. By analyzing the power performance and efficiency of entire <b>transmitter</b> <b>module,</b> design methodology for the high-power handling and efficient <b>transmitter</b> <b>module</b> is established.
