Veterinary intervention is not useful, {{since it is the}} eruption of the new teeth in the jaw that causes the problem; these cannot be removed until they have erupted, by which time the problem ceases. Apart from scarring caused by the self-mutilation, the cat seems to recover completely.|$|E
25|$|Gilgamesh {{delivers}} a lamentation for Enkidu, {{in which he}} calls upon mountains, forests, fields, rivers, wild animals, and all of Uruk to mourn for his friend. Recalling their adventures together, Gilgamesh <b>tears</b> <b>at</b> his hair and clothes in grief. He commissions a funerary statue, and provides grave gifts from his treasury to ensure that Enkidu has a favourable reception {{in the realm of}} the dead. A great banquet is held where the treasures are offered to the gods of the Netherworld. Just before a break in the text there is a suggestion that a river is being dammed, indicating a burial in a river bed, as in the corresponding Sumerian poem, The Death of Gilgamesh.|$|E

25|$|During England's {{second round}} match against Ecuador, Beckham scored from a free {{kick in the}} 59th minute, {{becoming}} the first English player to score in three separate World Cups, and giving England a 1–0 victory and {{a place in the}} quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of dehydration and illness that he got after having scored the winning goal for England. In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3–1), the score having been 0–0 after extra time. After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional {{for not being able to}} play, being in <b>tears</b> <b>at</b> one point.|$|E

500|$|At the convention's {{final day}} on July 14, 1972, presidential nominee McGovern {{selected}} and announced Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri as his vice-presidential choice. Eagleton was unknown to many delegates {{and the choice}} seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations. Thus, there were delegates willing to look elsewhere. Gravel was nominated by Bettye Fahrenkamp, the Democratic National Committeewoman from Alaska. He then seconded his own nomination, breaking down in <b>tears</b> <b>at</b> his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination. In any case he won 226 delegate votes, coming in third behind Eagleton and Frances [...] "Sissy" [...] Farenthold of Texas, in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates as well.|$|E

The range was remarkable".|$|E
500|$|When Humphreys {{returned}} to pre-season {{training for the}} following season, he was playfully teased over his penalty miss. Humphreys took the motto [...] "that anything that doesn't kill you, makes you stronger" [...] and was determined to come back stronger. Humphreys started the 2002–03 season with a goal against Carlisle on {{the opening day of}} the season. Throughout the course of the season, Humphreys would be played prominently as a left winger. Humphreys finished the season as an ever-present in the Hartlepool squad, adding 11 goals to his name in the process and helped Hartlepool gain promotion to the Second Division. His performances won him the Player of the Season award from the supporters. During this season it was revealed that Humphreys had been writing a diary, which he published and named it [...] "From Tears to Cheers", in reference to his <b>tears</b> <b>at</b> Cheltenham.|$|E

[...] His review for the second season After Story was much more positive, giving it an 'A-' rating. He praised {{the second half of the}} season as [...] "the best-written quarter of Clannad," [...] stating that it [...] "effectively builds up and delivers its emotional appeal, reinforces the series' central theme (i.e. the importance of family), and peaks visually," [...] and concluding that [...] "only the most cynical of souls will avoid shedding at least a few <b>tears</b> <b>at</b> certain points." [...] On the DVD Talk website, the reviewer Todd Douglass Jr. gave Clannad After Story a [...] "Highly Recommended" [...] rating, stating that [...] "the range of emotions Clannad takes you through is quite daunting. It's charming, cute, hilarious, mysterious, and tragic all at the same time. Few shows are as memorable, and few are this good for this long." [...] He concludes that the storytelling is [...] "heartfelt" [...] and [...] "memorable in so many ways," [...] and that [...] "few shows rise to the levels this one does." ...|$|E

500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{stated that}} in the Destination Moon-Explorers of the Moon story arc, Calculus [...] "embodies Hergé's... own wartime position, spun out into a post-war environment", {{representing}} a genius driven by his work whose activities are coincidental to national and political causes. He suggested that the scene in which Captain Haddock rides a pantomime hobby horse can be contrasted with the many scenes in which Haddock is thrown off of a horse's back during the Adventures. McCarthy also interpreted the scene in which Calculus cries and <b>tears</b> <b>at</b> his hair {{in response to the}} rocket's capture by the enemy as reflecting Hergé's own anxieties at having his work published and reinterpreted by his readers. He was also of the opinion that several scenes in Destination Moon reflected recurring themes throughout the series; he suggested that Haddock's attempts at smuggling whisky into Syldavia echoed the smuggling of treasure in The Secret of the Unicorn, while the [...] "correction" [...] in which Thompson and Thomson were recognised as not being spies reflected a theme of corrections in the series. He also believed that there was an example of Hergé's secret vulgarity within Destination Moon, with a diagram above Calculus' head in one scene resembling buttocks.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the {{academic}} journal Rhizomes, scholar Martin Hall, while analyzing the movie, discusses the self-perception an individual develops based on the views of those outside of themselves. The academician notes that when a child first comprehends the function of a mirror, they begin to develop the understanding that their perception of themselves is not self-contained, and learn partly they are what they see in the mirror. He contrasts this to when Anderton discovers the precogs' vision of his future self. At {{the beginning of the}} film, Anderton shows little concern for the precogs; when Witwer feels pity for them, he responds: [...] "It's better if you don't think of them as human." [...] Shortly thereafter, however, Anderton is shown in <b>tears</b> <b>at</b> his home, high on the hard drug neuroin while mourning the loss of his son. Agatha enters a similar period of self-examination when she has visions of her mother's death, and is informed they are merely [...] "echoes" [...] i.e. a faulty image in her memory. Anderton becomes flustered when he begins to interpret the images which show him about to commit murder and begins to frantically sort through, According to Hall he begins [...] "searching for whatever possible versions of this representation are available to him, other than the one that represents him as a murderer." [...] Hall says that he is sorting through the images so feverishly, as he is convinced once they are sorted properly and understood, they will not show him to be the murderer, because he is convinced that he is not a murderer. He literally becomes obsessed with himself, seeking to resolve these images with put him at [...] "discordance with his own reality." [...] Previously, at peace with himself, Hall says Anderton cannot accept the image he sees in the precogs' visions. Unable to reconcile the two, Hall says that he is forced to decide that [...] "it is likely that errors have occurred" [...] in the PreCrime system.|$|E
