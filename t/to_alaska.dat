5|$|Keene came <b>to</b> <b>Alaska</b> for {{the first}} time in the early 1970s to attend a cousin's wedding. Attracted by the state's beauty, she {{returned}} for several visits before making the decision in 1977 to move there — alone. Her son Lonnie was deemed old enough to make his own decisions, and he chose to remain in Minnesota. Keene took a week to drive from Minnesota <b>to</b> <b>Alaska</b> in a secondhand motorhome, ending in Homer, where she parked the motorhome at the end of Homer Spit in the Homer Spit Campground, where it remained for many years. She took a job at a fish processing facility on the Spit, the Icicle Seafoods subsidiary Seward Fisheries, in the spring of 1977, where she later became a foreman.|$|E

5|$|According to archaeological {{and genetic}} evidence, North and South America {{were the last}} continents {{in the world with}} human habitation. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska). Alaska was {{ice-free}} because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them <b>to</b> <b>Alaska</b> (East Beringia) for thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the legal}} {{right-of-way}} was cleared by January 1974, cold weather, {{the need to}} hire workers, and construction of the Dalton Highway meant work on the pipeline itself did not begin until March. Between 1974 and July 28, 1977, when the first barrel of oil reached Valdez, {{tens of thousands of}} people worked on the pipeline. Thousands of workers came <b>to</b> <b>Alaska,</b> attracted by the prospect of high-paying jobs at a time when most of the rest of the United States was undergoing a recession.|$|E

The next year they remarried on June 14, 1913, in Ottawa. They then departed on a honeymoon <b>to</b> <b>Alaska,</b> Hawaii, the Philippines, Panama, and Cuba, with their daughter Happy, son Ben, and his wife Miriam.|$|E

5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to deal with problems caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers <b>to</b> <b>Alaska,</b> causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E

5|$|It is believed, {{based on}} the {{ecological}} conditions, that C.maenas could eventually extend its range to colonise the Pacific coast of North America from Baja California <b>to</b> <b>Alaska.</b> Similar ecological conditions {{are to be found}} on many of the world's coasts, with the only large potential area not to have been invaded yet being New Zealand; the New Zealand government has taken action, including the release of a Marine Pest Guide in an effort to prevent colonisation by C.maenas.|$|E

5|$|Military flights {{also used}} Fairbanks as a base. In 1920, {{the first flight}} from the {{continental}} United States <b>to</b> <b>Alaska</b> used Fairbanks as a base.
