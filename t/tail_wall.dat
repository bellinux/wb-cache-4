50|$|Skaha Bluffs is a rock {{climbing}} area {{just south of}} Penticton, British Columbia, Canada on a hillside above Skaha Lake. The climbing takes place in three parallel canyons. Notable climbing walls include Fortress, Red <b>Tail,</b> Doctors <b>wall,</b> The Great White Wall and The Grand Canyon. The area is mostly a sport climbing area, though traditional climbing opportunities also exist. The rocks {{in the area are}} predominantly a coarse-grained gneiss and are generally under 30 metres tall. Skaha Bluffs is a climbing area with mild weather, easy access and a number of sport climbing routes. Access is from Lakeside Road to Smythe Road up along Gillies Creek.|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that similar {{physical}} systems can reveal two quite different ways of behavior, either coarsening, which creates a uniform state or a large-scale structure, or formation of ordered or disordered patterns, which are never homogenized. We present a description of coarsening using simple basic models, the Allen-Cahn equation and the Cahn-Hilliard equation, and discuss the factors that may slow down and arrest the process of coarsening. Among them are pinning of domain walls on inhomogeneities, oscillatory <b>tails</b> of domain <b>walls,</b> nonlocal interactions, and others. Coarsening of pattern domains is also discussed.

50|$|The {{intestinal}} trophozoites {{are similar}} in morphology to the infective sporozoites. In all species two mature trophozoites eventually pair up in {{a process known as}} (syzygy) and develop into gamonts. The gamonts are aseptate. During syzygy gamont orientation differs between species (side to side, head to <b>tail).</b> A gametocyst <b>wall</b> forms around each pair of gamonts which then begin to divide into hundreds of gametes. Zygotes are produced by the fusion of two gametes and these in turn become surrounded by an oocyst wall. Within the oocyst meiosis occurs yielding the sporozoites. Hundreds of oocysts accumulate within each gametocyst and these are released via host's faeces or via host death and decay.|$|R

50|$|This {{race was}} red flagged on lap 282 {{due to a}} crash {{involving}} the #41 of Steve Grissom. The #23 of Jimmy Spencer had spun out off Turn 2 and was hit by the #31 of Mike Skinner. Grissom spun to avoid this wreck and hit the inside wall near {{where there was a}} gate allowing infield access for motorhomes. Because of this, the car hit the <b>wall</b> <b>tail</b> first, breaking the wall, shearing the fuel cell {{out of the car and}} putting Grissom on his roof. The #91 of Mike Wallace backed off the throttle upon seeing the accident, which caused his exhaust to throw flames right over the fuel cell (which was sitting along the outside wall at the end of the backstretch). This caused a significant fire. Grissom was not seriously injured.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the years}} the mining company Boliden Mineral AB have had {{difficulties}} producing a working fine filter for their tailing pond at the Aitik copper mine. The problem with the fine filter occurs when it gets placed on the <b>tailing</b> pond <b>wall.</b> Coarse grains break down into fine grains and the entire composition of the fine filter is changed. The material {{that is used to}} produce the fine filter comes from the mine’s own waste rock supply. The primary waste rock in Aitik comprises of heterogeneous gneiss and pegmatite. To determine why the waste rock isn’t holding together well enough the mechanical strength of the rock is investigated. Huge differences for the mechanical strength both exist between the different rock types, but also in the different kinds of the gneiss. The effect of the explosions, used to mine the ore, and the crushing machine also impacts on the mechanical strength of the rock. Good mechanical strength is found in rock that has a high amount of secondary transformation like epidote and bad mechanical strength from foliated rock. To get the best mechanical properties it is suggested to exploit epidote transformed rock found in deformation zones, adjacent to the ore deposit or the pegmatite intrusions. It is also recommended to use less powerful charge when blasting rock material that will be used for production of the fine filter...|$|R
40|$|Diazepam was {{administered}} to Swiss-Webster mice for 53 days as a mixture of drug in laboratory chow, leading to consumption as high as 1 000 mg/kg/day. Low plasma concentrations of diazepam, but very high levels (generally between 5, 000 and 10, 000 ng/ml) of the active metabolites nordiazepam and oxaz-epam, were found. Animals appeared healthy throughout drug administration, but some died because of apparent drug-induced aggression. Withdrawal was precipftated by omitting drug from the food.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to follow the structural modifications of the aortic wall in middle-aged rats submitted to a resistance training protocol for a period of four months. Three groups of 8 animals per group were considered: middle-aged group (MA), old control group (OC) and old trained group (OT). Training consisted in to climb a 1. 1 -m vertical (80 ° incline) ladder with weights tied to their <b>tail.</b> Aortic <b>wall</b> structural modifications were studied through light and electron microscopy and morphometry. The mean arterial blood pressure at rest was similar in the three experimental groups (p =. 07). At the beginning of the experiment, the OC and OT groups had similar repetition maximums, ranging from 1. 6 -fold to 1. 9 -fold the body weight. At the end of the experiment, the repetition maximum of the OT group was 5 -fold greater than the body weight (p =. 03). The LV weight was 15 % larger in the OT group than in the MA group and 12 % larger than in the OC group (p =. 02). The LV wall thickness of the OT group was significantly larger than that of both, the MA group and the OC group (p =. 03). The LV internal diameter in the OT group was significantly smaller than that observed in the MA and OC groups (p =. 02). Resistance training diminished the alterations associated with aging improving aortic wall structure by reducing the thickness, normalising the elastic material, the collagen and the smooth muscle cells. Resistance training seems to be a potential treatment for reducing the deleterious effects of aging on the aortic wall...|$|R
40|$|The mRNA cap-binding protein {{eukaryotic}} translation {{initiation factor}} 4 E (eIF 4 E) participates in protein synthesis initiation, translational repression of specific mRNAs, and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Multiple isoforms of eIF 4 E {{are expressed in}} a variety of organisms, but their specific roles are poorly understood. We investigated one Caenorhabditis elegans isoform, IFE- 4, which has homologues in plants and mammals. IFE- 4 ::green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed in pharyngeal and <b>tail</b> neurons, body <b>wall</b> muscle, spermatheca, and vulva. Knockout of ife- 4 by RNA interference (RNAi) or a null mutation produced a pleiotropic phenotype that included egg-laying defects. Sedimentation analysis demonstrated that IFE- 4, but not IFE- 1, was present in 48 S initiation complexes, indicating that it participates in protein synthesis initiation. mRNAs affected by ife- 4 knockout were determined by DNA microarray analysis of polysomal distribution. Polysome shifts, in the absence of total mRNA changes, were observed for only 33 of the 18, 967 C. elegans mRNAs tested, of which a disproportionate number were related to egg laying and were expressed in neurons and/or muscle. Translational regulation was confirmed by reduced levels of DAF- 12, EGL- 15, and KIN- 29. The functions of these proteins can explain some phenotypes observed in ife- 4 knockout mutants. These results indicate that translation of a limited subset of mRNAs is dependent on a specific isoform of eIF 4 E...|$|R

40|$|Kinematics {{and steady}} {{swimming}} performance were recorded for steelhead trout (approximately 12. 2 cm in total length) swimming in channels 4. 5, 3 and 1. 6 cm wide in {{the centre of}} a flume 15 cm wide. Channel walls were solid or porous. Tail-beat depth {{and the length of}} the propulsive wave were not affected by spacing of either solid or porous walls. The product of tail-beat frequency, F, a d amplitude, H, was related to swimming speed, u, and to harmonic mean distance of the <b>tail</b> from the <b>wall,</b> z. For solid walls: FH = 1. 01 (± 0. 31) u 0. 67 (± 0. 09) z(0. 12 ± 0. 02) and for grid walls: FH = 0. 873 (± 0. 302) u 0. 74 (± 0. 08) z 0. 064 (± 0. 024), where ± 2 S. E. are shown for regression coefficients. Thus, rates of working were smaller for fish swimming between solid walls, but the reduction due to wall effects decreased with increasing swimming speed. Porous grid walls had less effect on kinematics, except at low swimming speeds. Spacing of solid walls did not affect maximum tail-beat frequency, but maximum tail-beat amplitude decreased with smaller wall widths. Maximum tail-beat amplitude similarly decreased with spacing between grid walls, but maximum tail-beat frequency increased. Walls also reduced maximum swimming speed. Wall effects have not been adequately taken into account in most studies of fish swimming in flumes and fish wheels...|$|R
40|$|Plaquing {{of a newly}} {{isolated}} phage of Bacillus subtilis, phage 41 c, is only 2 % {{efficient in}} agar containing 200 μg of deoxyribonuclease per ml. Timed deoxyribonuclease addition experiments showed that phage development is blocked in 90 % of the cells if deoxyribonuclease is present during adsorption (zero-time samples), whereas 10 min after adsorption the enzyme has little effect (10 -min samples). The fate of 32 P-deoxyribonucleic acid label of phage 41 c in zero-time samples was compared to that in 10 -min samples. In both, about 80 % of the label remained with the phage-bacterium complex on initial centrifugation. However, four successive washings removed 90 % of the 32 P from the zero-time samples but only 25 % from the 10 -min samples. In both samples, most of the washed-out label was of low molecular weight. When {{the time course of}} interruption of infection by blending was compared with interruption by deoxyribonuclease treatment, the two processes exhibited similar kinetics. It is postulated that both processes block injection at the same site, namely, the point of contact between phage <b>tail</b> and cell <b>wall</b> surface. Partitioning of 32 P label during protoplasting of zero-time and 10 -min samples was similar to that observed during washing. For the protoplasting experiments, a quantitative method for plaquing protoplasts was developed. A single bacillus made of several cells can give rise to several protoplast plaque-forming units. Strain 41 c was the only phage of seven tested to be inhibited by deoxyribonuclease. No other deoxyribonuclease-sensitive phages have been described...|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} three {{brothers}} lived so forlorn and solitary together they could scarcely eat. Everything they saw or handled told them only {{over and over}} again that their mother was dead. But there was work to be done, and brave hearts must take courage, else sorrow and trouble would be nothing but evil. This, too, was no time for sitting idle and doleful. For a little before the gathering of the rains there began to seem a strangeness in the air. After the great heat had flown up a tempest of wind and lightning of such a brightness that Nod, peering out of his little tangled window-hole, could see beneath the gleaming rods of rain and the huge, bowed, groaning trees no less than three leopards crouching for shelter beneath the Portingal's sturdy little hut. He could hear them, too, in the pauses of the tempest, mewling, spitting, and swearing, and the lash of their angry <b>tails</b> against the <b>wall</b> of the hut. After the tempest, it fell cold and very still, with sometimes a moaning in the air. Strange weather was in the sky at rise and set of sun. And the three brothers, looking out, and seeing the numberless flights of birds winging with cries all in one direction, and hearing this moaning, hardly knew what to be doing. They went out every day to gather great bundles of wood and as many nuts and fruits and roots as they could carry. And they found everywhere wise creatures doing the same--I mean, of course, collecting food--for none beside the Minimuls, the Gungas, and the Mulla-mulgars have fire-sticks, and most of them fear even the sight and smell of flames.|$|R
40|$|The micromagnetic {{structure}} of ultrathin cobalt films was studied under UHV conditions {{by means of}} a Scanning Electron Microscope with Polarization Analysis (SEMPA). The microscopic domain and domain wall structure was determined for Co/Cu(100) - and Co/Cu(1113) -films in the thickness range of 3 - 15 monolayers. In addition, the existence of domains and the {{structure of}} domain walls in ultrathin films has been investigated theoretically. After deposition, Co/Cu(100) - as well as Co/Cu(1113) -films exhibit a single domain state with edge domains only at the sample boundaries. This behavior can be well explained by taking into consideration that the magnetization for all those films is within the surface plane. Thus, a homogeneous magnetization state does not create any magnetic field, except at the boundaries, and therefore represents the lowest energy state. This simple picture remains valid for films with in-plane magnetization, even if the effect of film roughness during growth is taken into account. In contrast, the single domain state for films with out-of-plane magnetization is destabilized by an inhomogeneous, rough film structure during growth. Ultrathin Co/Cu(100) - as well as Co/Cu(1113) -films can be demagnetized by a magnetic AC-field of decreasing strength. In this demagnetized state, all ultrathin films investigated are characterized by a multidomain structure with domain sizes between several 10 and 100 #mu#m and very irregular boundaries. The domain walls are not straight and have no preferential orientation with regard to the magnetization direction, in contrast to bulk or thick film samples. Thus, the magnetostatic energy is of minor importance for domain walls in ultrathin films because this energy term is generally the origin of a preferential domain wall orientation. Due to the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the film plane, only 180 -domain walls are presented in Co/Cu(1113) -films. The micromagnetic structure of Co/Cu(100) -films which have a fourfold in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy is dominated by 90 -walls, although 180 -walls are also present. The experimental investigations for Co/Cu(100) -films show that within the domain wall the magnetization rotates in the film plane, i. e. the domain wall exhibits a Neel type structure. Domain wall structures and energies for Neel type walls in ultrathin films were calculated, using a 1 -dimensional model. In 180 -domain walls, for uniaxial as well as fourfold magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the magnetostatic energy contribution is significantly higher than in comparable 90 -walls. Therefore, 90 -walls are energetically more favorable than 180 -walls in materials with fourfold magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This is confirmed by the experimentally observed dominance of 90 -walls in demagnetized Co/Cu(100) -films. The magnetostatic energy contribution increases with the film thickness for all Neel wall types and alters the wall structure significantly. It sharpens the wall in its center region and also creates long tails in the outer segments. Long domain <b>wall</b> <b>tails</b> into the adjacent domains were found for 180 -walls in Co/Cu(100) -films. This type of wall also exhibits a 2 -dimensional magnetization structure depending on the surrounding domain configuration. (orig.)
