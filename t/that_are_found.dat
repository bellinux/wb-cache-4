The beads <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>were</b> common to find while the excavations were being done. [...] The beads were generally disc beads of freshwater shell, and then later in the deposits there were ivory beads and a glass beads as well, which are rare to find, <b>were</b> also <b>found.</b>|$|R

5|$|Contaminants {{that are}} {{discharged}} into {{the marine environment}} accumulate in the bodies of marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> in the tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular health, magic, and experience chests <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> throughout the game world, there are three Uber Chests to be found. Two of these chests provide an additional increment to the Health and Magic Meters, respectively, and the third chest contains an abundance of red and gold orbs. Several urns are also hidden in the game (e.g., the Urn of Gaia) which, {{upon completion of the}} challenge mode, unlocks special abilities (e.g., unlimited magic) for use during bonus play.|$|E
5|$|Intimidator 305 {{features}} two trains themed as Dale Earnhardt's black number 3 car. The trains feature headlights at {{the front}} of each train as well as advertisement stickers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> on NASCAR cars. One train is red with the other being silver. Each train has eight four-passenger cars, allowing thirty-two passengers per train. The trains are arranged in stadium-style seating with overhead lap bars fitted with soft, padded over-the-shoulder straps. In early July 2010, the ride received a unique new restraint design. The over-the-shoulder part of the harness now resembles a padded seat belt rather than the typical over-the-shoulder restraints used by Intamin.|$|E

5|$|Kinstones {{are special}} {{artifacts}} which Link can find throughout his quest. Kinstone pieces are fragments of a medallion <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> {{throughout the course}} of the game. If the player can find a character or object with a Kinstone piece (indicated by a thought bubble above their heads), the player can try to fuse their Kinstone piece with one of their own to make a match. If a successful fusion is made, something will occur somewhere within the game's world, including the placement of treasure chests, access to secret areas and certain events which occur among certain characters. Whilst many Kinstone fusions are optional, some fusions, such as those which use Golden Kinstones, are necessary to advance the story.|$|E
5|$|Matsuno, the game's {{producer}} and director, preferred {{to create a}} new game title from scratch and use design ideas from staff collaborations, rather than reusing popular characters and designs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> in sequels. Vagrant Story is regarded as a mixture of genres, as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map. Matsuno explained that the development team was not eager to place Vagrant Story into a specific genre, preferring to create the game with a genre of its own.|$|E
5|$|Proteins {{can also}} be natural poisons or antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors (discussed above) <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> in some legumes, {{as shown in the}} figure above. A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes: these act as {{irreversible}} inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is ricin, an extremely potent protein toxin found in castor oil beans. This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes. Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of ricin to kill a cell.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, UGA {{acquired}} the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), the marine science research institute <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>founded</b> in 1968, {{to join the}} University of Georgia Marine Institute <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>founded</b> in 1953.

5|$|The {{disease is}} {{believed}} to occur when there is susceptibility, {{or a lack of}} immune system resistance, to DPB-causing bacteria or viruses, caused by several genes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> predominantly in individuals of East Asian descent. The highest incidence occurs among Japanese people, followed by Koreans. DPB occurs more often in males, and usually begins around age 40. It was recognized as a distinct new disease in the early 1960s, and was formally named diffuse panbronchiolitis in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The land {{on which}} Worlds End State Park sits has {{undergone}} tremendous change over the last 350million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion {{of what is now}} North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone.|$|E
5|$|The limey oozes and mud {{were later}} lithified into the {{limestone}} and interbedded siltstone of the up-to-300foot (90m)-thick White Member of the Claron. This member erodes into white-colored monoliths <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> {{only at the}} highest elevations of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Fossils are rare in the White Member and consist mainly of freshwater snails and clams, indicating that the lakes supported little life. Most arches and natural bridges in the park, including the famous Natural Bridge, were carved from sandstone beds in the Claron.|$|E

5|$|The rocks {{exposed in}} the park were formed between 370and 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> {{in the park}} and in the Kitchen Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, siltstone, and conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|The tail is {{moderately}} {{short and}} does not have large thorn-like structures called dermal denticles that are normally found on skates. This lack of denticles distinguishes it from all but two species of skates <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> in the western Atlantic. Larger individuals do have three rows of smaller denticles on the tail, and mature females also possess denticles {{on the head and}} shoulders, and along the dorsal midbelt of the disk and tail. Denticles are completely absent on small individuals.|$|E
5|$|Wing {{areas are}} delimited and {{subdivided}} by fold-lines along which the wing can fold, and flexion-lines along which the wing can flex during flight. The fundamental {{distinction between the}} flexion-lines and the fold-lines is often blurred, as fold-lines may permit some flexibility or vice versa. Two constants <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> in nearly all insect wings are the claval (a flexion-line) and jugal folds (or fold line); forming variable and unsatisfactory boundaries. Wing foldings can very complicated, with transverse folding occurs in the hindwings of Dermaptera and Coleoptera, and in some insects the anal area can be folded like a fan.|$|E

5|$|Alloxylon flammeum, {{commonly}} known as the Queensland tree waratah or red silky oak, is a medium-sized tree of the family Proteaceae found in the Queensland tropical rain forests of northeastern Australia. It has shiny green elliptical leaves up to 18cm (7.2in) long, and prominent orange-red inflorescences that appear from August to October, followed by rectangular woody seed pods that ripen in February and March. Juvenile plants have large (up to 25cm (10in) long) deeply lobed pinnate leaves. Previously known as Oreocallis wickhamii, the initial specimen {{turned out to be a}} different species to the one cultivated and hence a new scientific name was required. Described formally by Peter Weston and Mike Crisp in 1991, A. flammeum was designated the type species of the genus Alloxylon. This genus contains the four species previously classified in Oreocallis <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> in Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of their}} need to keep their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture. In the Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Dredd was {{released}} on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence {{as well as a}} perceived lack of the satirical elements <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30–45 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a cult film. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by 2000 ADs publisher Rebellion Developments have maintained the possibility of a second film.|$|E
