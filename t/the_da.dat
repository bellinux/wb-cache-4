40|$|The article delineates {{the forms}} and {{mechanisms}} of accountability in Ghana’s District Assemblies (DAs) and probes their efficacy in the current decentralization policy. It provides empirical data on how accountability relationships have improved or not improved local democracy in Ghana. <b>The</b> <b>DAs</b> were created to be pillars of grassroots governance. The devolution of power to <b>the</b> <b>DAs</b> aimed at enhancing a system of local public monitoring and checks on their elected representatives. This was justified that local representatives would be more accessible to the local populace and could be held at close range for their policies and actions than distant national political leaders. The paper notes that the challenges of local accountability are many but they stem from the tendency {{of the central government}} to recentralize power by placing grassroots leaders under its influence. The practice of appointing the DCE and thirty percent members of <b>the</b> <b>DAs,</b> and <b>the</b> upward reporting mechanism reflect a growing culture of central controls in order to side step the autonomy of <b>the</b> <b>DAs.</b> <b>The</b> most apposite remedy for overcoming weak grassroots accountability lies in reform measures that allow the direct election of all officials of <b>the</b> <b>DAs</b> by <b>the</b> local populace...|$|R

5|$|The {{official}} opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) received 16.7% of {{the vote}} in 2009, up from 12.4% in 2004. <b>The</b> <b>DA</b> is led by Helen Zille, who was re-elected unopposed as Leader of the Democratic Alliance at the party's Federal Congress in Gauteng in 2012, while Lindiwe Mazibuko continued as Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. At provincial level, <b>the</b> <b>DA</b> has been in power in the Western Cape province since 2009, and came to power in several Western Cape municipalities in the 2011 municipal election. Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>DA</b> was seen as a party rallying against apartheid laws, especially in the 1980s. However, one of its larger following bases are the whites in the south, especially after it absorbed the New National Party in 2001 (although NNP was disbanded in 2004).|$|E
