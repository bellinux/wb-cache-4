5000|$|A {{horizontal}} {{boring machine}} has its work spindle {{parallel to the ground}} and work table. Typically there are three linear axes in which the <b>tool</b> <b>head</b> and part move.

50|$|The {{cleaning}} {{performance of}} the bristle blasting process {{is a consequence of}} synchronized impact of the bristle tips onto the target surface. The <b>tool</b> <b>head</b> with the bristle belt rotates at approximately 2,500 rpm. A so-called 'accelerator bar' detains the bristle tips and by releasing them increases their kinetic energy with which they strike the surface. Immediately after the bristles strike the corroded steel surface, they retract (rebound) from the surface ('single-impact'), which results in corrosion removal and a micro-identation that exposes the sheer metallic surface. The multitude of such primary impact craters generates a texture and surface which in visual cleanliness and roughness (anchor profile) mimics those obtained by grit blasting processes. The cleaned and coarsened surface is deemed favorable for the subsequent application and adhesion of protective films and industrial coatings.|$|E

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of high-resolution surface information by advanced documentation methods as short-range laser scanning or closerange photogrammetry can provide novel tool mark research perspectives {{in the field}} of archaeological sciences. For this reason, altogether eight different Bronze Age hand tool replicas and their tool marks were surveyed and analysed in this study. The automatic identification of sliding tool marks was carried out in a GIS environment. Based on hydrological and aspect parameters, the various hand tool impressions as watershed boundaries of the surface model could be determined in the developed workflow. After the segmentation of the single tool marks, slope and width values of the patterns were compared with the cutting edges of their replicas and the most used regions of the hand <b>tool</b> <b>heads</b> could be defined by these tool mark characteristics. The variation of midline parameters along the sliding tool marks resulted in significant conclusions about the mounting techniques of the hand <b>tool</b> <b>heads</b> on the handles. A smaller angular value between the replica and the handle produced different hand tool impressions which had a major influence on the woodworking efficiency as well.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to design a {{decoupled}} A/B-axis <b>tool</b> <b>head</b> with parallel kinematics, due to the increasing demand for A/B-axis tool heads in industry, particularly in thin wall machining applications for structural aluminium aerospace components.

For the purpose of optimal design, three indices are defined to evaluate the force transmission performance of the <b>tool</b> <b>head.</b> They have obvious physical significance and are dependent of any coordinate system. Based on the indices and their performance atlases, the optimization process is presented in detail.
