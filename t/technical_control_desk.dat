40|$|To {{cope with}} the {{continuous}} requests to introduce more systems to be monitored by the Technical Control Room (TCR), {{and to keep the}} existing systems' data up to date, the <b>Technical</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Desk</b> (TCD) service was created at the end of 1999. The TCD offers a single point of entry to all CERN users who are responsible for systems monitored by the TCR, so that they may establish a request for changes. The TCD consists of a set of procedures to be followed by users and TCR operators and a set of computer based tools to record and manage the requests. The TCR pledges to reply to all requests made to the TCD within 48 hrs. The implementation of changes in monitored systems involves a number of different activities from cabling, database modifications, and finally testing. The precise details of the changes requested and the activities impacted are recorded by the TCD so that both users and the TCR operators may view the progress of implementation throughout all stages...|$|E

This report outlines HCS existing at IAM, its working and use. The NAL designed, personal computer (PC) based electronic <b>control</b> <b>desk</b> used with the HCS to control the rotational speed of the Human Centrifuge (HC) is described. The <b>control</b> <b>desk</b> is used for running the HC to produce various (acceleration) patterns such as normal g profiles and combat g profiles which are generally experienced by pilots. The PC is used for speed reference signal generation, supervision of the sequence of operations to be carried out {{at the start of the}} centrifuge and continuous checking of the correct operation of the overall HCS. 13; The NAL designed <b>control</b> <b>desk</b> functionally replaces the original <b>control</b> <b>desk</b> and all the safety features that existed earlier have been retained in the new controller. Use of PC has resulted in a flexible programmig environment and use of the latest available solid state components employed in building the controller has resulted in a reliable system...|$|R
