Most Christ mythicists agree that the evidence for the existence of a historical Jesus Christ is weak at best, pointing at a series of perceived peculiarities in the sources which they regard as untrustworthy for a historical account and noting the reliance on Jewish writings and the similarities of early Christianity and the Christ figure with the mystery religions of the Greco-Roman world.|$|E

25|$|In late 1919, the Bolsheviks began {{gaining the}} upper hand in the Russian Civil War. Alexander Kolchak's White Movement and its allies faced an upsurge of {{partisan}} activity, as the Bolsheviks initiated a large scale offensive on the Eastern Front. A coalition of Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Left SRs formed a united political center in order to coordinate their actions against the Whites. The Red partisans took over Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk on 24 December 1919 and 5 January 1920 respectively. On 4 January, Kolchak resigned, relegating the leadership of the White Movement to Anton Denikin and Grigory Semyonov. On 6 April, the united leftist opposition formed the Far Eastern Republic as a semi autonomous buffer state between the Bolshevik dominated Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic {{and the rest of the}} Russian Far East still controlled by the White Movement and Japanese interventionists. On paper the Far Eastern Republic incorporated the Kamchatka Oblast, Zabaykalsky Krai, Primorsky Krai, Sakhalin Oblast, Amur Oblast and the Chinese Eastern Railway. However the eastern portion of Zabaykalsky Krai was still under the control of forces loyal to ataman Semyonov, forming <b>the</b> <b>so</b> <b>called</b> Chita Holdup. The holdup thus prevented the Reds from connecting the Far East Republic with the Primorsky Krai.|$|E

Gardner, considered one of the political leaders of the Know Nothing movement, although none of the three supported its extreme anti-immigrant positions of many of its supporters.|$|E
