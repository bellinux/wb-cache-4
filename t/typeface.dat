5|$|Capitalization {{during this}} time was not standardized. It {{depended}} on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter <b>typeface</b> which was used to print the Bible. This <b>typeface</b> was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin <b>typeface</b> (often antiqua).|$|E
5|$|Above {{the window}} is the album title {{and at the top}} of the cover is the band's name in a <b>typeface</b> more crafty than on {{previous}} album covers. Though the general design of the cover is that of a 1930s hotel in style, the <b>typeface</b> juxtaposes the general design with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled typeset. This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first appearing on Vulture Street.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic <b>typeface</b> and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the <b>typeface</b> in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.|$|E
5000|$|Imitation Song <b>typefaces</b> (...) are <b>typefaces</b> {{based on}} a printed style which {{developed}} in the Song dynasty, from which Ming <b>typefaces</b> developed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Typefaces</b> {{which contain}} {{pictures}} or symbols rather than letters and numbers are called non-alphanumeric <b>typefaces.</b> Important subclasses are dingbats, Ornamental and Pictorial <b>Typefaces</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Regular script <b>typefaces</b> {{are also}} {{commonly}} used, {{but not as}} common as Ming or sans-serif <b>typefaces</b> for body text. Regular script <b>typefaces</b> are often used to teach students Chinese characters, and often aim to match the standard forms of the region where they {{are meant to be}} used. Most <b>typefaces</b> in the Song dynasty were regular script <b>typefaces</b> which resembled a particular person's handwriting (e.g. the handwriting of Ouyang Xun, Yan Zhenqing, or Liu Gongquan), while most modern regular script <b>typefaces</b> tend toward anonymity and regularity.|$|R

5|$|In 2005 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a refurbishment programme including improvements to signage, security and train information systems. General repairs and redecoration were carried out, flooring was renewed, and better lighting, an improved CCTV security system and Help Points were installed, {{with the latter}} being suitable for people with limited hearing. Some of the original signs are in a 'petit-serif' adaptation of the London Underground <b>typeface,</b> Johnston Delf Smith Sans. This <b>typeface</b> was designed by Charles Holden and Percy Delf Smith, a former pupil of Edward Johnston.|$|E

50|$|Fournier is {{the name}} {{commonly}} applied to <b>typefaces</b> {{which are based on}} the <b>typefaces</b> of Parisian typefounder Pierre-Simon Fournier around the 1740s. Created in the Rococo style and influenced by the Romain du Roi <b>typefaces</b> commissioned by the French government in the previous century, Fournier's <b>typefaces</b> showed an advanced delicacy above what was previously common.|$|R

5|$|The three-languages {{wayfinding}} {{system for}} the Louvre Abu Dhabi was designed by Philippe Apeloig, and is implemented in both Arabic and Roman script. Frutiger LT <b>typeface</b> has been chosen for the Roman texts for its perfect readability for signage; while Lebanese typographer Kristyan Sarkis created an Arabic bespoked <b>typeface,</b> the LAD Arabic, based on the classic Naskh style and his Colvert Arabic font.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 to 1938, Monotype re-cut {{the type}} for modern-day usage, {{and it has}} become a popular book <b>typeface.</b> Ehrhardt has a {{slightly}} condensed design, giving it a strongly vertical, crisp appearance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Typefaces</b> {{that can}} be {{substituted}} for {{one another in a}} document without changing the document's text flow are said to be “metrically identical” (or “metrically compatible”). Several <b>typefaces</b> have been created to be metrically compatible with widely used proprietary <b>typefaces</b> to allow the editing of documents set in such <b>typefaces</b> in digital typesetting environments where these <b>typefaces</b> are not available. For instance, the open-source Liberation fonts and Croscore fonts have been designed as metrically compatible substitutes for widely used Microsoft fonts.|$|R
50|$|In most European countries, blackletter <b>typefaces</b> {{like the}} German Fraktur were {{displaced}} {{with the creation}} of the Antiqua <b>typefaces</b> in the 15th and 16th centuries. However, in Germany, both <b>typefaces</b> coexisted until {{the first half of the}} 20th century.|$|R

5|$|In 1500, Manutius {{released}} the first books printed using italic type, again designed by Griffo. This was originally not {{intended as a}} complementary design, as is used today, but rather as an alternative, more informal <b>typeface</b> suitable for small volumes.|$|E
5|$|The regular (roman) {{style of}} Bembo {{is based on}} Griffo's <b>typeface</b> for Manutius. Griffo, {{sometimes}} called Francesco da Bologna (of Bologna), was an engraver who created designs by cutting punches in steel. These were used as a master to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{variants}} of the $10 million denomination, the primary difference being the <b>typeface</b> {{and size of}} the serial number.

5|$|First {{unveiled}} {{in a single}} uppercase weight in 1928, Gill Sans achieved national prominence almost immediately, when it was chosen the following year to become the standard <b>typeface</b> for the LNER railway system, soon appearing on every facet of the company's identity, from metal locomotive nameplates and hand-painted station signage to printed restaurant car menus, timetables and advertising posters.|$|E
5|$|In France, {{his work}} {{inspired}} many French printers and punchcutters such as Robert Estienne and Claude Garamond from 1530 onwards, {{even though the}} <b>typeface</b> of De Aetna with its original capitals was apparently used in only about twelve books between 1496 and 1499. Historian Beatrice Warde suggested in the 1920s that its influence {{may have been due}} to the high quality of printing shown in the original De Aetna volume, perhaps created as a small pilot project. De Aetna was printed using a mixture of alternate characters, perhaps as an experiment, which included a lower-case p in the same style as the capital letter with a flat top. In 1499, Griffo recut the capitals, changing the appearance of the <b>typeface</b> slightly. This version was used to print Manutius' famous illustrated volume Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.|$|E
5|$|Iron Maiden's {{distinct}} logo has adorned {{all of the}} band's releases {{since their}} debut, 1979's The Soundhouse Tapes EP. The <b>typeface</b> originates with Vic Fair's poster design for the 1976 science fiction film, The Man Who Fell to Earth, also used by Gordon Giltrap, although Steve Harris claims that he designed it himself, using his abilities as an architectural draughtsman.|$|E
5000|$|Also called {{mechanical}}, slab serif, or mécanes, {{the name}} of this group evokes the mechanical aspect of these <b>typefaces,</b> which coincide with the Industrial Revolution {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century. The principal characteristics of these <b>typefaces</b> are a very low contrast and rectangular slab serifs. They correspond to the Egyptiennes of Thibaudeau classification. This category includes both <b>typefaces</b> with bracketed serifs (clarendons or ionics) and <b>typefaces</b> with square or unbracketed serifs (...) [...]|$|R
50|$|While the {{exhibition}} showed works of design other than <b>typefaces,</b> {{the selection and}} acquisition of <b>typefaces</b> was significant {{in the history of}} typographic design.

50|$|These days, {{legibility}} research {{tends to}} be limited to critical issues, or the testing of specific design solutions (for example, when new <b>typefaces</b> are developed).
