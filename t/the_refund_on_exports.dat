In particular, we examine the impact of the EITC across household types. For tax years 2002 through 2004, we find that the EITC is responsible for significantly lowering the poverty rate of EITC recipients, from 57 to 49 percent. In fact, for households below the poverty line, the EITC fills 31 percent of the gap between their adjusted gross income and the poverty line. The EITC has the largest impact on single parent households, lowering their poverty rate by 11. 2 percentage points and reducing their poverty gap by almost 35 percent. However, the EITC has negligible effects on the poorest households in the sample – childless singles. A majority (64 percent) of EITC recipients intends to use at least some of <b>the</b> <b>refund</b> <b>on</b> basic needs and almost half plan on using part of their refund for debt repayment. This suggests that the EITC helps the majority of recipients get by but does not increase their economic mobility. Somewhat surprisingly, single parent households in the sample are not that different from married parent households in terms of EITC amounts, poverty rates, use of credit, and participation in government programs, despite earning less...|$|R

40|$|According to the April 2003 {{report of}} the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service 'world flour trade has dropped 30 % {{in just the past}} seven years' as the pattern of trade has changed. Privatisation and an {{expansion}} of capacity of milling facilities in major markets has 'shifted demand from imported flour to imported wheat'. As a consequence 'competition has increased for the shrinking flour market'. Regional flour suppliers are increasing their market share by 'providing quicker delivery, smaller shipments and cheaper transportation to quality sensitive buyers'. As a consequence 'the EU - once the world's dominant flour supplier - has seen its exports drop nearly 60 %. Many French mills, which were built near ports for export, have slashed capacity in half or closed, whereas a third of Italy's mills have already closed. Comment: This trend is most noticeable in markets in north Africa, the middle east, India and the former Soviet Union. This means that the ACP flour market is increasing in importance as the European milling industry faces a major crisis. ACP countries could find themselves increasingly targeted by EU flour suppliers with substantial surplus capacity. In addition, developments in the global flour trade throw current French proposals for a temporary cessation of <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> <b>on</b> agricultural <b>exports</b> to African markets into a different light. If such a cessation were to apply only to basic agricultural products and not to other products in the value chain then this proposal could provide significant relief to a depressed French milling sector.

40|$|The usual sale of European {{agricultural}} products to Africa using export refunds has been heavily discussed in recent decades. At {{the centre of}} the discussion are the consequences on the agricultural producers in Western and Southern Africa. There are two different points of view: On the one hand, the European Union's (EU) export policy reduces the prices on these markets and relieves high burdens on local producers; on the other hand are claims that refunds do not influence local prices significantly. Hence, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has no effect on markets of third countries, besides depressing world market prices. This paper focuses on the effects of EU's export subsidies for beef <b>exports</b> <b>on</b> its market share in several developing countries. Twenty-seven African countries were analysed using a fixed-effects model between 1988 and 2000.

40|$|Functional {{principal}} components (FPC) analysis {{is widely used}} to decompose and express functional observations. Curve estimates implicitly condition on basis functions and other quantities derived from FPC decompositions; however these objects are unknown in practice. In this paper, we propose a method for obtaining correct curve estimates by accounting for uncertainty in FPC decompositions. Additionally, pointwise and simultaneous confidence intervals that account for both model- based and decomposition-based variability are constructed. Standard mixed-model representations of functional expansions are used to construct curve estimates and variances conditional on a specific decomposition. A bootstrap procedure is implemented to understand the uncertainty in principal component decomposition quantities. Iterated expectation and variance formulas combine both sources of uncertainty by combining model-based conditional estimates across the distribution of decompositions. Our method compares favorably to competing approaches in simulation studies that include both densely- and sparsely-observed functions. We apply our method to sparse observations of CD 4 cell counts and to dense white-matter tract profiles.
