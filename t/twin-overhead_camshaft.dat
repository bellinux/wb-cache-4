5000|$|Lombard took a {{stand at}} the 20th Paris Motor Show in October 1926 and {{exhibited}} the car they would be selling in 1927. [...] The Lombard AL3 was powered by a 4-cylinder <b>twin-overhead</b> <b>camshaft</b> engine of 1,083cc. [...] Some of the engines on the production cars would be fitted with superchargers.|$|E
5000|$|The DB6 {{is powered}} by the [...] <b>twin-overhead</b> <b>camshaft</b> (DOHC), in-line six-cylinder Aston Martin engine {{designed}} by Tadek Marek. The engine, continued with its triple SU carb setup producing [...] at 5,500 rpm; the Vantage engine option is quoted at [...] against the [...] of the DB5. Although {{the weight of the}} DB6 was approximately 17 lb heavier than its predecessor, the stability at high speed, added luggage capacity and comforts for passengers in this grand tourer more than offset any imperceptible loss in performance caused by additional weight. The rear suspension used helical coil springs with ride control that was adjustable from inside the car.|$|E
5000|$|Significant {{changes from}} the prior 3200 GT engine were the larger {{displacement}} resulting from an increased cylinder bore diameter and {{the move to}} a naturally aspirated intake that replaced the twin-turbo approach Maserati had used for the previous 20 years, fundamentally because the powertrain is now Ferrari based. [...] The engine operates at a compression ratio of 11.1:1 with the cylinders configured in a 90Â° V8. The cylinder bore diameter is 92 mm and piston stroke length is 80 mm. [...] The engine shares many of the design features of modern racing engines, including dry sump lubrication, a pump assembly located outside the crankcase, and four valves per cylinder. [...] The 32-valve DOHC utilizes chain-driven, <b>twin-overhead</b> <b>camshafts</b> that provide valve actuation in less than 0.15 seconds, with the intake cams being controlled by variable valve timing. [...] The crankcase and cylinder heads are made from an aluminum and silicon alloy, giving the engine a relatively light weight of 405 lb.|$|R
