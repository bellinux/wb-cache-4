40|$|Abstract: An {{accurate}} {{test for}} insulin resistance can delay or prevent {{the development of}} Type 2 diabetes and its complications. The current gold standard <b>test,</b> <b>CLAMP,</b> is too labor intensive {{to be used in}} general practice. A recently developed dynamic insulin sensitivity test, DIST, uses a glucose-insulin-C-peptide model to calculate model-based insulin sensitivity, SI. Preliminary results show good correlation to CLAMP. However both CLAMP and DIST ignore saturation in insulin-mediated glucose removal. This study uses the data from 17 patients who underwent multiple DISTs to investigate interstitial insulin action and its influence on modeled insulin sensitivity. The critical parameters influencing interstitial insulin action are saturation in insulin receptor binding, αG, and plasma-interstitial diffusion rate, nI. Very low values of αG and very low values of nI produced the most intra-patient variability in SI. Repeatability in SI is enhanced with modeled insulin receptor saturation. Future parameter study on subjects with varying degree of insulin resistance may provide a better understanding of different contributing factors of insulin resistance...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with severe}} {{bilateral}} carotid lesions (stenosis and contralateral internal carotid occlusion) {{are at high}} risk of having a stroke, and carotid endarterectomy has been proposed as the best treatment. In spite of improvements in surgical technique, this operation is still associated with significant perioperative complications (5 - 13 %) which are frequently (up to 40 %) correlated with intolerance to internal carotid artery clamping. For this reason, intraoperative cerebral monitoring able to accurately detect ischaemia during surgery would be useful. Reviewing our experience from the last 7 years in 74 patients operated on for stenosis and contralateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery, we found a 1. 3 % neurological morbidity and 1. 3 % mortality rate. Presenting symptoms included focal transient ischaemia attacks (TIAs) in 57 patients, stroke in 16 patients and two patients were asymptomatic. Half of these patients (37) were operated on under general anaesthesia with electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, stump pressure measurement and selective shunting. In this group, two patients (5. 4 %) sustained a postoperative stroke, one of which was fatal. The remaining 37 patients were operated on under local-regional anaesthesia with selective shunting on the basis of neurological deficit onset or loss of consciousness during the <b>test</b> <b>clamp.</b> There were no postoperative neurological complications in this group but one patient died of acute myocardial infarction on the 6 th postoperative day.

We reviewed the medical records and venograms of 14 patients with petroclival meningiomas, in whom the intraoperative ligation of transverse or sigmoid sinus had been done at our hospital between 1986 and 1999. All patients passed the intraoperative <b>test</b> <b>clamping</b> of the sinus. The drainage pattern of confluence of Herophili was classified into four types: type A, confluence and equal drainage on both transverse sinuses; type B, confluence and non-dominant transverse sinus on the tumor side; type C, confluence and dominant transverse sinus on the tumor side; and type D, unilateral transverse sinus only. Among the 14 cases, four cases were in type A, five cases in type B, and two were type C.

40|$|Background: In preterm infants, {{immediate}} {{complications of}} surgical closure of a {{patent ductus arteriosus}} (PDA) are often serious and due to haemorrhage or ligation of incorrect structures. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure blood pressure (BP) changes during ligation and hence introduce a novel physiological marker to alert surgeons to the ligation of incorrect structures. Materials and Methods: This study included 146 preterm babies (≤ 35 weeks of gestation) who underwent surgical PDA closure of a left-to-right unidirectional PDA between June 2006 and December 2015. The median weight was 920 g (range, from 520 to 2200 g). In all cases, the PDA was test cross-clamped, and the lower limb or umbilical artery BP was recorded before ligation. Results: Based on preoperative echocardiography, the PDA diameter range was 2 - 4 mm in 135 cases and 5 - 6 mm in 11 cases. During <b>test</b> <b>clamping</b> of the PDA, a 20 - 60 % rise in mean BP was recorded. The lower figure was observed with smaller PDAs. Conclusion: It is estimated that the mean BP should rise by 10 % for every mm of PDA diameter during <b>test</b> <b>clamping</b> and ligation of the PDA, irrespective of weight or age. The absence of this expected rise in mean BP indicates that an incorrect structure might have been clamped...|$|R

40|$|Aortic coarctation {{can now be}} {{repaired}} surgically with excellent results. Even though rare, injury to the spinal cord resulting in paraplegia remains a major concern. Preoperative evaluation showing the absence of collateral circulation is valuable in order to introduce protective actions. This report describes our experience using a temporary bypass from the ascending to the descending aorta bypass in children undergoing surgical correction of aortic coarctation {{in the setting of}} poorly developed collateral circulation. Between 1990 and 2002, we undertook direct surgical repair in 56 patients with isolated aortic coarctation, 20 as neonates, 11 as infants, and 25 during childhood. From 1998 onwards, we introduced preoperative evaluation of the collateral circulation with magnetic resonance imaging. From that time, we placed a temporary bypass from the ascending to the descending aorta, using a polytetrafluoroethylene tube of 4 to 8 mm diameter, whenever distal pressures were shown to be 25 mmHg or less after <b>test</b> <b>clamping,</b> or when magnetic resonance imaging revealed absence of collateral circulation. We found excellent correlations between the direct intra-operative measurements of distal pressure and the findings at magnetic resonance imaging. Following introduction of the temporary bypass, we observed no neurological complications, nor were there any complications related to bypass. Freedom from restenosis was 96 %. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, therefore, can accurately visualize poor collateral circulation in children with aortic coarctation. The use of a temporary bypass can possibly eliminate the risk of neurological sequels following direct repair of coarctation in children with poorly developed collateral circulation.

40|$|Type 2  diabetes is {{a complex}} chronic {{metabolic}} disorder characterized by hyperglycemia associated with a relative deficiency of insulin secretion and a reduced response of target tissues to insulin. Considerable efforts have been put into the development of models describing the glucose-insulin system. The best known is Bergman’s “minimal” model for glucose, which is estimating glucose concentrations using fixed insulin concentrations as input. However, due to the involved feedback mechanisms, simultaneous modeling of both entities would be advantageous. This is particularly relevant if the model {{is intended to be}} used as a predictive tool. The mechanism-based glucose-insulin model presented in this thesis is able to simultaneously describe glucose and insulin profiles following a wide variety of clinical provocation experiments, such as intravenous and oral glucose tolerance <b>tests,</b> <b>clamp</b> studies and sequential meal tests over 24 hours. It consists of sub-models for glucose, labeled glucose and insulin kinetics. It also incorporates control mechanisms for the regulation of glucose production, insulin secretion, and glucose uptake. Simultaneous analysis of all data by nonlinear mixed effect modeling was performed in NONMEM. Even if this model is a crude representation of a complex physiological system, its ability to represent the main processes of this system was established by identifying: 1) the difference in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity between healthy volunteers and type  2 diabetics, 2) the action of incretin hormones after oral administration of glucose, 3) the circadian variation of insulin secretion and 4) the correct mechanism of action of a glucokinase activator, a new oral antidiabetic compound acting on both the pancreas and the liver.

The results for static strength and fatigue residual strength under different fatigue stress amplitudes are evaluated and compared with each other. The damage and failure mechanisms of the composite laminates are discussed. It is observed that all tension–tension fatigue damage patterns of the notched laminates are similar while the tension–tension fatigue properties vary with the laminate layup. The reduction of stress concentration caused by the tension–tension fatigue damage leads to an improvement of the residual strength of the notched specimens in contrast to their static strength properties. The damage mechanics of the notched laminates under compression–compression loading are more complex {{than those of the}} tension–tension fatigue specimens; their damage patterns are influenced by the <b>test</b> <b>clamping</b> fixture, the layup, the size of specimens and the diameter of the hole.

Neither pace-maker current nor pace-maker potential were altered by addition of tetrodotoxin, but a tetrodotoxin-sensitive channel could be activated in sino-atrial nodal strips following hyperpolarizing clamp steps. Ca 2 +-channel blockers {{did not affect the}} voltage dependence of delta Ip or the maximum diastolic potential (m. d. p.) significantly. Removal of Ca 2 + did not affect the pace-maker current at clamp potentials near the pace-maker potential range (- 60 to - 80 mV), but it did reduce the potential dependence of the m. d. p. Removal of Na+ suppressed completely the pace-maker current and hyperpolarized the membrane. Removal of Na+ also increased membrane conductance, most likely through an increase in resting K+ permeability. Low concentration of Cs+ (less than 5 mM), but not Ba 2 + or tetraethylammonium, markedly suppressed activation delta Ip and reduced the rate of pacing slightly. Cs+ also decreased the membrane conductance and hyperpolarized the membrane.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of investigating glucose tolerance and insulin action and secretion in vivo in mouse models has provided major insights into both {{type 2 diabetes}} pathogenesis and the identification of novel strategies to treat this common disorder. When initial studies provide evidence for altered levels of insulin and/or glucose in the animal blood, a number of well-characterized tests can be adopted to estimate glucose homeostasis and insulin action and secretion in vivo. These tests include model assessments, glucose and insulin sensitivity studies, and glucose clamps. None {{of them can be}} considered appropriate under all circumstances and there is significant variation in their complexity, technical ease, and invasiveness. Thus, while the euglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp represents the gold standard for measuring in vivo insulin action, less labor-intensive as well as invasive techinques are usually considered as the initial approach to evaluate glucose homeostasis. This section focuses on glucose and insulin tolerance <b>tests.</b> The <b>clamp</b> technique is described in Chapter 15...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} fatigue problem on riveted {{structures}} and the correlated experimental tests. The term “fatigue” denotes the cracking of metals under repeated loading. The technique of riveting structures is obsolete {{due to the}} low level of standardization in the construction process. Knowledge concerning riveted structure’s ability to withstand fatigue has not been investigated to the same extent as for modern structures assembled by welding. Nevertheless, many riveted structures are still in service after over 100 years. Clamping force originates when the hot rivet is placed into the hole of the plates and the rivet shorten in length due to cooling. In Europe, a large number of railway bridges are riveted. Moreover, all over the world, the rivet assembly technique has been largely used for different types of buildings. The riveted structures are subjected, evidently, to fatigue degradation as all the other steel structures. The riveted joint complexity and the non-uniform realization lead to a structure-specific consideration. In Europe, current regulations recognise only one fatigue class for riveted structures neglecting the clamping force effect. This approach is characterized by an elevated standard deviation for the assessed results. This research aims to improve the riveted structures fatigue comprehension and to propose appropriate tests. Some elements have been extracted from a dismantled railway bridge located near San Stino di Livenza (Venice). An innovative <b>clamping</b> <b>test</b> (TCT) has been conceived: applying a torsional moment to the rivets and evaluating the sliding friction, the clamping force has been estimated. Contrary to traditional <b>clamping</b> <b>tests,</b> this setup, at an affordable price, provides good precision. Moreover, the test is in-site and does not provoke damages to the examined structure. Fem models of rail bearer have been realized taking into account rivets, holes and multilayer plates section inertia. A specific laboratory set up has been designed with the intention to calibrate the fem models. Frictions and clamping force have been taken into account in the rail bearer models. There is a close correspondence between the non-linear models and the experimental <b>tests.</b> The <b>clamping</b> assumptions, derived from the TCT, have been verified. A full scale fatigue test has been prepared and the first cycles have been monitored. Full scale fatigue tests are sophisticated and involve many parameters. For this test, a specific metallic frame has been designed and realized using advanced fatigue models. An advanced analysis (hot spot method) has been carried out, for the frame, in order to evaluate the stress into the welds. This frame will be used by the DICEA laboratory to test, principally, specimens extracted from bridges...|$|R

However, these sensor nodes are not {{directly}} supported {{because there are no}} suitable expansion slots on them for the purpose of network testing. Users must connect the corresponding wires between the nodes and the <b>test</b> boards with <b>clamps</b> or by soldering, which are neither convenient nor flexible. If these internal chip-level signals are connected to the test boards, no matter by clamps, soldering or expansion slot. the testbed HINT could obtain information enough to analysis the status of the sensor nodes and to perform the network testing.|$|R
