5|$|The edibility of {{the fruit}} bodies of Agaricus deserticola is not known definitively, and there are {{conflicting}} opinions in the literature, with some sources claiming that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should be avoided. However, one popular field guide to North American mushrooms suggests they are edible when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>young,</b> and have a pleasant odor and mild taste.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>young</b> and healthy.|$|E
5|$|When <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>young,</b> Sam {{breaks into}} the orphanage {{he was thrown}} out of to get to Nathan, and tell him some grim news. To make up for the bad part, Sam leads Nathan to the house of Evelyn,a {{historian}} who was legally sold their mother's belongings. They attempt to retrieve the items, but are caught. Evelyn called the police before she knew that the boys were the offspring of Cassandra Morgan, an employee of hers. Evelyn collapses from her lung disease and the boys are associated with her death. They flee, and Sam prompts Nathan that they can become explorers, under the new surname of Drake. It is implied that Sam , around 19 or 20 years old was behind bars when Nathan around 14 or 15 years old stole Francis Drake's ring in Columbia, and when he first partnered with Victor Sullivan, he presumably later met Victor but never saw him eye to eye, and distrusted him.|$|E

5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>young</b> and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E
25|$|The swimbladders of {{deep sea}} fish are either absent or {{scarcely}} operational, and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations. Filling bladders at such great pressures incurs huge energy costs. Some deep sea fishes have swimbladders which function while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>young</b> and inhabit the upper epipelagic zone, but they wither or fill with fat {{when the fish}} move down to their adult habitat.|$|E

25|$|The {{making of}} {{traditional}} huipils {{is an important}} cultural and economic activity for the Amuzgos, especially in Xochistlahuaca where most people still wear traditional clothing. Girls begin learning the craft when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>young,</b> learning techniques and designs from their mothers and grandmothers. The weaving is {{an important source of}} income as agriculture is not enough to meet most families’ needs. While they work on other items such as tablecloths and other items of clothing, the most popular and most valued remains the huipil. Amuzgo women have achieved a certain level of fame, with weavers such as Florentina López de Jesús winning recognition at the 2001 UNESCO handcraft competition for Latin America and Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a somewhat detailed {{picture of the}} perception of identity inside the country. The {{participants were asked to}} rate the relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll shows that 26% of the entire sample, which includes all ethnic groups, claim the two identities are the same or very similar, whereas 47% claim they are different or entirely different. The results vary significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar, and 44% different or very different. Among the senior respondents (aged over 60), the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. One of the largest deviation from the country average was among the residents of capital Chișinău, for whom the figures were 42% and 44%. The poll also shows that, compared to the national average (25%), {{people are more likely to}} perceive the two identities as the same or very similar if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>young</b> (33%), are native speakers of Romanian (30%), have higher education (36%) or reside in urban areas (30%), especially in the capital city (42%).|$|E

500|$|In Otago, cabbage trees {{gradually}} {{become less}} common towards the south until {{they come to}} an end in the northern Catlins. They reappear on the south coast at Waikawa, Southland, but they are not the wharanui type. Rather they are vigorous trees with broad, green leaves and broad canopies. They extend along the coast towards Fiordland, and inland to the margins of some of the glacier-fed lakes. Very vigorous when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>young,</b> these trees seem well adapted to the very cold winters of the south.|$|E
500|$|Although {{commonly}} considered edible, opinions vary on {{the culinary}} appeal of Leccinum holopus fruitbodies. Michael Kuo, writing in 100 Edible Mushrooms, considers {{it a good}} edible; Peter Roberts and Shelley Evans in The Book of Fungi say [...] "it is edible, but {{is said to be}} tasteless and pappy, so is not recommended." [...] Fruitbodies are optimally harvested when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>young,</b> before the flesh becomes too spongy, and before insect larvae establish themselves. Minimal cleaning is required in the field. The mushroom has a mild, somewhat sweet flavor that is enhanced after brief sauteeing. Drying the mushrooms enhances the flavor, but diminishes the sweetness of fresh mushrooms.|$|E

The hyphal part is less than 1–6 x 1–2µm. The [...] (thin projections of the basidia that attach to the spore) are 4–6µm long and mostly 1–1.5µm thick. The hyphae located immediately underneath the basidia are thin-walled, 1–2µm wide, provided with clamps and densely branched. The hyphae of the tramal plates are roughly parallel, thin-walled, 1–2µm wide, and provided with clamps which may be dilated.|$|E

The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} gill faces) are roughly cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>young,</b> but soon broaden in the mid portion and taper to an abrupt point; they reach dimensions of 40–68 (up to 80µm) by 9–13µm.
