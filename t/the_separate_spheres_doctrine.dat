Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique asserted that women were being forced to rely on their husbands and children as the sole sources of their identity by an historically constructed oppressive paradigm, not by any [...] "intrinsic" [...] predisposition. Drawing on Friedan, historian Barbara Welter identified a [...] "Cult of True Womanhood", an ideal of femininity prevalent among the upper and middle classes in the 19th century. [...] "True women" [...] were supposed to be pious, pure, submissive, and domestic. Domesticity, in particular, was regarded as a laudable virtue as the home was considered a woman's proper sphere. Unlike Tocqueville, Welter and other 20th-century historians were critical of <b>the</b> <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> ideology, seeing it as a source of women's denigration.|$|R

40|$|Research on role congruity {{theory and}} {{descriptive}} and prescriptive stereotypes has established that when {{men and women}} violate gender stereotypes by crossing spheres, with women pursuing career success and men contributing to domestic labor, they face backlash and economic penalties. Less is known, however, about the types of individuals {{who are most likely}} to engage in these forms of discrimination and the types of situations in which this is most likely to occur. We propose that psychological research will benefit from supplementing existing research approaches with an individual differences model of support for <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> for men and women. This model allows psychologists to examine individual differences in support for <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> as they interact with situational and contextual forces. <b>The</b> <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> ideology (SSI) has existed as a cultural idea for many years but has not been operationalized or modeled in social psychology. <b>The</b> <b>Separate</b> <b>Spheres</b> Model presents <b>the</b> SSI as a new psychological construct characterized by individual differences and a motivated system-justifying function, operationalizes the ideology with a new scale measure, and models the ideology as a predictor of some important gendered outcomes in society. As a first step toward developing <b>the</b> <b>Separate</b> <b>Spheres</b> Model, we develop a new measure of individuals' endorsement of the SSI and demonstrate its reliability, convergent validity, and incremental predictive validity. We provide support for the novel hypotheses that the SSI predicts attitudes regarding workplace flexibility accommodations, income distribution within families between male and female partners, distribution of labor between work and family spheres, and discriminatory workplace behaviors. Finally, we provide experimental support for the hypothesis that the SSI is a motivated, system-justifying ideology...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> {{ideology}} of <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> emerged in <b>the</b> {{wake of the}} Industrial Revolution. Prior to the industrialization of the Western world, family members worked side by side and the workplace was located mostly {{in and around the}} home. With the shift from home-based to factory production, men left the home to sell their labor for wages while women stayed home to perform unpaid domestic work. <b>The</b> <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> ideology reflected and fueled these changes. Theorists such as Friedrich Engels and, to a lesser extent, Karl Marx have stressed the importance of industrialization. Marx argued that following the rise of capitalism, the home lost its control of the means of production and consequently became a private, <b>separate</b> <b>sphere.</b> As a result, Engels contended, women were excluded from participating directly in the production process and relegated to the subordinate domestic sphere.|$|R

As {{a result of the}} study, there was more couples found with the mother having complete responsibility over the children then there were with separate duties for each parent. There were hardly any couples where there was a completely equal distribution of responsibility, and there were no couples in which the father had complete responsibility.

Objective: This paper examines the major trends unraveling the gender division of family support and care that reached its peak in the mid- 20 th century, often called the ‘worker-carer’ or the ‘separate spheres’ model, by comparing the experiences of Sweden and the United States.
