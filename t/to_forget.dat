He takes to drinking alcohol excessively and is encouraged by his friend Bhagawan, who also introduces him to Chandramukhi, a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the Moors in 1946, following his military service. Over the 1946 and 1947 seasons, Wilhelm earned 41 wins with Mooresville. He later recalled being dropped from a Class D minor league team and having the manager tell him <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> about the knuckleball, but he persisted with it. The Boston Braves purchased Wilhelm from Mooresville in 1947. On November 20, 1947, Wilhelm was drafted by the New York Giants from the Braves in the 1947 minor league draft.|$|E

She runs into Donna (Retta), who at first views Ann as competition, but then offers her advice after witnessing Ann's awkward flirting. When Ann hears about Andy getting married from Leslie, she considers going home, as she and Andy dated for several years. Donna tells Ann <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> her past and enjoy herself in the present. Ann ends up {{having a good time}} at the mixer and gets several phone numbers.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to}} be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's zeal {{to uncover}} {{subversion}} and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers {{of people who}} were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.... These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> nor permit to reoccur.|$|E

5|$|The West Side Boys were unstable, {{possibly}} due to prolonged use of cannabis and cocaine, {{and their}} behaviour {{during the crisis}} was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless they told him why they had entered the West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed {{a problem for the}} British negotiators as the cannabis caused them <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful.|$|E
5|$|Following the Great Fire of Smyrna, Lefty and Desdemona {{must start}} life anew. When she is 14years old, Callie {{experiences}} a second birth to become Cal. To become a male, Callie peregrinates across the United States {{and becomes a}} midwife of her new life by teaching herself <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> what she has learned as a female. Likewise, Cal's grandparents undergo a transformation, becoming husband and wife instead of brother and sister. Middlesex delves into the concept of identity, including how it is formed {{and how it is}} administered. The immigrant predicament is a metaphor and synecdoche for Calliope's hermaphroditic condition; Callie's paternal grandparents become Americanized through the amalgamation of the elements of heredity, cultural metamorphoses, and probability. Callie's maternal grandfather, Jimmy Zizmo, undergoes a rebirth when he transforms from a bootlegger into Fard Muhammad, a Muslim minister.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> the Nazi past.|$|E

40|$|Across 3 {{experiments}} {{we examined}} the interplay of part-list cuing and forgetting, employing 3 different methods <b>to</b> induce episodic <b>forgetting</b> { list-method directed forgetting, context-dependent forgetting, and proactive interference. For each form of forgetting, participants were asked at test to recall the target items of a previously studied list, in the presence or {{the absence of the}} list's remaining items serving as retrieval cues. We found such part-list cuing <b>to</b> amplify the <b>forgetting</b> in proactive interference but <b>to</b> diminish the <b>forgetting</b> in list-method directed forgetting and context-dependent forgetting. These results show that the effects of part-list cuing on forgotten memories depend critically on the circumstances surrounding the forgetting. If the forgetting reflects impaired access to the original encoding context, as has been suggested in list-method directed forgetting and context-dependent forgetting (but not in proactive interference), part-list cues improve access <b>to</b> <b>forgotten</b> memories; if the forgetting does not reflect such a contextual effect, no such beneficial effects emerge and access <b>to</b> <b>forgotten</b> memories may even be impaired...|$|R
5|$|Kōhei {{is living}} {{a normal life}} in high school with Mizuka, and gets to know five other girls {{throughout}} the story who he helps with their various personal problems. While Kōhei likes to joke and tease these girls, deep down he is nice to girls and genuinely wants to help them. In the story, Kōhei is able to form intimate relationships with the six heroines: Mizuka Nagamori, Rumi Nanase, Misaki Kawana, Mio Kouzuki, Mayu Shiina, and Akane Satomura. While a given relationship will start out well, before long those around him start <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> him as he begins to retreat further into the Eternal World. If Kōhei forms a strong bond {{with one of the}} girls, she alone remembers him even after he leaves to the Eternal World. This ensures his eventual return one year later when he and the girl reunite.|$|E

Kotarou's aging is also slowed as a consequence. Kotarou falls into a coma, and he is administered an amnesiac drug <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> about Gaia and Guardian. By the time he wakes up, Kotori is in junior high school, and Kotarou later graduates junior high with Kotori. He goes on to spend time in high school with the occult research society as shown before. In a different timeline when he encounters Kagari, Kotarou lets her go.|$|E

Rather than leave the club like {{teammates}} Joe Cole, Frédéric Kanouté and Jermain Defoe, Carrick stayed with West Ham during their first season back in First Division. During the 2003–04 season, West Ham finished fourth on the final day to ensure a place in the play-offs. However, they lost 1–0 in the final to Crystal Palace and were denied a return to the top flight. Carrick was included in the PFA First Division Team of the Year for the season.|$|E
5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E
