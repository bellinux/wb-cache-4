5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} {{the logic of}} the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices and lead <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also lead <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in poaching.|$|E

5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but {{it is unlikely that}} the pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E

5|$|Another {{development}} {{that lead to}} the shift to modern globalization was the development of a more politicized system. Proto-globalization period marked a steady expansion of larger states from the Indonesian islands to northern Scandinava. The settlement of these individuals made it easier for governments to tax, develop an army, labor force, and create a sustainable economy. The development and streamlining of these cultural aspects lead <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in peripheral players in the game of globalization. The stable legal institutions developed in the late proto-globalization and early modern globalization period established economic advances, intellectual property rights (more predominantly in England), general geographical stability, and generational societal improvement.|$|E
5|$|Around 10:00pm {{local time}} on 4January, {{the centre of}} Tropical Cyclone Helen made {{landfall}} near Channel Point. As it moved ashore, the storm developed an eye; however, this feature began breaking apart once overland and the eyewall merged into the system's feeder bands. Roughly 12hours after landfall, Helen weakened to a tropical low before moving over the Gulf of Carpentaria late on 5January. Due <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in forward motion, the system was unable to regenerate sufficient convection to be reclassified a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall along the Cape York Peninsula. Once overland again, the remnants of Helen abruptly slowed and were last noted on 7January in the same region.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} neared the Florida Keys on September25, its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery. The reorganization led <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in intensity, and at about 1530UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall {{along the northern}} Gulf Coast. The slow motion of the storm led to an erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated at up to 35mph (55km/h), restricting outflow within {{the hurricane}} and confining the most intense convection to {{the eastern side of}} the circulation.|$|E
