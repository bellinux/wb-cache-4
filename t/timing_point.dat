50|$|All RFID timing systems {{incorporate}} a box housing the reader(s) with peripherals like a microprocessor, serial or ethernet communications and power source (battery). The readers {{are attached to}} one or more antennas that are designed for the particular operating frequency. In the case of low or medium frequencies these consist of wire loops incorporated into mats that cover the entire width of the <b>timing</b> <b>point.</b> For UHF systems the antennas consist of patch antennas that are protected in a matting system. The patch antennas may also be placed on stands or a finish gantry pointing towards the oncoming athlete. In most cases the distance between reader and antennas is restricted. Also more equipment is needed for events that require multiple timing points. Wider timing points require more readers and antennas. For active systems a simple wire loop is all that is needed since the transponder has its own power source and the loop serves as a trigger to turn on the transponder, then receive the relatively strong signal from the transponder. Therefore, active systems need less readers (or decoders) per <b>timing</b> <b>point</b> width.|$|E

Some sports merely measure endurance, or how long a competitor can race. Racetracks can host individual or team sports. Racetracks can feature rolling starts, or fixed starts, with associated equipment (starting blocks, cages, wheel traps etc.) They invariably feature a pit lane, and usually timing equipment.|$|R
40|$|Transit Schedule Design (TSD) in {{this work}} is defined as {{selecting}} the location of <b>timing</b> <b>points</b> and the slack times associated with them. The selection of these variables affects several cost components such as waiting time cost of boarding passengers, in-vehicle waiting time cost of through passengers and the operational cost of transit vehicles. To make a balance between these cost components, the TSD problem must be treated as an optimization problem where {{the objective is to}} select a set of <b>timing</b> <b>points</b> and corresponding slack times such that a generalized cost function is minimized. However, this problem takes a considerable amount of time to solve when there are numerous timing point/slack time options. This paper designs a practical algorithm based on the Ant algorithm optimization technique to find an optimal TSD. To check the performance of the algorithm, it is calibrated using the generated data from micro-simulation modelling of a bus route in Melbourne, Australia. The results demonstrate the ability of the developed algorithm to solve the problem for the modelled bus route in a manageable processing time. When the problem becomes more complex, i. e. more feasible schedule designs, the algorithm examines a lower portion of the feasible designs to reach the solution. The paper presents a range of practical benefits of the algorithm in bus route planning...|$|R

50|$|Costing about $25 million US$ to construct, {{the track}} uses 297,000 watts of track lighting, 62 water hydrants, 24 cameras, eight scoreboards, and 49 <b>timing</b> <b>points.</b> Generally open from October {{to the end}} of March annually, the track takes a total of 18 days to ice down to the {{required}} thickness needed to run sliding events. The track has 54 mi of piping with 110000 lb of ammonia refrigeration able to keep the track to -14 F. During operating season, a nine-man crew smooths the track every day. A total of 59 temperature probes are located throughout the track to ensure the ice temperature is properly monitored. Throughout the track, a $1 million retractable shading system protects the course from sun and snow, which reduces energy usage by 25 percent and the need to clear the track from snow.|$|R
40|$|Hunting for bargains {{has long}} been an {{important}} aspect of shopping behavior.

50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>point,</b> {{time point}} or timepoint {{is a public}} transit stop that a vehicle tries to reach at a {{scheduled}} time. A vehicle {{is not supposed to}} pass a timepoint until the schedule time has arrived. These stops are contrasted with all other stops on a scheduled route, for which the transit agency does not explicitly schedule an arrival/departure time. These other stops occur between timepoint stops, so their scheduled times are implicitly between those of the timepoints though not explicitly defined. At minimum, a timepoint allows regular passengers to estimate when a bus would get to a stop before or after a timepoint.|$|E
50|$|Transponder {{timing is}} used in {{sporting}} events around the world, including running races, marathons, triathlons, cycling and mountain biking competitions, in-line skating and cross-country skiing. Chips are either rented for use at a given event or purchased by participants for successive use at events timed with ChampionChip mats (the chips are incompatible with other timing systems). In either case, the serial number of a participant's chip is stored in a database for an event allowing the recorded times to be matched with participants' names. Although a chip might transmit its number several times while the athlete is crossing the mat, special software is used to eliminate all but the first time recorded for each chip at each <b>timing</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bus {{deregulation}} in Great Britain in 1985 allowed {{operators to}} determine routes and frequencies (except in London which were normally prepared {{by hand and}} few transport authorities had databases giving the name and locations of bus stops, and where they did {{they were in a}} locally developer format. Bus operators were required register their schedules with VOSA which they did on paper at <b>timing</b> <b>point</b> level together with a prose description of the route. An additional problem was that a single bus stop could be served by multiple bus operators who would typically use different names for the same bus stop. The Bus wars in the early period of deregulation added to the confusion and printer timetables at bus stops largely disappeared as bus companies cut costs.|$|E

30|$|Microscopic rail models, by contrast, {{portray the}} {{networks}} in great detail. They {{take into account}} information concerning tracks (e.g. the number, length and alignment of the block sections, speed, gradient), features of the signalling system (e.g. signal position, release points, permissive occupancy), layout of stations (e.g. number of tracks, length of platforms, shunting yards, points, vehicle depots), characteristics of the rolling stock (e.g. acceleration/deceleration features, tractive/effort diagram, total and adherence load), operational information (e.g. departure/arrival times, routes, alternative platforms, <b>timing</b> <b>points,</b> dwell times, connections between runs) as well as safety conditions. The variation of each attribute leads {{to the creation of}} a new node and hence necessarily of a new link. Such modelling of the infrastructure can be used for operational needs such as calculating travel times, drawing up timetables, detecting probable train conflicts, addressing disruption conditions and testing rescheduling strategies. Hence, they provide very accurate results, albeit requiring the collection of a large amount of data and considerable computational effort.|$|R

The intergrated Tabu Search and Genetic solution method is developed with respect to this specific problem. The third part deals with headways harmonization problem i. e. synchronization of different transit lines schedules on a common segments of routes. For the solution of this problem a new bilevel optimization method is proposed with zones harmonization at the bottom level and co-ordination of zones, by time buffers assigned to <b>timing</b> <b>points,</b> at the upper level. Finally, the synchronization problems are numerically illustrated by real-life examples of the public transport lines in Cracow...|$|R

40|$|A {{controlled}} {{drug delivery system}} (CDDS) {{that is capable of}} releasing right dose of drug in the alimentary canal at the prespecified time has been designed, fabricated and tested. This micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) -based CDDS, {{in the form of an}} electronic capsule, has four major components: a timer module for controlling drug release, a driving unit for releasing drug to the alimentary canal, a microfluidic chamber for drug reservoir, and a power supply. Of these four components, the timer module is the most critical one as it needs to provide precise <b>timing</b> <b>points</b> for drug release and must have a simple mechanism for setting up timing parameters externally.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{trajectory}} Optimization framework for whole-body motion planning through contacts. We demonstrate how the proposed approach {{can be applied to}} automatically discover different gaits and dynamic motions on a quadruped robot. In contrast to most previous methods, we do not pre-specify contact switches, <b>timings,</b> <b>points</b> or gait patterns, but they are a direct outcome of the optimization. Furthermore, we optimize over the entire dynamics of the robot, which enables the optimizer to fully leverage the capabilities of the robot. To illustrate the spectrum of achievable motions, here we show eight different tasks, which would require very different control structures when solved with state-of-the-art methods. Using our trajectory Optimization approach, we are solving each task with a simple, high level cost function and without any changes in the control structure. Furthermore, we fully integrated our approach with the robot's control and estimation framework such that optimization can be run online. By demonstrating a rough manipulation task with multiple dynamic contact switches, we exemplarily show how optimized trajectories and control inputs can be directly applied to hardware.
