5000|$|Under some circumstances, {{and in some}} {{technical}} contexts, <b>transcluded</b> sections of text may not require strict adherence to the [...] "context neutrality" [...] principle, because the <b>transcluded</b> sections are capable of parameterization. Parameterization implies the ability to modify certain portions or subsections of a <b>transcluded</b> text depending on exogenous variables that can be changed independently. This is customarily done by supplying a <b>transcluded</b> text {{with one or more}} substitution placeholders. These placeholders are then replaced with the corresponding variable values prior to rendering the final <b>transcluded</b> output in context.|$|E

5000|$|Transclusion {{works better}} when <b>transcluded</b> {{sections}} of text are self-contained, {{so that the}} meaning {{and validity of the}} text is independent of context. For example, formulations like [...] "as explained in the previous section" [...] are problematic, because the <b>transcluded</b> section may appear in a different context, causing confusion. What constitutes [...] "context neutral" [...] text varies, but often includes things like company information or boilerplate.|$|E
50|$|An infobox may be {{implemented}} in another document by <b>transcluding</b> it into that document and specifying {{some or all of}} the attribute-value pairs associated with that infobox, known as parameterization.|$|R
50|$|Through {{techniques}} such as Ajax, scripts associated with an HTML document can instruct a web browser to modify the document in-place, {{as opposed to the}} earlier technique of having to pull an entirely new version of the page from the web server. Such scripts may <b>transclude</b> elements or documents from a server after the web browser has rendered the page, in response to user input or changing conditions, for example.|$|R
5000|$|... 3. Expansion : Pages in a MediaWiki {{are often}} built using templates, magic words, parser {{functions}} and tag extensions. To use the AST in a WYSIWYG editor, one would leave out expansion {{to see the}} unexpanded transclusion statements and parser function calls in the original page. However, for rendering the content e.g. as HTML page these must be processed to get the complete output. Moreover, pages used as templates can themselves <b>transclude</b> other pages which makes expansion a recursive process.|$|R
50|$|Other {{publishers}} {{may seek}} specifically {{to have their}} materials <b>transcluded</b> into other web sites, as {{in the form of}} web advertising, or as widgets like a hit counter or web bug.|$|E
50|$|A popular Front End Framework {{known as}} AngularJS {{developed}} and maintained by Google has a directive callend ng-transclude {{that marks the}} insertion point for the <b>transcluded</b> DOM of the nearest parent directive that uses transclusion.|$|E
50|$|Baeza-Yates and King {{say that}} some editors find {{templates}} such as infoboxes complicated, as the template may hide text about a property or resource that the editor wishes to change; this is exacerbated by chained templates, that is templates <b>transcluded</b> within other templates.|$|E
40|$|WARP is a Web-based dynamic spatial {{hypertext}} {{that runs}} in a Web browser. WARP includes the ability to <b>transclude</b> other spatial hypertexts as collections. WARP also enables annotation and other content manipulation to be preserved in personal reading sessions. WARP uses a variety of presentation adaptations to contextualize the spatial hypertextâ€™s display. In particular WARP uses a variable number of models to guide adaptation in response to multiple relevant factors. Behaviors in WARP help preserve perceptual structures that may be lost due to adaptation and user interaction...|$|R
50|$|Santa Barbara {{is located}} in the middle of Cilento and <b>transcluded</b> into its {{national}} park, 3 km south of Ceraso, on the provincial road from Vallo della Lucania to Ascea, and nearby the green area of Gelbison mountain. It counts a little locality named Isca nearby the little river Fiumarella.|$|E
50|$|Located in {{the middle}} of Cilento and <b>transcluded</b> into its {{national}} park, Piano Vetrale is a hill village that spans on a ridge upon the valley of Alento river's source. It is divided into the quarters of Piano (west) and Vetrale (east), contiguous and divided by a little valley, named Vallone di Sabato.|$|E
50|$|Regional Legislative Decree 15/2012/A (2 April 2012), which {{approved}} the legal regime for {{conservation of nature}} and biodiversity, <b>transcluded</b> the Azorean legal order, the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive, while repealing the Regional Legislative Decree 15/2007/A (25 June 2007), incorporating the new legal framework for the Protected Areas of the Azores.|$|E
50|$|Located in {{southern}} Cilento and <b>transcluded</b> into its national park, Massicelle is a hill village that spans {{on the national}} road SR447/A, 4 km south of Futani and 4 km west of Abatemarco. It is 6 km from Montano Antilia, 7 from Cuccaro Vetere, 16 from Vallo della Lucania, and 17 from Palinuro and the Cilentan Coast.|$|E
50|$|Templates are {{structured}} documents containing attribute-value pairs. They are defined with parameters, to which are assigned values when <b>transcluded</b> on an article page. The {{name of the}} parameter is delimited from the value by an equals sign. A class of templates known as infoboxes is used on Wikipedia to collect and present a subset of information about its subject, usually on the top (mobile view) or top right-hand corner (desktop view) of the document.|$|E
50|$|Located in {{the middle}} of Cilento and <b>transcluded</b> into its {{national}} park, Villa Littorio is a hill village above the Sammaro river valley, on a little ravine upon the river Pietra. It is 5,5 km far from Laurino, Piaggine and Valle dell'Angelo, 9 from Bellosguardo, 10 from Sacco, 17 from Roscigno and 85 from Salerno. Situated in the northernmost area of its municipality, it is 26 km far from Pruno, the other and the southernmost hamlet of Laurino.|$|E
5000|$|The example above {{describes}} a person, {{based on the}} FOAF vocabulary. First, the two JSON properties [...] and [...] and the type [...] are mapped to concepts in the FOAF vocabulary {{and the value of}} the [...] property is specified to be of the type , i.e., it is specified to be an IRI in the context definition. Based on the RDF model, this allows the person described in the document to be unambiguously identified by an IRI. The use of resolvable IRIs allows RDF documents containing more information to be <b>transcluded</b> which enables clients to discover new data by simply following those links; this principle is known as Follow Your Nose.|$|E
50|$|An infobox {{may be used}} {{to improve}} the {{appearance}} of an article on Wikipedia; They are used on similar articles to ensure consistency of presentation by using a common format. Originally, infoboxes (and templates in general) were used for page layout purposes. The guideline Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Infoboxes has details of infoboxes. An infobox may be <b>transcluded</b> into an article by specifying the value for some or all of its parameters. The parameter name used must be the same as that specified in the infobox template, but any value may be associated to it. The name is delimited from the value by an equals sign. The parameter name may be regarded as an attribute of the article's subject.|$|E
50|$|On Wikipedia, an infobox is <b>transcluded</b> into {{an article}} by {{enclosing}} its name and attribute-value pairs within a double set of braces. The MediaWiki software on which Wikipedia operates then parses the document, for which the infobox and other templates are processed by a template processor. This is a template engine which produces a web document and a style sheet used for presentation of the document. This enables {{the design of the}} infobox to be separated from the content it manipulates; that is, the design of the template may be updated without affecting the information within it, and the new design will automatically propagate to all articles that transclude the infobox. Usually, infoboxes are formatted to appear in the top-right corner of a Wikipedia article in the desktop view, or at the top in the mobile view.|$|E
40|$|DynaTable is an {{extension}} for the MediaWiki software that pro-vides support for structured data. While tables and lists are popu-lar features in many wikis, they are currently unsupported as first-class entities. As a consequence, creating and editing tables is a manual, error-prone task. DynaTable allows wiki editors to create tables that can be displayed on and <b>transcluded</b> to multiple wiki pages, and can be partially displayed based on different criteria. ...|$|E

Additional attributes such as title or derived chemical attributes such as a SMILES descriptor are added to improve the indexing of the resulting document collection. Conformance tests for the popular Web browsers are reported. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Transclusion is {{a concept}} that allows users to reuse {{document}} fragments from different source pages, not by duplicating it, but by including a reference to the original work. Thus, transclusion provides an interesting platform for authors to quote text from other documents in a way such that the quoted text can be compared alongside its original context, and changes in the original document are reflected automatically in the user document. Several researchers have partially implemented transclusion using various techniques and technologies. The issue of transcluding text from a dynamic source page still persists because dynamic content changes have not been reflected. This research was based on finding a solution to this problem. Encrypted <b>transcluded</b> text, along with its reference, was stored in the user 2 Ì† 7 s document. Using this encrypted message, a document fragment was located in the dynamic source page such that encryption of that fragment matched most closely to the recorded encrypted message. This returned document fragment ensured that changes in the original source documents were reflected in the user 2 Ì† 7 s document. A test set was created with a modified source file, <b>transcluded</b> text, number, nature, and percentage change in the source file. The expected outcome, and the document fragment returned based on the algorithm, were used to determine the accuracy of the algorithm. The average accuracy of the algorithm obtained for the entire test set was found to be 0. 92. Moreover, for 60...|$|E
