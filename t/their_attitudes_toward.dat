5|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} to be representative of the Polish nation, its members being recruited from all parties and social classes (the only notable exception being communists sent by the Soviets, and the Soviet-created People's Army). The Home Army's growth was largely based on integrating, into its ranks, scores of smaller resistance organizations. Most other Polish underground armed organizations were incorporated into the Home Army (though they retained varying degrees of autonomy). The largest organization merged into the Home Army was the leftist Bataliony Chłopskie (Peasants' Battalions), about 1943-44. Parts of the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne (National Armed Forces) also came to be subordinated to the Home Army. As a result, individual Home Army units varied substantially in their political outlooks (notably in <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> ethnic minorities and toward the Soviets). The largest group that completely refused to join the Home Army was the pro-Soviet, communist People's Army, which at its height in 1944 numbered 30,000 people.|$|E

25|$|Medicine in the Middle Ages had {{its roots}} in pagan and folk practices. This {{influence}} was highlighted by the interplay between Christian theologians who adopted aspects of pagan and folk practices and chronicled them in their own works. The practices adopted by Christian medical practitioners around the 2nd century, and <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> pagan and folk traditions, reflected an understanding of these practices, especially humoralism and herbalism. The practices of Christian medicine stemmed from these pagan and folk practices.|$|E
25|$|Mopping-up {{operations}} required several years, but organized resistance {{ended when}} the Khalifa, who had escaped to Kurdufan, died in fighting at Umm Diwaykarat in November 1899. Many areas welcomed {{the downfall of}} his regime. Sudan's economy had been all but destroyed during his reign and the population had declined by approximately one-half because of famine, disease, persecution, and warfare. Millions had died in Sudan from foundation of the Mahdist state to its fall. Moreover, none of the country's traditional institutions or loyalties remained intact. Tribes had been divided in <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> Mahdism, religious brotherhoods had been weakened, and orthodox religious leaders had vanished.|$|E
500|$|In late May 1797 Adams' cabinet met {{to discuss}} French {{relations}} and {{to choose a}} special commission to France. [...] Adams initially proposed that John Marshall and Elbridge Gerry join Pinckney on the commission, but his cabinet objected to the choice of Gerry {{because he was not}} a strong Federalist. [...] Francis Dana was chosen instead of Gerry, but he declined to serve, and Adams, who considered Gerry one of the [...] "two most impartial men in America" [...] (he himself being the other), submitted his name to the United States Senate in Dana's stead without consulting his cabinet. [...] Adams, in introducing the matter to Congress, made a somewhat belligerent speech in which he called for a vigorous defense of the nation's neutrality and expansion of the United States Navy, but stopped short of calling for war against France. [...] Congress approved this choice of commissioners, and Adams instructed them to negotiate similar terms to those that had been granted to Britain in the Jay Treaty. [...] The commissioners were also instructed to refuse loans, but to be flexible in the arrangement of payment terms for financial matters. [...] Marshall left for Europe in mid-July to join Pinckney, with Gerry following a few weeks later. [...] The political divisions in the commission's makeup were reflected in <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> the negotiations: Marshall and Pinckney, both Federalists, distrusted the French, while Gerry (who was then opposed to political parties) was willing to be flexible and unhurried in dealing with them.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Parents have an {{important}} role in making decisions about their child′s oral health. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine parental awareness of their children′s oral health maintenance and <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> dental treatment. Materials and Methods: Total 284 parents from different socioeconomic groups participated in the study. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire addressing various aspects of knowledge and <b>attitude</b> of parents <b>toward</b> oral health and treatment modalities. Results: Awareness among parents was significantly lower in low socioeconomic group. <b>Their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> dental treatment differed significantly in which only 53 % parents from high socioeconomic group preferred going to the pediatric dentist. Conclusion: The level of awareness among parents is relatively low and there is need for the implementation of oral health awareness programs for parents to change <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> dental treatment of their children...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} the <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> occupational therapy and life satisfaction {{in patients with}} schizophrenia. Seventy-three inpatients with schizophrenia were asked questions about their life satisfaction, <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> occupational therapy, and their desire to be discharged. The scores for life satisfaction were high, particularly regarding satisfaction about their environment. In contrast, the satisfaction scores for interpersonal relationships were relatively low. In answer to the questions regarding <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> occupational therapy, 62 patients felt that occupational therapy was effective. This suggests that the study subjects regarded occupational therapy {{as a form of}} treatment for their disease. The number of patients who participated in occupational therapy with an active attitude was 35, with an inactive attitude was 30, and with a rejective attitude was 8. There was a significant relationship between the <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> occupational therapy and the desire to be discharged. 　These findings indicate that many inpatients with schizophrenia regard occupational therapy as a form of treatment. Their desire to be discharged affected <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> participation in occupational therapy. Therefore, it is possible to improve life satisfaction through occupational therapy in such patients...|$|R

2500|$|In a {{study done}} at Old Dominion University, Thomas F. Cash, Julie R. Ancis and Melissa D. Strachan studied college women and <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> gender, feminist {{identity}} and body image. [...] "Relative to men, women are considerably more psychologically invested in their appearance. Moreover, women's poor evaluations of and stronger investments in their looks potentiate greater body-image dysphoria in women's daily lives." [...] A contributing factor in this scenario that leads women to greater objectification of their bodies are the images that are seen throughout media. Women who are portrayed in the media often possess unattainable beauty. [...] "Furthermore, the social construct of femininity is partially tied to perceived beauty, as evinced by the 'what is beautiful sex-typed' stereotype." [...] These internalized ideals along with the pursuit for this unattainable beauty of one's body image can lead to body dysmorphic disorder, body objectification, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and other related psychological difficulties.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2005 survey {{commissioned}} by Anti-Defamation League from New York in 12 European countries, asking about selective stereotypes among 500 callers each, Polish respondents averaged 52% at question #1, 43% at #2, 43% at #3, 52% at #4 and 39% at #5 (the highest) asked if [...] "The Jews {{are responsible for}} the death of Christ", with the lowest percentage of believers in [...] "anti-Israel sentiment" [...] (21% at question #7) among all of the 12 countries surveyed. According to a Polish survey conducted in 2005, by CBOS institute (target of critical evaluations themselves by the media), in which Poles were asked to assess <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> 32 nationalities representing different European and non-European countries, 45% claimed to feel antipathy towards Jews (steadily decreasing) with 18% to feel sympathy (fluctuating by up to 10 percentage points annually; in 1997 it was 28%), while 29% felt impartial and 8% were undecided. Those surveyed were asked to express their feeling on the scale from −3 (strong antipathy) to +3 (strong sympathy). The average score for attitude towards Jews was −0.67 in that year. In the CBOS survey from 2010, antipathy decreased to 27%, and sympathy rose to 31% (down from 34% in 2008). The average score for attitude was +0.05 at that time.|$|E

40|$|Two {{hundred and}} twenty-six {{heterosexual}} participants (115 women and 111 men) {{were asked to}} indicate <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> gender-roles, <b>their</b> perceived similarities with gay men, and <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> gay men (i. e., sexual prejudice). As expected, male participants showed more sexual prejudice than female participants, and perceived dissimilarities were related to a greater sexual prejudice. Support for gender-roles was related to sexual prejudice for male participants, but not for female participants. More interestingly, the three-way interaction suggested that perceived similarities moderated the link between gender-roles and sexual prejudice among heterosexual men, but not among heterosexual women. Attitude in favor of traditional gender-roles was related to sexual prejudice for male participants who perceived gay men as different, but not for those who perceived gay men as similar. These findings are discussed in terms of the defensive function of men's <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> homosexuality as a result of threat to masculinit...|$|R
