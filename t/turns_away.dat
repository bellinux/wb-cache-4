5|$|The {{story begins}} {{on a cold}} and bleak Christmas Eve in London, seven years {{after the death of}} Ebenezer Scrooge's {{business}} partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an old miser, hates Christmas and refuses an invitation to Christmas dinner from his nephew Fred. He <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> two men who seek a donation from him in order to provide food and heating for the poor, and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.|$|E
5|$|Then, SR 78 intersects with SR 115 east of Brawley, running {{concurrently}} {{with it for}} a brief distance. Shortly {{after passing}} through the small community of Glamis, the road turns northeast and eventually north towards Blythe, passing near the Chocolate Mountain Naval Reserve. As it nears the Colorado River and the Arizona border, SR78 briefly passes through Cibola National Wildlife Refuge before entering the community of Palo Verde, where the river <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from the highway and SR78 enters Riverside County.|$|E
5|$|Although US-89 {{follows the}} I-70 freeway from Sevier to Salina, the old {{alignment}} {{can still be}} driven, and is state-maintained north of Elsinore as SR-258, SR-118 (which overlaps I-70 Business through Richfield), SR-24, and US-50. Both highways stay mainly in the west half of the Sevier River's valley, with the faster I-70/US-89 bypassing the communities that the surface road passes through. Just south of Salina, I-70 curves to the east, rising alongside Salina Creek, and US-89 exits into downtown Salina, where it rejoins its pre-freeway alignment. US-50 overlaps US-89 between I-70 and Salina, following I-70 east and a separate alignment northwest from the area; the short Interstate 70 Business also uses this roadway as a business spur from I-70 to the city. North of Salina, US-89 bypasses Redmond (SR-256 follows the former route through the town) and passes through Centerfield to Gunnison, where it meets SR-28 and finally <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from the Sevier River.|$|E

5|$|PA106 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US11 {{in the community}} of Kingsley, Pennsylvania. The route heads to the southeast, paralleling US11 through forestry until the intersection with Jeffers Road, where it <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from US11 and enters fields. The route makes several curves to the southeast and east, crossing through several large fields and industries. The route keeps turning to the southeast, re-entering the deep woods and passing a large pond near West Lenox. In West Lenox, PA106 passes through forestry and residences until leaving the community for more forestry. After paralleling Creek Road for a distance, PA106 enters the small community of Lenox, where the highway intersects PA92 near some industry. A short distance later, the highway interchanges with I-81 at Interchange211. After I-81, PA106 continues paralleling the interstate through forestry. The highway continues eastward, paralleling Stone Road into East Lenox, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Ranch Road 1 {{begins at}} US 290 {{on the west}} side of Stonewall, as a two-lane, paved road. The highway follows along the south bank of the Pedernales River around the town's north side and intersects RM 1623 on the town's east side. The route {{continues}} along the river briefly passing through a narrow southwestern portion of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, before entering Lyndon B Johnson State Park and Historic Site. The route crosses the length of the state park at its northern edge along the riverbank and exits the park before intersecting PR 49, which crosses the river accessing the national historic site. After crossing into Blanco County, the route <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from the riverbank to the southeast returning to US 290 west of Hye. Although the road is located in the Texas Hill Country, the road only encounters gentle grades within the channel of the Pedernales River.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{into the}} wide sweep of St Ives Bay, where many walkers drop {{down onto the}} sands at low tide, the path follows {{the line of the}} sand dunes or Towans as they are known here. This area was used for {{explosives}} manufacture for many years, the sand being ideal for absorbing any accidental explosions. The Towans are interrupted by two rivers, the small Red River at the north end, and the larger River Hayle and its estuary towards the south. Although narrow, the estuary is tidal and fast flowing due to the large expanse of mud flats and docks that lie behind the Towans, so the path <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from St Ives Bay to go round via Hayle. The water is crossed using an old railway bridge and then the old Hayle Railway is followed into the town centre then the A30 road to Griggs Quay where quieter roads bring the Path around to {{the west side of the}} tidal mud flats. Views of the birdlife can be had from Carnsew Pool at Hayle and from the area around Lelant Saltings railway station, although the official path is slightly inland on the A3074 road through Lelant village, regaining the coast by crossing golf links to reach the last of the Towans above Porth Kidney Sands.|$|E

2500|$|Turning away: [...] "Apostasy is also pictured as {{the heart}} <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> from God (Jeremiah 17:5-6) and righteousness (Ezekiel 3:20).

Following the Lord or journeying with him {{is one of the}} chief images of faithfulness in the Scriptures... The... Hebrew root (swr) is used to picture those who have <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> and ceased to follow God ('I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> from me,' 1 Samuel 15:11)... The image of <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> from the Lord, who is the rightful leader, and following behind false gods is the dominant image for apostasy in the OT." ...|$|R

25|$|Raising the forelegs {{and holding}} the abdomen to one side {{are by no means}} {{specific}} to courtship.

In these situations, however, the spider with its forelegs raised and waving backs off while facing the moving object and, when 5–8cm away, <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> and flees.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly, all is dark. The transport's {{headlights}} flicker back on, illuminating walls swarming {{with thousands}} of beetles.

The transport stalls for a moment as another oncoming transport can be seen about to cross the bridge, which <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> just before reaching it. The transport then accelerates across the bridge which sways and jostles under its weight. The massive stone face of Mara shoots beams from its eye, attempting to destroy the bridge. The transport makes it safely across then turns sharply to the right.|$|E

The guests are depicted as ludicrously half-Westernised. During a private moment, Satoko and Kiyoaki embrace, but suddenly Satoko <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> and spurns him, calling him childish. Infuriated, Kiyoaki tells Iinuma what has happened, and the tutor responds with a story which makes him realise that Satoko did indeed read the letter {{she was supposed to}} burn. He concludes that she has been leading him on all along in order to humiliate him.|$|E
25|$|Salvation is {{available}} through Jesus' work on the cross and is a gift from God made possible by grace through faith and not by human works. The PCG believes {{it is possible to}} lose one's salvation if one <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from God. After salvation, a Christian can receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The evidence of this baptism is speaking in other tongues. It believes in the doctrine of sanctification as a definite and progressive work of grace. It believes heaven and hell are real places. Heaven is for those who have received the gift of salvation, and hell is for those who have not.|$|E
25|$|Just {{north of}} Rutherford Road, NY310 <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from the Grasse River, {{proceeding}} northeast towards Trout Brook. At the junction with Planty Road, NY310 and Trout Brook begin running alongside each other, entering a large junction with CR38 (MadridNorfolk Road) and CR44 (NorfolkChamberlain Corners Road). NY310 continues northeast from this junction without the moniker, crossing from Madrid {{into the town}} of Norfolk. After a couple of miles, the route crosses a junction with Stark Road and enters the hamlet of Raymondville. In Raymondville, NY310 becomes a two-lane residential road as it approaches the Raquette River. Running northeast, NY310 enters a junction with CR39 and NY56, a large junction marking the northern terminus of NY310.|$|E
