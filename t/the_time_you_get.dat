500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} {{a message of}} female strength, the song lyrics were described as [...] "goofy" [...] and [...] "fun" [...] by Larry Katz from the Boston Herald. Reading [...] "Just like the Calgon commercial / I really gotta get up out of here", Carey tells her lover that she is leaving him, making a [...] "clever" [...] reference to a commercial. In regards to the latter lyrics, Lawrence Farber from the Windy City Times wrote [...] "they are a playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple." [...] She then sings [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> this message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll be on my way," [...] establishing that the relationship is over, and that he shouldn't even try to mend the situation. She also makes reference to his infidelity, [...] "with this one and that one / By the pool, on the beach, in the streets." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Dupri described the song's composition: ...|$|E
500|$|Sahar Ghosh from Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{felt that}} the best songs on the EP were [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer", saying that [...] "the lyrics Madonna sang in 2001 [...] still (unfortunately) ring true today, but they acquire a new poignancy as they are sung by the boys in Glee Club. [...] But the best {{performance}} of the album is definitely 'Like a Prayer'. The talented voices of the Glee cast, backed by a full choir, masterfully carry the lyrics to greater heights." [...] Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly gave it an [...] "A" [...] rating, explaining [...] "Sue hilariously revises the spoken-word bit on 'Vogue', and the Glee guys give a surprisingly tender reading of 'What It Feels Like for a Girl'. Go ahead— open your heart." [...] David Hiltbrand from Star Tribune gave a negative review of the EP saying that [...] "things go downhill as soon as Jane Lynch starts camping up the spoken portion of 'Vogue'. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to 'Like a Virgin' and '4 Minutes', the songs sound overproduced and melodramatic, more show tune than disco." ...|$|E
500|$|The single's {{video was}} {{directed}} by Jake Nava, and contains numerous wardrobe changes by Carey in a storyline involving luxurious scenery in which the singer leaves her significant other. It is presented in one continuous shot, with no edits. The video begins with a TV screen and the word 'Mimi' appearing, while on the monitor, Dupri raps his introduction. As the television fades, Carey is then shown lying in a bathtub overflowing with water and rose petals, with her hair flowing {{over the side of}} the tub. Next, the camera follows down one floor of the mansion to find Carey, decked out in bright blue makeup and high heels, as she sings [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> this message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll be on my way," [...] into the phone. A short scene is then shown of her lover in a strip club, receiving the message Carey had sent him. As he reads it, he blows smoke into the screen, fading to reveal Carey dressed in a trench coat and dress, before grabbing her bag and heading out the door as she sings, [...] "So I packed up my Louis Vuitton / Jumped in your ride and took off." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{minute later}} the doctor appeared. [...] "I {{was just in}} the middle of a rubber, Dick, and if you have not an uncommonly good reason for calling me up I will make you smart for it, <b>the</b> first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> under my hands. Whom have we got here?" ...|$|R
50|$|It {{would be}} nice to have no {{uncertainty}} in case duration prediction. But, it is present. The problem is looking for a single number that is correct most of <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> won't <b>get</b> accurate estimates by using historical case duration data. Rather, from the historical data you'll get an assessment of the uncertainty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} I am," [...] {{returned}} the fun-loving Rover, kindly; [...] "you just see if <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> {{on the trail}} of that fellow who stole the four thousand dollars, and at <b>the</b> same <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> busy and {{make up for lost time}} with Minnie. Good-bye!" [...] and then he hung up the receiver, and a few minutes later was on board the train bound for the metropolis.|$|R
500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} from July 1993 to September 1993 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington, as according to Cornell [...] "there {{was never a}} decent studio in Seattle and now there's one with a Neve console, so it seemed obvious to use it". Bad Animals' resident engineer Adam Kasper, {{who went on to}} produce Soundgarden's following albums, assisted Beinhorn on the recording process. Soundgarden took the approach of recording one song at a time. The drum and bass parts were recorded first for each song, and then Cornell and Thayil would lay down their parts over top. Cornell said that getting to know Beinhorn contributed to the length of time Soundgarden spent working on the album. The band spent time experimenting with different drum and guitar sounds, as well as utilizing techniques such as layering, resulting in an expansive production sound. Cornell said, [...] "Michael Beinhorn was so into sounds. He was so, almost, anal about it, that it took the piss out of us a lot of the time... By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the sounds that you want to record the song, you're sick and tired of playing it." [...] Beinhorn tried to add many of his preferred musicians to mold the band's sound, in what Billboard described as [...] "weaning the band from brute force, giving it the impetus to invest in a more subtle power". For instance, prior to recording the vocals of [...] "Black Hole Sun", Beinhorn made Cornell listen to Frank Sinatra.|$|E
2500|$|On December 19, Duty offered Wise some {{cigarettes}} {{in exchange for}} allowing himself to be tied up to make the guards think {{that he had been}} taken hostage, with the goal of having Duty transferred into administrative security. The prosecutor's report stated that after tying Wise's hands and feet behind his back, Duty strangled him to death with a shoelace. Duty then wrote a letter to Wise's mother Mary, in which he stated: [...] "Well by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> this letter you will already know that your son is dead. I know now because I just killed him an hour ago. Gee you'd think I'd be feeling some remorse but I'm not." [...] The letter was intercepted at the prison.|$|E
2500|$|Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald {{gave the}} film one star, commenting, [...] "There are enough laughs {{scattered}} throughout A Million Ways to Die in the West that while you're watching it, the movie {{seems like a}} passable comedy. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> home, though, you can barely remember the jokes." [...] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film's running time: [...] "Though the film is hardly laugh-free, its uneven jokes appear to have breezed through a very forgiving editing process." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal too found the film's length [...] "exhausting," [...] noting, [...] "Some of it sputters, settling for smiles instead of laughs, {{and much of it}} flounders while the slapdash script searches [...] for ever more common denominators in toilet humor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now don't be {{too sure}} of that, old man. I guess {{you want to}} keep your eyes open all <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> an' if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to thinkin' he can't do any harm, you'll find him jumpin' right down on you some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, Joe," [...] he said, [...] "that you are {{not tied}} down to that laundry. There are no strings on it. You can sell it any <b>time</b> and blow <b>the</b> money. Any <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> sick of it and want to hit the road, just pull out. Do what will make you the happiest." ...|$|R
50|$|The Westfjords {{have much}} of natural beauty and places that are worth a visit. To mention a few there is Litlibær in Skötufjörður {{a place that was}} built 1895. The place was rebuilt by National Museum of Iceland. During <b>the</b> summer <b>time</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> delicious waffels with whipped cream.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first time}} Albarn went to Mali, {{he was taken}} to a {{landfill}} where he saw people [...] "taking every little bit, a little bit of fabric to the fabric regenerators, or the metal and the cans to the ironsmiths and the aluminium recyclers, and it goes on and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to the road, they're selling stuff." [...] When Albarn went to a landfill outside London to record the sound of seagulls for the album, he noticed a [...] between the way the two countries dealt with rubbish. [...] "They've got more snakes... like adders, grass snakes, slow worms, toads, frogs, newts, all kinds of rodents, all kinds of squirrels, a massive number of squirrels, foxes, and obviously, seagulls. [...] This is part of the new ecology. And for the first time I saw the world in a new way. I've always felt, I'm trying to get across on this new record, the idea that plastic, we see it as being against nature but it's come out of nature. We didn't create plastic, nature created plastic. And just seeing the snakes like living in the warmth of decomposing plastic bags. They like it. It was a strange kind of optimism that I felt... but trying to get that into pop music is a challenge, anyway. But important." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then if you've got {{half the}} pluck you claim, show us {{a place where}} it can be done in shape," [...] {{answered}} Teddy, sharply. [...] "I'm here with nothing to do but settle matters. I'm going to stay in the town right along, and I can't be bothered with <b>you</b> all <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> best of me when we're where nobody'll interfere with us, I'll leave; an' if I get the best of you, why, then I'll get back my dollar, an' you'll have to behave yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Marcel Bidot {{was the son}} of {{a failed}} café owner, a former racing cyclist who then ran one of the clubs in his home town of Troyes, in the Champagne region.

He went {{training}} after work at 7pm.He turned professional in 1923 and at Alcyon earned 2,000 francs a month, ten times his pay at the bank.

5000|$|Lombardo's {{work has}} been an {{influence}} on many rock and heavy metal drummers. Per Möller Jensen of The Haunted cites Lombardo as a major influence, having grown up listening to Slayer; the band was a big influence on his style and The Haunted's. Suffocation drummer Mike Smith also cites Lombardo as an influence. Rocky Gray, {{former member of the}} alternative metal band Evanescence was influenced by Lombardo's choice of equipment; [...] "All those old school guys are all TAMA guys. Where I'm from, if you're in <b>the</b> big <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a TAMA drum set. You have to be good if you've got a TAMA set." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was remarked by Tolstoy, I think, {{that few}} {{intellectual}} men would really tolerate {{the world as}} it is if it were not for smoking and drinking. Even novelists have their moments of lucidity. Certainly these things soothe the restlessness in men's minds, deaden their sceptical sensibilities. And just at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when <b>you</b> were <b>getting</b> most dislodged--you gave them up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, {{there will}} be some other {{advantages}} beyond that of pay.

5000|$|To {{solve the}} maze, players had to collect keys called [...] "puzzle pegs" [...] that are {{designed}} as shapes to find their corresponding sockets. Only one peg can be held on to one at a time. After placing all the pegs correctly, the player is {{able to go on}} to the next level through a now unlocked door. As the levels advanced, the pegs begin to appear more similar to confuse the player. The pegs are placed randomly each <b>time</b> <b>the</b> game is re-booted.

50|$|You {{start out}} as the Germans with two {{missions}} involving the invasion of Poland in 1939. They are fairly easy, since the German tanks were far superior to any other tanks or weapons {{at that point in}} <b>time.</b> After <b>the</b> Poland missions, you have a mission against the French in Belgium. The difficulty begins to rise as the French had better tanks than the Poles and they also make use of anti-tank guns.Then, you have a mission as part of Operation Barbarossa, where you are part of the army advancing towards Moscow. Then you come to the final German mission: the attack on Stalingrad. For <b>the</b> first <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to use a Tiger tank and you also face more powerful Soviet tanks.|$|R
