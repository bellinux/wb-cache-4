5|$|The {{football}} team at Georgetown was first formed on November 1, 1874, with the earliest recorded games dating to 1887. By the 1940s, Georgetown {{had one of}} the better college {{football team}}s in America, and played in the 1941 Orange Bowl, where they lost 147 to Mississippi State. As <b>the</b> <b>college</b> <b>game</b> became more expensive after World War II, however, Georgetown's program began to lose money rapidly. The Hoyas last successful season was 1949, when they lost in the Sun Bowl against Texas Western. However the program was losing too much money, and on March 22, 1951, the university's president canceled the football program.|$|E

[...] He led the Badgers in goals (19) and points (27) as a junior in 2002–03 and was named the team's most {{valuable}} player.

[...] He was named {{the recipient of the}} Ivan B. Williamson Scholastic Award as the team's scholastic player of the year. He served as a tri-captain of the team in his final year and reached a double-digit goal total in each of his four seasons with the Badgers.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Jerry Hinnen of CBS Sports {{described}} it as [...] "the biggest upset {{of the past five}} years of college football", and {{described it}} as having [...] "set the table" [...] for an [...] "epically chaotic" [...] 2007 season as well as [...] "four years' worth of headline-making upsets to follow." [...] Dennis Dodd of CBS Sports said in 2012 that [...] "we may never see its likes again." [...] He said that the game [...] "reminded us why <b>the</b> <b>college</b> <b>game</b> is the best," [...] but felt that such a result would become more unlikely in the future, as many conferences are moving to increase to nine conference games, reducing the need to play FCS teams.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>college</b> <b>game</b> {{continued}} to grow, {{particularly in the}} South, bolstered by fierce rivalries such as the [...] "South's Oldest Rivalry", between Virginia and North Carolina and the [...] "Deep South's Oldest Rivalry", between Georgia and Auburn. Although before the mid-1920s most national powers came from the Northeast or the Midwest, the trend changed when several teams from the South and the West Coast achieved national success. Wallace William Wade's 1925 Alabama team won the 1926 Rose Bowl after receiving its first national title and William Alexander's 1928 Georgia Tech team defeated California in the 1929 Rose Bowl. College football quickly became the most popular spectator sport in the South.|$|E
500|$|The {{dominant}} form {{of football}} {{at the time}} was played at the collegiate level, but the upstart NFL received a boost to its legitimacy in 1925 when an NFL team, the Pottsville Maroons, defeated a team of Notre Dame all-stars in an exhibition game. A greater emphasis on the passing game helped professional football to further distinguish itself from <b>the</b> <b>college</b> <b>game</b> during the late 1930s. Football in general became increasingly popular following the 1958 NFL Championship game, a match between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants that is still referred to as the [...] "Greatest Game Ever Played". The game, a 23–17 overtime victory by the Colts, was seen by millions of television viewers and had a major impact on the popularity of the sport. This, along with the innovations introduced by the new American Football League (AFL) in the early 1960s, helped football to become the most popular sport in the United States by the mid-1960s.|$|E

2500|$|Holtz's lone {{foray into}} the {{professional}} ranks began when he was appointed as {{head coach of the}} New York Jets on February 10, 1976. He was selected over Johnny Majors, Darryl Rogers, and Marv Levy. Holtz resigned ten months later on December 9 with the Jets at 310 and one game remaining in the 1976 season. Upon his departure, he lamented, [...] "God did not put Lou Holtz on this earth to coach in the pros." [...] Holtz's jump to the NFL as head coach for only thirteen games with a 310 record before returning to <b>the</b> <b>college</b> <b>game</b> with Arkansas would be duplicated by Bobby Petrino 31 years later in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, he {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>college</b> <b>game</b> as the {{head coach of the}} South Carolina Gamecocks. [...] While his offenses were not as prolific as they had been at Florida, Spurrier similarly brought the South Carolina program to unprecedented levels of success, leading the Gamecocks to three of the four 10-win seasons in program history, as well as the school's only 11-win seasons, top-10 poll finishes, and its only SEC Championship Game appearance. On October 12, 2015, Spurrier announced that he was resigning as South Carolina's head coach, effective immediately, stating that he felt that the program was {{going in the wrong direction}} and it was time to [...] "fire myself".|$|E

2500|$|After {{retiring}} as a player, Spurrier {{returned to}} <b>the</b> <b>college</b> <b>game</b> in 1978 as an offensive assistant at Florida under head coach Doug Dickey. Dickey and his entire staff were fired after the season, and Spurrier {{served as the}} quarterbacks coach at Georgia Tech in 1979 under head coach Pepper Rodgers, who was also fired after the season. At his first two coaching stops, Spurrier had been primarily a position coach without play calling responsibilities. In 1980, Duke University head coach Red Wilson hired Spurrier as his offensive coordinator. His squads were seldom as talented as their opposition, so Spurrier created an innovative pass-based offensive system that broke several school and conference records over his three seasons as an assistant at the school. When asked in later years how he developed his offense, Spurrier has often stated that he [...] "learned it all at Duke University." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mack {{was widely}} praised in the {{newspapers}} for his intelligent and innovative managing, which earned him the nickname [...] "the Tall Tactician". He valued intelligence and [...] "baseball smarts," [...] always looking for educated players. (He traded away Shoeless Joe Jackson despite his talent because of his bad attitude and unintelligent play.) [...] "Better than any other manager, Mack understood and promoted intelligence as an element of excellence." [...] He wanted men who were self-directed, self-disciplined and self-motivated; his ideal player was Eddie Collins. [...] According to baseball historian Bill James, Mack was well {{ahead of his time}} in having numerous college players on his teams. [...] Several of his players went on to become well-respected college coaches. [...] Jack Coombs, the ace of Mack's 1910-11 champions, became the longtime coach at Duke. [...] Andy Coakley, who won 20 games for Mack's 1905 pennant winners, coached for over 30 years at Columbia, where he was the college coach for Lou Gehrig. [...] Dick Siebert, longtime coach at Minnesota, played for Mack from 1938 to 1945. [...] James believed that Mack's influence on the game, as great as it was, would have been even greater had <b>the</b> <b>college</b> <b>game</b> been more popular during the 1920s and 1930s, when Mack was at his peak.|$|E
2500|$|Rumors {{began to}} {{circulate}} {{alleging that the}} Buccaneers were a disorganized and confused organization, and returning veterans were promised that changes were forthcoming. It was pointed out {{that none of the}} team's administrative staff had any experience in their position, {{at the same time that}} a team of rookie players and coaches was being fielded. These problems were addressed with the firings and resignations of six coaches and administrators at the beginning of the year. Head coach John McKay used the opportunity to take control of more aspects of the organization, and selected replacements of his choosing. McKay was criticized over his handling of the players, and was accused of cutting veterans who could have helped the team, such as Ira Gordon, over ego conflicts. A perception arose that McKay was intolerant toward challenges to his authority, as he frequently cut players who argued with him, and surrounded himself with former USC players and staff. Concern that McKay preferred players who would keep their mouth shut, rather than players with talent, produced resentment among veterans who worried that their limited career spans would be spent with a losing team. Critics accused McKay of attempting a style of play that was more appropriate for <b>the</b> <b>college</b> <b>game,</b> and noted Don Shula's comment that preparing for the Buccaneers was like preparing to play USC. Reporters who covered the team indicated that McKay did not respond to the losing streak with the humor that it was hoped he would, but that he became an [...] "old grouch" [...] who complained about his coaching assistants, game-day officiating, and opposing coaches who he accused of running up the score. This was reflected in a bitter tone that had crept into McKay's trademark humor, with comments such as [...] "I keep a picture of O.J. Simpson by my side at all times to remind me of the days when I knew how to coach".|$|E
