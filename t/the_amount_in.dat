5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> the system because paracetamol may still be {{in the process of being}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E

5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E
5|$|For U.S. {{food and}} dietary {{supplement}} labeling purposes <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> a serving is {{expressed as a}} percent of Daily Value (%DV).

50|$|But {{the problem}} {{can also be}} {{resolved}} mathematically without assuming a maximum amount. Nalebuff (1989), Christensen and Utts (1992), Falk and Konold (1992), Blachman, Christensen and Utts (1996), Nickerson and Falk (2006), pointed out that if <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two envelopes have any proper probability distribution representing the player's prior beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two envelopes, then it is impossible that whatever <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> A=a <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first envelope might be, it would be equally likely, according to these prior beliefs, that the second contains a/2 or 2a. Thus step 6 of the argument, which leads to always switching, is a non-sequitur, also {{when there is no}} maximum to <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> envelopes.|$|R

5|$|The Provisional Government also {{included}} a judiciary. The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace. The Supreme Judge was elected by the people, but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if needed. This Supreme Court had original and appellate jurisdiction over legal matters, whereas the lower probate court and justice courts that were also created could only hear original jurisdictional matters when <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> controversy was less than $50 and did not involve land disputes. Some judges under the Provisional Government were Nathaniel Ford, Peter H. Burnett, Osborne Russell, Ira L. Babcock, and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} the dodo {{differed}} much {{from those of}} other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws. The upper bill was nearly {{twice as long as}} the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated {{along the length of the}} beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the frontal bone formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The sclerotic rings inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single fenestra (opening), as in other pigeons.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a conceptualization of information {{as related to}} the decision problems of the recipient. The orientation is toward a formal definition of behavioral elements in an individual's "purposeful state": specifically, these elements are his objectives, his valuation of each objective, his possible courses of action, the efficiency of each course of action in achieving each objective, and his probability of choice for each course of action. <b>The</b> <b>amount</b> of information <b>in</b> a purposeful state is explicitly {{defined in terms of}} the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action. <b>The</b> <b>amount</b> of information <b>in</b> a message is defined as the difference between <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> purposeful state following the message, and <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> purposeful state preceding <b>the</b> message. <b>The</b> <b>amount</b> of instruction <b>in</b> a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies of the available courses of action; and <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of motivation is defined in terms of the values of <b>the</b> objectives. <b>The</b> <b>amounts</b> of instruction and motivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>in</b> a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message. The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function of <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of information, <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of instruction, and <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of motivation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state. This concept can be generalized to express the value of the state to some other individual. ...|$|R
