25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} {{a specific type of}} currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to consumption taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the Tobin tax, Edgar L. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax and Spahn tax. The Automated Payment Transaction tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated by currency can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a brokerage fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> <b>applied</b> to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|Michigan and the University of Iceland for {{comments}} on an earlier draft of this paper. This paper analyzes the effect of personal income taxation on the sensitivity of executive compensation to company performance and the use of stock option and restricted stock grants underlying this sensitivity. The theoretical model predicts that, if a single tax rate applies to the entire compensation package, an increase in the tax rate weakly diminishes the equilibrium level of managerial effort and the after-tax pay-to-performance sensitivity, with the effect on the pre-tax pay-to-performance sensitivity being ambiguous. When salary and option gains are taxed at a higher rate than stock gains, tax changes also induce shifting among the individual compensation instruments. Interestingly, this differential taxation leads to a positive amount of stocks in the compensation contract {{even in the absence of}} any desire to incentivize the manager. In addition, an increase in the <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> <b>applied</b> to salary and option gains may increase the level of managerial effort in equilibrium.

40|$|Municipalities {{sometimes}} reform {{property tax}} schedules {{in an effort}} to increase suboptimal residential densities. One such approach is to reduce the <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> <b>applied</b> to building values and increase the <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> <b>applied</b> to land, known as a two-rate property tax (TPT). This paper evaluates the impact of a TPT on residential density in Nashville-Davidson County,Tennessee where a conventional property tax schedule prevails during 2006 – 2007. When land taxes are proportionally higher than taxes on structures, 1. 07 to 1 and 1. 25 to 1 for general and urban service districts, respectively, ex ante simulations suggest that housing density increases by 18 % in general services districts and 83 % in urban services districts. Key words: residential density, spatial lag probit, two-rate property tax. JEL codes: Q 24, R 14. Most municipalities in the United States collect residential real estate property taxes based on a percentage of total assessed property value. These policies place equal value on land and structures, but the taxation of build-ings or structures inflates the perceived cost of improvements, thereby discouraging site improvement and potentially reducing eco-nomic returns (Mathis and Zech 1982). Thus, the landowner can reduce their tax burden by developing projects that use relatively more land than structures. This behavior leads to lower than optimal residential densities (Skaburskis and Tomalty 1997). In response to suboptimal residential densities, researchers have investigated reducing tax rates applied to structures and increasing tax rates on land using a “two-rate property tax ” (TPT) as an alternative to plac-ing equal weight on land and structure taxes. ...|$|E
