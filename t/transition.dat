40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{parallelism}} between tonal <b>transitions</b> and musical note <b>transitions</b> in Thai pop songs based on the data from 30 current pop songs. The results suggest that there is a statistically significant parallelism between tonal <b>transitions</b> and musical note <b>transitions.</b> Interestingly, the results show that both contour tones, RISING and FALLING, typically pattern with HIGH with respect to the mapping between tonal <b>transitions</b> and note <b>transitions.</b> Nevertheless, when two FALLING occur consecutively, the offset of the second one is used for mapping. Our results seem to find further support for decomposability of contour tones in Thai.
