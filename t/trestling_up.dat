500|$|In {{order to}} move logs from the plateau above the Lower river, Adams River Lumber {{constructed}} several flumes. [...] The flumes were elevated wooden troughs filled with water that floated logs down to the valley bottom. [...] The largest of these was at Bear Creek. [...] It incorporated <b>trestles</b> <b>up</b> to [...] high and was capable of moving [...] of logs per month. [...] It was the largest flume in North America at its peak. [...] The structures were dismantled after the areas became logged out.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} bridges along the {{abandoned}} route also remain {{to this day}} as well, the most notable {{of which is the}} causeway over Gasparilla Sound that connected the line to the island. The southernmost trestle is now a fishing pier as is the northernmost <b>trestle</b> <b>up</b> to the abandoned drawbridge tower. [...] The rest of the causeway and trestles, which remain just to the south of the Boca Grande Causeway, are now completely abandoned. The bascule span on the northernmost trestle was removed and the center trestle's swing span is locked open to facilitate boat traffic.|$|R
6000|$|Above the darky's head, {{elevated}} trains roared on the Fifty-third Street <b>trestle,</b> and <b>up</b> Broadway streaked a stripped motor-car, {{all steel chassis}} and grease-mottled board {{seat and}} lurid odor of gasoline. But sparrows splashed in the pools of sunshine; in a lull the darky's voice came again, chanting passionately, [...] "In de spring, spring, spring!" [...] and Carl clamored: [...] "I've {{got to get out}} to-day. Terrible glad it's a half-holiday. Wonder if I dare telephone to Ruth?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the story}} takes place in 1907 in the United States of America. Osgood Hennessy, owner of the Southern Pacific Railway, has hired the Van Dorn Detective Agency to help catch a murdering saboteur nicknamed [...] "The Wrecker," [...] who has wrecked Southern Pacific trains through a route in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon using TNT, dynamite, and other explosives. He hires accomplices of hobos from the down and out to attack the {{railroad}} in any way, including blowing <b>up</b> <b>trestles,</b> ripping <b>up</b> rail and ties, cutting power lines and communication systems, and collapsing tunnels on workers, leaving them to suffocate or be crushed. It is discovered that after [...] "The Wrecker" [...] is done with his men, he brutally murders each one himself. [...] "The Wrecker" [...] traverses the vast spaces of the American West {{as if he had}} wings, striking wherever he pleases, causing untold damage and loss of human life.|$|R
50|$|The Trevorton Bridge was {{a wooden}} covered bridge that crossed the Susquehanna River. It was erected between Herndon in Northumberland County and Port Trevorton in Snyder County, Pennsylvania. The bridge was 3460 ft long, with a 1400 ft <b>trestle</b> leading <b>up</b> to it. It was {{originally}} {{built as a}} railroad bridge by the Trevorton and Susquehanna Railroad and, in 1885, the bridge was adapted {{for use as a}} road bridge as well as for trains. The bridge was most often used to cross the Susquehanna by cattle. The continuous crossing of cattle endangered the already weakened bridge (weakened from acid in the bark the pine used to construct the bridge). The bridge was eventually dismantled for fear that it collapse.|$|R
5000|$|After the new {{bridge was}} built, the old bridge was {{demolished}} but the western approach (the <b>trestle</b> span <b>up</b> {{to the original}} truss spans) was purchased by the County of San Mateo in 1968 for the nominal sum of [...] and retained as the 4055 ft Werder Fishing Pier, which was {{known as one of}} the best places to catch sharks in San Francisco Bay. San Mateo County operated Werder Pier under a lease agreement with Caltrans, which stated that Caltrans may temporarily revoke the lease in order to perform use the pier as a staging area for repairs to the 1967 span, and that San Mateo County must maintain the pier and keep it open for public use for twenty-five years.|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s, the Canadian Robert Dollar Company of Dollarton logged {{the lower}} slopes of Burke Mountain with a steam railway. The peak was called Dollar Mountain by early residents. Rail lines snaked in from Port Moody along the sidehill of Westwood slope, across the Coquitlam River on a <b>trestle</b> bridge and <b>up</b> to the timber on Burke Mountain. As {{the area was}} {{depopulated}} for many years, bush logging and gravel mining continued with vigour.|$|R
25|$|Several BFS {{personnel}} were honoured for their work. Jack Owen, a BFS officer and former Royal Marine, was awarded an MBE in 1963 following a tense incident at Bohldamm near Lüchow in Lower Saxony. The border ran along a stream, but its precise location was disputed. The West Germans considered {{the far side}} of the stream to be the location of the border, while the East Germans regarded the border as lying in the middle of the stream. An overgrown cobbled footbridge crossed the stream but was blocked by the East Germans with a movable barbed wire trestle barrier situated at the far end of the bridge. One day in 1962 the East Germans moved the barrier to the middle of the bridge, despite protests from West German border guards and customs officials. The situation escalated when the East Germans warned that they would shoot anyone who touched the <b>trestle</b> and backed <b>up</b> their warning by emplacing machine guns and armoured cars on their side of the stream. The West Germans called up a BFS platoon and a British Army section to back them up. Owen called the East Germans' bluff by walking onto the bridge with two British soldiers and carrying the trestle back to the eastern side of the stream. He then stood by it for the next eight hours to make sure that it would not be moved again.|$|R
2500|$|Weaving was {{introduced}} into West Yorkshire in {{the reign of}} Edward III, and Cistercians, such as at Kirkstall, were certainly engaged in sheep farming. Leland (date) records the organised trading of cloth on the bridge over the Aire, {{at the foot of}} Briggate, at specified times and under set conditions. The traded woollen cloth was predominantly of home manufacture, produced in the villages and settlements surrounding Leeds. (Bradford, by contrast, was the centre of the worsted cloth trade.) There was, however, a fulling mill at Leeds by 1400, and cloth dying may also have been an early centralised activity. Before the time of Defoe's visit to Leeds, cloth trading outstripped the capacity of the bridge, and moved instead to <b>trestle</b> tables in <b>up</b> to two rows on each side of Briggate. Defoe mentions that at this time Leeds traders went all over the country, selling cloth on credit terms; and that an export trade existed. Ralph Thoresby was involved in the establishment of the first covered cloth market, when with others he secured the permission of the 3rd Viscount Irwin, holder of Manor of Leeds, to erect the White Cloth Hall. The fact of Wakefield having erected a trading hall in 1710 was almost certainly a driver of change. The new hall opened on 22 May 1711, and lasted for 65 years before being removed to a new site in the Calls, and later {{at the time of the}} railways to the present trading hall. In 1758 a coloured or mixed cloth hall was built near Mill Hill – a quadrangular building [...] by , with capacity for 1800 trading stalls, initially let at 3 guineas per annum, but later trading at a premium of £24 per annum. The hall was pulled down in 1899 to make way for the new General Post Office; the last White Cloth hall in 1896 to make way for the Metropole Hotel.|$|R
