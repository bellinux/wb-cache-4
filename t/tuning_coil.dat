25|$|The antenna {{converts}} {{the energy}} in the electromagnetic radio waves to an alternating electric current in the antenna, which {{is connected to the}} <b>tuning</b> <b>coil.</b> Since in a crystal radio all the power comes from the antenna, {{it is important that the}} antenna collect as much power from the radio wave as possible. The larger an antenna, the more power it can intercept. Antennas of the type commonly used with crystal sets are most effective when their length is close to a multiple of a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves they are receiving. Since the length of the waves used with crystal radios is very long (AM broadcast band waves are 182-566 m or 597–1857ft. long) the antenna is made as long as possible, from a long wire, in contrast to the whip antennas or ferrite loopstick antennas used in modern radios.|$|E

2500|$|By varying {{either the}} {{inductor}} (L) or the capacitance (C), the circuit {{can be adjusted}} to different frequencies. [...] In inexpensive sets, the inductor was made variable via a spring contact pressing against the windings that could slide along the coil, thereby introducing a larger or smaller number of turns of the coil into the circuit. Thus the inductance could be varied, [...] "tuning" [...] the circuit to the frequencies of different radio stations. Alternatively, a variable capacitor is used to tune the circuit. [...] Some modern crystal sets use a ferrite core <b>tuning</b> <b>coil,</b> in which a ferrite magnetic core is moved {{into and out of}} the coil, thereby varying the inductance by changing the magnetic permeability (this eliminated the less reliable mechanical contact).|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, in {{improved}} receiver circuits, {{in order to}} match the antenna impedance to the receiver's impedance, the antenna was connected across {{only a portion of}} the tuning coil's turns. This made the <b>tuning</b> <b>coil</b> act as an impedance matching transformer (in an autotransformer connection) in addition to providing the tuning function. The antenna's low resistance was increased (transformed) by a factor equal to the square of the turns ratio (the ratio of the number of turns the antenna was connected to, to the total number of turns of the coil), to match the resistance across the tuned circuit. In the [...] "two-slider" [...] circuit, popular during the wireless era, both the antenna and the detector circuit were attached to the coil with sliding contacts, allowing (interactive) adjustment of both the resonant frequency and the turns ratio. Alternatively a multiposition switch was used to select taps on the coil. These controls were adjusted until the station sounded loudest in the earphone.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{transmit}} SENSE technique {{can reduce}} imaging time by shortening the trajectory in k-space which a multi-dimensional RF pulse follows for spatial selective excitation [1, 2]. The {{use of multiple}} transmit coils, {{each with its own}} time-dependent waveform and spatial sensitivity compensate for the missing parts of the excitation k-space. To implement Transmit SENSE, independent transmit channels, each driven by a specific RF waveform, are required. However independent transmit channel operation is difficult to achieve in conventional arrays due to coupling between elements.

50|$|Tuning of the R-390A's radio {{frequency}} and intermediate frequency front end is synchronized {{by means of}} an ingenious mechanical system of racks, gears, and cams.

The receiver's construction is modular for easy servicing. Each major area of the receiver is contained in easily removable subassemblies, and these can be repaired or replaced as needs be. Though the R-390A is mechanically and electrically complex, alignment and servicing were designed to follow simplified procedures published by the Signal Corps.|$|R

50|$|Lear Radio Laboratories was {{the source}} of an early step to {{miniaturization}} in electronics. <b>Tuning</b> <b>coils</b> in the radio frequency stage of a set were rather large and Lear knew how to reduce their size by using Litz wire. Wire braided from many fine strands has a large surface area giving it high conductivity at radio frequency. Lear borrowed $5,000 from his friend Algot Olson to make machines to wrap the strands, braid the wire, and wind the coils. The industry was set up in the basement of his mother’s old house on 65th street, and done with assistance of Don Mitchell, a railroad electrician. Lear called the company Radio Coil and Wire Corporation. They took an order of 50,000 coils from Eugene F. McDonald of Zenith Electronics when they demonstrated them. These small coils were one-quarter the size of coils with solid wire.|$|R
50|$|In more {{sophisticated}} crystal receivers, the <b>tuning</b> <b>coil</b> is replaced with an adjustable air core antenna coupling transformer which improves the selectivity by {{a technique called}} loose coupling. This consists of two magnetically coupled coils of wire, one (the primary) attached to the antenna and ground and the other (the secondary) attached {{to the rest of}} the circuit. The current from the antenna creates an alternating magnetic field in the primary coil, which induced a current in the secondary coil which was then rectified and powered the earphone. Each of the coils functions as a tuned circuit; the primary coil resonated with the capacitance of the antenna (or sometimes another capacitor), and the secondary coil resonated with the tuning capacitor. Both the primary and secondary were tuned to the frequency of the station. The two circuits interacted to form a resonant transformer.|$|E

40|$|Excessive fluid-borne {{noise in}} {{hydraulic}} systems {{is a problem}} the fluid power industry has long struggled to address. Traditional noise control devices such as Helmholtz resonators, tuning coils, and Herschel-Quincke tubes are generally too large for fluid power systems unless {{the speed of sound}} in the device can be reduced. A compliant lining can achieve this effect, but compliance (and lossy compliance) has had little attention in noise control in general, and in fluid power in particular. One means to achieve compliance in these devices, especially at elevated pressures, is through a liner made of syntactic foam, which in this case is a urethane host matrix with embedded hollow, polymer microspheres. The material properties at elevated pressure are unknown by the liner manufacturer, but are known to be pressure- and temperature-dependent. Therefore, the effect of hydrostatic pressures from 2. 1 - 21 MPa and temperatures from 20 - 45 C on the liner properties, thus the device performance, are studied. For a Helmholtz resonator, a theoretical model is fit to experimentally-measured transmission loss of the device using a least-squares routine, which solves the inverse problem for the complex bulk modulus of the liner. These material properties are used to compare a predictive model of a <b>tuning</b> <b>coil</b> to experimental data, and in a parameter study of a Herschel-Quincke tube. The compliance of the liner is found to lower the effective sound speed by an order of magnitude and decrease the volume of the cavity of a Helmholtz resonator by up to two orders of magnitude.
