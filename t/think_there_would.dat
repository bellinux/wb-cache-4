500|$|In 1998, Laurie Brown of the CBC {{criticized the}} Walk of Fame, calling it [...] "just an {{attraction}} to lure tourists to theatres in the area." [...] She claimed {{that it would}} only honour Canadians with international impact, saying [...] "if it was truly for Canadians, then I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> {{be more of a}} national bend to the whole thing. But I doubt I'm going to see a star on the Walk of Fame that is only a known-name here in Canada." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 2010, he {{has said}} he would allow for a doctor's {{discretion}} in life-threatening cases such as ectopic pregnancies. Concerning same-sex marriage, Paul has made a distinction between his personal beliefs and how he feels the government should handle it. He has stated that he personally feels same-sex marriage [...] "offends [...] and a lot of people", and said there is a [...] "crisis that allows people to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be some other sorts of marriage." [...] However, he believes the issue should be left to the states to decide, and would not support a federal ban.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after its}} release, {{the book also}} won accolades from other award bodies, {{including}} [...] "Best Historical Single Title Romance" [...] by Romance Readers Anonymous and [...] "Best Historical Romance" [...] by Reader's Voice. In 2014, romance novelist Madeline Hunter recalled Lord of Scoundrels being [...] "the 'must read' of the season" [...] when {{it was published in}} 1995, and described it as [...] "witty, heartfelt, with a flawed hero and an indomitable heroine, [...] pacing so perfect a reader could only hold on for the ride. It was no surprise that a book that pushed so many peoples' happy buttons ended up winning a RITA that year. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have been a revolt if it had not".|$|E
6000|$|... "You and I thought scarlet most {{becoming}} to our complexion, Joe Blake!" [...] says Sir George. [...] "And my wife <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> {{not have}} been room for two such great men on one side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that would}} be a very good story, Terence, and I <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no great fear, even if we were to go boldly into a town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should hardly <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be a tumult here, Gregory. The natives {{all seem}} very gentle and peaceable, {{and the army}} is {{composed}} of {{the same sort of}} men." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sandé's {{debut album}} was {{released}} on 13 February 2012. She {{said that it is}} very hard to imagine that she is releasing an album with Virgin Records. She said that she was always going to [...] "definitely" [...] release an album, if she was signed or not. However, she stated that she did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be [...] "this much anticipation, or acknowledgement of what I was doing". She said she loves to be in the limelight and that people are talking about her so much. She said she only loves the attention because she has experienced the other side, when no one cares.|$|E
2500|$|I think I {{agree with}} your [...] order for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned {{beforehand}} as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure {{it would be the}} last, but I found I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I’m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published.|$|E
2500|$|Connecticut's George P. McLean on January 25 with an {{amendment}} reducing the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 250,000 and a recommendation that it pass. The presiding officer over the Senate, Vice President Thomas R. Marshall {{asked if there}} was objection to its passage. [...] The Minority Leader, Democrat Oscar Underwood of Alabama said he did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be objection, but that the bill should be read first. [...] Idaho Senator William E. Borah, a Republican, stated he would object to the bill if there was to be discussion of it, as the Senate had not had morning business in ten days. Borah asked McLean if he expected there would be objection to the bill, and McLean reassured the Idahoan. The bill, as amended, passed the Senate without recorded objection.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{quantity}} of them!" [...] said Rollo. [...] "I should <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be knife handles enough in the pile for all creation. Where can they get so many horns?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} could live here," [...] said Mrs. Vincent {{as though she were}} making a great admission. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be any law to turn him out of the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, colonel; {{but you know}} you promised {{to give us a}} chance if you could, and having a chance of course means having extra danger; but I really don't <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be any great danger in it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Soon {{after these}} charges were filed, there were calls from gay rights advocates and bloggers to include hate crimes charges against Ravi and Wei. Bruce Kaplan, the {{prosecutor}} in the case, said [...] "now that two individuals {{have been charged with}} invasion of privacy, we will be making every effort to assess whether bias {{played a role in the}} incident, and, if so, we will bring appropriate charges." [...] On October 4, 2010, Kaplan stated that he did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be enough evidence to charge Ravi and Wei with a hate crime. After further investigation, the prosecution concluded that there was evidence supporting a hate crime charge against Ravi, dating to when Ravi first learned Clementi's name. On April 20, 2011, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts, including bias intimidation, invasion of privacy, witness tampering, and evidence tampering.|$|E
2500|$|Several notable {{artists and}} musicians cite Milo Goes to College as a {{favorite}} and influence, including Mike Watt of the Minutemen, David Nolte of The Last, and Zach Blair of Hagfish, Only Crime, and Rise Against. Dave Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters opined that [...] "If the Descendents had made Milo Goes to College in 1999, they’d {{be living in}} fucking mansions. That’s a fucking amazing record." [...] Joey Cape of Lagwagon remarked that the album [...] "was just huge in punk and to me. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have been a [...] song like 'Angry Days' without that album." [...] Fat Mike of NOFX has cited Milo Goes to College as his favorite record of all time, and said that hearing the song [...] "Kabuki Girl" [...] on Rodney Bingenheimer's Rodney on the ROQ program on KROQ-FM was a significant moment in his youth. Chris Shary, who has done artwork for the Descendents and their successor band, All, since 1998, remarked that [...] "From the minute that I heard the beginning it was like 'this is the music that I have been waiting for. Photographer Glen E. Friedman, who photographed the band during the early 1980s, recalled that [...] "the album had just come out, and coincidentally I had my own little heartbreak as a teenager, and I heard that song 'Hope' and I gotta say that I had {{never in my life}} related to a song about love ever before until I heard that song [...] I was just 'Wow, this is fucking heavy. This guy's hurting even more than I am, and this is desperation.' A whole new world opened up of a depth of emotion in music for me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But I {{am not so}} sure of that. She {{will not}} want more than her fair interest; and as it will be {{thoroughly}} well managed, I should <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be something over--something enough {{to keep up the}} house. And then, you know, we must have some place in the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see," [...] {{the latter}} exclaimed, [...] "we kept our word! That dear plucky little {{friend of yours}} turned the scale, {{but in any case}} I <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> not have been much trouble about the matter. The {{magistrate}} had received a communication direct from the Home Secretary concerning your case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And to {{hear their}} damnable taunts!" [...] said Edith. [...] "It is very hard upon him. I think it is papa's idea to keep him here till after the trial in August, and then, if possible, {{to send him to}} England. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> be the double journey else, and papa <b>thinks</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no real danger till his {{evidence}} had been given." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. Still, you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be {{no harm in}} {{my writing}} to Marian to say that her {{behavior}} has attracted your notice, and----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Oliver; [...] "it {{looks like}} a dog's track; but I shouldn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be a dog {{out here in the}} woods." ...|$|E

5000|$|Since 5, 7, and 11 are {{consecutive}} primes, {{one might}} <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> {{be such a}} congruence for the next prime 13, [...] for some a. This is, however, false. In fact, it can be shown {{that there is no}} congruence of the form [...] for any prime b other than 5, 7, or 11.|$|R

60|$|The term at Putnam Hall Military Academy {{was at an}} end, and {{the school}} days of the three Rover boys at that {{institution}} were now {{a thing of the}} past. Each had graduated with honors, yet all were a trifle sad to <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no going back to a place where they had made so many friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did not say}} so," [...] the Inspector {{answered}} warily. [...] "By the bye, do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be {{any chance}} of five minutes' interview with your chief?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be {{much use}} in trying. You couldn't carry me {{for more than}} four or five minutes. That wouldn't be worth while, would it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{they would}} have done better, a year or two since, when we were {{settling}} a new tariff; but I should <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be less demand for them now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mrs. Docimer, I {{have taken}} my place. Your sister seemed to <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be great danger if I waited till to-morrow morning when I {{could have got}} a {{pleasant}} lift in a return carriage. I hate travelling at night and I hate diligences. I was quite prepared to post all the way, though it would have ruined me,--only for this accursed diligence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Mr. Mainwaring, I may <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no Goarlys {{if there}} were no Ruffords. That, however, is a great {{question}} which cannot be argued on this case. All we can hope here is that one poor man may have an act of justice done him though in seeking for it he has to struggle against so wealthy a magnate as Lord Rufford." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{can never}} marry now, you know. Only <b>think</b> of it. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> be three hundred a year between them.--Not at present, that is," [...] added Aunt Letty, {{looking forward to}} a future period after her own death.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You think so?' said Amy. 'Well, Guy {{would be}} glad. Yes. O Laura, if Philip {{would learn to}} do Guy justice, I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be any more to wish!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you not?" [...] {{the other}} {{asked with a}} hint of polite surprise. [...] "I do not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be much {{difficulty}} about a new commission, and officers are wanted." ...|$|E

5000|$|In Voices to Visions magazine, Mark Edward {{states that}} [...] "common sense should {{tell us what}} these charlatans (psychics) do is an act and nothing more; otherwise, they would be ruling the planet."

6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right," [...] said my Lady. [...] "And, now I come to <b>think</b> of it, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> hardly {{be time for}} more than one Lecture. And it will go off all the better, if we begin with a Banquet, and a Fancy-dress Ball--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not here!" [...] entreated Eustace, {{alarmed at}} his gesture. [...] "Remember the servant. Oh Harold, {{if you could}} but be more the gentleman!
