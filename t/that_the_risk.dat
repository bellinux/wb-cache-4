5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of miring was seasonal.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{potential}} for microbes to cause infection in the astronauts {{and to be able to}} degrade various components that may be vital for the functioning of the spacecraft it is important <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> are assessed and where appropriate the levels of microbial growth controlled by the use of good astronautical hygiene. For example, by frequently sampling the spacecabin air and surfaces to detect early signs of a rise in microbial contamination, keeping surfaces clean by the use of disinfected clothes, by ensuring that all equipment is well maintained in particular the life support systems and by regular vacuuming of the spacecraft to remove dust etc. It is likely <b>that</b> during <b>the</b> first manned missions to Mars <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> from microbial contamination will be underestimated unless the principles of good astronautical hygiene practice are applied.

5|$|Alprazolam {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was of panic disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, Xanax became a blockbuster drug in the US. As of 2010, alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine in the US. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> is low and {{similar to that of}} other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid onset of action may increase the misuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E

Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Swiss {{publisher}} Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested {{permission to}} produce a full-colour facsimile of the book. Permission was initially denied, because Trinity College officials felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of damage to the book was too high. By 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page {{so that it could}} be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, {{on the site of the}} original monastery.|$|E
5|$|Raw's {{role in the}} Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 was controversial. During the engagement, he {{initially}} refused to allow No. 9 Squadron to fly ammunition to D Company of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment after it was heavily engaged and nearly surrounded, as {{he believed that the}} heavy rain at the time made flying too dangerous. The commander of the 1st Australian Task Force, Brigadier David Jackson, was angered by this decision and argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of losing a few helicopters was unimportant compared to the possibility of having 200 infantrymen killed if the unit was overrun {{due to a lack of}} ammunition and other supplies. Raw eventually allowed the resupply flight to proceed after the most experienced of the helicopter pilots present stated that the mission needed to be flown regardless of its risk.|$|E

5|$|The English {{plan for}} 1673 centred on first {{achieving}} naval dominance, followed by landing an army in Zeeland. The King appointed the Duke as supreme commander, with Rupert as his deputy, combining {{the rank of}} General and Vice Admiral of England. During the winter of 1672, however, Charles—still (legitimately) childless—decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> to the Duke, his heir, was too great and made Rupert supreme Allied commander in his place. Rupert began the 1673 campaign against the Dutch knowing the logistical support for his fleet remained uncertain, with many ships undermanned. The result was the Battle of Schooneveld in June and the Battle of Texel in August, a controversial sequence of engagements in which, at a minimum, poor communications between the French and English commanders assisted the marginal Dutch victory. Many English commentators were harsher, blaming the French for failing to fully engage in the battles and Rupert—having cautioned against the alliance in the first place—was popularly hailed as a hero. Rupert finally retired from active seagoing command later that year.|$|E

5|$|The Das Reich {{division}} attacked on {{the same}} day, along {{the west side of}} Kharkov. After penetrating into the city's Zalyutino district, the advance was stopped by a deep anti-tank ditch, lined with Soviet defenders, including anti-tank guns. A Soviet counterattack was repulsed after a bloody firefight. A detachment of the division fought its way to the southern approaches of the city, cutting off the road to Merefa. At around 15:00, Hoth ordered Hausser to immediately disengage with the Das Reich, and instead redeploy to cut off escaping Soviet troops. Instead, Hausser sent a detachment from the Totenkopf division for this task and informed Hoth <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of disengaging with the Das Reich was far too great. On the night of 11–12 March, a breakthrough element crossed the anti-tank ditch, taking the Soviet defenders by surprise, and opening a path for tanks to cross. This allowed the Das Reich to advance to the city's main railway station, which would be the farthest this division would advance into the city. Hoth repeated his order at 00:15, on 12 March, and Hausser replied as he had replied on 11 March. However, a third attempt by Hoth was obeyed, and Das Reich disengaged, using a corridor opened by LSSAH to cross northern Kharkov and redeploy east of the city.|$|E
5|$|The use of bone {{building}} drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs {{require special}} consideration with implants, {{because they have}} been associated with a disorder called Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.|$|E
