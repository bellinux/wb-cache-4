40|$|Many {{questions}} about technology {{growth and development}} in health care call for a broad-based characterization of <b>technology</b> <b>availability.</b> In this paper, we explore the possibility of producing aggregated estimates of <b>technology</b> <b>availability</b> by constructing an index of <b>technology</b> <b>availability</b> in hospitals. Our index {{is based on the}} number of services provided by a hospital, weighted by how rare those services are. We use the index to examine the relationship between managed care and <b>technology</b> <b>availability</b> in hospitals. We find that managed care may have slowed technology growth in the mid 1980 s, but in the early 1990 s we find little evidence that technology growth in areas with high-HMO market share is any slower than growth in lower market share areas. To the extent that our index captures variation in the costs of new technologies, this finding leaves open the question of whether managed care can help control long term cost growth by slowing technology adoption. We also discuss the general strengths and weaknesses of indices of the type we develop. One concern arises from the considerable variation across individual technologies. We profile several individual technologies and note that conclusions drawn from the aggregated index may not apply to each of the constituent technologies. Nonetheless, this exercise shows that it is feasible to develop and analyze hospital technology indices if aggregated information about technologies is appropriate to the research question. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDespite the claimthat {{technology}} {{has been one of}} themost important drivers of healthcare spending growth over the past decades, technology variables are rarely introduced explicitly in cost equations. Furthermore, technology is often considered exogenous. Using 1996 – 2007 panel data on Swiss geographical areas, we assessed the impact of <b>technology</b> <b>availability</b> on per capita healthcare spending covered by basic health insurance whilst controlling for the endogeneity of health <b>technology</b> <b>availability</b> variables. Our results suggest that medical research, patent intensity and the density of employees working in the medical device industry are influential factors for the adoption of technology and can be used as instruments for <b>technology</b> <b>availability</b> variables in the cost equation. These results are similar to previous findings: CT and PET scanner adoption is associated with increased healthcare spending, whilst increased availability of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty facilities is associated with reductions in per capita spending. However, our results suggest that the magnitude of these relationships is much greater in absolute value than that suggested by previous studies that did not control for the possible endogeneity of the <b>availability</b> of <b>technologies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Technology {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the restructuring of education. However, there is continued disillusionment in the educational community regarding the effective use of computer technology. Factors are identified and noted in related literature as contributors to the ineffective use of computer technology. As the presence of technology continues to increase in the education, it is important for educational leaders and administrators to recognize the significance of their role in technology implementation and utilization. Educational Leaders should be effective role models and have a clear vision of the possibilities technology can provide. ^ This study was guided by the following research questions: (a) What types of tasks do middle school principals most use computer technology to complete? (b) Are there differences in the use of computer technology by middle school principals based upon the format of computer technology training received by middle school principals? (c) Are there differences in the use of computer technology by middle school principals based upon age, gender, or years of experience as educational administrators? (d) Are there differences in the use of computer technology by middle school principals based upon computer <b>technology</b> <b>availability?</b> ^ Data were obtained from a research sample of 66 middle school principals from ten counties located in the southeastern portion of North Carolina. The Principal 2 ̆ 7 s Use of Computer Technology survey questionnaire developed by Dr. Jack Dibee, served as the research instrument. Additional data collected by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction were used to determine computer <b>technology</b> <b>availability</b> at each school. ^ Data were analyzed using various statistical methods. Means for responses to individual items and grouped areas were used to illustrate comparisons of tasks and demographics. Analyses of data revealed that middle school principals used technology more for communications tasks like electronic correspondence and less for instructional leadership tasks, such as locating curriculum or staff development resources. Data analyses also indicated differences in the use of computer technology by middle school principals and computer <b>technology</b> <b>availability</b> related to management, communications and instructional leadership tasks. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to create}} and evaluate {{a model for a}} culturally appropriate, interactive, multimedia and informative health program for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers that aims to improve the capacity to independently control their learning within an attractive learning environment. The research also aims to provide recommendations for policy development and further research. This study involved four phases: program needs assessment, identification of the key factors that should be considered in developing the CD-ROM, model development, and formative evaluation for the model. A general needs assessment as a first step in program development highlighted the presence of continuing education gaps and indicated the need for a new means to deliver a sustainable, efficient and culturally acceptable program. This article explores the second objective in this study, which is the identification of the key factors considered for developing the program. The identification began with a systematic review of the literature which served as background information, followed by qualitative semistructured interviews with diverse key stakeholders to explore their expectations and recommendations. The findings indicated that the most important key factors could be categorised under four main categories: cultural factors, information <b>technology</b> <b>availability</b> and literacy, learning aspects, and interactive multimedia factors. Cultural factors included cultural inclusivity, oral cultural, pre-existing knowledge, and Aboriginal preferred learning styles. Information technology factors concerned <b>technology</b> <b>availability</b> and literacy. Learning aspects highlighted the impact of the learning theory in model design. Interactive multimedia development factors explored included the requirements for the process, fitting and design of the program. Recommendations for program design were also provided. ...|$|R
