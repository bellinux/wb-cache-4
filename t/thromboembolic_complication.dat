40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thromboembolic {{events are}} the most common {{complications}} of elec-tive coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms. Administration of oral clopidogrel and/or aspirin could lower the <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>complication</b> rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records over a 10 -year period were reviewed in a retrospective cohort study. For 369 consecutive elective coil embolization procedures, 25 patients received no antiplatelet drugs, 86 received antiplatelet drugs only after embolization, and 258 received antiplatelet drugs before and after embolization. RESULTS: Symptomatic thromboembolic complications (transient ischemic attack or stroke within 60 days) occurred in 4 (16 %) of 25 when no antiplatelet drugs were given, in 2 (2. 3 %) of 86 when antiplatelet drugs were administered only after embolization, and in 5 (1. 9 %) of 258 when antiplatelet drugs were administered before and after embolization. The lower symptomatic <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>complication</b> rate in the patients who received any antiplatelet therapy was statistically significant (P. 004).

40|$|AbstractBackground: Off-pump {{coronary}} artery operations have recently gained popularity among {{the community of}} cardiac surgeons. Because the use of cardiopulmonary bypass is avoided, full anticoagulation is generally not sought to decrease perioperative blood loss and transfusion needs. Traditionally, patients undergoing {{coronary artery}} bypass operations with cardiopulmonary bypass are not considered {{at risk of having}} venous or arterial <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>complications,</b> and prophylaxis is generally not recommended. Methods and results: We have reviewed our experience with off-pump coronary bypass operations, focusing on <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>complications</b> with clinical manifestations, and compared these findings with our experience with cardiopulmonary bypass operations. In our series of 500 off-pump cases, <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>complications</b> occurred in 1 %, causing death in 1 patient, whereas in a contemporary cohort of 1476 patients operated on with cardiopulmonary bypass, <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>complications</b> resulted in stroke in 0. 5 % of the cases. This difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: <b>Thromboembolic</b> <b>complications</b> in off-pump coronary bypass operations are comparable with those in cardiopulmonary bypass operations. Although the prevalence of this complication remains low, the associated morbidity should lead to reconsideration of prophylactic measures. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2001; 121 : 920 - 2...|$|R

MethodsWe performed a multicenter, observational study from a prospective registry including all consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation in 8 high-volume centers in the United States. All patients receiving dabigatran therapy who underwent AF ablation on periprocedural dabigatran, with the dose held on the morning of the procedure, were matched by age, sex, and type of AF with an equal number of patients undergoing AF ablation with uninterrupted warfarin therapy over the same period. ResultsA total of 290 patients, including 145 taking periprocedural dabigatran and an equal number of matched patients taking uninterrupted periprocedural warfarin, were included in the study. The mean age was 60 years with 79 % being male and 57 % having paroxysmal AF. Both groups had a similar CHADS 2 score, left atrial size, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Three <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>complications</b> (2. 1 %) occurred in the dabigatran group compared with none in the warfarin group (p = 0. 25).
