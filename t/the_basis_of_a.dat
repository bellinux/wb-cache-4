5|$|Ferugliotheriids {{are known}} {{from a few}} dozen {{isolated}} teeth and a questionably allocated jaw fragment. Most fossils are referred to Ferugliotherium; Trapalcotherium and Argentodites were each described on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single tooth. Their precise dental formula is unknown, but incisors, premolars, and molariform teeth have been identified. Gurovich suggested that Ferugliotherium had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars {{on each side of}} the lower and upper jaws.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals from the Campanian and/or Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, around 70 million years ago) of Argentina {{in the family}} Ferugliotheriidae. It {{contains}} a single species, Ferugliotherium windhauseni, which was first described in 1986. Originally interpreted {{as a member of}} Multituberculata, an extinct group of small, rodent-like mammals, on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single brachydont (low-crowned) molar, it was recognized as related to the hypsodont (high-crowned) Sudamericidae after the discovery of additional material in the early 1990s. After a jaw of the sudamericid Sudamerica was described in 1999, these animals (collectively known as Gondwanatheria) were no longer considered to be multituberculates and a few fossils that were previously considered to be Ferugliotherium were assigned to unspecified multituberculates instead. Since 2005, a relationship between gondwanatheres and multituberculates has again received support. A closely related animal, Trapalcotherium, was described in 2009 on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single tooth.|$|E

5|$|French {{zoologist}} Henri Filhol was {{the first}} to scientifically describe a species of Pachylemur; he named Lemur insignis and Lemur intermedius in 1895 on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few subfossil bones. Descriptions of other species now placed in Pachylemur quickly followed. In 1899, Guillaume Grandidier named a new genus and species, Palaeochirogalus jullyi, on the basis of two teeth from Antsirabe, central Madagascar, which he thought similar to dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus). In 1903, Grafton Elliot Smith placed this species in the genus Lemur (as Lemur jullyi), and in 1905, Grandidier himself considered the species a synonym of Lemur insignis.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, Richard Harlan {{renamed the}} turtle Emys muhlenbergii.

Synonyms include Emys biguttata, named in 1824 by Thomas Say on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> turtle from {{the vicinity of}} Philadelphia, and Clemmys nuchalis, described by Dunn in 1917 from near Linville, North Carolina.
