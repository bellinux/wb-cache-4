500|$|During his youth, Starr {{had been}} a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, {{but by the time}} he joined the Texans in 1958, he had {{developed}} a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: [...] "He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, what about him? Because he doesn't <b>turn</b> <b>me</b> on." [...] He stated that he [...] "was never really into drummers", but identified Cozy Cole 1958 cover of Benny Goodman [...] "Topsy Part Two" [...] as [...] "the one drum record" [...] he bought.|$|E

Some contend that Nancy's character becomes [...] "more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [...] since 1956." [...] Others criticize the series for its increasing incorporation of romance and [...] " [...] of pre-feminist [...]" [...] For example, volume 78 in the series Update on Crime (1992) opens with Nancy wondering in italics, [...] "Am I or am I not in love with Ned Nickerson?" [...] Nancy begins dating other young men and acknowledges sexual desires: [...] "'I saw ... You don't have to apologize to me if some guy turns you on.' 'Gianni doesn't <b>turn</b> <b>me</b> on!...

500|$|... "Anticipating" [...] is a teen pop and dance-pop {{that lasts}} {{for three minutes}} and 16 seconds. Corey Moss of MTV noted the song also has a 1970s disco sound, while Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{compared}} it to early Madonna tracks such as [...] "Holiday" [...] (1983).

[...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and <b>turn</b> <b>me</b> inside out."

2500|$|The Beatles were {{involved}} in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as the center of a controversy.

The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle Paul McCartney had died, and claimed that the Beatles song [...] "Revolution 9" [...] contained a backward message confirming the rumor.
