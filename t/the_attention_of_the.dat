The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the timeâ€”they fixed <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E
