5|$|Although Herodian is not deemed as {{reliable}} as Cassius Dio, {{his lack of}} literary and scholarly pretensions make him less biased than senatorial historians.

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{technological}} changes <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since {{the early part of}} the century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house. Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Islam and Christianity, Periyar {{also found}} in Buddhism a basis for his {{philosophy}} {{though he did not}} accept that religion. It was again an alternative in the search for self-respect and the object was to get liberation from the discrimination of Hinduism. Through Periyar's movement Temple Entry Acts of 1924, 1931, and up to 1950 were created for the non-Brahmins. Another accomplishment <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the Temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits were finally eligible for priesthood.|$|E

5|$|Between 1631 and 1890, {{the city}} tripled its area through land {{reclamation}} by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront. The largest reclamation efforts <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 19th century; beginning in 1807, {{the crown of}} Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50-acre (20ha) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square area. The present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects {{in the middle of}} the century created significant parts of the South End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown.|$|E
5|$|Blancornelas {{covered the}} rise of Mexico's drug {{trafficking}} organizations for more than thirty years, but his best {{work in the field}} <b>took</b> <b>place</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1990s.

Blancornelas' stories are considered so crucial that almost every written account of the Tijuana Cartel cites him.|$|E
