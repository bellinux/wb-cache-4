The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and <b>touch</b> <b>pads.</b> These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can be restored to working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E
500|$|The show's {{original}} three lifelines were [...] "50:50", {{in which}} the computer eliminates two of the incorrect answers; [...] "Phone-a-Friend", which allowed the contestant to make a 30-second call to {{one of a number}} of friends (who provided their phone numbers in advance) and read them the question and answer choices, after which the friend provided input; and [...] "Ask the Audience", in which audience members use <b>touch</b> <b>pads</b> to designate what they believe the correct answer to be, after which the percentage of the audience choosing each specific option is displayed to the contestant. 50:50 was eliminated at the end of the show's sixth syndicated season, only to be restored in season fourteen. Phone-a-Friend was removed on the episode aired January 11, 2010, after it was determined that there was an increasing trend of contestants' friends using search engines and other Internet resources, unfairly privileging individuals who had computer access over those who did not, and that it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline where friends were supposed to provide assistance based on what they already knew. From 2004 to 2008, there was a fourth lifeline called [...] "Switch the Question", earned upon answering question ten, {{in which the}} computer replaced, at the contestant's request, one question with another of the same monetary value; however, any lifelines used on the original question were not reinstated for the new question. Switch the Question returned as [...] "Cut the Question" [...] on a special week of shows with child contestants aired in 2014.|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of the mouse as an input device for notebook computers indicates that many users are reluctant to use alternative built-in pointing devices. We present a novel input method called Touch&Type ™ which is meant to overcome some of the drawbacks encountered with conventional built-it pointing devices. Touch&Type™ combines a conventional keyboard with an extended <b>touch</b> <b>pad</b> whereby the <b>touch</b> <b>pad’s</b> sensitive area is formed by {{the surface of the}} keys themselves and thus can be made as large as the whole key area. A comparative study of pointing operation is presented with a Touch&Type™ prototype in comparison with the mouse and the conventional <b>touch</b> <b>pad.</b> While the mouse outperformed its two counterparts, Touch&Type ™ was found to be superior to the conventional <b>touch</b> <b>pad</b> (after a short learning period) with a confidence level of 73 %.

2500|$|The show's {{original}} three lifelines are [...] "50/50", {{in which}} the computer eliminates two of the incorrect answers; [...] "Phone a Friend", {{in which the}} contestant makes a thirty-second call to {{one of a number}} of friends (who provide their phone numbers in advance) and reads them the question and answer choices, after which the friend provides input; and [...] "Ask the Audience", in which audience members use <b>touch</b> <b>pads</b> to designate what they believe the correct answer to be, after which the percentage of the audience choosing each specific option is displayed to the contestant. In countries where the show is broadcast live, friends selected for Phone-a-Friend are alerted when their contestant begins to play the main game, and are told to keep the phone free and to wait for three rings before answering. Phone-a-Friend was removed from the U.S. version beginning with the episode that aired on 11 January 2010, after it was determined that there was an increasing trend of contestants' friends using web search engines and other Internet resources to assist them, which unfairly privileged individuals who had computer access over those who did not, and that it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline, by which friends were supposed to provide assistance based on what they already knew. From 2004 to 2008, the U.S. version had a fourth lifeline called [...] "Switch the Question", earned upon answering question ten, in which the computer replaced, at the contestant's request, one question with another of the same monetary value; however, any lifelines used on the original question were not reinstated for the new question.
