The situation reached a climax in the aftermath of Treasurer Peter Costello's 2006 Budget, whereby {{for the first time in}} recent Australian political history, the opposition leader and his colleagues ceased inquiry on the budget papers after just six questions, before resuming further questioning on the AWB scandal. The media criticised the ALP, although many ministers acknowledged the need for the Government <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> the AWB scandal.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbinic Judaism's scholars, such as Maimonides, {{write that}} people who deny the divine {{authority}} of the Oral Torah are to be considered among the heretics.

2500|$|The {{shooting}} was controversial, with some observers stating {{that it was}} unclear whether Harambe was likely to harm the child.

Director Thane Maynard stated, [...] "The child was being dragged around... His head was banging on concrete. This was not a gentle thing. The child was at risk." [...] Police investigated possible criminal charges against the parents, while the parents defended the zoo's actions. The boy's mother also became the target of harassment on the Internet and social media. On June 6, 2016, Ohio prosecutor Joe Deters said that the mother would not face any charges of wrongdoing. The zoo was being investigated by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), which sets the standards for zoos, and the USDA.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} 3 growing trends in {{relation}} to NGOs and the rights-based approach to development that have been implemented into practice. [...] The first trend is focusing attention onto a rights-based approach to development. [...] The second trend is the joint advocacy by development NGOs and human rights NGOs to work together towards a common goal. [...] The third trend is to expand the attention to economic and social rights as well. [...] The Human Rights ideal imparts the international benchmark that states can have related and common ideas. [...] To have internationally understood human rights allows NGOs, governments, and corporations <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> their actions. [...] This change in focus on human rights-based approach to development challenges the market-dominated view that was popular during the 1980s into a view focused {{on the relationship between}} human rights and development.|$|E
2500|$|At an FCW house show on October 21, Ambrose {{challenged}} WWE wrestler CM Punk, who {{was making}} a guest appearance, to a match in which Ambrose was defeated in a 30-minute match, but was later paid tribute to by Punk. Ambrose's behind-the-back attack on WWE wrestler and FCW commentator William Regal set up a match between the two on the November 6 episode of FCW, where Regal pinned Ambrose to win the match. Following the loss to Regal, Ambrose became obsessed about wanting a rematch and regularly taunted Regal by using Regal's finishing moves to win matches. Ambrose started appearing at WWE house shows in December 2011. At WrestleMania XXVIII Axxess in April 2012, Ambrose had a confrontation with veteran hardcore wrestler Mick Foley, claiming that Foley needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> leading a generation astray. Ambrose continued his verbal assault on Foley through Twitter and WWE reacted by [...] "sending Ambrose home" [...] from the SmackDown taping. Ambrose challenged old nemesis Seth Rollins for the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship on the June 24 episode of FCW, but Rollins defeated him. Ambrose finally received a rematch with Regal on the final episode of FCW on July 15, which ended in a no contest when Ambrose kneed Regal's head into an exposed turnbuckle, causing Regal to bleed from the ear, but after the match nonetheless applauded Ambrose and allowed him to deliver a running knee lift, which prompted the FCW locker room {{to get in the}} ring to separate Ambrose from a fallen Regal while commentators questioned whether Regal would ever be able to wrestle again.|$|E

And yet all aboard were so busy with their own {{concerns}} that the castaways were left very much to themselves. Thirty of the soldiers were down with fever and scurvy, and both priests and nuns were fully taken up in nursing them. Denonville, the governor, a pious-minded dragoon, walked the deck all day reading the Psalms of David, and sat up half the night with maps and charts laid out before him, planning out {{the destruction of the}} Iroquois who were ravaging his dominions. The gallants and the ladies flirted, the maidens of Anjou made eyes at the soldiers of Quercy, and the bishop Saint Vallier read his offices and lectured his clergy. Ephraim Savage used to stand all day glaring at the good man as he paced the deck with his red-edged missal in his hand, and muttering about the [...] "abomination of desolation," [...] but his little ways were put down to his exposure upon the iceberg, and to the fixed idea in the French mind that men of the Anglo-Saxon stock are not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> their actions.|$|E
