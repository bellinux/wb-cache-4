A deity carried out this punishment using its ba, the force that manifested the god's power in the human world. Natural disasters and human ailments were seen {{as the work of}} angry divine bas. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> were eventually represented by deities: Shed, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm, and Petbe, an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|TMS-induced MEPs {{have been}} used in many {{experiments}} in cognitive neuroscience. Because MEP amplitude is correlated with motor excitability, they offer a quantitative way to test the role of various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> on the motor system (pharmacological, behavioral, lesion, etc.). TMS-induced MEPs may thus serve as an index of covert motor preparation or facilitation, e.g., induced by the mirror neuron system when seeing someone's else actions. In addition, MEPs are used as a reference to adjust the intensity of stimulation that needs to be delivered by TMS when targeting cortical regions whose response might not be as easily measurable, e.g., in the context of TMS-based therapy.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Randomized {{controlled}} {{clinical trial}} is the most valid <b>type</b> <b>of</b> epidemiological studies {{for the treatment of}} diseases. The aim of the present article is to determine the subject area, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention,</b> and blinding methods used in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> study design. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study in which all the articles based on randomized {{controlled clinical trial}} were studied. The articles were all affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences(TUMS) and indexed in PubMed by {{the end of the year}} 2010. Results: Among the subject areas, most randomized controlled clinical trials(44 cases or 14 %) were conducted in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology. In terms <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>type,</b> the majority <b>of</b> the studied trials(214 cases or 68. 2 %) used drug intervention. And regarding the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> blinding, double-blinding was employed more than other blinding techniques(152 cases or 48. 4 %). On the whole, 125 cases(39. 8 %) of randomized controlled clinical trials were conducted through drug intervention simultaneous with double-blinding technique. Conclusion: In different subject areas, the application of blinding techniques and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> are somewhat related to research methodology and medical ethics. It seems that intervention type depends on subject area, and blinding technique is determined by the selected <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Other authors dispute Singer's {{empirical}} claim {{about the}} likely consequences of intervening {{in the natural}} world, and argue that some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> {{can be expected to}} produce good consequences overall. Economist Tyler Cowen cites examples of animal species whose extinction is not generally regarded as having been on balance bad for the world. Cowen also notes that, insofar as humans are already intervening in nature, the relevant practical question is not whether we should intervene at all, but what particular forms of intervention we should favor. Philosopher Oscar Horta similarly writes that there are already many cases in which we intervene in nature for other reasons, such as for human interest in nature and environmental preservation as something valuable in their own rights. Likewise, moral philosopher Jeff McMahan argues that, since humans [...] "are already causing massive, precipitate changes in the natural world," [...] we should favor those changes that would promote the survival [...] "of herbivorous rather than carnivorous species." ...|$|E

5000|$|There are varying <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> for ankyloglossia. Horton et al., have a {{classical}} belief {{that people with}} ankyloglossia can compensate in their speech for limited tongue range of motion. For example, if {{the tip of the}} tongue is restricted for making sounds such as /n, t, d, l/, the tongue can compensate through dentalization; this is when the tongue tip moves forward and up. When producing /r/, elevation of the mandible can compensate for restriction of tongue movement. Also, compensations can be made for /s/ and /z/ by using the dorsum of the tongue for contact against the palatal rugae. Thus, Horton et al. proposed compensatory strategies as a way to counteract the adverse effects of ankyloglossia and did not promote surgery. Non-surgical treatments for ankyglossia are typically performed by Orofacial Myology specialists, and involve using exercises to strengthen and improve the function of the facial muscles and thus promote proper function of the face, mouth and tongue ...|$|E

5000|$|His first book, After War: The Political Economy of Exporting Democracy, was {{published}} by Stanford University Press in November 2007 ( [...] ; paperback [...] ). After War employs the tools of economics to analyze {{the ability of the}} U.S. to export democracy abroad. The central argument is that continued efforts to export democracy through military occupation and reconstruction are more likely to fail than to succeed because of an array of constraints facing occupiers and policymakers. In the book, Coyne contends that failure is due to the inability of foreign governments to centrally plan the complex array of institutions which underpin liberal democracy. Coyne provides a new vision of U.S. foreign policy including principled nonintervention and a commitment to free trade in goods, ideas and cultural products. He presented his book at the Cato Institute in November 2007. [...] In his review of After War in the Financial Times, Samuel Brittan concluded by noting that,Prof Coyne is obviously a dove rather than a hawk. But he accepts the case for occasional intervention for humanitarian reasons or to protect US citizens. His main suggestions are to avoid nation-building <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> and adopt free trade, if necessary unilaterally by the US. It is perhaps déformation professionelle for economists to overrate the spillover benefits of the latter.
