5|$|During {{his reign}} as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay {{of an average}} legionary from 2000 sesterces (500 denarii) to 2700–3000 sesterces (675–750 denarii). He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E
5|$|Dokeianos re-appears in 1050, when he {{held the}} titles of patrikios and vestarches, {{as part of an}} {{imperial}} expedition against the Pechenegs who raided Thrace. The imperial commander-in-chief, the eunuch praipositos Constantine, a militarily inexperienced court favourite of Emperor Constantine IX (r. 1042–55), listened to his advice on fortifying the army's encampment, but when the Pechenegs appeared before Adrianople, he refused <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> opinion of the magistros Constantine Arianites to wait and attack the Pechenegs on their return journey, and instead marched to meet them in the open field of Basilike Libas, resulting in a devastating defeat: Arianites fell, while Dokeianos was taken prisoner. As he was brought before the Pecheneg leader, however, Dokeianos seized a sword from one of his guards and slashed at the leader, cutting off one of his arms, whereupon the enraged Pechenegs killed him and, according to Michael Attaleiates, opened his belly, cut off his arms and legs and placed them in it.|$|E

In 1862 Hopkins {{wrote a letter to}} Lincoln requesting the President not <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> detractors' calls and continue to keep soldiers stationed in Maryland.

The organizers behind the demonstration said around 500,000 people massed in the March 30 rally, while the police estimate the figure to be 116,000. Twenty-two NGOs also took part in the rally.

Henry yielded, and the favourites were dismissed, Hubert de Burgh (whom they had imprisoned) was released and reconciled to the king and soon the archbishop was sent to Wales to negotiate peace with Llywelyn the Great. Edmund's success, however, turned the king against him.|$|E
25|$|The post {{election}} violence therefore is, in part, {{a consequence}} of the failure of President Kibaki and his first Government to exert political control over the country or to maintain sufficient legitimacy as would have allowed a civilised contest with him at the polls to be possible. Kibaki's regime failed to unite the country, and allowed feelings of marginalisation to fester into what became the post election violence. He and his then Government were complacent in the support they considered they would receive in any election from the majority Kikuyu community and failed <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> views of the legitimate leaders of other communities.|$|E

25|$|Initially reluctant, Aquino was {{eventually}} prevailed upon <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> people's clamor, after one million signatures urging her {{to run for}} president were presented to her. Despite this, United Opposition (UNIDO) leader Laurel, did not immediately give way to his close friend's widow. Salvador Laurel only gave way to Cory after a political deal which was later reneged by Cory after the election. According to Salvador Laurel's diary, Cory offered Laurel that he would be her Prime Minister, that she would step down in two years, that Laurel would name 30 percent of the Cabinet, that she would appoint the remaining 70 percent after close consultations with Laurel. Salvador Laurel eventually ran as Cory Aquino's running mate for vice-president under the United Opposition (UNIDO) party. With that, the Aquino-Laurel tandem was formally launched to challenge Marcos and finally put an end to his two-decade rule.|$|E
25|$|In February 1984, the Toyota {{franchise}} officially takes a {{leave of}} absence from the league after suffering from huge losses in terms of revenues. This also forced the hand of then team manager Jack Rodríguez (who replaced Ricky Silverio, Jr., the son of the team owner who replaced Carlos) to sell the franchise to Beer Hausen of Lucio Tan's Asia Brewery. The lock, stock and barrel deal stated that all Toyota players will be sold as well, to be led by no less than their starting center Ramon Fernandez. Robert Jaworski and his bossom buddy Francis Arnaiz balked at the sale, refusing <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> contract that they were obligated to follow. This made Arnaiz mouth the famous line, “di kami por kilo” in reference to the non-transparent ways that the Toyota management did in selling the franchise without informing the players. With the controversy becoming even bigger as the days wore on, then Ginebra team owner Carlos “Honeyboy” Palanca, III, who was also the PBA President at that time, decided to secure Jaworski's services. Jaworski was joined by Francis Arnaiz in the Palanca franchise, while Chito Loyzaga and Arnie Tuadles were taken in by Great Taste Coffee. Prior to the sale of the franchise, Abe King joined the San Miguel Group then called Gold Eagle Beer. The majority of the Toyota players led by Fernandez (along with Coloso, Cordero, Herrera, Legaspi, Bulaong, Relosa, etc.) went to Beer Hausen.|$|E
25|$|Abaza Hasan's {{promotion}} {{to the major}} governorships of Diyarbakır and Aleppo coincided with another major development in Ottoman history: {{the beginning of the}} Köprülü Era. Köprülü Mehmed Pasha had been given the office of grand vizier on 15 September 1656, and since then began carrying out major reforms of the Ottoman state. Some of these aroused widespread opposition, such as the purges he carried out against the Altı Bölük cavalry regiments (of which Abaza Hasan had once been a member). In particular, after his return to Edirne from the 1657 campaign to reconquer the islands of Bozcaada (Tenedos) and Limni (Lemnos), Köprülü Mehmed ordered a massacre of all the cavalry soldiers he suspected of disloyalty - {{in the words of one}} historian, strewing the banks of the Tunca River with corpses. Abaza Hasan already had a history of disloyalty toward Köprülü: In 1657 Köprülü had ordered the execution of the governor of Egypt, and Abaza Hasan secretly aided his escape through Aleppo. Thus, when the order was given for the army to assemble for a campaign against Transylvania, Abaza Hasan and his allies chose not <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> call. Instead, they gathered at Konya with an army of 30,000, and pledged to oppose Köprülü. Their forces included a significant portion of the Ottoman military, including the governors of Damascus, Anatolia, Raqqa, and Aleppo, which Abaza Hasan himself governed. The rebels were further supported by members of the imperial cavalry regiments who had fled from Köprülü's purges.|$|E

Although one of PUTERA's constituent organisations had insisted on ketuanan Melayu as a [...] "National Birthright" [...] of the Malays, PUTERA joined the AMCJA in championing equal political rights for non-Malays. After the British refused <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> PUTERA-AMCJA coalition, it pulled out of talks with the British, later launching a major hartal (general strike) to protest perceived defects in the new polity. After the Federation was formed over their objections, the coalition disbanded.|$|E
500|$|Fearing Democrats in the Assembly would [...] "steal" [...] the election, {{armed men}} came to Frankfort from various {{areas of the}} state, {{primarily}} Eastern Kentucky, which was heavily Republican. On January 30, Goebel was shot while entering the state capitol building. Taylor {{declared a state of}} emergency and called out the militia. He called a special session of the legislature, holding it in heavily Republican London, Kentucky rather than the capital. Democrats refused <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> call, and met in Democratic-dominated Louisville instead. They certified the election commission's report that disqualified enough Taylor votes for Goebel to be declared the winner of the election. Shortly after being sworn in as governor, Goebel died from the gunshot wound he had received days earlier.|$|E
500|$|Federal tax {{inspector}} for western Pennsylvania General John Neville {{was determined to}} enforce the excise law. He was a prominent politician and wealthy planter—and also a large-scale distiller. He had initially opposed the whiskey tax, but subsequently changed his mind, a reversal that angered some western Pennsylvanians. In August 1792, Neville rented a room in Pittsburgh for his tax office, but the landlord turned him out after being threatened with violence by the Mingo Creek Association. From this point on, tax collectors {{were not the only}} people targeted in Pennsylvania; those who cooperated with federal tax officials also faced harassment.

500|$|Guy de Beauchamp is {{probably}} best remembered [...] for his opposition to King Edward II, and {{for his part in}} the death of Gaveston. To contemporaries, however, he was considered a man of considerable learning and wisdom. His library, of which he donated 42 books to Bordesley Abbey during his lifetime, was extensive. It contained several saints' lives as well as romances about Alexander and King Arthur. As mentioned, Edward I entrusted the supervision of his son to Warwick. Likewise, when the earl of Lincoln died in 1311, he supposedly instructed his son-in-law Thomas of Lancaster <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> advice of Warwick, [...] "the wisest of the peers". Chronicles also praised Warwick's wisdom; the Vita Edwardi Secundi says that [...] "Other earls did many things only after taking his opinion: in wisdom and council he had no peer". Later historians have reflected this view, in the 19th century William Stubbs called Warwick [...] "a discriminating and highly literate man, the wisdom of whom shone forth through the whole kingdom". He was politically and economically well connected by traditional ties of kinship and marriage.|$|E
500|$|The {{power of}} the {{governor}} to adjourn the General Assembly {{for a period of}} up to four months if the two houses cannot agree on a time to adjourn appears in all four constitutions. The governor is also empowered to convene the General Assembly [...] "on extraordinary occasions". Since the 1799 constitution, the governor has been permitted to call the legislature into session somewhere other than the state capital if the capital had, since the last legislative session, [...] "become dangerous from an enemy or from contagious diseases." [...] This was an important provision {{in the early days of}} the Commonwealth, when epidemics like smallpox posed a danger to the populace. One notable example of an attempt to employ this power was in 1900 when Republican Governor William S. Taylor attempted to adjourn the legislature and re-convene it in heavily Republican London, Kentucky following the shooting of William Goebel. Taylor claimed a state of insurrection existed in the capital, but defiant Democrats refused <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> call to adjourn or to convene in London.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} of three segments, the Simpsons visit Morocco (which Homer {{mistakes}} for Monaco). Homer purchases a severed monkey's hand that will grant four wishes, despite the vendor's warning that the wisher will experience grave misfortune. Back in Springfield, the family argues in how to use the wishes. Despite Marge's warning <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> advice of the vendor in not using any of them, Maggie is granted that first wish: a new pacifier. Next, Bart wishes for the Simpsons to be rich and famous. His wish is granted, but the people immediately tire of the family's annoying antics, cheesy merchandise and celebrity treatment. Horrified by these wasteful wishes, Lisa wishes for world peace and Homer is furious. While all countries declare peace and destroy their weapons, the aliens Kang and Kodos realize the human race is [...] "ripe for the plucking" [...] and, armed with only a slingshot and a club, enslave the Earth. At the house, Homer blames Lisa and deems her own wishes to be selfish. She defends herself, claiming that Bart and Maggie's own wishes were also selfish as well and felt that hers was the only selfless one. Soon, Marge catches the people who are angry with the Simpsons and calls for a temporary truce in the family. Determined to make a wish that could not be twisted, she begs Homer {{to do the right thing}} and use the last wish to get rid of the aliens. Much to her dismay, Homer refuses and demands a turkey sandwich, but the turkey turns out to be a little too dry. With all the wishes used up, he goes to throw out the paw, but his neighbor Ned asks about it. Hoping to see Flanders suffer, Homer gladly hands the paw over. Ned's first wish is to [...] "Get rid of those awful aliens," [...] which is accomplished when Moe chases after Kodos with a board with a nail sticking out of it, then brings the aliens back to the flying saucer. Kodos laments their failed invasion, but Kang assures him that humanity is doomed: [...] they will end up in an arms race creating increasingly larger boards and larger nails, which will ultimately [...] "cause the human race to create a board with a nail in it so big to doom mankind." [...] Everyone celebrates and after Flanders wishes to [...] "spruce up the ol' homestead," [...] his house is converted into an opulent castle, making Homer envious. Lisa wakes up from her nightmare and begs Bart to keep her company. Bart sleepily complies after Lisa gives him a candy necklace. Bart then has a nightmare.|$|E
