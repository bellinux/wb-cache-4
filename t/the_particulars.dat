5|$|The {{presence}} of outsiders {{such as the}} Strangers and <b>the</b> <b>Particulars</b> was a considerable annoyance to the Pilgrims. As early as 1623, a conflict broke out between the Pilgrims and the Strangers over the celebration of Christmas, a day of no particular significance to the Pilgrims. Furthermore, a group of Strangers founded the nearby settlement of Wessagussett and the Pilgrims were highly strained, both emotionally {{and in terms of}} resources, by their lack of discipline. They looked at the eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people.|$|E
5|$|The ecclesiastical {{forms of}} Byzantine music, {{composed}} to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music, are, today, {{the most well-known}} forms. Ecclesiastical chants were a fundamental part of this genre.

It remains the oldest genre of extant music, of which the manner of performance and (with increasing accuracy from the 5th century onwards) the names of the composers, and sometimes <b>the</b> <b>particulars</b> of each musical work's circumstances, are known.|$|E

5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with <b>the</b> <b>particulars</b> of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Fielding drew {{inspiration}} from many literary sources and traditions {{as well as from}} his own life. The structure and plot of The Author's Farce {{are similar to those of}} George Farquhar's Love and a Bottle (1698), in that both plays describe the relationship between an author and his landlady. The plays only deal with the same generalised idea however; <b>the</b> <b>particulars</b> of each are different. Fielding also drew on the Scriblerus Club's use of satire and the humour common to traditional Restoration and Augustan drama. Many of Luckless's situations are similar to those found within various traditional British dramas, including Buckingham's The Rehearsal (1672), a satirical play about staging a play. It is possible that Pope's Dunciad Variorum, published on 13 March 1729, influenced the themes of the play and the plot of the puppet show. The Court of Nonsense in the puppet show are related to the Court of Dulness in The Dunciad and the Court of Nonsense in John Dryden's Mac Flecknoe. The Scriblerus Club style of humour as a whole influences The Author's Farce, and it is possible that Fielding borrowed from Gay's Three Hours after Marriage (1717) and The Beggar's Opera (1728). In turn, Fielding's play influenced later Scriblerus Club works, especially Pope's fourth book of his revised Dunciad and possibly Gay's The Rehearsal at Goatham.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rules of}} [...] "Kelal u-perat" [...] and [...] "perat u-kelal" [...] ("General and {{particular}}, particular and general") is a [...] {{limitation of the}} general by <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> and vice versa. According to Rabbi Ishmael, this principle has eight special applications, and thus includes eight separate rules in his scheme (Nos. 4-11). This method of limitation {{is one of the}} main points of difference between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the former, who follows his teacher Rabbi Nehunya ben HaKanah, <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> is only an elucidation of the preceding general expression, so that the latter includes only what is contained in <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> (כלל ופרט אין בכלל אלא מה שבפרט). But if still another general follows <b>the</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>the</b> two general expressions are defined by <b>the</b> intermediate <b>particular,</b> so that <b>the</b> law applies only to what is like <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> (כלל ופרט וכלל אי אתה מרבה אלא כעין הפרט). Akiva, on the contrary, applies the rule of increase and decrease (רבוי ומיעוט) which had been taught him by his teacher Nahum of Gimzo. According to this principle, the general followed by a particular subsumes everything which is like <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> (Sanhedrin 45b, 46a). If, however, another general term follows <b>the</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>the</b> former subsumes also what is not similar to the latter. The two general terms are decreased in only one respect by <b>the</b> intermediate <b>particular</b> (רבוי ומיעוט ורבוי ריבה הכל ומאי מיעט דבר אחר Shebu. 26a; comp. also Rashi on Sanhedrin l.c.).|$|R

25|$|The Persian {{invasion}} of Egypt began either in 617 or 618, but {{little is known}} about <b>the</b> <b>particulars</b> of this campaign, since the province was practically cut off from the remaining Roman territories. The Persian army headed for Alexandria, where Nicetas, Heraclius' cousin and local governor, was unable to offer effective resistance. He and the Chalcedonian patriarch, John V, fled the city to Cyprus. According to the Khuzistan Chronicle, Alexandria was then betrayed to the Persians by a certain Peter in June 619.|$|E
50|$|Another logical {{opposition}} {{implied by}} this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is 'alternation' (alternatio), consisting of 'subalternation' and 'superalternation'. Alternation is a relation between a particular statement and a universal {{statement of the}} same quality such that <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> is implied by <b>the</b> other. <b>The</b> <b>particular</b> is <b>the</b> subaltern of the universal, which is <b>the</b> <b>particular's</b> superaltern.
