5|$|Danny K. Davis {{running for}} Chicago mayor in the Democratic primary {{scheduled}} for February 26, 1991, made police brutality and excessive force {{an issue in}} the campaign. He sought an independent citizens' review of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department.</b> On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International called for an investigation into police torture in Chicago. After Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley seemed reluctant to initiate an investigation, his opponent Davis questioned whether there was a police and city coverup. Eventually, after pressure by citizens' organizations and anti-brutality organizations, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department</b> resumed an internal investigation.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{lasted for}} {{nine and a}} half years, from April 1902 until October 1911, with the tower {{construction}} alone taking three years (1908–11). Different departments of the city administration moved in at different times with some, such as <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department,</b> moving in as early as March 1908.

5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department</b> to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department,</b> Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E

5|$|The {{city has}} had struggles: {{a series of}} scandals in the 1990s plagued <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department,</b> {{including}} underreporting of crime. The Street administration was plagued with scandal, with administration people being accused of awarding contracts based on campaign donations for Street's 2003 reelection campaign. The 2000s had a rise of violent crime after {{a decline in the}} 1990s. In 2006 Philadelphia's murder rate was 27.8 per 100,000 inhabitants versus a rate of 18.9 in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Broderick's {{exploits}} {{were widely}} {{reported in the}} New York media, gaining him celebrity status.

5|$|The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department {{was founded}} on February 10, 1903 from Briarcliff Manor's first fire company, the 1901 Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1.

5|$|The Lawton PD is {{especially}} pleased that “prominent crimes”, such as robbery and homicide have declined nearly 50%. Sergeants Stephanie Crawford and Tim Jenkins credit the marked improvement {{to not only}} the outstanding work of the LPD, {{but also to the}} involvement of Lawton’s citizens. One of the key contributing factors is local Neighborhood Watch groups, which act as the eyes and ears of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department</b> in the areas they represent. They also share tips on how to protect themselves with their neighbors at regular neighborhood meetings.|$|E
5|$|The three episodes {{were tied}} {{together}} by {{the story of a}} murdered Haitian domestic worker employed by wealthy philanthropist Felix Wilson, played by Jones. Protagonists Frank Pembleton and Al Giardello initially refuse to properly investigate the Wilson family out of respect for their success and contributions to the African American community of Baltimore, which leads to tensions and accusations of discrimination within <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department.</b> The storyline serves as a rumination and commentary on racism and classism, even when they come from the best of intentions.|$|E
50|$|The Municipal Integrated Emergency Response Team (MIERT) was an {{emergency}} response unit {{formed as a}} joint venture of <b>police</b> agencies in <b>the</b> Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada.

5|$|W. Harry Davis, {{who later}} served 20 {{years on the}} Minneapolis School Board, agreed {{to run for mayor}} in 1971, {{becoming}} the city's first black mayoral candidate supported by a major political party. White supremacists were still present in Minneapolis, and threatened his family daily during the campaign. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>department</b> guarded their home and the FBI gave them protection dogs. Davis also received support from white politicians including Humphrey, Donald M. Fraser, and Walter Mondale. Twenty years later, Minneapolis elected its first African American mayor, Sharon Sayles Belton. To date, she has been the city's only non-white mayor.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's {{four-year}} term as county executive saw a moderately progressive administration, {{which included the}} building of new schools, increases to teachers' salaries, reorganization of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department,</b> and improvements to the water and sewer systems. His anti-discrimination bill passed, {{and gave him a}} reputation as a liberal, but its impact was limited in a county where the population was 97 percent white. His relations with the increasingly militant civil rights movement were sometimes troubled. In a number of desegregation disputes involving private property, Agnew appeared to prioritize law and order, showing a particular aversion to any kind of demonstration. His reaction to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Alabama, in which four children died, was to refuse to attend a memorial service at a Baltimore church, and to denounce a planned demonstration in support of the victims.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in major US cities, the 1960s was a turbulent decade for the city. Numerous {{civil rights and}} anti-war protests took place, including large protests led by Marie Hicks to desegregate Girard College. Students took over the Community College of Philadelphia in a sit-in, race riots broke out in Holmesburg Prison, and a 1964 riot along West Columbia Avenue killed two people, injured over 300 and caused around US$3 million in damages. Crime was also a serious problem. Primarily drug-related gang warfare plagued the city, and in 1970 crime was rated the city's number one problem in a City Planning Commission survey. The court system was overtaxed and the tactics of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department</b> under Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo were controversial. Frank Rizzo was credited with preventing {{the level of violence}} seen in other cities at the time and was elected mayor in 1971.|$|E
