5|$|<b>The</b> <b>traits</b> {{of organisms}} {{are subject to}} change through acclimation, development, and evolution. For this reason, {{individuals}} form a shared focus for ecology and for evolutionary ecology.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{themes are}} {{expressed}} through the No-Face, who reflects the characters which surround him, learning by example and taking <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bath house. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At {{the end of}} the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.|$|E
5|$|Conceived by series creators Michael Schur and Greg Daniels, Ron {{has been}} a central {{character}} since the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. Offerman had some input into the character's creation, and some aspects of Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity for woodworking and 16-year-old Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch. <b>The</b> <b>traits</b> of the character were also partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in Burbank, California.|$|E
25|$|Refinement: Once <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> exists, if it {{provides}} selective benefit, mutations will accumulate that improve <b>the</b> <b>trait,</b> making it effective. This phase is open-ended, {{and will continue}} so long as refining mutations arise and <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> remains beneficial.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> in {{question}} is determined by simple (complete) dominance, a heterozygote will express only <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> coded by <b>the</b> dominant allele, and <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> coded by <b>the</b> recessive allele will not be present. In more complex dominance schemes the results of heterozygosity can be more complex.|$|R
5000|$|In genetics, a {{reciprocal}} cross is a breeding experiment designed {{to test the}} role of parental sex on a given inheritance pattern. [...] All parent organisms must be true breeding to properly carry out such an experiment. In one cross, a male expressing <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> of interest will be crossed with a female not expressing <b>the</b> <b>trait.</b> In <b>the</b> other, a female expressing <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> of interest will be crossed with a male not expressing <b>the</b> <b>trait.</b>|$|R
5|$|Like Mr. Krabs, Pearl {{has also}} been {{considered}} a stereotyped character; Sharon Lamb and Lyn Mikel Brown wrote in their 2007 book Packaging Girlhood that Pearl exhibits <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of an archetypal girly girl. A study by the federal office of gender equality in Mexico, , found that Pearl's roles sometimes rely on characteristics associated with stereotypes of women, such as vanity and materialism.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of Orochimaru's {{character}} {{were taken}} from Japanese mythology. Orochimaru originates from the Japanese folktale Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari where he opposes the title character who also appears in Naruto as his former ally. He wields a sword named Kusanagi {{is said to be}} related to creature known as the Yamata no Orochi. In Japanese mythology, Yamata no Orochi is defeated by the god Susanoo with Orochimaru taking using the a technique also known as Yamata no Orochi but is defeated by Itachi Uchiha's own Susanoo technique.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Mendel's work, the {{dominant}} theory of heredity {{was one of}} blending inheritance, which suggested that each parent contributed fluids to the fertilisation process and that <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of the parents blended and mixed to produce the offspring. Charles Darwin developed a theory of inheritance he termed pangenesis, from Greek pan ("all, whole") and genesis ("birth") / genos ("origin"). Darwin used the term gemmule to describe hypothetical particles that would mix during reproduction.|$|E
50|$|The {{covariance}} term {{captures the}} effects of natural selection; if the covariance between fitness (wi) and <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> value (zi) is positive then <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> value is predicted to increase on average over population i. If the covariance is negative then <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> is deleterious and is predicted to decrease in frequency.|$|R
50|$|A {{population}} {{consisting of}} individuals with <b>the</b> same <b>trait</b> is called monomorphic. If not explicitly stated otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> {{is assumed to be}} a real number, and r and m are <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> value of <b>the</b> monomorphic resident population and that of an invading mutant, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Fisherian runaway, {{explaining}} how {{the desire for}} a phenotypic trait in one sex combined with <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> in <b>the</b> other sex (for example a peacocks tail) creates a runaway development of <b>the</b> <b>trait.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> it has that modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Japanese manga artist Kazuhiko Katō under the pen name Monkey Punch. His {{inspiration}} for the series was the fictional French gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, created by Maurice Leblanc. Before creating the series he read 15 of Leblanc's stories. The aim of the Lupin III series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of Leblanc's character. Originally the intention {{was to keep the}} blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however he was convinced by others not to do so.|$|E
5|$|Thompson's {{screenplay}} {{exaggerated the}} Dashwood family's wealth {{to make their}} later scenes of poverty more apparent to modern audiences. It also altered <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of the male leads {{to make them more}} appealing to contemporary viewers. Elinor and Marianne's different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. Ang Lee was selected as director, both due to his work in the 1993 film The Wedding Banquet and because Doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Lee was given a budget of $16 million.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{is maintained}} by the counteracting pressures of natural selection and sexual selection. For example, sexual dimorphism in coloration increases the vulnerability of bird species to predation by European sparrowhawks in Denmark. Presumably, increased sexual dimorphism means males are brighter and more conspicuous, leading to increased predation. Moreover, the production of more exaggerated ornaments in males may come {{at the cost of}} suppressed immune function. So long as the reproductive benefits of <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> due to sexual selection are greater than the costs imposed by natural selection, then <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> will propagate throughout the population. Reproductive benefits arise {{in the form of a}} larger number of offspring, while natural selection imposes costs in the form of reduced survival. This means that even if <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> causes males to die earlier, <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> is still beneficial so long as males with <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> produce more offspring than males lacking <b>the</b> <b>trait.</b> This balance keeps the dimorphism alive in these species and ensures that the next generation of successful males will also display these traits that are attractive to the females.|$|R
50|$|Given that <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> of {{interest}} is either autosomal or sex-linked and follows by either complete dominance or incomplete dominance, a reciprocal cross following two generations will determine the mode of inheritance of <b>the</b> <b>trait.</b>|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in the dynamic of a structured branching population where <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> of each individual moves according to a Markov process. The rate of division of each individual is a function of its trait and when a branching event occurs, <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> of <b>the</b> descendants at birth depends on <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> of <b>the</b> mother and on the number of descendants. In this article, we explicitly describe the penalized Markov process, named auxiliary process, corresponding to the dynamic of <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> along <b>the</b> spine by giving its associated infinitesimal generator. We prove a Many-to-One formula and a Many-to-One formula for forks. Furthermore, we prove that this auxiliary process characterizes exactly the process of <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> of a uniformly sampled individual in the large population approximation. We detail three examples of growth-fragmentation models: the linear growth model, the exponential growth model and the parasite infection model...|$|R
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the bicycle kick would again be brought forth to {{international}} acclaim by Pelé. Pelé's capability to perform bicycle kicks with ease was one of <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> that made him stand out from other players early in his sports career, and it also boosted his self-confidence as a footballer. After Pelé, Argentine midfielder Diego Maradona and Mexican forward Hugo Sánchez became notable performers of the bicycle kick during the last decades of the 20th century. Other notable players to have performed the move during this period include Peruvian winger Juan Carlos Oblitas, who scored a bicycle kick goal in a 1975 Copa América match between Peru and Chile, and Welsh forward Mark Hughes, who scored from a bicycle kick in a World Cup qualification match played between Wales and Spain in 1985.|$|E
5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages, and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.|$|E
5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
50|$|Frequently {{in the use}} of regression, the {{presence}} or absence of a trait is quantified by employing a dummy variable, which takes on the value 1 in {{the presence}} of <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> or <b>the</b> value 0 in the absence of <b>the</b> <b>trait.</b>|$|R
50|$|Indifferences {{is defined}} {{variously}} as <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> of lacking enthusiasm for or interest in things generally; <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> of remaining calm and seeming not to care, a casual lack of concern; apathy demonstrated by {{an absence of}} emotional reactions; and unbiased impartial unconcern.|$|R
50|$|Martin was {{diagnosed}} with sickle cell anemia at 3 months old. Both of Martin's parents had <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> for <b>the</b> disease and thus had a 25 percent chance of giving it to a child. Her brother is also a carrier of <b>the</b> <b>trait.</b>|$|R
5|$|Natural {{historians of}} the 18th and 19th centuries {{rejected}} stories of hermaphroditism in hyenas, and recognised {{the differences between}} the spotted and striped hyena. However, they continued to focus on the species' scavenging habits, their potential to rob graves and their perceived cowardice. During the 20th century, Western and African stereotypes of the spotted hyena converged; in both Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and Disney's The Lion King, <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of gluttony and comical stupidity, common in African depictions of hyenas, are added to the Western perception of hyenas being cowardly and ugly. After the release of The Lion King, hyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character, and another who had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas suggested boycotting the film.|$|E
5|$|Norbert Jacques {{wrote the}} {{original}} Dr. Mabuse {{books in the}} style of other popular thrillers in Europe at the time, such as Nick Carter, Fantomas, and Fu Manchu. Jacques expanded <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of these books to include critiques on Weimar Germany. In 1930, Jacques was approached by a film producer to develop a story for a new Dr. Mabuse film with a female villain. This caused Jacques to start writing a new novel called Mabuse's Colony. In the novel, a character named Frau Kristine obtains a copy of Mabuse's testament which outlines plans for a future world of terrorism and crime that she uses.|$|E
5|$|The Old Norse poems Völuspá, Grímnismál, Darraðarljóð and the Nafnaþulur {{section of}} the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, provide lists of valkyrie names. In addition, some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists, such as Sigrún (who is attested in the poems Helgakviða Hundingsbana I and Helgakviða Hundingsbana II). Many valkyrie names {{emphasize}} associations with battle and, in many cases, on the spear—a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin. Some scholars propose that {{the names of the}} valkyries themselves contain no individuality, but are rather descriptive of <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> and nature of war-goddesses, and are possibly the descriptive creations of skalds.|$|E
25|$|Validity: Direct {{scales are}} likely to be more valid because they are {{designed}} to measure <b>the</b> underlying <b>trait</b> itself rather than indicators of <b>the</b> <b>trait.</b>|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> {{negative}} urgency, <b>the</b> {{propensity to}} engage in risky behaviour in response to distress, is highly predictive of certain aspects of substance abuse in adolescents.

5|$|The first Celtic people {{arrived in}} Poland, coming from Bohemia and Moravia, around or after 400 BC, {{just a few}} decades after their La Tène culture was born. They formed several {{enclaves}} mostly {{in the southern part}} of the country, within the Pomeranian or Lusatian populations or in areas abandoned by those people. The cultures or groups that were Celtic, or had a Celtic element in them (mixed Celtic and autochthonous), lasted at their furthest extent to 170 AD (the Púchov culture). After the Celts moved in, and during their tenure (they had always remained only a small minority), the bulk of the population had begun acquiring <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> of archaeological cultures with a dominant Proto-Germanic or Germanic component. In Europe the expansion of Rome and the Germanic pressure checked and reversed the Celtic expansion.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} from an aquatic, lobe-finned fish to an air-breathing amphibian {{was a significant}} and fundamental one in the evolutionary history of the vertebrates. For an organism {{to live in a}} gravity-neutral aqueous environment, then colonize one that requires an organism to support its entire weight and possess a mechanism to mitigate dehydration, required significant adaptations or exaptations within the overall body plan, both in form and in function. Eryops, an example of an animal that made such adaptations, refined many of <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> found in its fish ancestors. Sturdy limbs supported and transported its body while out of water. A thicker, stronger backbone prevented its body from sagging under its own weight. Also, through the reshaping of vestigial fish jaw bones, a rudimentary middle ear began developing to connect to the piscine inner ear, allowing Eryops to amplify, and so better sense, airborne sound.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the global}} factors were {{developed}} by factor-analyzing <b>the</b> primary <b>traits,</b> <b>the</b> meanings of <b>the</b> global <b>traits</b> were determined by <b>the</b> primary <b>traits</b> which made them up.
