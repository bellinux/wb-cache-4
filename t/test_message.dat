5000|$|In 1975, IBM {{developed}} the first bit-oriented protocol, SDLC, [...] from work done for IBM {{in the early}} 1970s.

50|$|On February 3, 2011, the FCC {{announced}} plans {{and procedures for}} national EAS tests, which will involve all television and radio stations connected to the EAS, {{as well as all}} cable and satellite services in the United States. It will not be relayed on the NOAA Weather Radio (NOAA/NWS) network as it is an initiation-only network and does not receive messages from the PEP network. The national test would transmit and relay an EAS <b>test</b> <b>message</b> from the White House. This protocol was first used in the first national test of the EAS, conducted on November 9, 2011 at 2:00 p.m. EST.|$|E
50|$|To this end, in 2010, Michael W.

Reddick decoded the entire message after approximately twelve hours of work. This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the Lone Signal hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the hailing message.|$|E

By allowing any node to declare the failure of its own cascade, we eliminate the need for global trusted witnesses...|$|R
5000|$|For modern languages, hello, world {{programs}} vary in sophistication. For example, the Go {{programming language}} introduced a multilingual program, Sun demonstrated a Java hello, world based on scalable vector graphics, and the XL programming language features a spinning Earth hello, world using 3D graphics. While some languages such as Perl, Python or Ruby may need {{only a single}} statement to print [...] "hello, world", a low-level assembly language may require dozens of commands. Mark Guzdial and Elliot Soloway {{have suggested that the}} [...] "hello, world" [...] <b>test</b> <b>message</b> may be outdated now that graphics and sound can be manipulated as easily as text.|$|E
5000|$|Within the low-traffic Usenet {{newsgroup}} alt.xyzzy, {{the word}} is used for test messages, to which other readers (if there are any) customarily respond, [...] "Nothing happens" [...] as a note that the <b>test</b> <b>message</b> was successfully received. In the Internet Relay Chat client mIRC and Pidgin, entering the undocumented command [...] "/xyzzy" [...] will display the response [...] "Nothing happens". [...] The string [...] "xyzzy" [...] is also used internally by mIRC as the hard-coded master encryption key {{that is used to}} decrypt over 20 sensitive strings from within the mirc.exe program file. A [...] "deluxe chatting program" [...] for DIGITAL's VAX/VMS written by David Bolen in 1987 and distributed via BITNET took the name xyzzy. It enabled users on the same system or on linked DECnet nodes to communicate via text in real time. There was a compatible program with the same name for IBM's VM/CMS.|$|E
5000|$|These {{variations}} {{were heard}} {{in different parts}} of the country throughout the years depending on FCC regulations at the time, local preferences, and whether the specific station performing the test was a primary EBS station or not. The announcement text was mandated by the FCC. Stations had the option of either reading the test script live, or using recorded versions. WHEN radio in Syracuse, New York and WGR radio in Buffalo, New York both had a sung version of the most common script. There was also a version done by Los Angeles-based Cheap Radio Thrills, as well as another by the comedy team of Bob and Ray. The FCC declared it illegal to sing the <b>test</b> <b>message,</b> or read it as a joke. However, it was acceptable to read it in another language (for example, French or Spanish), if a station broadcast in a language other than English. Copies of the warning message script had a note saying that it was acceptable to broadcast in any other language, so long as it was broadcast in English as well. Usually the post-test recorded announcement began with the phrase, [...] "This has been a test of the Emergency Broadcast System...", followed by the here-in-above stated recitations.|$|E
2500|$|Inter-process {{communication}} works via a shared-nothing asynchronous {{message passing}} system: every process has a [...] "mailbox", a queue of messages {{that have been}} sent by other processes and not yet consumed. A process uses the receive primitive to retrieve messages that match desired patterns. A message-handling routine <b>tests</b> <b>messages</b> in turn against each pattern, until one of them matches. When the message is consumed and removed from the mailbox the process resumes execution. A message may comprise any Erlang structure, including primitives (integers, floats, characters, atoms), tuples, lists, and functions.|$|R
50|$|For National HIV Testing Day (NHTD) 2009, June 27, AIDS.gov shared <b>testing</b> <b>messages</b> from President Obama, and HHS Secretary Sebelius and DC Mayor Fenty.

In addition, {{in collaboration with the}} CDC, AIDS.gov developed and promoted an accompanying widget with videos from the campaigns, and with the President's NHTD message.|$|R
50|$|The {{sequence}} RYRYRY... {{is often}} used in <b>test</b> <b>messages,</b> and {{at the start of}} every transmission. Since R is 01010 and Y is 10101, the sequence exercises much of a teleprinter's mechanical components at maximum stress. Also, at one time, fine-tuning of the receiver was done using two coloured lights (one for each tone). 'RYRYRY...' produced 0101010101..., which made the lights glow with equal brightness when the tuning was correct. This tuning sequence is only useful when ITA2 is used with two-tone FSK modulation, such as is commonly seen in radioteletype (RTTY) usage.|$|R
