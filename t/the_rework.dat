500|$|The North Bank was {{the final}} stand to be refurbished. It opened in August 1993 {{at a cost of}} £20million. <b>The</b> <b>rework</b> {{significantly}} reduced the stadium's capacity, from 57,000 {{at the beginning of the}} decade to under 40,000. High ticket prices to serve the club's existing debts and low attendance figures forced Arsenal to explore the possibility of building a larger stadium in 1997. The club wanted to attract an evergrowing fanbase and financially compete with the biggest clubs in England. By comparison, Manchester United enjoyed a rise in gate receipts; the club went from £43.9million in 1994 to £87.9million in 1997 [...] because of Old Trafford's expansion.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary music critics {{received}} the [...] "Ave Maria" [...] with mixed reception. While some praised Knowles' emotion-filled vocals, others stated that her version {{as merely a}} normal take on the original. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle commended the open-hearted emotion and the soft vocals that Knowles adopts on [...] "Ave Maria", before adding that it is [...] "a clever riff on the classic aria" [...] and [...] "a unique risk that pays off". Likewise, the Hartford Courants Eric R. Danton, praised <b>the</b> <b>rework</b> of the classic aria, adding that Knowles' lyrics were an [...] "elegant take on the timeless melody". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media commented that Knowles twist on the song is [...] "vocally impeccable, but it reads more like recital fodder rather than a true confessional." [...] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly wrote that on the I Am disc there were some [...] "lovely ballads" [...] including [...] "Disappear", the [...] "soaring 'Halo' and 'Ave Maria'". Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "Beyoncé has a real flair for grandeur" [...] and the [...] "big, wide melodies of 'Halo' and 'Ave Maria' give her enough to work with that." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "Ave Maria" [...] offers a [...] "rare moment of comfort" [...] and added that it [...] "come off as delicate as [...] emotions." [...] Jim Farber of Daily News praised the song with its [...] "operatic flourishes... heavenly élan". In another review, {{he noted that the}} song was [...] "by far her most melodically sure, and musically diverse, work". USA Todays Elysa Gardner chose [...] "Ave Maria" [...] as one of the songs to download from the album. While reviewing I Am... Sasha Fierce, a critic from People magazine noted that [...] "the classically tinged 'Ave Maria,'... shows even more range [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|After queuing to {{meet his}} idol Douglas P. {{backstage}} at a performance in Munich in December 1996, Albin Julius Martinek of Der Blutharsch later collaborated and toured throughout Europe between 1998-2000 with Death in June. Together, they produced the albums Take Care & Control and Operation Hummingbird, {{as well as the}} live album Heilige!. In comparison to previous Death In June works the material on these albums is primarily sample based, building on musical motifs from the likes of Richard Wagner, Franz Schubert, French 1960s pop icon Serge Gainsbourg amongst others. The two albums mark a significant departure from previous or subsequent Death In June material, featuring very little by way of Pearce's guitar, and could be classified {{as a part of the}} martial music genre. This is itself a genre which Pearce had arguably invented in 1986 on [...] "The World That Summer" [...] album with tracks like 'Death Of A Man' and again in 1989 on [...] "The Wall Of Sacrifice" [...] album with the title track and 'Death Is A Drummer'. Pearce wrote a song loosely inspired by an untitled Der Blutharsch song for the Fire Danger Season Der Blutharsch tribute compilation. The track title was later created/revealed as [...] "Many Enemies Bring Much Honour", which also appears on <b>the</b> <b>rework</b> and rarities album 'Abandon Tracks!' ...|$|E

50|$|In the {{follow-up}} phase of software inspections all defects {{found in the}} inspection meeting should be corrected (as they have been fixed in <b>the</b> <b>rework</b> phase). The moderator is responsible for verifying that this is indeed the case. He should verify if all defects are fixed and no new defects are inserted while trying to fix the initial defects. It is crucial that all defects are corrected as the costs of fixing them in a later phase of the project will be 10 to 100 times higher compared to the current costs.|$|E
