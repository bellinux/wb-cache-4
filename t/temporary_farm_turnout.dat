40|$|The {{first rule}} {{regarding}} irrigation district canal automation {{is that there}} is no single "best " method of automation. As an example, the cost of automating a small lateral structure with a computerized gate is similar to the cost of automating a regulating gate on a large canal, although the respective justifiable budgets may be $ 1000 versus $ 100, 000 per structure. The locations of buffer reservoirs, the ability to allow water to spill at the ends of canals, the storage capacity of canal pools, and the topography will also play key roles in deciding if automation is desirable, and what type of automation should be used. These typical engineering considerations must also be coupled with recognition of the limitations and abilities of irrigation district staff regarding maintenance and troubleshooting of sophisticated controls. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the flexibility and reliability of irrigation district water deliveries to the <b>farm</b> <b>turnout</b> must improve. Environmental pressures and the increased competition for the scarce water resources make on-farm irrigation management changes inevitable.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate malaria risk factors in urban farming communities in a medium-sized town in Côte d’Ivoire. Two cross-sectional surveys were carried out among 112 households from six agricultural zones. First, the heads of households were interviewed on agricultural land use, farming practices, water storage, sanitation facilities, and socioeconomic status. Second, a finger prick blood sample was taken from all household members and examined for the occurrence and density of Plasmodia.

40|$|AbstractSummer {{transhumance}} {{of dairy}} cows to high Alpine pastures is still practiced in many mountainous areas. It {{is important for}} many permanent dairy farms because the use of highland pastures increases milk production and high-priced typical local dairy products often boost farm income. As traditional cheese- and ricotta-making procedures in Alpine pastures are central to this dairy system, {{the objective of this}} study was to characterize the quality and efficiency of products and their relationships with the quality and availability of grass during the grazing season. The milk from 148 cows from 12 permanent farms reared on a <b>temporary</b> <b>farm</b> located in Alpine pastures was processed every 2 wk during the summer (7 cheesemakings from late June to early September). During each processing, 11 dairy products (4 types of milk, 2 by-products, 3 fresh products, and 2 ripened cheeses) were sampled and analyzed. In addition, 8 samples of fresh forage from the pasture used by the cows were collected and analyzed. At the beginning of the pasture season the cows were at 233 ± 90 d in milk, 2. 4 ± 1. 7 parities, and produced 23. 6 ± 5. 7 kg/d of milk. The milk yield decreased with the move from permanent to <b>temporary</b> <b>farms</b> and during the entire summer transhumance, but partly recovered after the cows returned to the permanent farms. Similar trends were observed for the daily yields of fat, protein, casein, lactose, and energy, as we found no large variations in the quality of the milk, with the exception of the first period of Alpine pasture. The somatic cell counts of milk increased during transhumance, but this resulted from a concentration of cells in a lower quantity of milk rather than an increase in the total number of cells ejected daily from the udder. We noted a quadratic trend in availability of forage (fresh and dry matter weight per hectare), with a maximum in late July. The quality of forage also varied during the summer with a worsening of chemical composition. The evening milk (before and after natural creaming), the whole morning milk, and the mixed vat milk had different chemical compositions, traditional coagulation properties, and curd-firming modeling parameters. These variations over the pasture season were similar to the residual variations with respect to chemical composition, and much lower with respect to coagulation and curd-firming traits. Much larger variations were noted in cream, cheese, and ricotta yields, as well as in nutrient recoveries in curd during the pasture season. The protein content of forage was correlated with some of the coagulation and curd-firming traits, the ether extract of forage was positively correlated with milk fat content and cheese yields, and fiber fractions of forage were unfavorably correlated with some of the chemical and technological traits. Traditional cheese- and ricotta-making procedures showed average cream, cheese, and ricotta yields of 6. 3, 14. 2, and 4. 9 %, respectively, and an overall recovery of almost 100 % of milk fat, 88 % of milk protein, and 60 % of total milk solids...|$|R

40|$|Flows in an {{irrigation}} canal were analyzed {{to evaluate the}} effects of lateral flow fluctuations on tailend spill losses and on-farm application losses. The flow variabilities at the <b>farm</b> <b>turnouts</b> due to lateral heading inflow variabilities were examined through CanalCAD modeling simulations of the Palm Lateral in the Imperial Irrigation District. The magnitude of flow fluctuations at the turnouts were dependent primarily on the localized flow conditions (i. e. flow depths) and types of structures at the bifurcations. Simulations of fluctuating lateral heading inflows with coefficients of variations (CV) ranging from 0. 0 to 0. 15 were evaluated to quantify the effect of inflow variability on tailend spillage. A positive relationship between lateral inflow fluctuations and tailend spill was obtained. The increased spill as inflow variability increased was also related to the localized flow conditions at the bifurcation structures. Significantly higher spill ratios were evident only when inflow CV's were greater than 0. 10 and the head differences at the turnouts were relatively large. On the farm, 104 recorded irrigation events from the District were randomly selected. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed on the field data with the tailwater quantities (tailwater volume and fraction) as the dependent variables and the inflow variability (CV) and some other field parameters (e. g. inflow volume, date of irrigation, and crop type, etc.) as independent variables. The best-fit regressor variables were CV, delivery volume, month, and crop for the regression equation to predict tailwater volume. It had an R-squared value of 0. 393 which indicated a weak correlation. Two on-farm management conditions were simulated and analyzed for border irrigation using the SRFR model. One set of inflow hydrographs had equal flow volume and duration and were used in simulations with "irrigation by the clock" (i. e. fixed application duration) management method. The {{results showed that the}} inflow variability did not affect the irrigation performance (i. e. tailwater ratio, distribution uniformity, application efficiency, etc.).

BC). Debate surrounding the nature of early farming predominantly revolves around the intensity of crop cultivation: did early farmers move around the landscape while practicing <b>temporary</b> <b>farming</b> methods such as slash and burn agriculture or did they create more permanent fields by investing high labor inputs into smaller pieces of land that produced higher crop yields? The need to address these questions using a direct assessment of the intensity and scale of cultivation is apparent, and an integrated stable isotope approach provides such an opportunity. The {{results of this study}} support the model of small-scale mixed farming, where crop cultivation and animal husbandry are closely integrated. The farmers directed their intensive management towards crops grown for human consumption (free-threshing wheat), while growing fodder crop (hulled barley) more extensively. Pulses were cultivated under a high-manuring/high-watering regime, likely in garden plots in rotation with free-threshing wheat. The diets of the livestock enable us to investigate which parts of the landscape were used for browsing and grazing and indicate that animal management changed in the Late Neolithic. The sheep and goats were now kept in smaller numbers and grazed together and new pasture grasses may have been sought for the grazing of cattle. This study demonstrates that beyond its applicability for palaeodietary reconstruction, analysis of stable isotopes of archaeological crop and animal remains has important implications for understanding the relationship between humans, plants and animals in an archaeological context...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND At {{the request}} of the fanning community, the local public health {{authority}} in a tuberculosis (TB) high-burdened area implemented a farm-based lay health worker (LHW) project focusing on TB control. This project achieved a significantly better (15 %) treatment adherence rate among adult TB patients. Management was keen to expand the intervention, but nonrandomised sampling methodology had been used and could have resulted in an overestimation of results. A more rigorous research design was requested to evaluate this project before replication; therefore this study. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of an LHW intervention within a primary health care (PHC) framework, aimed at improving TB case finding and case holding among permanent farm dwellers, to explore the perceptions of the different stakeholders, and do a cost-effectiveness analysis, in order to contribute to TB control in South Africa. METHODS This LHW model was rigorously evaluated using an unblinded, pragmatic cluster randomised control trial (RCT), while qualitative research evaluated the perceptions of the stakeholders, and a cost-effectiveness analysis established the cost-effectiveness of LHWs in conjunction with the standard TB control programme. RESULTS The successful treatment completion rate in the new smear-positive (NSP) adult TB patients was 18. 7 % higher (P = 0. 042, 95 % CI 0. 9 %- 36. 4 %) on farms in the intervention group than in the control group. The treatment interruption rate was 4 % on intervention farms, compared to 26 % on control farms. In the intervention group 8 % more (P = 0. 267 1) farms increased their adult NSP TB case finding, compared to farms in the control group. A cost-effectiveness analysis showed a potential saving of 59 % for the public health sector in direct staff costs for clinic-based directly observed treatment of TB patients living on farms. Qualitative studies found that farmers remained positive; however, they desired recognition from the public health sector. LHWs, 95 % of whom were women, were grateful for the opportunity, but feared becoming over-burdened. Among <b>temporary</b> <b>farm</b> workers the NSP TB point prevalence was 6 / 356 (1. 7 %), and the total TB point prevalence was 10 / 356 (2. 8 %). CONCLUSIONS Although the focus of this study was on permanent farm labour there has been a subsequent significant change in the labour structure on farms, resulting in a shift towards temporary employment. This will require a separate study. However, the research conducted on permanent farm dwellers shows convincingly that resident, trained LHWs on farms, in conjunction with the public health sector, have the potential to substantially enhance TB control activities on farms and in similar community settings. Pivotal for success are political commitment, a dedicated project champion, an adequate budget and adoption by the health service system and other stakeholders...|$|R

Even if a farmer is successful, there is no way for him to transport large loads to the market, or to store surplus. The tropical climate is too damp for the food to keep - not to mention the vermin and insects that will eat the crops.

It was selected and developed by Gray to give a permanent summer camp for Scouts, and the camp is the first purpose-built Scout camp in New Jersey. Prior Scout summer camping experiments were typically <b>temporary</b> affairs at <b>farm</b> fields or church camps. Frank Gray was one of America's earliest Scoutmasters, having started Troop 4 in Montclair, New Jersey, known as the [...] "Lord Baden-Powell Troop" [...] in March 1909. [...] He also created an honor program {{that was used in}} New Jersey and in the Brooklyn Council called [...] "Senior Division". The camp ultimately reached a size of about 840 acre and was operated by Eagle Rock Council, then Essex Council, and finally Northern New Jersey Council. In 2003, the camp was sold to the Bergen County Parks Commission and operated through a management agreement by the non-profit group Friends of Glen Gray, and is supported by a group of volunteers known as the [...] "Old Guard". While no longer an [...] "official" [...] Boy Scout Camp, it does continue to host a large number of Scouting groups and activities throughout the year, as well as hosting a summer day camp for an area special-needs school.|$|R
50|$|According to Judith Gans, Immigration Policy Program Manager at the University of Arizona, United States {{employers}} are pushed to hire illegal migrants for three main reasons—global economic change, {{the inadequacy of}} channels for legal economic migration, and ineffective employer sanctions.Global economic change is one cause for illegal immigration because information and transportation technologies now foster internationalized production, distribution and consumption, and labor. This has encouraged many countries to open their economies to outside investment, then {{increasing the number of}} low-skilled workers participating in global labor markets and making low-skilled labor markets all more competitive. This and the fact that developed countries have shifted from manufacturing to knowledge-based economies, have realigned economic activity around the world. Labor has become more international as individuals migrate seeking work, despite governmental attempts to control this migration. Because the United States education system creates relatively few people who either lack a high school diploma or who hold PhDs, {{there is a shortage of}} workers needed to fulfill seasonal low-skilled jobs as well as certain high-skilled jobs. To fill these gaps, the United States immigration system attempts to compensate for these shortages by providing for <b>temporary</b> immigration by <b>farm</b> workers and seasonal low-skilled workers, and for permanent immigration by high-skilled workers. The third cause of illegal immigration—the ineffectiveness of current employer sanctions for illegal hiring—allows migrants who are in the country illegally to easily find jobs. There are three reasons for this ineffectiveness—the absence of reliable mechanisms for verifying employment eligibility, inadequate funding of interior immigration enforcement, and the absence of political will due to labor needs to the United States economy. For example, it is unlawful to knowingly hire an illegal immigrant, but according to Judith Gans, there are no reliable mechanisms in place for employers to verify that the immigrants' papers are authentic.|$|R
40|$|Ponds {{support a}} rich {{biodiversity}} because {{the heterogeneity of}} individual ponds creates, at the landscape scale, a diversity of habitats for wildlife. The distribution of pond animals and plants will be influenced by both the local conditions within a pond and the spatial distribution of ponds across the landscape. Separating out the local from the spatial is difficult because the two are often linked. Pond snails {{are likely to be}} affected by both local conditions, e. g. water hardness, and spatial patterns, e. g. distance between ponds, but studies of snail communities struggle distinguishing between the two. In this study, communities of snails were recorded from 52 ponds in a biogeographically coherent landscape in north-east England. The distribution of snail communities was compared to local environments characterised by the macrophyte communities within each pond and to the spatial pattern of ponds throughout the landscape. Mantel tests were used to partial out the local versus the landscape respective influences. Snail communities became more similar in ponds that were closer together and in ponds with similar macrophyte communities as both the local and the landscape scale were important for this group of animals. Data were collected from several types of ponds, including those created on nature reserves specifically for wildlife, old field ponds (at least 150 years old) primarily created for watering livestock and subsidence ponds outside protected areas or amongst coastal dunes. No one pond type supported all the species. Larger, deeper ponds on nature reserves had the highest numbers of species within individual ponds but shallow, <b>temporary</b> sites on <b>farm</b> land supported a distinct temporary water fauna. The conservation of pond snails in this region requires a diversity of pond types rather than one idealised type and ponds scattered throughout the area at a variety of sites, not just concentrated on nature reserves...|$|R
