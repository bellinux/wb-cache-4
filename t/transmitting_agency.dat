5000|$|This {{regulation}} {{enables a}} somewhat simplified route by establishing transmitting and receiving agencies {{in each of}} the member states. Some member states have a de-centralised system with many transmitting and receiving agencies, whereas others have a single centralised agency. The <b>transmitting</b> <b>agency</b> in one member state sends the judicial documents to the receiving agency who is then responsible for service. A Letter Rogatory is not necessary, as a standardised request form included in the annex to the regulation must be used. This aids the process by being widely recognised by the relevant authorities. In addition to service through the recipient member state's receiving agency or agencies, Article 14 of the regulation permits service on defendants directly by mail. Article 15 of the regulation allows for [...] "direct service" [...] through competent judicial officials in the member state, although some member states have opted out of that article.|$|E
40|$|An {{assemblage}} of individual motoneurons constituting a synthetic motoneuron pool {{has been studied}} {{from the standpoint of}} relating monosynaptic reflex responses to frequency of afferent stimulation. Intensity of low frequency depression is not a simple function of transmitter potentiality. As frequency of stimulation increases from 3 per minute to 10 per second, low frequency depression increases in magnitude. Between 10 and approximately 60 per second low frequency depression apparently diminishes and subnormality becomes a factor in causing depression. At frequencies above 60 per second temporal summation occurs, but subnormality limits the degree of response attainable by summation. At low stimulation frequencies rhythm is determined by stimulation frequency. Interruptions of rhythmic firing depend solely upon temporal fluctuation of excitability. At high frequency of stimulation rhythm is determined by subnormality rather than inherent rhythmicity, and excitability fluctuation leads to instability of response rhythm. In short, whatever the stimulation frequency, random excitability fluctuation is the factor disrupting rhythmic response. Monosynaptic reflex response latency is stable during high frequency stimulation as it is in low frequency stimulation provided a significant extrinsic source of random bombardment is not present. In the presence of powerful random bombardment discharge may become random with respect to monosynaptic afferent excitation provided the latter is feeble. When this occurs it does so equally at low frequency and high frequency. Thus temporal summation is not a necessary factor. There is, then, no remaining evidence to suggest that the agency for temporal summation in the monosynaptic system becomes a <b>transmitting</b> <b>agency</b> in its own right...|$|E

5000|$|When {{criminal}} justice agencies share data, they transmit Information Exchange Packages (IEPs) to each other. An IEP {{is a set}} of data that is <b>transmitted</b> between <b>agencies</b> for a specific purpose. For example, if a police department wanted the local prosecutor to charge an individual for a crime, the IEP sent from the police department would contain a very specific set of data (victim name, date and time of the offense, etc.) as well as any associated artifacts (dashcam video, 911 audio transcript).|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the late}} 1920s, the Soviet Union, through its GRU, OGPU and NKVD {{intelligence}} services, used Russian and foreign-born nationals {{as well as}} Communist, and people of American origin to perform espionage activities in the United States. [...] These various espionage networks had contact with various U.S. government <b>agencies,</b> <b>transmitting</b> to Moscow information {{that would have been}} deemed confidential.|$|R
50|$|Formerly {{known as}} {{communications}} security (COMSEC), the CSE's IT security program {{grew out of}} a need to protect sensitive information <b>transmitted</b> by various <b>agencies</b> of the government, especially the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), DND, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). As a result of this critical and urgent need, the IT Security program's strategic stance has made possible a shift to that of a predictive nature allowing the program to provide relevant knowledge based upon sound practices and forward looking solutions.|$|R
50|$|Information Exchange Package Documentation. The {{information}} that is commonly or universally exchanged between participating domains can be organized into information exchange packages (IEPs) {{in the form of}} XML Schemas. An example of this collection of information is data associated with an arrest. The data to be exchanged includes not only descriptive and personal identification data regarding the individual arrested (i.e., the person component described above) but also information about the person's alleged offense, the location of the offense, the arresting officer, etc. The IEP represents a set of data that is actually <b>transmitted</b> between <b>agencies</b> for a specific business purpose (e.g., initiating a charging document by the local prosecutor). It includes the actual XML instance that delivers the payload or information. Additional information regarding this specific exchange can be further documented {{in the form of an}} information exchange package documentation (IEPD), which also contains data describing the structure, content, and other artifacts of the information exchange. An IEPD supports a specific set of business requirements in an operational setting.|$|R
50|$|United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has {{announced}} a new rule, known as the Importer Security Filing (ISF) or more commonly called 10+2; which requires containerized cargo information, for security purposes, to be <b>transmitted</b> to the <b>agency</b> at least 24 hours (19 CFR section 149.2(b) before goods are loaded onto an ocean vessel headed to the U.S. (i.e. mother vessel, not feeder vessel) for shipment into the U.S. 10+2 is pursuant to section 203 of the SAFE Port Act, and requires importers to provide 10 data elements to CBP, as well as 2 more data documents (Container Status Messages and the vessel's Stow Plan)from the carrier.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the letters}} {{are sent to}} the check writer without a {{prosecutor}} ever having reviewed any evidence or considered whether the check writer committed a crime. These are highly automated operations in which large retailers and collection <b>agencies</b> <b>transmit</b> masses of computer data directly to the private company {{that is trying to}} collect the check, using the prosecutor's name and authority. Generally, enrollment in the program is not an admission of guilt to a crime, and will not result in criminal charges being filed or a criminal record. The check writer is told that if s/he successfully completes all program requirements, the case against him/her dismissed without any possibility of arrest, criminal charges or a record thereafter.|$|R
5000|$|Bob Woodward {{wrote in}} 1986 that Reagan {{administration}} authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{to support and}} fund Iranian exiles, including Pahlavi. The <b>agency</b> <b>transmitted</b> his 11-minute speech during which he vowed [...] "I will return" [...] to Iranian television by pirating its frequency. The Tower Commission report published in 1987, acknowledged that CIA was behind the event. In 2006, Connie Bruck of The New Yorker wrote that [...] "Pahlavi had CIA funding {{for a number of}} years in the eighties, but it ended after the Iran-Contra scandal". Andrew Freedman of Haverford College states that Pahlavi began cooperation with the CIA after he met director William J. Casey and received a monthly stipend, citing Pahlavi's financial advisor and other observers. He also connects his residence in Great Falls, Virginia to its close distance from the vicinity of George Bush Center for Intelligence, headquarters of the service.|$|R
40|$|Many large {{companies}} and governmental <b>agencies</b> <b>transmit</b> a large quantity of long distance communications between facilities. Most {{of these organizations}} reduce the expense of transmitting these communications by leasing private telephone lines instead of using commercial long distance. The monthly expense of leasing telephone lines between two facilities depends upon the number of lines leased and the air miles between facilities; it is independent of usage. For this analysis, the number of lines leased between two facilities is called a link, and the aggregate of all the links leased by an organization is called a network. This paper presents a technique to determine the optimal number of lines to be leased on each link, subject to a limit on the network expense. The technique was developed for Lockheed Missiles & Space Company at Sunnyvale, California, and its implementation has provided management with a more efficient means of controlling the leased line network. ...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{management}} of large protected conservation areas is challenged by political, institutional and environmental complexity and inconsistency. Knowledge generation and its uptake into management {{are crucial to}} address these challenges. We reflect on practice at the interface between science and {{management of}} the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area (GBMWHA), which covers approximately 1 million hectares west of Sydney, Australia. Multiple government agencies and other stakeholders are involved in its management, and decision-making is confounded by numerous plans of management and competing values and goals, reflecting the different objectives and responsibilities of stakeholders. To highlight the complexities of the decision-making process for this large area, we draw on the outcomes of a recent collaborative research project and focus on fire regimes and wild-dog control as examples of how existing knowledge is integrated into management. The collaborative research project achieved the objectives of collating and synthesizing biological data for the region; however, transfer of the project 2 ̆ 7 s outcomes to management has proved problematic. Reasons attributed to this include lack of clearly defined management objectives to guide research directions and uptake, and scientific information not being made more understandable and accessible. A key role of a local bridging organisation (e. g., the Blue Mountains World Heritage Institute) in linking science and management is ensuring that research results with management significance can be effectively <b>transmitted</b> to <b>agencies</b> and that outcomes are explained for nonspecialists as well as more widely distributed. We conclude that improved links between science, policy, and management within an adaptive learning-by-doing framework for the GBMWHA would assist the usefulness and uptake of future research.

5000|$|A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) is {{a notice}} filed with an {{aviation}} authority to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards along a flight route or {{at a location}} that could affect {{the safety of the}} flight. [...] NOTAMs are unclassified notices or advisories distributed by means of telecommunication that contain information concerning the establishment, conditions or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedure or hazard, the timely knowledge of which is essential to personnel and systems concerned with flight operations. NOTAMs are created and <b>transmitted</b> by government <b>agencies</b> and airport operators under guidelines specified by Annex 15: Aeronautical Information Services of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (CICA). The term NOTAM came into common use rather than the more formal Notice to Airmen following the ratification of the CICA, which came into effect on 4 April 1947. Notices to Airmen were normally published in a regular publication by each country's air authorities (e.g., in Flight Magazine in the UK). A number of developments and amendments to the CICA have resulted in the more automated system available today.|$|R
60|$|The {{remaining}} part of Mr. Spencer's {{essay is}} devoted to {{a consideration of the}} hypothetical action of the environment on the lower organisms which consist of simple cells or formless masses of protoplasm; and he shows with great elaboration that the outer and inner parts of these are necessarily subject to different conditions; and that the outer actions of air or water lead to the formation of integuments, and sometimes to other definite modifications of the surface, whence arise permanent differences of structure. Although in these cases also {{it is very difficult to}} determine how much is due to direct modification by external <b>agencies</b> <b>transmitted</b> and accumulated by inheritance, and how much to spontaneous variations accumulated by natural selection, the probabilities in favour of the former mode of action are here greater, because there is no differentiation of nutritive and reproductive cells in these simple organisms; and it can be readily seen that any change produced in the latter will almost certainly affect the next generation.[201] We are thus carried back almost to the origin of life, and can only vaguely speculate on what took place under conditions of which we know so little.|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} legislature-agency {{interaction}} is analyzed where the agency possesses an informational advantage in that only it knows {{the cost of}} its services. The legislature {{has the ability to}} audit the agency, where auditing is a costly means of verifying the agency's information. Two different procedures are analyzed for determining the agency's budget: in one, the agency makes a budget request, after which the legislature can either accept or reject the request, or audit the agency and impose a budget equal to the true cost of services. In the other procedure, the legislature can follow a request with a counterproposal to the agency, which can then either accept or reject. Since under both procedures auditing is costly, it will be optimal for the legislature to refrain from auditing a request if the perceived benefits do not outweigh this cost. At issue is the ability of the legislature to impose discipline on the agency's request and final budget through an optimal choice of audit and counterproposal strategies, the extent of the information <b>transmitted</b> through the <b>agency's</b> budget request, and the efficiency of the resulting outcomes. A refinement of the sequential equilibrium concept provides the behavioral predictions for the procedures...|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} wave height and average wave period form an essential input for operational activities in ocean and coastal areas. Such information {{is important in}} issuing appropriate warnings to people planning any construction or instillation works in the oceanic environment. Many countries over the world routinely collect wave and wind data through a network of wave rider buoys. The data collecting <b>agencies</b> <b>transmit</b> the resulting information online to their registered users through an internet or a web-based system. Operational wave forecasts {{in addition to the}} measured data are also made and supplied online to the users. This paper discusses operational wave forecasting in real time mode at locations where wind rather than wave data are continuously recorded. It is based on the time series modeling and incorporates an artificial intelligence technique of genetic programming. The {{significant wave}} height and average wave period values are forecasted over a period of 96 hr in future from the observations of wind speed and directions extending to a similar time scale in the past. Wind measurements made by floating buoys at eight different locations around India over a period varying from 1. 5 yr to 9. 0 yr were considered. The platform of Matlab and C++ was used to develop a graphical user interface that will extend an internet based user-friendly access of the forecasts to any registered user of the data dissemination authority...|$|R
40|$|Transposed {{to media}} like film, drama, opera, music, {{and the visual}} arts, “narrative” is no longer {{characterized}} by either temporality or an act of telling, both required by earlier narratological theories. Transposed to other disciplines, “narrative” is often a substitute for “assumption”, “hypothesis”, a disguised ideological stance, a cognitive scheme, and even life itself. The potential for broadening the concept lay dormant in narratology, both in the double use of “narrative” for the medium-free fabula and for the medium-bound sjuzet, and in changing interpretations of “event”. Some advantages of the broad use of “narrative” are an evocation of commonalities among media and disciplines, an invitation to re-think the term within the originating discipline, a constructivist challenge to positivistic and foundational views, an emphasis on a plurality of competing “truths”, and an empowerment of minority voices. Conversely, disadvantages of the broad use are an illusion of sameness whenever the term is used and the obliteration of specificity. In a Wittgensteinian spirit, the essay agrees that concepts of narrative are mutually related by “family resemblance”, but wishes to probe the resemblances further. It thus postulates two necessary features: double temporality and a <b>transmitting</b> (or mediating) <b>agency,</b> and an additional cluster of variable optional characteristics. When the necessary features are not dominant, the configuration may have “narrative elements” but is not “a narrative”...|$|R
40|$|The public {{authorities}} (the agency) messages {{could play a}} key role in the social subjects’ decisions. How and when the agency communicates the path of its future policies influences the present social and economic architecture. The aim of this paper is to advance an explanatory framework for the connections between the transparency and credibility of the {{public authorities}} and the volatility of the social output. In order to provide some empirical evidences, the paper will consider the case of the European Central Bank as a representative monetary authority. The main output of the paper resides in the thesis that, with a certain consistency, there are some connections between the agency’s mandates, the types of the messages <b>transmitted</b> by the <b>agency</b> and the volatility of the obtained results, and also in the idea that an agency entrusted with a “strong” mandate could transmit “mixed” type messages (i. e. “informative-persuasive” ones) which, in special conditions, could influence the decisions of certain categories of clients and/ or non-members. Of course, the following core question still remains: “How sustainable could be the effects induced by the impact of different agency messages received by the various beneficiaries?” And this, because in the end “The one who knows does not speak and the one who speaks does not know” (LAO ZI - DAO DE JING) ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, on {{the base}} of the {{preliminary}} analysis, we are going to develop the IMC plan to be implemented on the Chinese market. Firstly, we define the target audience for the campaign we are going to propose. This section presents figures and critical perspectives that are essential to have a detailed identity card of our Chinese target. Furthermore, a benchmark analysis helps our understanding of the coffee competitive environment in China and mainly in the big cities. Then, we continue with the description of three macro-objectives that will be depicted in details to have clearly in mind what are all the specific elements that must be accomplished. These objectives represent the fundamental guidelines in order to develop the communication plan. They have been developed as an evolutional path in which every step is necessary for the achievement of the further one. At this point, we have the creative brief. It is necessary to clearly <b>transmit</b> to the <b>agency</b> the information we perceive as crucial to be communicated to target audience. Through this brief we aim at being as much clear as possible in relation to the objectives we want to achieve, the issues that must be solved, and the benefits and the values that must lead the target to prefer Illy than other brands. The next section describes the communication tools that will be implemented {{on the base}} of the objectives; three “mock-ups ” will be proposed. The development of the press release about the exhibition has been chosen as emblematic. This is depicted i...|$|R
60|$|I {{imagine that}} Louis Agassiz, the genial backwoodsman {{of the science}} of my young days, who did more to open out new tracks in the {{scientific}} forest than most men, {{would have been much}} surprised to learn that he was preaching the doctrine of the Cabbala, pure and simple. According to this modification of Neoplatonism by contact with Hebrew speculation, the divine essence is unknowable--without form or attribute; but the interval between it and the world of sense is filled by intelligible entities, which are nothing but the familiar hypostatised abstractions of the realists. These have emanated, like immense waves of light, from the divine centre, and, as ten consecutive zones of Sephiroth, form the universe. The farther away from the centre, the more the primitive light wanes, until the periphery ends in those mere negations, darkness and evil, which are the essence of matter. On this, the divine <b>agency</b> <b>transmitted</b> through the Sephiroth operates after the fashion of the Aristotelian forms, and, at first, produces the lowest of a series of worlds. After a certain duration the primitive world is demolished and its fragments used up in making a better; and this process is repeated, until at length a final world, with man for its crown and finish, makes its appearance. It is needless to trace the process of retrogressive metamorphosis by which, through the agency of the Messiah, the steps of the process of evolution here sketched are retraced. Sufficient has been said to prove that the extremist realism current in the philosophy of the thirteenth century can be fully matched by the speculations of our own time.|$|R
60|$|After a short pause, and an {{abundance}} of felicitations on his excellent and self-abasing discourse, the newly admitted member again rose, {{and began to read}} an essay on some discoveries he had made in the science of Latent Sympathies. According to his account of the matter, every monikin possessed a fluid which was invisible, like the animalcula which pervade nature, and which required only to be brought into command, and to be reduced into more rigid laws, to become the substitute for the senses of sight, touch, taste, hearing, and smelling. This fluid was communicable; and had already been so far rendered subject to the will, as to make it of service in seeing in the dark, in smelling when the operator had a bad cold, in tasting when the palate was down, and in touching by proxy. Ideas had been <b>transmitted,</b> through its <b>agency,</b> sixty-two leagues in one minute and a half. Two monikins, who were afflicted with diseased tails, had during the last two years, been insulated and saturated, and had then lost those embellishments, by operations; a quantity of the fluid having been substituted in their places so happily, that the patients fancied themselves more than ever conspicuous for the length and finesse of their caudce. An experiment had also been successfully tried on a member of the lower house of parliament, who, being married to a monikina of unusual mind, had for a long time been supplied with ideas from this source, although his partner was compelled to remain at home, in order to superintend the management of their estate, forty-two miles from town, during the whole session. He particularly recommended to government the promotion of this science, as it might be useful in obtaining evidence for the purposes of justice, in detecting conspiracies, in collecting the taxes, and selecting candidates for trusts of a responsible nature. The suggestion was well received by the king's cousin, more especially those parts that alluded to sedition and the revenue.|$|R
