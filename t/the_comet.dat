5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> {{moved into}} the southern celestial hemisphere. <b>The</b> <b>comet</b> was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers {{than it had been}} in the northern hemisphere, but southerners were able to see <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> had remained visible without aid for 569days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E
5|$|Development {{flying and}} route proving with <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 3 allowed {{accelerated}} certification {{of what was}} destined to be the most successful variant of the type, <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4. All airline customers for <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 3 subsequently cancelled their orders and switched to <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4, which was based on <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 3 but with improved fuel capacity. BOAC ordered 19 Comet 4s in March 1955, while American operator Capital Airlines ordered 14 Comets in July 1956. Capital's order included 10 Comet 4As, a variant modified for short-range operations with a stretched fuselage and short wings, lacking the pinion (outboard wing) fuel tanks of <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4. However, because of financial problems and a subsequent takeover by United Airlines, Capital would never operate <b>the</b> <b>Comet.</b>|$|E
5|$|The cockpit was {{significantly}} altered for <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4's introduction, on which an improved layout {{focusing on the}} onboard navigational suite was introduced. An EKCO E160 radar unit was installed in <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4's nose cone, providing search functions as well as ground and cloud mapping capabilities, and a radar interface was built into <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4 cockpit along with redesigned instruments.|$|E
50|$|From 1954 until 1973, <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> {{participated in}} <b>the</b> Eastern Hockey League, {{dominating}} for ten of their nineteen seasons. Most notably, under head coach Pat Kelly, <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> posted a 315-208-64 (wins-losses-ties) record over eight seasons. During that period, in the 1967-68 season, <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> produced an awe-inspiring 57-5-10 record. <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> won <b>the</b> EHL playoffs in 1958-59, 1963-64, 1967-68, 1968-69 and 1969-70.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> started <b>the</b> season struggling, winning {{one game}} {{in their first}} nine. With the nearby Troy Slapshots failing to bring fans to the game (including one game that had an {{estimated}} 120 fans) and the inability for the team to pay several bills, the league decided to revoke the Slapshots' franchise on November 18, 1986. As a result, the league decided not have a dispersal draft for the league. Instead, they decided to give <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> <b>the</b> rights to the former Slapshots player for ten days. Twelve players who had skated with the Slapshots would see ice time with <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> throughout <b>the</b> season. <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> would also fire coach Bill Horton. In his place, <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> would hire Joe Selenski as their new coach and general manager. <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> would go 22-22-3 under Selenski and make <b>the</b> playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> would eventually lose to the Virginia Lancers four games to three in the Payne Trophy Finals.|$|R
2500|$|League {{president}} Donna Orender {{said that}} the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> was not {{a sign that the}} WNBA was in trouble. Former player Cynthia Cooper-Dyke {{said that the}} loss of <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> was [...] "disturbing news" [...] and that <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> were integral to the WNBA.|$|R
5|$|Comet 4C: This variant {{featured}} <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4's {{wings and}} the 4B's longer fuselage; 23 were produced.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, {{using its}} Medium Resolution Instrument, {{through a variety}} of filters. <b>The</b> <b>comet</b> was 1.75–2.11 astronomical units (AU) (2.62–3.16×108 km) from the Sun and 1.87–1.30 AU from the spacecraft. It was found that the outgassing from <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to the rotation of its nucleus. The dry ice content of <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> was measured and found to be about ten percent of its water ice content by number of molecules.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into <b>the</b> <b>comet.</b> At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> dust tail roughly {{followed}} {{the path of}} <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> orbit and <b>the</b> gas tail pointed almost directly away from the Sun, the sodium tail appeared to lie between the two. This implies that the sodium atoms are driven away from <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> head by radiation pressure.|$|R
50|$|The four novels which {{comprise}} the series {{look in on}} four periods of <b>the</b> Velvet <b>Comet's</b> lifespan, from early on in <b>the</b> <b>Comet's</b> life (Eros Ascending) to a period after <b>the</b> <b>Comet's</b> decommissioning (Eros at Nadir).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> {{also hold}} grudges with their {{cross-town}} neighbor Grove City High School. <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> {{had their first}} football meeting with Grove City, beating the Dawgs 28-21 led by Sophomore quarterback Kameron Peck in his first start as a varsity athlete. It's always a heated match between <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> and <b>the</b> Dawgs no matter which sport they meet in.|$|R
5|$|In 1953 <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> {{appeared}} to have achieved success for de Havilland. In addition to the sales to BOAC, two French airlines, Union Aéromaritime de Transport and Air France, each acquired three Comet 1As, an upgraded variant with greater fuel capacity, for flights to West Africa and the Middle East. A slightly longer version of <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 1 with more powerful engines, <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 2, was being developed, and orders were placed by Air India, British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines, Japan Air Lines, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, and Panair do Brasil. American carriers Capital Airlines, National Airlines, and Pan Am placed orders for the planned Comet 3, an even larger, longer-range version for transatlantic operations. Qantas was interested in <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 1 but concluded that a version with more range and better takeoff performance was needed for the London to Canberra route.|$|E
5|$|In 1959 BOAC began {{shifting}} its Comets from transatlantic {{routes and}} released <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> to associate companies, making <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4's ascendancy as a premier airliner brief. Besides the 707 and DC-8, {{the introduction of}} the Vickers VC10 allowed competing aircraft to assume the high-speed, long-range passenger service role pioneered by <b>the</b> <b>Comet.</b> In 1960, as part of a government-backed consolidation of the British aerospace industry, de Havilland itself was acquired by Hawker Siddeley, within which it became a wholly owned division.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet ISON. <b>The</b> <b>comet</b> remained observable until March 2013.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> had a 27-5 record (.844), {{good enough}} to receive home-court {{advantage}} over the Liberty (20-12). It did not matter, however, as <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> swept <b>the</b> Liberty.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>the</b> flyby of <b>Comet</b> Borrelly was a {{great success}} and {{returned}} extremely detailed images of <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> surface. Such images were of higher resolution than the only previous pictures, of Halley's <b>Comet</b> taken by <b>the</b> Giotto spacecraft. The PEPE instrument reported that <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> fields were offset from the nucleus. This {{is believed to be}} due to emission of jets, which were not distributed evenly across <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> surface.|$|R
50|$|IN late 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> ceased their {{alignment}} with the Cowboys {{and formed a}} far more beneficial {{alignment with}} the Brisbane Broncos. This relationship is still in place and has seen <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> and <b>the</b> Broncos prosper {{through the development of}} local players. The arrangement with the Broncos sees Broncos-contracted players that are not named in the weekly NRL side return to their home region and play for <b>the</b> <b>Comets.</b> Dave Taylor, PJ Marsh, Tommy Hewitt, Ben Hunt and Guy Williams have all played for <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> while being contracted to the Broncos.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after {{perihelion}} {{was reached}} on 17 September, <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> transited the Sun.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Comet</b> 4 first flew on 27 April 1958 and {{received}} its Certificate of Airworthiness on 24 September 1958; {{the first was}} delivered to BOAC the next day. The base price of a new Comet 4 was around £1,140,000, equivalent to £ in today's pounds. <b>The</b> <b>Comet</b> 4 enabled BOAC to inaugurate the first regular jet-powered transatlantic services on 4 October 1958 between London and New York (albeit still requiring a fuel stop at Gander International Airport, Newfoundland, on westward North Atlantic crossings). While BOAC gained publicity as the first to provide transatlantic jet service, {{by the end of}} the month rival Pan American World Airways was flying the Boeing 707 on the same route, and in 1960 the Douglas DC-8 as well. The American jets were larger, faster, longer-ranged, and more cost-effective than <b>the</b> <b>Comet.</b> After analysing route structures for <b>the</b> <b>Comet,</b> BOAC reluctantly cast about for a successor, and in 1956 entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase the 707.|$|E
50|$|The 2006 WNBA {{season was}} the tenth season for <b>the</b> Houston <b>Comets.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> {{qualified}} for <b>the</b> WNBA Playoffs for the 9th and {{last time in}} franchise history. It would also {{be the end of}} Van Chancellor's tenure as head coach of <b>the</b> <b>Comets.</b>|$|R
50|$|On September 15, 2008, <b>the</b> Houston <b>Comets</b> and <b>the</b> Sacramento Monarchs of the WNBA came {{to play in}} the Coliseum due to Hurricane Ike {{cancelling}} {{the final}} home game of the regular season for <b>the</b> Houston <b>Comets.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> defeated Sacramento 90-81. This would end up being the last game <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> ever played; they folded after the season ended.|$|R
50|$|From 1997 {{until early}} 2007, Alexander was {{the owner of}} <b>the</b> WNBA's Houston <b>Comets.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> won <b>the</b> league's first 4 WNBA championships from 1997 to 2000. He sold the team to Hilton Koch in January 2007, one year before <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> folded.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Comet</b> 4 was {{a further}} {{improvement}} on the stretched Comet 3 with even greater fuel capacity. The design had progressed {{significantly from the}} original Comet 1, growing by 18ft 6in (5.64m) and typically seating 74 to 81 passengers compared to <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 1's 36 to 44 (119 passengers could be accommodated in a special charter seating package in the later 4C series). <b>The</b> <b>Comet</b> 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher cruising speed and higher maximum takeoff weight. These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice the thrust of <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 1's Ghosts. Deliveries to BOAC began on 30 September 1958 with two 48-seat aircraft, which were used to initiate the first scheduled transatlantic services.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Comet</b> 4 {{was ordered}} by two other airlines: Aerolíneas Argentinas took {{delivery}} of six Comet 4s from 1959 to 1960, using them between Buenos Aires and Santiago, New York and Europe, while East African Airways received three new Comet 4s from 1960 to 1962 and operated {{them to the}} United Kingdom and to Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. <b>The</b> <b>Comet</b> 4A ordered by Capital Airlines was instead built for BEA as <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4B with a further fuselage stretch of 38in (97cm) and seating for 99 passengers. The first Comet 4B flew on 27 June 1959 and BEA began Tel Aviv to London-Heathrow services on 1 April 1960. Olympic Airways {{was the only other}} customer to order the type. The last Comet 4 variant, <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4C, first flew on 31 October 1959 and entered service with Mexicana in 1960. <b>The</b> <b>Comet</b> 4C had <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 4B's longer fuselage and the longer wings and extra fuel tanks of the original Comet 4, which gave it a longer range than the 4B. Ordered by Kuwait Airways, Middle East Airlines, Misrair (later United Arab Airlines), and Sudan Airways, it was the most popular Comet variant.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Comet</b> {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to <b>the</b> <b>Comet.</b>|$|E
50|$|On August 1, 2005, Staley {{was traded}} to <b>the</b> Houston <b>Comets.</b> Staley {{announced}} {{before the start of}} the WNBA season that she would be retiring after <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> season was over. <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> made <b>the</b> playoffs and faced the Sacramento Monarchs in the first round. The Monarchs swept <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> and won <b>the</b> series 2-0, ending Staley's career. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA.|$|R
500|$|Regarding {{the press}} conference of <b>the</b> <b>comet’s</b> discovery, Hale praised the {{reporting}} done by “the very first reporter that broke the story of <b>the</b> <b>comet’s</b> discovery,” <b>the</b> Albuquerque Journal’s science reporter John Fleck: ...|$|R
2500|$|Today, {{the team}} {{represents}} Canberra in the lower-level Futures League. <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> finished <b>the</b> 2005–06 season in fourth place with two outright wins. <b>The</b> <b>Comets</b> took out their first ever {{title in the}} 2010–11 season.|$|R
5|$|The Deep Impact {{mission was}} planned to help answer {{fundamental}} questions about comets, which included what {{makes up the}} composition of the comet's nucleus, what depth the crater would reach from the impact, and where <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> originated in its formation. By observing the composition of <b>the</b> <b>comet,</b> astronomers hoped to determine how comets form based on the differences between the interior and exterior makeup of <b>the</b> <b>comet.</b> Observations of the impact and its aftermath would allow astronomers to attempt to determine the answers to these questions.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>comet</b> {{continued}} to fade as it receded, {{but is still}} being tracked by astronomers. In October 2007, 10 years after the perihelion and at distance of 25.7 AU from Sun, <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> was still active {{as indicated by the}} detection of the CO-driven coma. Herschel Space Observatory images taken in 2010 suggest comet Hale–Bopp is covered in a fresh frost layer. Hale–Bopp was again detected in December 2010 when it was 30.7 AU away from the Sun, and on August 7, 2012 at a 33.2 AU distance from the Sun. Astronomers expect that <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020, by which time it will be nearing 30thmagnitude. By this time it will become very difficult to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> from the large numbers of distant galaxies of similar brightness.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>comet</b> {{was bright}} enough to be visible next to the Sun in the daytime sky at its perihelion.|$|E
