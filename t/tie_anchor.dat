40|$|The {{invention}} to be hereinafter described {{relates to}} insulators and more particularly to strain insulators for wire antennas. It {{has long been}} common practice to use with antenna wires on airplanes the well known porcelain or ceramic insulator, the wire ends being looped through or about the insulator, and brought back and twisted about the wire to <b>tie,</b> <b>anchor</b> or securely attach or fasten the insulator to the antenna. The produces small wire-end surfaces or other small wire surfaces, where the wires are would or twisted, which under certain atmospheric conditions are favorable to corona discharges. When the corona discharge is produced on a place it frequently completely obscures, submerges or, in substance, blanks out the signals of the radio so that the radio set of the plane becomes, practically, useless. The atmospheric conditions conducive to such corona discharge are frequently encountered by airplanes, especially when flying at high altitudes. Obviously, it is extremely important that the radio sets of planes should function well under such adverse conditions. The main objects of the present invention are to overcome the above and other objections and provide a simple, efficient, and compact strain insulator which may be produced in quantity at low cost...|$|E

40|$|Question: How {{does one}} tie down {{items that are}} put into the bed {{of a pickup truck}} without causing damage to the body of the truck and have the ring {{disappear}} as well as be flush with the body? Rationale: With the increase of pickup trucks on the road, {{there is a need to}} tie items down securely in the bed to keep the public safe while the vehicle is in motion, as well as when parked. In most pickup trucks there are post/pole holes built into the bed that allows the users to put in either <b>tie</b> down <b>anchors</b> or pole/post made from wood. The problem with the <b>tie</b> down <b>anchors</b> is that they either fold/slide to attach items to the truck, but they all sit on top of the body. This doesn’t allow the driver to place items on top of the trucks bed, give the driver the option to put the ring away, and have weight restrictions; thus requiring a device for these tasks. Over the past year a device has been proposed, designed, and built to do these tasks, as well as offer features that other <b>tie</b> down <b>anchors</b> do not have. The results have shown that this device is able to do the task it is required to do; thus allowing this device to compete with the current benchmarks out in the market...|$|R

ISBN 978 - 1 - 138 - 02999 - 6 An experimental study {{was carried out}} to analyse the tension and compression behaviour of wall <b>ties</b> <b>anchoring</b> brick veneer walls to masonry infill walls as the backing support. Connection subassemblies were tested under monotonic and cyclic loading, simulating out-of-plane loading of veneer wall systems {{in order to understand}} the influence of six different ties with different design, thickness and attachment methods in the strength, stiffness and failure modes of the connection system. Experimental results from this study show more details about the behaviour of this system and importance of determined parameters. Tensile resistance capacity can be more influenced by wall tie design, while tie thickness was considered to be the most important parameter in compression behaviour. Attachment methods studied do not considered a very influential factor. This study can help to understand and justify the contribution of these elements for the mechanical masonry veneer walls under different loading conditions.

40|$|Currently, most of {{railway track}} {{inspections}} are manually conducted by railroad track inspectors.

This inspection takes too much time to inspect the defected railway track and then inform to the railway authority people. In this way it may lead to disaster. Hence to avoid delay and improve the accuracy, our propose system will automatically inspect the railway track by using vision based method and vibration based method. This method proposes continuous monitoring and assessment of the condition of the rail tracks which prevent major disasters.

The system provides real-time monitoring and structural condition for railway track using vision based method and calibration to search the fault location on the track. Inspections include detecting defects on tracks, missing bolts, <b>anchor,</b> <b>tie</b> plate and clips etc. In vision based method camera we will use to capture the images or videos.

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT The {{approaches}} to the Terrace Tunnel on the Wellington Urban Motorway (State Highway 1) have large retaining structures that support the cuttings. The retaining structures are supported by a system of <b>anchors</b> <b>tied</b> back to <b>anchor</b> drive tunnels constructed in the hillside behind the walls. The retaining walls were designed in the 1970 ’s using a peak ground acceleration of 0. 25 g. Transit New Zealand commissioned Opus International Consultants to develop a maintenance strategy for the large approach walls. The strategy identified {{the need for a}} seismic performance assessment of these structures. The seismic performance of the walls was assessed for earthquakes with return periods of 475 years (operating level, 0. 38 g), 1000 years (design level, 0. 48 g) and a maximum credible earthquake (MCE) (contingency level, 0. 75 g). The factor of safety against slope instability was found to be less than one for the design level and MCE events. The resulting slope displacements of up to 350 mm are likely to be accommodated by ductile behaviour of the high capacity MacAlloy anchors. The assessment therefore concluded that collapse of the structures is not likely. The structure therefore meets its performance expectation of minimum damage in a design earthquake event and no collapse in a contingency level MCE event. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>tie</b> rod <b>anchor</b> plates is {{at present}} not well established, and the criteria suggested {{do not seem}} to have consistent theoretical basis. This paper suggests a theoretical approach to determine the load-carrying capacity of stiff anchor plates acting on a masonry wall. According to this approach the punching strength is the lower of two values. The first value follows from the hypothesis that collapse occurs because of the slippage of the units on the mortar bed, whereas the second comes from the alternative hypothesis that punching creates a solid consisting of a truncated cone in which the outer face is the surface of the anchor plate (units break whereas the mortar does not crumble). When doing so it is supposed that the anchor plate is so stiff that pressure it applies on the masonry wall is almost constant. The issue of setting an adequate stiffness is solved for the most common types of anchor plate. Some numerical examples show the capabilities of the suggested approach...|$|R
