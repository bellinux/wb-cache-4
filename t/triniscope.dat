2500|$|The problem, however, was how {{to combine}} the three {{separate}} signals back into a single display. The system used in the cameras, with three separate tubes combined together optically, was not practical due {{to the cost of}} a receiver set with three CRTs as well as the unwieldily chassis needed to contain them. One such example was the RCA <b>Triniscope,</b> which produced useful images but was extremely complex, required constant adjustment, and {{was the size of a}} contemporary refrigerator to produce a [...] display. A number of experiments were carried out using more conventional tubes and then filtering them, but the low output of the CRTs produced very dim images that were dismissed as impractical.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Triniscope</b> was {{an early}} color {{television}} system developed by RCA. It used three separate video tubes with colored phosphors producing the primary colors, combining the images through dichroic mirrors onto a screen for viewing.|$|E
50|$|However, {{during the}} same period the first video tape systems were being introduced, and the expense of the color {{printing}} used in the <b>Triniscope</b> made it an expensive option. Improvements in color film technology improved the system and work on the concept continued into the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consumer}} system it was enormous, expensive, impractical, and dropped {{as soon as}} the shadow mask system was successful. However, the <b>Triniscope</b> idea was used commercially in several niche roles for years, notably as a color replacement for the kinescope, from which it took its name.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Triniscope</b> {{was first}} used as a color analog of the {{existing}} kinescope systems it was originally developed from. NBC and Path√© demonstrated a working system as early as 1954. However, in tests the system proved to be only [...] "resonsable" [...] so development continued {{in order to improve}} the quality.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the shadow}} mask worked, {{it had a}} number of {{practical}} drawbacks. Notable among these was the dim images it produced as a side-effect of the mask blocking off most of the power from the electron guns. Development of other solutions to the color problem continued throughout the 1950s and 60s, including commercial development of the <b>Triniscope.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} color {{meetings}} {{hosted by the}} FCC, the selection board {{made it clear they}} did not consider the <b>Triniscope</b> to be an acceptable solution. They allowed RCA to use the system in order to illustrate the dot-sequential system, but stated that only a system with a single display tube would be selected. In any event, RCA's displays never produced a reasonable image in testing.|$|E
50|$|There were {{numerous}} {{problems with the}} arrangement. The first, and most difficult to solve, was that the resulting system was enormous. One example system using three 10-inch kinescope monitors, was 40-inches high, 38-inches wide and 21-inches deep. This was {{the smallest of the}} <b>Triniscope</b> models produced with a reasonable display size; others had smaller chassis, but only at the cost of much smaller displays.|$|E
50|$|As the FCC {{meetings}} {{evolved into}} the NTSC, other researchers at RCA were {{hard at work on}} the competing shadow mask concept. By the time the next set of presentations was ready, shadow mask tubes using one or three guns were available. These did not fare any better in viewing tests, but critically, it was due to the signaling system, not the tubes. By that point, RCA had abandoned further development of the <b>Triniscope.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Triniscope</b> {{also saw}} limited {{development}} for consumer television use. One {{example is the}} Mitsubishi 6CT-338, which used three 5-inch CRTs arranged behind a faux screen {{on the front of}} the display. The image was viewable as a small image centered within the larger faux screen. Using three separate tube resulted in image brightness no shadow mask set could match, but because the image was [...] "behind" [...] the front of the display, the system had a limited display angle.|$|E
