Decisions about resource allocation were devolved to front line social work staff giving them greater autonomy within <b>clear</b> <b>expenditure</b> parameters.

40|$|Although {{there are}} obvious {{differences}} in the political systems of China and India, there are surprising similarities in their respective approaches to decentralization. Both countries face similar design issues with their intergovernmental systems, such as the lack of <b>clear</b> <b>expenditure</b> assignments, high transfer dependency, low revenue autonomy, and soft budget constraints. As a result, in both countries {{there is a lack}} of aggregate fiscal discipline among sub-national governments, and the quality of sub-national government service delivery is poor. Poor service delivery and the lack of fiscal discipline threaten the ability of both countries to sustain high rates of economic growth.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} economic {{developments in}} Malawi during the 1990 s. Malawi’s economy began to deteriorate in late 1991 {{as a result}} of a series of exogenous shocks. These shocks included two major droughts, a severe weakening in the terms of trade, and a suspension of donor nonhumanitarian aid owing to concern over governance. As a consequence, the average real GDP growth fell from 6 percent a year in 1989 – 91 to - 3 percent a year in 1992 – 94. Savings and investment also fell considerably.

40|$|The {{process of}} gradual {{administrative}} and political decentralization in Bulgaria started in 1991 with {{the adoption of}} the Local Self-Government and Local Administration Act, but the real financial decentralization process started in the beginning of 2003 with the adoption of a comparatively <b>clear</b> <b>expenditure</b> assignment and introduction of a transparent and predictable intergovernmental transfer system. Basically, a key issue in the design of fiscal federalism is the financing of subnational governments. Because of the advantages of taxation at the central level and spending at the decentralized level during the transition period Bulgaria has often ended up with vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances. In most of the fiscal years the decentralization of expenditures was not accompanied by equivalent revenue-raising responsibilities and the taxable base was unevenly distributed within the country territory. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to study and critically analyze the financial decentralization reform in Bulgaria, outlining the key achievements and basic weaknesses of the local taxation and the intergovernmental fiscal relations. financial decentralization, local finance, intergovernmental fiscal relations, local government, local taxation...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} gradual {{administrative}} and political decentralization in Bulgaria started in 1991, {{but the real}} financial decentralization process started {{in the beginning of}} 2003 with the adoption of a comparatively <b>clear</b> <b>expenditure</b> assignment and introduction of a transparent and predictable intergovernmental transfer system. Step by step, local governments have been given full control over some of the own-source revenues (local fees, service prices and revenues from municipal asset management) and limited control over the local tax levy. This study is intended to examine and critically analyze the financial decentralization reform in Bulgaria, outlining the key achievements and basic weaknesses of expenditure assignment, local taxation and intergovernmental fiscal relations. The results indicate that local governments gradually became powerful component of the public sector. Although reducing financial resources of the public sector, worldwide economic and financial crisis can turn into an opportunity for some of the local governments in the country to gain financial independence and concentrate the efforts on strengthening local tax capacity.
