5|$|Thus as Wagner's stock rose, Meyerbeer's fell. In 1890, <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Paris {{premiere of}} Wagner's Lohengrin, {{there were no}} Wagner {{performances}} at the Paris Opéra, and 32 performances of Meyerbeer's four grand operas.

He then sent Şeremet bey to Ohrid, a city close to Skanderbeg's domains, with 14,000 cavalry to prevent another Albanian incursion. After learning of this, Skanderbeg prepared to march against Şeremet. The pasha's men, however, were stationed {{both inside and}} outside the city, making it difficult to defeat them. Before marching, Skanderbeg received news that Pius had arrived in Ancona and died upon seeing the crusader fleet. He left Cimarosto with an Italian force in Valikardhë (near modern-day Bulqizë in eastern Albania). Skanderbeg then decided to march against Şeremet anyway and set off with 12,000 cavalry three hours after dusk. After one day of marching, Skanderbeg reached Macedonia and began pillaging the land.|$|E
5|$|Anne Hyde (12 March 163731 March 1671) was Duchess of York and of Albany as {{the first}} wife of the future King James II of England.

James and Anne had eight children, but six died in early childhood.

5|$|Cleveland {{held its}} {{training}} camp at Bowling Green University, {{as it did}} <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> Browns played one preseason game in late August against the Baltimore Colts, a new AAFC team formed to replace the Miami Seahawks after the Seahawks folded. The Browns scored their first points on a drive in the second period. A 14-yard run by fullback Marion Motley set up a 25-yard touchdown throw by quarterback Otto Graham to end Mac Speedie. Cleveland scored three more touchdowns in the game, all of them following Colts passes the Browns intercepted. One {{of them was a}} pass by Graham to end Dante Lavelli in the third quarter, and another was a rush by halfback Edgar Jones. Paul Brown pulled most of the Browns' starters from the game as the team built up a three-touchdown lead. Backup end Bob Cowan scored a fourth Cleveland touchdown in the final quarter on a pass from backup quarterback Ermal Allen, and the Browns won 28–0. Following the victory, the Browns faced the Buffalo Bills in the regular-season opener at Cleveland Stadium to begin their defense of the AAFC championship.|$|E

5|$|Hardenbergh's {{design was}} {{described}} as employing both Gothic elements and classical forms that preceded the extreme eclecticism that was to mark a later Victorian Gothic Revival period. The original plans called for the building to be constructed out of red brick, but the final execution was mostly in sandstone quarried in Connecticut, with some examples of stone from Newark. Geology Hall, built {{on the south side}} of Old Queens, was the second of three projects that Hardenberg designed for the college, following an addition to a building (now Alexander Johnston Hall) that housed the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School) <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> third project, Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873), was designed to complement the simple Gothic Revival style of Geology Hall and was erected on the north side of Old Queens.|$|E

5|$|The battalion's first {{experience}} of combat came during {{an attack against}} the Italian garrison at Giarabub in March 1941.

In early 1942, following Japan's entry into the war, the 2/10th was withdrawn to Australia and in August 1942, {{at the height of}} the Japanese advance in the Pacific, the battalion was committed to the fighting around Milne Bay, suffering heavy casualties in their debut in the Pacific. Further fighting came during the Battle of Buna–Gona before the 2/10th was brought back to Australia for reorganisation in March 1943. In August 1943, they returned to New Guinea, first undertaking jungle training near Port Moresby and then, in December 1943, moving inland into the Finisterre Mountains where they later fought the Battle for Shaggy Ridge. After being withdrawn to Australia in mid-1944, the battalion did not take part in further fighting until the final months of the war when they were committed to the fighting on Balikpapan in July 1945. At the conclusion of hostilities, the 2/10th Battalion was disbanded in December 1945.|$|E

5|$|The Browns' perfect {{season and}} third {{championship}} victory came during a strong year for Cleveland sports teams. That April, the Cleveland Barons, the city's American Hockey League team, won the Calder Cup championship. The Cleveland Indians, the city's Major League Baseball club, set an all-time season attendance record {{and won the}} World Series. The Browns' success was also a major draw for fans: the team led professional football in attendance in 1948 {{with an average of}} 45,517 people per game, although that was still 10,000 lower than <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> distribution of talent and fortune among AAFC's teams was unbalanced, however, and while the Browns, the 49ers and the Dons were successes at the gate, teams including the Rockets and Colts languished financially. The NFL was also facing major financial trouble – nine of its ten teams lost money that year – and the two leagues' competition for talent led to talks about a merger. Discussions centered around how many AAFC teams the NFL would absorb; most owners favored four teams, but the talks broke down when powerful owners George Preston Marshall of the Washington Redskins and Tim Mara of the New York Giants intervened and suggested only Cleveland and San Francisco should be absorbed. The AAFC continued play in 1949, but was disbanded after that season. The Browns, 49ers and Colts were merged into the NFL starting in 1950.|$|E
