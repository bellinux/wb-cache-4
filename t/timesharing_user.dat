5000|$|In 1968, {{three former}} {{employees}} from the General Electric computer company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona {{set out to}} start their own software development house. A. Leroy Ellison, Harry N. Cantrell, and Russell E. Edwards found themselves doing a large number of calculations when making tables for the business plans that they were presenting to venture capitalists. They decided to save themselves a lot of effort and wrote a computer program that produced their tables for them. This program, originally conceived as a simple utility for their personal use, {{would turn out to be}} the first software product offered by the company that would become known as Capex Corporation. [...] "AutoPlan" [...] ran on GE’s Time-sharing service; afterward, a version that ran on IBM mainframes was introduced under the name AutoTab. (National CSS offered a similar product, CSSTAB, which had a moderate <b>timesharing</b> <b>user</b> base by the early 1970s. A major application was opinion research tabulation.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, MCP was {{enhanced}} {{to support}} Sperry Univac terminals and its name {{was changed to}} COS (Communication Operating System). Ports in the CCM {{and later in the}} MCC running in emulation mode could be designated either interactive or transactional, but not both. If a port was designated an interactive port, it was controlled by the timesharing services integrated into the VMOS or VS/9 operating system. Transactional ports, on the other hand, were controlled by COS. All terminals connected to these ports became the [...] "property" [...] of the respective controlling host software. Timesharing was used for program development allowing much faster program development than the traditional batch process which was state of the art at the time. Each <b>timesharing</b> <b>user</b> was a task by itself and could execute programs, create files, and request system resources as needed. What made much of this possible was the operating system's ability to manage [...] "virtual memory", or temporarily save pages of memory (including executing programs) to disk or drum while not in use and then retrieve them later as needed. Virtual memory page size was fixed at 4096 bytes. This allowed many more tasks to be running simultaneously than would otherwise be constrained by limited and expensive main memory space. Transactional users, on the other hand, were all controlled by a single program and their view of the environment was limited to that which was presented to them. They were not identified as individual tasks and did not have the ability to run programs or request system resources.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967, CP/CMS {{production}} use began, {{first on}} CSC's CP-40, {{then later on}} CP-67 at Lincoln Laboratories and other sites. It was made available via the IBM Type-III Library in 1968. By 1972, CP/CMS had gone through several releases; it was a robust, stable system running on 44 systems; it could support 60 <b>timesharing</b> <b>users</b> on a S/360-67; {{and at least two}} commercial timesharing vendors (National CSS and IDC) were reselling S/360-67 time using CP/CMS technology.|$|R
50|$|I. P. Sharp Associates offered <b>timesharing</b> <b>users</b> {{access to}} a variety of databases, plus {{sophisticated}} packages for statistical analysis, forecasting, reporting, and graphing data. Databases included historical stock market time series data, econometric data, and airline data. All of these were available from the 39 MAGIC workspace, an easy-to-use time series, query, and reporting language, which among other things featured integrated high-quality business graphics from Superplot. In 1982, IPSA produced its first printed catalog of all online databases and proceeded to document for its customers the content and use of single databases or sets of databases.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} the {{personal}} computer, with the Altair 8800 in 1975, changed the field of software in general, with specific implications for educational software. Whereas users prior to 1975 were dependent upon university or government owned mainframe computers with <b>timesharing,</b> <b>users</b> after this shift could create and use software for computers in homes and schools, computers available for less than $2000. By the early 1980s, the availability of personal computers including the Apple II (1977), Commodore PET (1977), Commodore VIC-20 (1980), and Commodore 64 (1982) allowed {{for the creation of}} companies and nonprofits which specialized in educational software. Brøderbund and The Learning Company are key companies from this period, and MECC, the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, a key non-profit software developer. These and other companies designed a range of titles for personal computers, with the bulk of the software initially developed for the Apple II.|$|R

5000|$|The Dartmouth Time Sharing System's creators {{wrote in}} 1968 that [...] "any {{response}} time which averages more than 10 seconds destroys {{the illusion of}} having one's own computer". Conversely, <b>timesharing</b> <b>users</b> thought that their terminal was the computer. With the rise of microcomputing in the early 1980s, time-sharing faded into the background because individual microprocessors were sufficiently inexpensive that a single person could have all the CPU time dedicated solely to their needs, even when idle. However, the Internet brought the general concept of time-sharing back into popularity. Expensive corporate server farms costing millions can host thousands of customers all sharing the same common resources. As with the early serial terminals, web sites operate primarily in bursts of activity followed by periods of idle time. This bursting nature permits the service {{to be used by}} many customers at once, usually with no perceptible communication delays, unless the servers start to get very busy.|$|R
50|$|The Fairchild F8 {{microcomputer}} evolved during 1974 and 1975. The {{first set}} of integrated circuits were available to engineers in 1975. These 40-pin integrated circuits required documentation for putting the F8 microcomputer to work. The Preliminary F8 Microcomputer Data Book from Fairchild Semiconductor carries the date June 27, 1975. A Guide to Programming the Fairchild F8 Microcomputer also carries the date June 27, 1975. Another document titled A <b>Timeshare</b> <b>Users</b> Guide for the Fairchild F8 Microcomputer was published August 7, 1975 as Revision A. In September 1975 Fairchild published User's Manual F8 Design Evaluation Kit Number 1. These documents were meant to accompany the Fairchild F8 Design Evaluation Kit 1 which was being sold to engineers. Kit 1 was an 8-bit microprocessor on a single circuit board. The board had three 40-pin ICs: F3850, F3851, F3853. The F3850 held the Central Processing Unit. The F3851 held a Read-Only Memory that contained a program called Fairbug. The F3853 contained circuitry to interface to {{static random access memory}} of 64K bytes. The circuit board allowed a simple interface to a Teletype for interacting with the Fairbug program.|$|R
5000|$|The LANPAR {{system was}} {{implemented}} on GE400 and Honeywell 6000 online <b>timesharing</b> systems enabling <b>users</b> to program remotely via computer terminals and modems. Data could be entered dynamically either by paper tape, specific file access, on line, or even external data bases. Sophisticated mathematical expressions including logical comparisons and [...] "if/then" [...] statements {{could be used}} in any cell, and cells could be presented in any order.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{individuals who}} have acquired an extraordinary number of vacation ownership (timeshare) points or weeks and utilize their ownership {{for the purposes of}} generating income by renting their room reservations to the third parties. Individuals who operate in this context have been referred to as mega-renters on blogs such as the <b>Timeshare</b> <b>Users</b> Group website (Tug 2. net), commonly referred to as Tug, which is an online forum where owners of timeshare share information about their ownership. The timeshare or vacation ownership product is a leisure product that provides consumers luxury accommodations and or vacation experiences. Academic opinion based on net present value (NPV) analyses on the value of the vacation ownership product in comparison to renting hotel accommodations is mixed. What is consistent in the academic research is that the vacation ownership product should be purchased for one 2 ̆ 7 s personal enjoyment and not as an investment. This study attempted to answer the research question of: Who are mega-renters and how do they operate? Identifying how mega-renters operate can assist other individuals considering developing a rental business to operate more effectively and pre-identify operating risks. Understanding how mega-renters operate can benefit vacation ownership companies in yield management of their resort properties and identifying opportunities in managing aspects of their owner program or policies. Using an exploratory multi-case study approach, four in-depth interviews were conducted with participants solicited from Tug. A cross-case analysis was conducted applying the methodology suggested by Stake (2006) to develop assertions on how mega-renters operate. A conceptual model is presented based on the study 2 ̆ 7 s findings illustrating the manner in which mega-renters may acquire and distribute their inventory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} {{multidisciplinary}} (economic, socio-cultural and legal) analysis of tourism sustainability {{in national parks}} through {{the conclusion of the}} timesharing contract with special (all inclusive) services provided by national parks. National parks might apply the timesharing contract model for achieving tourism sustainability by building tourist objects (villas and apartments) on the outskirts of national parks (areas outside the protected zone) providing <b>timesharing</b> service <b>users</b> with services that national parks offer through their natural resources. Such a timesharing contract with “all inclusive ” services should be primarily concluded by means of the right to use system, in which the owner or the proprietor would be a person in charge of the national park management and the user a person who takes advantage of the entire service package once in a year (from the timesharing accommodation to services such as photo-safari, boat excursions, cycling trails, etc.) or sub-leases his own facility and pertaining package of services. In such a process {{it is very important that}} the mentioned model pays attention to maintain the number of such guests on the annual level in a national park, while ad hoc guests remain, from the point of view of tourism sustainability, a variable, that is, an unstable factor. In certain situations even the fee simple system o...|$|R
