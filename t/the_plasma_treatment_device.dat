The waxy {{wheat straw}} surface and high SiO 2 content of wheat straw agrifibres make wheat straw-based panel {{production}} {{much more difficult}} than traditional wood-based panel manufacture. Plasma surface modification is {{regarded as one of the}} cost effective surface treatment techniques for many materials including natural fibers. In this study, plasma technique was employed to treat the surface of wheat straw. After <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>treatment,</b> <b>the</b> surface properties were then evaluated by determining the contact angles of 3 liquids on the wheat straw surface and by analysis using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed that the contact angles of water, glycerol, and UF resin after <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>treatment</b> decreased by 44. 1 %, 18. 6 %, and 24. 9 %, respectively.
