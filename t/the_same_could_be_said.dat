5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E

The game was due to be played on 15 March, the day after their arrival, but most had not yet fully recovered.

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, Manchester gained a {{pioneering}} reputation {{for a city}} at the centre of physics, namely {{in the field of}} nuclear physics. The 'Nuclear Family' was the alias given to a group of scientists who studied nuclear physics in Manchester. 'Family' highlights the consistent development through the generations in nuclear physics, beginning with Thomson in the late 18th century and ending with James Chadwick in the 1930s who discovered the neutron. Ernest Rutherford is often described as the 'father of nuclear physics', equally <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of J. J. Thomson who discovered the electron and isotopes, and ultimately taught Rutherford who later go on to split the atom. Scientists who were part of the 'nuclear family' in Manchester included J. J.

500|$|In 1921 Wilkinson {{attended}} the Red International of Labour Unions Congress and the Second Congress of Communist Women in Moscow, {{where she met}} several Russian communist leaders, including the Defence Minister Leon Trotsky, and Nadezhda Krupskaya, the educationist who was Lenin's wife; Wilkinson considered Krupskaya's speech the best at the Congress. The main outcome of the gathering was {{the foundation of the}} Red International of Labour Unions, often known as the [...] "Profintern". The aim of this organisation was to seek revolutionary change through industrial action, leading to the overthrow of world capitalism. At home, although she failed to persuade her union, NUDAW, to affiliate to the Profintern, Wilkinson continued to promote Russian achievements, especially its emancipation of women workers. In November 1922, at a meeting celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Wilkinson said that the Russian people could look forward with hope, and asked whether <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of the people condemned to live their lives in the slums of Manchester. However, Wilkinson found herself increasingly at odds with communists in Manchester, over the party's industrial and wider international strategies.|$|E

[...] Justin Chang of Variety extolled the film as [...] "a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie."

[...] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a [...] "B+", stating that [...] "the cast vanishes into their parts...buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent, Winslet's chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender, whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel." [...] He also noted that Boyle [...] "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece." ...|$|E

[...] While to an extent this may be true, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of most eras until the early 20th century, the Neo-Renaissance {{in the hands of}} provincial architects did develop into a style not always instantly recognisable as a derivative of the Renaissance.

2500|$|Glazunov's musical {{development}} was paradoxical. He was adopted as an idol by nationalist composers {{who had been}} largely self-taught and, apart from Rimsky-Korsakov, were deeply distrustful of academic technique. Glazunov's first two symphonies {{could be seen as}} an anthology of nationalist techniques as practiced by Balakirev and Borodin; <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for his symphonic poem Stenka Razin with its use of the folk song [...] "Volga Boatmen" [...] and orientalist practices much like those employed by The Five. By his early 20s he realized the polemic battles between academicism and nationalism were no longer valid. Although he based his compositions on Russian popular music, Glazunov's technical mastery allowed him to write in a sophisticated, cultured idiom. With his Third Symphony, he consciously attempted to internationalize his music {{in a manner similar to}} Tchaikovsky, to whom the piece is dedicated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} Scappaticci's would {{eventually}} {{be replaced by the}} Raj Indian restaurant (i) is indicative of the post war influx of Asian immigrants to Scotland and the popularity of their food with the local population. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for the presence of Henderson Street's Chinese restaurant, Golden Bridge (vii). More recently, one of Henderson Street's oldest bars, The Bay Horse (located at number 6365 and in operation as a spirit merchant since 1897) has succumbed to this international influence. Early photographic records show The Bay Horse circa 1910. Its proprietor, at that time, was a Charles G. Lane, who had been in possession of the pub since 1902. In the 1990s, the bar became Kalinka's (ix), a vodka bar operated by a Russian Countess [...] and since 2005, the pub has once again been reincarnated as Sofi's (vi), now with a Swedish theme and Swedish owners.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{era when}} {{scientists}} did not travel so frequently as today, Huxley was an exception, for he travelled widely in Europe, Africa and the United States. He was therefore able to learn from and influence other scientists, naturalists and administrators. In the US {{he was able to}} meet other evolutionists at a critical time in the reassessment of natural selection. In Africa he was able to influence colonial administrators about education and wild-life conservation. In Europe, through UNESCO, he was at the centre of the post-World War II revival of education. In Russia, however, his experiences were mixed. His initially favourable view was changed by his growing awareness of Stalin's murderous repression, and the Lysenko affair. There seems little evidence that he had any effect on the Soviet Union, and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for some other Western scientists."Marxist-Leninism had become a dogmatic religion… and like all dogmatic religions, it had turned from reform to persecution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nearly all of Vysotsky's {{songs are}} in the first person, {{although}} he is almost never the narrator. When singing his criminal songs, he would adopt the accent and intonation of a Moscow thief, and when singing war songs, he would sing {{from the point of}} view of a soldier. In many of his philosophical songs, he adopted the role of inanimate objects. This created some confusion about Vysotsky's background, especially during the early years when information could not be passed around very easily. Using his acting talent, the poet played his role so well that until told otherwise, many of his fans believed that he was, indeed, a criminal or war veteran. Vysotsky's father said that [...] "War veterans thought the author of the songs to be one of them, as if he had participated in the war together with them." [...] <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about mountain climbers; on multiple occasions, Vysotsky was sent pictures of mountain climbers' graves with quotes from his lyrics etched on the tombstones.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{source of}} the first duel is the Kaijo Monogatari. The entry in the Kaijo Monogatari {{was written in the}} 17th century but the exact year is debated.

The sources agree on the core of the story however; that Gonnosuke faced Musashi and was defeated, after which he retreated and formed his jo-techniques. The notion that Musashi was defeated in a rematch can be argued to have been a later construct by later pro-Gonnosuke historians, as there is no mentioning of a defeat in the sources regarding Musashi. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> however, for Musashi's followers who might have removed all mentioning of Musashi's defeat as a way to preserve his reputation. Another mentioning of the first duel is found in the Niten-Ki which was compiled by Musashi's followers years after his death. There is only one known source mentioning the rematch. It is a scroll now preserved in Tsukuba Shrine in Ibaraki prefecture, although doubts of its contents has been raised, partially because there are no other known corroborating sources to confirm it.|$|E
