5|$|In {{addition}} to standard usages {{listed in the}} law, the emblem {{has been used in}} various other circumstances. The emblem is displayed, along with the national flag, at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> end of a video clip with the Belarusian anthem My Belarusy, regularly played on Belarusian television. Another use of the emblem is on ballot boxes and campaign mailings used during national and local elections. The emblem also appears on Belarus's border posts.|$|E
5|$|Outside the National Day {{celebrations}} period, {{the national}} flag of Singapore is flown from all buildings housing government and government-related departments, such as armed forces installations, court houses, offices, and educational institutions. A {{picture of the}} flag is commonly found in each classroom, and schools conduct ceremonies at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the school}} day at which the national flag is raised and lowered, the national anthem is sung and the national pledge is taken.|$|E

5|$|Since Michelangelo {{executed}} {{the nine}} Biblical scenes in reverse chronological order, some {{analyses of the}} frescoes of the vault commence with the Drunkenness of Noah.

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ken Levine and David Isaacs, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was the first episode of The Simpsons Kirkland directed. He has since directed over 50 episodes. Executive producer James L. Brooks {{came up with the}} idea of the Moe's Tavern wraparounds at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> end of the episode. It was added because the writers did not know how to end the episode. Levine had worked as a minor league baseball announcer before the episode was produced so he was able to give directions to the animators on the characters' looks and ambiance of the episode.|$|E
5|$|The fourth was {{performed}} at the Apollo Theater in 2002 and at the 50th American Bandstand Special in 2002 and is a variation of both {{the second and third}} version. There are clicking beats as with the 1999 mix, but only replacing the finger snaps in <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> main beat begins as it does in the 1995 mix. Additionally during the performance at the 50th American Bandstand Special, Jackson briefly sang a section live towards the end and even threw his hat off along with the jacket. Jackson's performance at the Apollo Theather marks his last live performance ever.|$|E

5|$|Beyoncé then {{sings the}} chorus again and dances in her red dress {{in front of}} the background. Mc Lyte and Free are seen at a {{backyard}} barbecue party as Mc Lyte's verse begins and she mingles with the party guests, with Elliott as the party DJ. Again, Beyoncé comes back to sing the chorus of the song, now at the barbecue party, with scenes of her dancing in a room of the mansion and scenes from the movie in which she is singing on a stage in front of a large audience with a group of people behind her. With the end of the final chorus, the song moves back to Elliott and Lyte, with the former on her rollerskates as in <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> latter {{in front of the}} semi-circle of men. The video ends with the four of them sitting at a picnic table at the barbecue party as two small girls clap hands on the opposite bench.|$|E
5|$|Every {{night after}} shooting, editor Colin Goudie and his {{assistant}} Justin Hall would download the footage so the memory sticks could be cleared and {{ready for the next}} day. While new footage was being captured, the previously filmed footage was edited at the production team's hotel. After filming concluded, the crew had over 100 hours of footage. The original cut was over four hours long but was trimmed to 94 minutes after eight months of editing. Edwards originally had the ending of the film both at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> end. He and the film's producers disagreed about the placement, so he decided to put the chronological ending of the film {{at the beginning and end}} the film immediately after Andrew and Samantha kiss.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} uses social cues in its {{evaluation}} and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it listens to the post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of reproductive success. Near {{the end of a}} breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.|$|E

5|$|The {{office of}} {{governor}} {{was established by}} the first New York State Constitution in 1777. The governor was originally for a term of three years, though the constitution did not specify when the term began. A 1787 law set {{the start of the}} term at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the state constitution, reducing the term of office to two years, moving the election to November, and moving <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> end of the term to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended the term of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it to two years. The most recent constitution of 1938 extended the term to the current four years. There is no limit to the number of consecutive terms a governor may serve.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E
