5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. <b>This</b> <b>prediction</b> was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E
5|$|Closely {{related to}} light {{deflection}} is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals {{take longer to}} move through a gravitational field than they would {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of <b>this</b> <b>prediction.</b> In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Glenn T. Seaborg, who {{devised the}} {{actinide}} concept that elements 89 to 103 formed an actinide series homologous to the lanthanide series from elements 57 to 71, predicted that element 103 (lawrencium) should be its final member {{and that the}} Lr3+ ion should be about as stable as Lu3+ in aqueous solution. It was not until decades later that element 103 was finally conclusively synthesized and <b>this</b> <b>prediction</b> was experimentally confirmed.|$|E

In this work, we develop an efficient lossless image compression scheme called super-spatial structure <b>prediction.</b> <b>This</b> super-spatial <b>prediction</b> is motivated by motion prediction in video coding, attempting to find an optimal prediction of structure components within previously encoded image regions.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of nobelium is incompletely characterized {{and is known}} only in aqueous solution, in which it can take on the +3 or +2 oxidation states, the latter being more stable. It was largely expected before the discovery of nobelium that in solution, it would behave like the other actinides, with the trivalent state being predominant; however, Seaborg predicted in 1949 that the +2 state would also be relatively stable for nobelium, as the No2+ ion would have the ground-state electron configuration 5f14, including the stable filled 5f14 shell. It took nineteen years before <b>this</b> <b>prediction</b> was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{prediction}} that the CMB temperature was {{higher in the}} past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. <b>This</b> <b>prediction</b> also implies that the amplitude of the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies does not depend directly on redshift.

5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, {{it was predicted that}} the ground-state electron configuration of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (ground state term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium. However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned <b>this</b> <b>prediction,</b> instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 configuration. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 relativistic calculations concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s2p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained by}} taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match <b>this</b> <b>prediction.</b> The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{problems}} of the press launch day, a more positive response was expected from the 20,000 members of the public who attended the remaining two days of the launch event to try out the C5 on the Alexandra Palace test track. Sinclair reported the day after the event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers, and it expected that all 2,700 units from the first production run would be sold by the following Monday. Setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout the C5's short commercial life, <b>this</b> <b>prediction</b> was wildly optimistic; less than 200 were sold during the Alexandra Palace event. However, sales picked up as mail order forms – which had been sent to all of Sinclair's computer customers – were returned with fresh orders. Within four weeks, 5,000 C5s had been sold.|$|E

Further, in comparison with the commitment equilibrium and for very general union preferences, the no-commitment equilibrium exhibits higher wages and a lower employment level. Since commitment-like equilibria are more likely in cooperative bargain environments, these results suggest that, coeteris paribus, the interaction between employment protection and the quality of industrial relations reduces unemployment.

5|$|In 1902, Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner {{found out}} that the {{differences}} in properties between neodymium and samarium were the largest between any two consecutive lanthanides in the sequence then known; as a conclusion, he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them. <b>This</b> <b>prediction</b> was supported in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having discovered that atomic number was an experimentally measurable property of elements, found that a few atomic numbers had no known corresponding elements: the gaps were 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87. With the knowledge of a gap in the periodic table several groups started to search for the predicted element among other rare earths in the natural environment.|$|E
5|$|In her April 2008 budget, Stelmach's Finance Minister Iris Evans {{forecast}} a $1.6billion surplus for 2008–2009. By August, she had revised <b>this</b> <b>prediction</b> to $8.5billion. The {{major reason}} for this change {{is an increase in}} oil prices: while she had estimated in April that they would average $78 per barrel over the fiscal year, by August increases—including a high of $147 per barrel in July—have led her to make a new estimate of a $119.25 per barrel average. By November, prices had fallen to $55 per barrel, and Evans estimated a $2billion surplus. By February 2009, the government of Alberta appeared poised to run a $1billion deficit. In April 2009, Evans released her budget for 2009–2010, in which she anticipated a $4.6billion deficit. This is the largest deficit in Alberta's history, and its first in sixteen years. The government's fiscal plan includes deficits until 2012–2013, when it again anticipates a surplus.|$|E

5|$|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari {{was written}} by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, {{both of whom were}} pacifists by the time they met {{following}} World War I.

Janowitz and Mayer were introduced in June 1918 by a mutual friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Both writers were penniless at the time. Gilda Langer, an actress with whom Mayer was in love, encouraged Janowitz and Mayer to write a film together. She later became the basis for the Jane character. Langer also encouraged Janowitz to visit a fortune teller, who predicted that Janowitz would survive his military service during the war, but Langer would die. <b>This</b> <b>prediction</b> proved true, as Langer died unexpectedly in 1920, and Janowitz said it inspired the scene in which Cesare predicts Alan's death at the fair.|$|E
5|$|The {{lanthanides}} and actinides, in {{the metallic}} state, can exist as either divalent (such as europium and ytterbium) or trivalent (most other lanthanides) metals. The former have fn+1s2 configurations, whereas the latter have fnd1s2 configurations. In 1975, Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted {{values for the}} cohesive energies (enthalpies of crystallization) of the metallic lanthanides and actinides, both as divalent and trivalent metals. The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the 5f136d17s2 configuration over the 5f147s2 configuration for nobelium {{was not enough to}} compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d, as is true also for the very late actinides: thus einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals, although for nobelium <b>this</b> <b>prediction</b> has not yet been confirmed. The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number: an effect of this is that nobelium is predominantly divalent instead of trivalent, unlike all the other lanthanides and actinides. In 1986, nobelium metal was estimated to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 126kJ·mol−1, a value close to the values for einsteinium, fermium, and mendelevium and supporting the theory that nobelium would form a divalent metal. Like the other divalent late actinides (except the once again trivalent lawrencium), metallic nobelium should assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure. Divalent nobelium metal should have a metallic radius of around 197pm. Nobelium's melting point has been predicted to be 827°C, the same value as that estimated for the neighboring element mendelevium. Its density is predicted to be around 9.9±0.4g·cm−3.|$|E
