5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> Persons Report has {{identified}} several individual and structural {{factors that contribute}} to the persistence of human trafficking to, through, and out of Haiti, as well as throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{government}} {{spent more}} than $6 million on actions related to the NAP-CHT in 2013. In September of that year, Kellie Leitch, Minister responsible for the Status of Women and Minister of Labour, announced {{that the government would}} give the Women's Support Network of York Region $200,000 to initiate a project aimed at eradicating human <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> the Regional Municipality of York, and she appealed to the NAP-CHT when making the announcement. In February 2013, the Toronto City Council decided to coordinate its anti-human-trafficking efforts with the NAP-CHT. That May, during a meeting of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly at United Nations Headquarters in New York City that was convened to discuss the Global Plan of Action to Combat <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> Persons, the Canadian delegation spoke about the NAP-CHT.|$|E

5|$|The right against exploitation, {{given in}} Articles 23 and 24, {{provides}} for two provisions, namely {{the abolition of}} <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> human beings and Begar (forced labour), and abolition of employment of children below the age of 14 years in dangerous jobs like factories, mines, etc. Child labour is considered a gross violation of the spirit and provisions of the constitution. Begar, practised in the past by landlords, has been declared a crime and is punishable by law. <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> humans {{for the purpose of}} slave trade or prostitution is also prohibited by law. An exception is made in employment without payment for compulsory services for public purposes. Compulsory military conscription is covered by this provision.|$|E
5|$|A SMS {{opinion poll}} of 2,123 people was {{conducted}} by Roy Morgan Research over the 26 January 2015 Australia Day weekend {{and the results were}} broadcast on ABC's Triple J radio network.

5|$|As had {{occurred}} with Bilheimer's previous film, A Closer Walk, Not My Life had several preview screenings before its official release. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) hosted a preview screening at the Willard InterContinental Washington in September 2009 {{as part of}} a day-long symposium on human trafficking.

5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E
5000|$|Sections {{with left}} and right routes {{formerly}} carried 2 lanes of <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> each direction.

5|$|Two {{years after}} her selection, Sarumpaet was {{approached}} by UNICEF and asked to do a survey of child <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia and promote awareness of the problem. After discovering {{the extent of the}} problem, she wrote Pelacur dan Sang Presiden (The Prostitute and the President), spending six months interviewing prostitutes in Surabaya, Surakarta, Garut, and Borneo in preparation. The play was shown in five different cities in 2006 and received warmly. Also in 2006, Sarumpaet organised the seventh triannual Women's Playwright International Conference in Bali.|$|E
5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. When she returned to Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated. The following year, she released her first novel, Maluku, Kobaran Cintaku (Maluku, Flame of My Love).|$|E

5|$|Also in October 2012, Jamie McIntosh of IJM Canada {{said that}} his {{organization}} supports the NAP-CHT, and that the plan's promises to participate in international child protection would be best fulfilled by apprehending and prosecuting Canadians who engage in child sex tourism and child <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> other countries. McIntosh recommended that this work be focused on Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand because these countries are particularly vulnerable to Canadian traffickers. He also recommended focusing on these countries because Canadians have been caught participating in child sex tourism there; McIntosh made specific reference to the cases of Kenneth Klassen and Donald Bakker.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Zinta visited Hisar, Haryana, {{where she}} spent {{a day at the}} army {{training}} base to boost the morale of the jawan troops. The visit was conducted for an NDTV show, Jai Jawan, on which entertainers and actors visit Indian troops. While there, she also met children with disabilities at a special school maintained by the army. In August, along with Mumbai-based artist Gurcharan Singh, Zinta painted for the cause of street children for the non-governmental organisation Khushi. In December, she joined the efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to curb human <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> India.

5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E
