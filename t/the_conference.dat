5|$|Another {{conduit for}} the {{transfer}} of knowledge is the International Conference on Emergency Medicine, a conference held every two years for worldwide emergency physicians by the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM). In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> took place in Dublin, Ireland. The organization was founded in 1991 by four national emergency physician organizations: the American College of Emergency Physicians, the British Association for Emergency Medicine, the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, and the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine. <b>The</b> <b>conference</b> rotated between the founding members until 2010, when it was held in Singapore. Many new members have been accepted since the mid-1990s, when the IFEM decided to open up membership to other nations' emergency medicine organizations; <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> will rotate to them as well. For instance, in 2014 <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> will be hosted in Hong Kong and in 2016 it {{will be held in}} Cape Town, South Africa.|$|E
