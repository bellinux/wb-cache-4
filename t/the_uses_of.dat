5|$|Naming and {{classifying}} our surroundings {{has probably}} been taking place as long as mankind {{has been able to}} communicate. It would always have been important to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the family or group. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> {{bioluminescence}} by animals include counter-illumination camouflage, mimicry {{of other}} animals, for example to lure prey, and signalling to other individuals {{of the same}} species, such as to attract mates. In the laboratory, luciferase-based systems are used in genetic engineering and for biomedical research. Other researchers are investigating {{the possibility of using}} bioluminescent systems for street and decorative lighting, and a bioluminescent plant has been created.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> coal were varied. Coal {{was used}} in limekilns to produce lime for mortar used in {{building}} and by farmers to improve the soil.

5|$|From August 1953, Montalban ceased {{working for}} London Life, {{publishing}} {{her work in}} the magazine Prediction, one of the country's best-selling esoteric-themed publications. Starting with a series on <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> the tarot, in May 1960 she was employed to produce a regular astrological column for Prediction. Supplementing such esoteric endeavours, she penned a series of romantic short stories for publication in magazines. Throughout the 1950s she released a series of booklets under different pseudonyms that were devoted to astrology; in one case, she published the same booklet under two separate titles and names, as Madeline Montalban's Your Stars and Love and Madeline Alvarez's Love and the Stars. She never wrote any books, instead preferring the shorter booklets and articles as mediums through which to propagate her views, and was critical of those books that taught the reader how to perform their own horoscopes, believing that they put professional astrologers out of business.|$|E
5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about {{the different kinds of}} plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. <b>The</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
40|$|The current {{controversy}} as to {{the proper}} role of the placebo control in the evaluation of new treatments for schizophrenia requires an analysis that is sensitive to both ethical and scientific issues. Clinical equipoise, widely regarded as the moral foundation of the randomized controlled trial (RCT), requires <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> best available treatment as the control in RCT. Scientific criticisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an active control are examined and none present an insuperable barrier to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an active control. Indeed, scrutiny of the most recent argument for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> placebo controls, 2 ̆ 7 assay sensitivity 2 ̆ 7, suggests that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> placebo may be the cause of the problem pointed to. Scientific, regulatory, ethical and legal advantages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an active control are described. While <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a placebo control may be acceptable in carefully defined circumstances, in most cases <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an active control in schizophrenia research is ethically and scientifically preferable...|$|R

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} book was Wright's method for dividing the meridian; an explanation of how he had constructed a table for the division; and <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> this information for navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to depict accurately a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the projection used by Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569. Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or true course, known as loxodromes or rhumb lines, as straight lines. However, Mercator had not explained his method.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{relationship}} between the motivational components of self-regulated learning, i. e. value of studying, perceived abilities and perceived effort, goal orientation (mastery, performance and work-avoidance) and perceived <b>use</b> <b>of</b> reading strategies. Two path models were proposed, one with the elaboration strategy and the other with monitoring and regulation strategies as outcome variables. The value of studying and perceived ability predicted <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> reading strategies through goal orientation and perceived effort, directly and indirectly. The results showed that the value <b>of</b> studying affected <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> elaboration and monitoring and regulation strategies equally, and its impact was stronger than the impact of perceived ability. Perceived ability had a stronger effect on <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> elaboration strategies than on <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> monitoring and regulation. Also, the mediational effect of mastery orientation was stronger for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> elaboration strategies than for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> monitoring and regulation strategies. Work-avoidance and performance goal orientations affected the perceived effort, which predicted <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> monitoring and regulation strategies, and did not predict <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> elaboration strategies...|$|R
