25|$|T-55 Fire Support - Uralvagonzavod is {{offering}} the Peruvian Army an upgrade for its T-55s {{as an alternative}} to replacement with new tanks. The proposal is to replace the turret of their current tanks with the turret of the BMPT. The BMPT turret is equipped with two 2A42 30 mm autocannons, two AGS-17 grenade launchers, four 9M120 Ataka-V ATGMs, and a PKTM machine gun. Every operator in the turret has a scope, and the main armament operator has a <b>thermal</b> <b>camera,</b> an optical sight, and a panoramic camera. It is also equipped with a laser detection system. Although the BMPT design fits onto a T-72 tank chassis, it can be adapted to fit on a T-55.|$|E
2500|$|The Buk-M1-2 TELAR {{uses the}} GM-569 chassis {{designed}} and produced by JSC MMZ (Mytishchi). TELAR superstructure is a turret containing the fire control radar {{at the front}} and a launcher with four ready-to-fire missiles on top. Each TELAR is operated by a crew of four and is equipped with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) protection. The radar fitted to each TELAR, {{referred to as the}} 'Fire Dome' by NATO, is a monopulse type radar and can begin tracking at the missile's maximum range (32km/20mi) and can track aircraft flying at between 15m and 22km (50 to 72,000ft) altitudes. It can guide up to three missiles against a single target. The 9K37 system supposedly has much better ECCM characteristics (i.e., is more resistant to ECM and jamming) than the 3M9 Kub system that it replaces. While the early Buk had a day radar tracking system 9Sh38 (similar to that used on Kub, Tor and Osa missile system), its current design can be fitted with a combined optical tracking system with a <b>thermal</b> <b>camera</b> and a laser range-finder for passive tracking of the target. The 9K37 system can also utilise the same 1S91 Straight Flush 25kW G/H band continuous wave radar as the 3M9 [...] "Kub" [...] system.|$|E
2500|$|T-72M4 CZ: the Czech T72M4 CZ is a {{comprehensive}} upgrade of {{every aspect of the}} T-72M1 resulting in a tank that only superficially resembles the precursor. The automotive performance was enhanced with a Perkins CV12-1000 1,000hp (740kW) water-cooled diesel engine coupled to an Allison XTG-411-6 automatic transmission. All drive train work was done by the Israeli firm NIMDA and involved extensive modification of the tank's hull and the driver's compartment. The upgrade added new Czech-manufactured Dyna-72 ERA for protection against HEAT and kinetic rounds impacting the frontal aspects of the turret and hull, and against top-attack ATGMs and sub-munitions with ERA tiles covering the turret roof. Survivability is enhanced with the Polish-made Obra laser warning system integrated with a series of DGO-1 smoke grenade dischargers on each side of turret, a Deugra fire suppression system, REDA NBC suite and electromagnetic mine plow. The most important improvement in firepower comes from the use of the Galileo Avionica TURMS-T computerized FCS (it is similar to that used in C1 Ariete) which enables a [...] "hunter-killer" [...] mode of operation; the commander has a panoramic day/night sight with built-in laser rangefinder and Attila <b>thermal</b> <b>camera</b> and can engage targets independently, while the gunner has his own primary sight with thermal channel. The FCS has sensors that correct for thermal distortion of the barrel, the temperature of the ammunition propellant, meteorological conditions, totaling 22 sensor clusters installed at several points on the turret. A new 125/EPpSV-97 APFSDS round was developed for use with the new tank which can defeat 540mm of RHA at 2,000 m. The Czech tanks were also equipped with a rear-view camera, a new intercom, navigational system, the DITA 72/97B auto-diagnostic system and improvements to the suspension due to the increase in the weight of the T-72M4 CZ by 4 tonnes. Curiously, the obsolete 2A46 main gun was retained as was the original 2E28M stabilization system, which was modestly upgraded with new hydraulic drives and gyroscopic sensors, resulting in only marginal improvements in first-hit probability despite the sophisticated and expensive TURMS-T FCS. The published probability of hitting a stationary target on the move is said to be between 65-75% with the first fired round. In comparison, the Leopard 2A4 from the mid-1980s can achieve a first round hit probability on the move of 75-85% at 2,000 m and as high as 90% with a skilled crew. The original tender called for an order of 350 tanks, which was downgraded to 140 in the face of dwindling defense budgets and finally amounted to a commitment for only 35 tanks to be upgraded to the T-72M4 CZ standard. One of the reasons for this drastic reduction was due to the escalating unit cost of the upgrade—from an initial estimate of 3.7M—and closing on a final cost of US$5.2M per tank. The reliance on foreign components and labour has also taken the original Czech contractor to the verge of bankruptcy, and the program is considered a failure by analysts according to cost-effectiveness metrics.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{histogram}} based auto-focusing {{method for}} <b>thermal</b> <b>cameras</b> is proposed.
