5|$|The {{conclave}} remained deadlocked {{until the}} electors were informed of Charles II's death in November. The electors present understood that with Charles' death, the next pope would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>politically</b> impartial, so {{a member of}} the zelanti was preferred. Giovanni Albani, who had drafted the bull outlawing nepotism, soon became the leading candidate for the papacy.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economist}} Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric {{about the end}} of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of the belief that the Balcerowicz Plan would quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>politically</b> unrealistic.|$|E

In 2011, a High Court in Serbia found the sentence <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>politically</b> and ideologically motivated and Prince Paul was officially rehabilitated. A similar decision had been made in 2009 to rehabilitate Cvetković for war crimes charges relating to the signing of the pact.|$|E

The couple were often {{separated}} when Sastrasatomo was imprisoned for his political activities, but {{they were able to}} go on the hajj together. During the 1960s Santoso continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>politically</b> active, serving in the State Secretariat from 1962 to 1967 and on the State Advisory Council from 1967 to 1972. While with Sastrosatomo, she adopted a child.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1999, the Lomé Peace Accord was signed. Among other provisions, the {{agreement}} mandated an immediate ceasefire between the main {{parties to the}} civil war and the disarmament of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) and the RUF. It also gave the RUF status as a legitimate political party, a role in the Sierra Leone Government, and four of the twenty-two seats in the cabinet. Foday Sankoh, leader of the RUF, was given responsibility for the diamond mines—an appointment much criticised by observers and the international media given the RUF's history of diamond smuggling. However, Peter Hain, Minister of State for Africa, suggested that the British government {{had no choice but to}} endorse the Lomé agreement given the RUF's dominance, and that the only alternative was continued civil war. A military intervention by the United Kingdom in 1999 was ruled out as the British government had received no request for military assistance and felt it lacked the backing of the international community for a unilateral intervention. An intervention was also deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>politically</b> and militarily impractical given the British military's involvement with NATO operations in Yugoslavia.|$|E

5|$|The {{marriage}} was {{opposed by the}} governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth. Religious, legal, political and moral objections were raised. As British monarch, Edward was the nominal head of the Church of England, which did not then allow divorced people to remarry in church if their ex-spouses were still alive. For this reason, it was widely believed that Edward could not marry Simpson and remain on the throne. Simpson was perceived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>politically</b> and socially unsuitable as a prospective queen consort because of her two failed marriages. It was widely assumed by the Establishment that she was driven by love of money or position rather than love for the King. Despite the opposition, Edward declared that he loved Simpson and intended to marry her whether his governments approved or not.|$|E
5|$|The Morumbi Stadium {{failed to}} provide proof of funding for a R$630million {{renovation}} plan requested by FIFA to secure {{its status as a}} World Cup venue; the stadium was then excluded from the tournament on 16 June 2010. The Local World Cup Committee suggested to use Arena Corinthians instead. FIFA accepted the suggestion and confirmed the decision on 10 October 2011. Journalist Wagner Vilaron from O Estado de S. Paulo deemed the exclusion of the Morumbi Stadium from the World Cup and the subsequent choice of Arena Corinthians as a venue for the event <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>politically</b> charged. After receiving several negative responses from FIFA about the renovation project for Morumbi, then-CBF-president Ricardo Teixeira lost patience with São Paulo Futebol Clube officers; he considered that they were delaying the decision by purposely failing to meet the requirements to force the government to spend money on the construction. São Paulo's opposition to Teixeira in the now defunct Clube dos 13 electionwhich was won by ruling-side Fábio Koff, aligned with São Paulo's Juvenal Juvêncioirritated the CBF president. At the same time, an affinity between Teixeira and then-president of Corinthians, Andrés Sanchezwho was chosen as the head of delegation for the national team during the 2010 FIFA World Cup and on the same side on Clube dos 13's electionwas noticed.|$|E
