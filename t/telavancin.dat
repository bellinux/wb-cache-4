40|$|Background: Serious infections {{caused by}} Gram-positive bacteria, {{particularly}} multi-drug resistant, {{are an important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in patients admitted to intensive care units. Thus, new antibiotics covering these pathogens are urgently needed. Objective: To review characteristics of <b>telavancin,</b> a novel antibiotic intended to use for treating infections caused by difficult Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to meticillin or vancomycin, multi-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae or glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Methods: The studies on microbiological activity, clinical efficacy and safety of <b>telavancin</b> were reviewed. Results/conclusion: <b>Telavancin</b> is a lipoglycopeptide administered intravenously once-daily and excreted with urine. It proved to be microbiologically active against numerous Gram-positive pathogens including drug-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and pneumococci. Large randomized Phase II and III clinical trials on efficacy and safety of <b>telavancin</b> in treating complicated skin and skin structure infections reported <b>telavancin</b> to be non-inferior to standard treatment (mostly vancomycin). Preliminary data on <b>telavancin</b> in hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, documented that <b>telavancin</b> was efficacious for this indication. Overall incidence of adverse events was similar for <b>telavancin</b> and the comparator arms.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{epidemiology}} and antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus have evolved, underscoring {{the need for}} novel antibiotics, particularly against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). <b>Telavancin</b> is a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide with potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and synthesize the available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating <b>telavancin</b> {{in the treatment of}} patients with infections due to Gram-positive organisms with the methodology of meta-analysis. RESULTS: Six RCTs comparing <b>telavancin</b> with vancomycin were included; 4 (2229 patients) referred to complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) and 2 (1503 patients) to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Regarding cSSTIs, <b>telavancin</b> and vancomycin showed comparable efficacy in clinically evaluable patients (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 10 [95 % confidence intervals: 0. 82 - 1. 48]). Among patients with MRSA infection, <b>telavancin</b> showed higher eradication rates (OR= 1. 71 [1. 08 - 2. 70]) and a trend towards better clinical response (OR= 1. 55 [0. 93 - 2. 58]). Regarding HAP, <b>telavancin</b> was non-inferior to vancomycin in terms of clinical response in two Phase III RCTs; mortality rates for the pooled trials were comparable with <b>telavancin</b> (20 %) and vancomycin (18. 6 %). Pooled data from cSSTIs and HAP studies on <b>telavancin</b> 10 mg/kg indicated higher rates of serum creatinine increases (OR= 2. 22 [1. 38 - 3. 57]), serious adverse events (OR= 1. 53 [1. 05 - 2. 24]), and adverse event-related withdrawals (OR= 1. 49 [1. 14 - 1. 95]) among <b>telavancin</b> recipients. CONCLUSION: <b>Telavancin</b> might be an alternative to vancomycin in cases of difficult-to-treat MRSA infections.

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies in the MNT model demonstrated that the 24 -h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) /MIC ratio was {{the best predictor of}} efficacy. <b>Telavancin</b> produced dose-dependent reduction of thigh titers of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. The 50 % effective dose (ED 50) estimates for <b>telavancin</b> ranged from 0. 5 to 6. 6 mg/kg of body weight (administered intravenously), and titers were reduced by up to 3 log 10 CFU/g from pretreatment values. Against MRSA ATCC 33591, <b>telavancin</b> was 4 - and 30 -fold more potent (on an ED 50 basis) than vancomycin and linezolid, respectively.

Micrococcus, Listeria and Corynebacterium spp. were inhibited by <b>telavancin</b> at ≤ 0. 015, ≤ 0. 03 and ≤ 0. 06 mg/L, respectively. <b>Telavancin</b> exhibited potent in vitro activity against this collection, greater than comparators (daptomycin, linezolid, vancomycin). This study provides new baseline MIC results for <b>telavancin</b> and confirms the spectrum and potency of <b>telavancin</b> against less commonly encountered Gram-positive species...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{extracellular}} and intracellular {{activities of}} <b>telavancin</b> (versus vancomycin) against Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA, VISA and VRSA). METHODS: Determination of cfu changes (3 - 24 h) in culture medium and in macrophages at concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 1000 x MIC. RESULTS: Extracellularly, <b>telavancin</b> displayed a fast, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against all strains. The concentration-effect relationship was bimodal for MSSA and MRSA [two successive sharp drops in bacterial counts (0. 3 - 1 x MIC and 100 - 1000 x MIC) {{separated by a}} zone of low concentration dependency]. When compared at human total drug Cmax (vancomycin, 50 mg/L; <b>telavancin,</b> 90 mg/L) towards MSSA, MRSA and VISA, <b>telavancin</b> caused both a faster and more marked decrease of cfu, with the limit of detection (> 5 log decrease) reached already at 6 versus 24 h for vancomycin. Intracellularly, the bactericidal activity of <b>telavancin</b> was less intense [- 3 log (MSSA) to - 1. 5 log (VRSA) at Cmax and at 24 h]. A bimodal relationship with respect to concentration (at 24 h) was observed for both MSSA and MRSA. In contrast, vancomycin exhibited only marginal intracellular activity towards intraphagocytic MSSA, MRSA and VISA (max. - 0. 5 log decrease at 24 h and at Cmax). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Telavancin</b> showed time- and concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against both extracellular and intracellular S. aureus with various resistance phenotypes. The data {{support the use of}} <b>telavancin</b> in infections where intracellular and extracellular S. aureus are present. Bimodality of dose responses (MSSA and MRSA) could indicate multiple mechanisms of action for <b>telavancin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Telavancin</b> is a lipoglycopeptide with {{multiple}} mechanisms {{of action that}} include membrane-destabilizing effects towards bacterial cells. It shows bactericidal activity against forms of Staphylococcus aureus (phagolysosomal infection) with different resistance phenotypes [methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus or vancomycin-resistant S. aureus]. We examine here the uptake, efflux and intracellular distribution of <b>telavancin</b> in eukaryotic cells {{as well as its}} potential to induce lysosomal changes (in comparison with vancomycin and oritavancin). Methods J 774 macrophages and rat embryo fibroblasts were exposed for up to 24 and 72 h to <b>telavancin</b> (5 - 90 mg/L). The following studies were performed: measurement of (14) C-labelled <b>telavancin</b> cellular uptake and subcellular distribution (cell fractionation), determination of pericellular membrane integrity (lactate dehydrogenase release), electron microscopy with morphometric analysis of changes in lysosome size and determination of total phospholipid and cholesterol content. Results The uptake of <b>telavancin</b> proceeded linearly as a function of time and concentration in both cell types (clearance rate of approximately 10 mL/g of protein/h). Efflux (macrophages) was approximately 5. 7 -fold slower. <b>Telavancin</b> subcellular distribution was superimposable on that of a lysosomal marker (N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase). It did not cause an increase in the release of lactate dehydrogenase and did not induce significant increases in total phospholipid or cholesterol content. It caused only mild morphological lysosomal alterations (similar to vancomycin and much less than oritavancin by morphometric analysis). Conclusions <b>Telavancin</b> is taken up by eukaryotic cells and localizes in lysosomes, causing mild morphological alterations without evidence of lipid metabolism alterations. These data support our observations that <b>telavancin</b> is active against intracellular S. aureus...|$|E
