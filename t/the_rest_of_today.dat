But because this happens while you are sleeping, you {{have no way of knowing}} that there was an overnight miracle that solved the problem. pause So, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what might be the small change that will make you say to yourself, ‘Wow, something must have happened—the problem is gone!’”? ...|$|E

40|$|Working life changes, {{just like}} <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>today’s</b> society, at an {{accelerated}} pace. It is through changes and challenges {{that human beings}} develop, personally and professionally. Changes are often met by resistance. The {{purpose of this study}} is to see how different factors influence individuals’ experiences of change. Interviews were performed with eight individuals within a company that is experiencing an organizational change. The question at issue for this study is how different factors can increase or reduce individuals’ possible resistance that may occur when a change in process is taking place. Resistance has, for a long time been viewed as a very important factor that may affect the success of change, in previous research resistance has been viewed as something negative, something that has to been fought and conquered in order for change to succeed. Today’s research shows results of resistance being viewed for what it really is; a complex multifaceted phenomenon that arises on account of many different factors. As a result of the study we have seen that insufficient and poorly backed up information is an obstacle in the way of a good changing process. When the employees are allowed to be a part of developing suggestions for change, motivation increases. When information is given about upcoming changes, it is important to be clear in order to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings...|$|R
