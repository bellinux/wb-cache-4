5|$|The Khazars and <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> {{came into}} {{conflict}} {{as a result}} of the first phase of Muslim expansion: by 640, <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> had reached Armenia, and in 642, they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah. In 645/646, <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> defeated a Byzantine army in Armenia, reinforced with Khazar and Alan contingents. It was followed by an attempt in 651/652 to advance onto the Khazar capital, Balanjar, but <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> were heavily defeated in a battle before the city, resulting in the death of Abd ar-Rahman's brother Salman and 4,000 Muslim troops. Three years later, the Khazars repelled a retaliatory campaign under Habib ibn Maslama.|$|E

5|$|As {{the relief}} army {{approached}} Tyana, it {{was confronted by}} <b>the</b> <b>Arabs,</b> and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were routed. According to Theophanes, the two Byzantine generals quarrelled among themselves, and their attack was disorderly. The Byzantines lost many thousand dead, and the captives also numbered in the thousands. <b>The</b> <b>Arabs</b> captured the Byzantine camp and took all the provisions they had brought along for the beleaguered city, allowing them to continue the siege. The inhabitants of Tyana now despaired of any succour, and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender. <b>The</b> <b>Arabs</b> promised {{to allow them to}} depart unharmed, and the city capitulated after a siege of nine months (in March according to Michael the Syrian, in May–June according to al-Tabari). Theophanes reports that <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> broke their promise and enslaved the entire population, which was deported to the Caliphate, but no other source confirms this. After looting the town, <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> razed it to the ground.|$|E
5|$|From there, <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> turned west towards Nicaea, {{the chief}} city of Bithynia and {{capital of the}} {{powerful}} Opsician Theme. <b>The</b> <b>Arabs</b> arrived before the city in late July, with al-Battal's vanguard preceding the main army. The Byzantines, probably {{under the command of}} the Count of the Opsicians, Artabasdos, did not meet them in the field, but instead retreated behind the city's walls. <b>The</b> <b>Arabs</b> assaulted the city for forty days, employing siege engines which destroyed a part of the walls, but eventually failed to take it. In late August, they raised the siege and departed, taking along many captives and much booty. The 12th-century chronicle of Michael the Syrian claims that the city's inhabitants abandoned it and fled by ship through Lake Ascania, whereupon <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> destroyed Nicaea, but this is clearly an error.|$|E

5000|$|The {{military}} history of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> League is {{closely linked to}} the Arab-Israeli conflict. <b>The</b> 1950 <b>Arab</b> Joint Security Pact set out provisions for collective security among <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> states, but only in 1961 was <b>the</b> Joint <b>Arab</b> Command (JAC) proposed as a unified military command for <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> League first by the Joint Defence Council, an institution of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> League.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arabs</b> {{hoped that}} the disunity among the Byzantines would play to their advantage. Maslama had already {{established}} contact with Leo the Isaurian. French scholar Rodolphe Guilland theorized that Leo offered to become a vassal of the Caliphate, although the Byzantine general intended to use <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> for his own purposes. In turn, Maslama supported Leo hoping to maximize confusion and weaken the Empire, easing his own task of taking Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Theophilos in 842, new {{measures}} to confront the Cretan threat were undertaken by the new Byzantine regime: in 843 a new maritime theme, that of the Aegean Sea, was established to better deal with <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> raids, and another expedition to recover Crete was launched under the personal leadership of the powerful logothetes and regent Theoktistos. Although it succeeded in occupying much of the island, Theoktistos had to abandon the army due to political intrigues in Constantinople, and the troops left behind were slaughtered by <b>the</b> <b>Arabs.</b> In an effort to weaken <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> in 853, several Byzantine fleets engaged in coordinated operations in the Eastern Mediterranean, attacking the Egyptian naval base of Damietta and capturing weapons intended for Crete. Despite some Byzantine successes against <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> in the following years, the Cretans resumed their raids in the early 860s, attacking the Peloponnese, the Cyclades, and Athos. In 866, the Byzantine Caesar Bardas assembled another large-scale expeditionary force to subdue Crete, but his murder by Basil the Macedonian only {{two weeks after the}} fleet set sail from the capital spelled the end of the undertaking.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size. This was done to make the city's perimeter more easily defensible, and similar reductions in city sizes were common around the Mediterranean region in the early Middle Ages. Although it was traditionally assumed that the retrenchment was built by <b>the</b> <b>Arabs,</b> {{it has been suggested that}} it was actually built by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century, when the threat from <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> increased.|$|E
