40|$|The use of {{powerful}} low or {{very low frequency}} (LF/VLF) transmitter signals (mainly in the range 15 - 60 kHz) is a well established technique for remote sensing of the lower ionosphere. Standard tools for calculating the the world wide propagation conditions – like the Long Wave Propagation Capability (LWPC) code- usually rely on default procedures for modeling the day-night transition conditions that do not map reality sufficiently for modeling purposes, {{especially with regard to}} timing and shape of the terminators. We propose an improved method to cover with these problems by making use of the possibility <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>charge</b> density profiles into the LWPC that vary appropriately over the day-night cycle and additionally can model disturbances caused by forcing of the lower ionosphere from above (X-rays, particle precipitations) and below (atmospheric waves). 1...|$|E
40|$|Coaxing {{correlated}} {{materials to}} {{the proximity of}} the insulator–metal transition region, where electronic wavefunctions transform from localized to itinerant, is currently the subject of intensive research because of the hopes it raises for technological applications and also for its fundamental scientific significance. In general, this tuning is achieved by either chemical doping <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>charge</b> carriers, or external stimuli to lower the ratio of Coulomb repulsion to bandwidth. In this study, we combine experiment and theory to show that the transition from well-localized insulating states to metallicity in a Ruddlesden-Popper series, La 0. 5 Srn + 1 − 0. 5 TinO 3 n + 1, is driven by intercalating an intrinsically insulating SrTiO 3 unit, in structural terms, by dimensionality n. This unconventional strategy, which can be understood upon a complex interplay between electron–phonon coupling and electron correlations, opens up a new avenue to obtain metallicity or even superconductivity in oxide superlattices that are normally expected to be insulators...|$|E
40|$|The {{superconductivity}} in {{high temperature}} superconductors ordinarily arises when doped with hetero-valent ions that introduce charge carriers. However, in ferropnictides, "iso-valent" doping, {{which is generally}} believed not <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>charge</b> carriers, can induce superconductivity as well. Moreover, unlike other ferropnictides, the superconducting gap in BaFe 2 (As 1 -xPx) 2 {{has been found to}} contain nodal lines. The exact nature of the "iso-valent" doping and nodal gap here are key open issues in building a comprehensive picture of the iron-based high temperature superconductors. With angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we found that the phosphor substitution in BaFe 2 (As 1 -xPx) 2 induces sizable amount of holes into the hole Fermi surfaces, while the dxy-originated band is relatively intact. This overturns the previous common belief of "iso-valent" doping, explains why the phase diagram of BaFe 2 (As 1 -xPx) 2 is {{similar to those of the}} holedoped compounds, and rules out theories that explain the nodal gap based on vanishing dxy hole pocket.

The critical exponents are determined, as well as the scaling function associated with the equation of state. The universal properties of a liquid-gas transition are found. This is potentially a generic description of the Mott critical endpoint in correlated electron materials. Published as: Science vol. 302 p. 89 (October, 3 rd, 2003) 1 Since the early recognition by Mott [1, 2] that electron-electron interactions are responsible for the insulating character of many transition-metal oxides, extensive research over the last decade has demonstrated the key importance of this phenomenon for the physics of strongly correlated electron materials. Outstanding examples [3] are superconducting cuprates, manganites displaying colossal magnetoresistance, or fullerene compounds.

40|$|When {{studying}} transverse modes propagating {{parallel to}} a static magnetic field, an apparent contradiction arises between the weakly nonlinear results {{obtained from the}} derivative nonlinear Schr&# 246;dinger equation, predicting envelope solitons (where the amplitude is stationary in the wave frame, but the phase is not), and recent results for whistler oscillitons, indicating that really stationary structures of large amplitude are possible. Revisiting this problem in the fluid dynamic approach, care has been taken not <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>charge</b> neutrality from the outset, because this not only neglects electric stresses compared to magnetic stresses, which is reasonable, but could also imply from Poisson's equation a vanishing of the wave electric field. Nevertheless, the fixed points of the remaining equations are the same, whether charge neutrality is assumed from the outset or not, so that the solitary wave solutions at not too large amplitudes will be very similar. This is borne out by numerical simulations of the solutions under the two hypotheses, showing {{that the lack of}} correspondence with the DNLS envelope solitons indicates the limitations of the reductive perturbation approach, and is not a consequence of assuming charge neutrality...|$|E
40|$|To obtain {{superconductivity}} in a layered copper-oxide compound, it {{is necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>charge</b> carriers into the antiferromagnetic CuO{sub 2 } planes. Recent neutron diffraction studies of the system La{sub 1. 6 -x}Nd{sub 0. 4 }Sr{sub x}CuO{sub 4 } provide evidence that the dopant-induced holes choose to segregate into periodically-spaced stripes which separate antiferromagnetic domains, {{in a manner similar}} to that found in hole-doped La{sub 2 }NiO{sub 4 }. The charge and spin stripe modulations are identified by the appearance of scattering at incommensurate positions. In the Nd-doped system, elastic scattering is observed, corresponding to static stripes. In pure La{sub 2 -x}Sr{sub x}CuO{sub 4 }, the magnetic scattering that is observed is purely inelastic. Where samples with and without Nd, but with the same Sr concentration, have been measured, the incommensurate (IC) splittings of the magnetic signal are found to be essentially identical. It has been proposed that the spin correlations in the two systems are fundamentally the same, thus implying similar charge correlations. The static nature of the stripes in the Nd-doped system is attributed to pinning of the otherwise dynamic correlations by a special distortion of the lattice. That distortion is driven by purely ionic interactions and is stabilized by the smaller ionic radius of the substituted Nd...|$|E

40|$|The ability <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>charge</b> {{carriers}} {{in organic}} molecular materials and control their concentration {{is of great}} relevance for both fundamental research and applications. In this thesis, it has been demonstrated that the electronic properties of Metal Phthalocyanines (MPc) and pentacene (PEN) molecular materials can be tuned by controlling the electron density through intercalation of alkali atoms. Electrical conductivity measurements for different MPcâs thin films (CuPc, NiPc, ZnPc, FePc, CoPc and MnPc) reveal the occurrence of an insulator-metal-insulator transition with progressive doping, {{as well as the}} influence of the molecular orbitals occupied by the charge carriers on the conduction properties. Measurements based on scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-Ray structural analysis complemented by calculations of the electronic structure of the doped material suggest that the observed behaviour is due to filling of electronic bands originating from the molecular orbitals of the constituent molecules. Furthermore, the thesis addresses the transport properties of electron-doped pentacene films. The measurements reveal that, upon potassium intercalation, the pentacene films become metallic in a broad range of doping concentrations, up to one potassium atom per molecule. At this value, charge transfer from potassium to pentacene saturates, leaving the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital at half filling. This causes a sharp drop of the conductivity, concomitantly with the entrance into an insulating state. These observations are consistent with the occurrence of a Mott-Hubbard insulating state driven by strong electron-electron interaction. In addition to chemical doping, also the electronic transport properties of electrostatically doped MPcâs materials have been addresses. These measurements reveal the occurrence of field-effect induced ambipolar transport at the surface of CuPc and FePc single crystals. Applied Science...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{presents}} various membrane {{techniques for}} biomolecules separation. New charged membranes and new methods <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>charge</b> into the membranes are demonstrated. All chapters present {{characterization of the}} hollow fiber membranes produced via the immersion precipitation dry-wet spinning. Apart from the spinning technique, the phase separation in-situ and polymer foaming are explored, too. A model protein or a model protein mixture is investigated in each chapter to give a proof of concept of the new method. Bovine serum albumin is used, as this protein is known of its stability, lack of effect in many biochemical reactions and low cost. First, a new in-line method of introduction charge onto the bore surface of the hollow fiber membrane in a one-step spinning process is described. A negatively charged polyelectrolyte sulphonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) is dissolved in the bore liquid and during the membrane formation deposited on the bore surface. Secondly, a crosslinking agent for the membrane forming polymer, the polyethyleneimine (PEI) is dissolved in the bore liquid. This is a new method of simultaneous membrane formation and chemical modification in a one-step spinning process. It is shown that two types of membranes: either a completely crosslinked and porous fiber (for ultrafiltration), or a porous fiber with crosslinked dense inner layer (for gas separation), can be produced via the same spinning procedure, only by changing {{the composition of the}} bore liquid and/or shell liquid and dope solution. Third method explores application of mixed matrix membranes for adsorption of biomolecules. These membranes are produced by dispersion of negatively charged particles in the matrix polymer. The novelty of this work is that the membranes are crosslinked {{and for the first time}} applied for the adsorption of biomolecules (lysozyme and cholesterol) from organic solvents, rather than from aqueous solutions. The last part introduces membrane technology in a completely new field, capillary elelectrochromatography (CEC) – a hybrid analytical separation technique.

Furthermore, WRV and NMR-relaxation measurements showed that an increase in the surface charge had no significant influence on the swelling whereas an increase in bulk charges had a large effect.
