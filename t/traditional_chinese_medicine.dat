5|$|Mercury in {{the form}} of one of its common ores, cinnabar, is used in various {{traditional}} medicines, especially in <b>traditional</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine.</b> Review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in overdose, or taken long term, and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses, though effects from therapeutic doses are typically reversible. Although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms, its use in <b>traditional</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine</b> has not yet been justified, as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear.|$|E
5|$|Having earlier {{rejected}} the Western-led environmentalist movement, China changed its stance in the 1980s {{and became a}} party to the CITES treaty.

5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii {{mushrooms}} are edible. They {{have been used}} in <b>traditional</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine</b> to treat lumbago, numbed limbs, and as an antihemorrhagic.

Mushrooms are also used in mushroom dyeing to produce the colors yellow, gold, greenish yellow, orange, or olive, depending on the mordant used.|$|E
5|$|The {{detected}} compounds are polyols {{and have}} an antifungal and antibacterial effect, especially in connection with Gram-positive bacteria. H.olivaceoalbus is therefore {{an important source of}} antibiotics, especially as the hygrophorones also show an effect on bacterial cultures that are resistant against contemporary antibiotics such as methicillin, ciprofloxacin or vancomycin. The fungus has been used in <b>Traditional</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine,</b> where it is known for its curing components, such as 4-, 6- or 4,5,6-tri-O-acetyl hygrophorones B14.|$|E

Result: For all of the analyzed heavy metals, the correlative coefficient of the calibration curves was over 0. 999 2. The recovery rates of the procedure were 97. 5 %- 108. 0 %, and its RSD was lower than 11. 6 %. Conclusion: This method was convenient, quick-acquired, accurate and highly sensitive.

5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, {{as well as}} <b>traditional</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine,</b> {{consider the}} durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people {{with high blood pressure}} are traditionally advised not to consume durian.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in <b>traditional</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine)</b> and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E

Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy.|$|E

5|$|In China, {{the tree}} of heaven has a long and rich history.

The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in <b>traditional</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine,</b> primarily as an astringent. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the ailanthus silkmoth, a moth involved in silk production.
