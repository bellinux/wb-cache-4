5|$|The {{production}} model utilised the same Alcan bonded honeycomb aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT) as the concept car for <b>the</b> <b>chassis.</b> <b>The</b> <b>chassis</b> design featured two box section rails which acted as the suspension mounting points and {{would provide an}} energy absorbing structure {{in the event of}} a frontal impact, these were successfully tested at speeds up to , an integral roll cage formed part of <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> and monocoque, providing additional structural rigidity for the car and allowing the XJ220 to easily pass stringent crash testing.|$|E
5|$|The T-26 mod. 1939 with appliqué armour weighed , {{which caused}} an {{overload}} of <b>the</b> <b>chassis,</b> transmission, and {{engine of the}} light tank. Drivers were advised to use low gears only.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chassis</b> was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
50|$|In 2018, Lynx {{introduced}} <b>the</b> Radien <b>chassis.</b> <b>The</b> Radien <b>chassis</b> is {{also based}} on <b>the</b> Ski-Doo <b>chassis,</b> but it's made shorter, lighter and smaller.The weight center is also improved on <b>the</b> Radien <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Tamiya created <b>the</b> MA <b>chassis</b> {{series of}} cars as a {{subseries}} to the PRO series starting with Blast Arrow. <b>The</b> MA <b>chassis</b> combines <b>the</b> aerodynamics and monocoque aesthetics of <b>the</b> AR <b>chassis</b> and <b>the</b> inner structure aspects of <b>the</b> MS <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dallara began development, {{design and}} {{construction}} of <b>the</b> GP2/11 <b>chassis</b> in late 2009. <b>The</b> first <b>chassis</b> was assembled in July 2010, with <b>the</b> first <b>chassis</b> completed September 15, 2010. <b>The</b> Dallara GP2/11 <b>chassis</b> was replacing <b>the</b> Dallara GP2/08 <b>chassis</b> in 2011 season. Dallara GP2/08 2008-2010 chassis were permanently retired after 2010 GP2 Series season.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s and in {{the early}} 1960s, VAT and the French Camions Willème SA had plans for joint production, but only one jointly {{produced}} prototype was ever made; <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> was from Vanaja, the engine was from AEC, and the cabin, which was a forward control type cabin and partly made from glass fibre, was from Willème.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chassis</b> of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{a variety}} of issues with <b>the</b> Irish <b>chassis</b> Devin {{designed}} a replacement that was made in California and was called <b>the</b> American <b>chassis.</b> <b>The</b> price for the cars made with <b>the</b> American <b>chassis</b> rose to US$10,000.00 {{in the last year of}} production.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Dallara GP3/16 <b>chassis</b> was {{designed}} to replace <b>the</b> Dallara GP3/13 <b>chassis</b> in 2016 season. Dallara began the development, design and construction of <b>the</b> GP3/16 <b>chassis</b> in mid-2014. <b>The</b> first <b>chassis</b> began assembly in July 2015, and was completed in September.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> DE <b>chassis</b> {{was also}} <b>the</b> basis for <b>the</b> DC {{ambulance}} <b>chassis</b> on which coachbuilders Barker and Hooper built five hundred {{units of the}} Daimler DC 27 Ambulance. A variant of <b>the</b> DC <b>chassis</b> became <b>the</b> DH <b>chassis,</b> on which fifty DH 27 limousines were built for Daimler Hire.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chassis</b> {{was used}} for both a command tank (Panzerbefehlswagen 35(t)) which {{featured}} extra radios (20 built) and also as an artillery tractor (Artillerie Schlepper 35(t)) by removing the turret and upper hull and covering the gap with canvas (49 converted from March 42 onwards).|$|E
5|$|Tri-ang, {{and later}} Hornby, have {{produced}} 'OO'-scale models of Flying Scotsman almost continuously since the 1960s. In the 2000s, Hornby also produced live steam examples, re-using <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> {{from the initial}} LNER Class A4 models. Other manufacturers have produced models in other scales, such as Minitrix (N-gauge) and Bassett-Lowke (O-gauge).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Wheldon had been working with IndyCar {{officials}} to develop the ICONIC chassis with the intention of improving safety in the sport. Planned changes to <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> include larger cockpits for driver protection and bodywork over the rear wheels to prevent cars from launching off one another {{in the event of a}} collision, long a problem in open-wheel racing, regardless of oval or road course, but troublesome on high-speed ovals and tight street circuits with a long straight and a tight turn, similar to the style of many modern road courses.|$|E

5|$|Crowley {{started the}} process of {{designing}} the Tumbler for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model to serve as <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale {{in the course of}} four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.|$|E
5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> more evenly.|$|E
5|$|Remaining {{in such a}} {{position}} would require Mercedes-Benz to produce a competitive car for the 1936 season. Although <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> of the W25 was shortened, and the engine was significantly upgraded to 4.74litres, the car proved inferior to the Type C developed by Auto Union. Mercedes had not improved <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> to match the engine, and the W25 proved uncompetitive and unreliable. Despite this, Caracciola opened {{the season with a}} win in the rain at the Monaco Grand Prix, after starting from third position. He led the Hungarian Grand Prix early but retired with mechanical problems. At the German Grand Prix, he retired with a failed fuel pump, before taking over his teammate Hermann Lang's car; he later retired that car with supercharger problems. Caracciola led the Swiss Grand Prix for several laps, Rosemeyer trailing him closely, but the Clerk of the Course ordered Caracciola to cede the lead to Rosemeyer on the ninth lap after he was found to be blocking the Auto Union. The two had a heated argument after the race despite Caracciola's later retirement with a rear axle problem. Mercedes were so uncompetitive in 1936—Caracciola won only twice, in Monaco and Tunis—that Neubauer withdrew the team mid-season, leaving Rosemeyer to take the Championship for Auto Union.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{designated}} ZiL-115, the ZIL-4104 was {{an update}} of the ZIL-114 {{with which it}} shared <b>the</b> same <b>chassis</b> and over half its mechanical components. Despite sharing <b>the</b> same <b>chassis,</b> <b>the</b> ZIL-4104 was still as much as 314 kg (692 lb) heavier than the 114.|$|R
25|$|Tatuus was {{selected}} by the series promoter as <b>the</b> new spec <b>chassis</b> for <b>the</b> U.S. F2000 National Championship beginning in 2017. A derivative of <b>the</b> same <b>chassis</b> but with more power, downforce, and adjustments will be <b>the</b> spec <b>chassis</b> for <b>the</b> Pro Mazda Championship beginning in 2018.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, Emperor and <b>the</b> Type-2 <b>chassis</b> were introduced. Like <b>the</b> Type-1 <b>chassis</b> kits, all Type-2 chassis kits {{also have}} spiked tires {{of the super}} slick type.|$|R
5|$|Since the T65 {{project was}} fading away, the Armored Force still needed a light {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, so {{they made a}} new project (called T65E1) based on the new T24 chassis (a prototype of the M24 Chaffee). The T65E1 had the same overall layout as the T65 GMC – gun turret at rear with the engines {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> – with a few minor tweaks (including an angular gun shield instead of a straight one).|$|E
5|$|The F 3 {{appeared}} in 1939 {{and was the}} production version. The design was simplified {{over the course of}} the war to reduce costs and the use of strategic metals. Some vehicles produced by Tatra had its 12-cylinder, air-cooled Type 103 diesel engine fitted. Large spades were added at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> during the war to improve the vehicle's ability to recover tanks and other heavy vehicles.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chassis</b> {{formed the}} basis for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light armored {{personnel}} carrier. Approximately 14,000 were produced between 1938 and 1945, {{making it one of the}} most widely produced German tactical vehicles of the war. It participated in the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France, the Balkans Campaign and fought on both the Western Front and the Eastern Front, in North Africa and in Italy.|$|E
2500|$|As the M4 Sherman tank {{replaced}} the M3, {{it was decided}} to continue production using <b>the</b> M4 <b>chassis</b> (<b>the</b> M4 <b>chassis</b> was a development of the M3). The M7 was subsequently supplanted by the M37 HMC (on the [...] "Light Combat Team" [...] chassis that also gave the M24 Chaffee light tank).|$|R
50|$|The Toyota Coaster {{bus line}} had <b>the</b> same <b>chassis</b> and also used <b>the</b> U10-series <b>chassis</b> codes. There {{was also one}} {{generation}} of the heavier Toyota Massy Dyna, which was first introduced in September 1969.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Aravis' <b>chassis</b> {{is based}} on <b>the</b> Unimog U5000 <b>chassis.</b> <b>The</b> total {{internal}} volume for the vehicle is 9.5m3 with 8m3 of that under full armoured protection. The Aravis can be equipped {{for a variety of}} roles, including patrol vehicle, ambulance, and command and control vehicle.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chassis</b> {{was derived}} from the T1E2 chassis, an earlier version of the M13. Based on an M3 Half-track chassis, it {{replaced}} the M13 MGMC half-track after early 1944. As aircraft became more advanced, the usefulness of the M16 was reduced. In the Korean War, it was relegated primarily to the ground-support role, being put out of service in the U.S. Army in 1951.|$|E
5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09:30 Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4) for a 30-minute warm-up session. It took place in cloudy and windy weather conditions. Both Ferrari drivers {{maintained}} their good pace from qualifying; Michael Schumacher had the fastest time, a 1:18.932. Barrichello finished with the second quickest time. The McLaren drivers rounded out the top four fastest drivers; Häkkinen in front of Coulthard. Amongst the slower runners, Heidfeld had a worrying moment when his engine cover was shed from <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> on the main straight.|$|E
5|$|The {{landing craft}} used {{included}} twelve actual World War II examples, 10 LCVPs and 2 LCMs, standing {{in for the}} British LCAs that the Ranger Companies rode in to the beach during Operation Overlord. The filmmakers used underwater cameras to better depict soldiers being hit by bullets in the water. Forty barrels of fake blood were used to simulate the effect {{of blood in the}} seawater. This degree of realism was more difficult to achieve when depicting World War II German armored vehicles, as few examples survive in operating condition. The Tiger I tanks in the film were copies built on <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> of old, but functional, Soviet T-34 tanks. The two vehicles described in the film as Panzers were meant to portray Marder III tank destroyers. One was created for the film using <b>the</b> <b>chassis</b> of a Czech-built Panzer 38(t) tank similar to the construction of the original Marder III; the other was a cosmetically modified Swedish SAV m/43 assault gun, which also used the 38(t) chassis.|$|E
50|$|Using <b>the</b> same <b>chassis,</b> <b>the</b> {{resupply}} vehicles (RSVs) {{would deliver}} automatic, reciprocal transfer of ammunition, data and {{fuel to the}} SPH or another RSV.|$|R

50|$|The Dyna Junior {{would use}} two {{versions}} of <b>the</b> Dyna X <b>chassis</b> over <b>the</b> course of its production history. Early Juniors used <b>the</b> X86 <b>chassis</b> from <b>the</b> Dyna X 120 while later models used <b>the</b> X87 <b>chassis</b> from <b>the</b> Dyna X 130. This platform gave the Junior a wheelbase of 2127 mm and front and rear tracks of 1220 mm.|$|R
