25|$|The impact {{initially}} {{caused the}} formation of a transient crater with the diameter of about 150km and depth of about 50km, which then relaxed forming the present crater with the final diameter of about 300km. The impact probably penetrated through <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>water</b> poor ejecta of Adlinda and Heimdell, then entered a water ice rich layer beneath it. This explains the distribution of the Lofn's ejecta. The outer rings of impact deposits around Lofn are made from the dark material, which was excavated first and accelerated to a high speed. After that the light water rich material was excavated from the depth, but with a lower speed forming the bright inner ring of ejecta.|$|E
25|$|One common {{feature of}} the myths is the {{emergence}} of the world from the waters of chaos that surround it. This event represents the establishment of maat and the origin of life. One fragmentary tradition centers on the eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the characteristics of the primeval water itself. Their actions give rise to the sun (represented in creation myths by various gods, especially Ra), whose birth forms a space of light and dryness within <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>water.</b> The sun rises from the first mound of dry land, another common motif in the creation myths, which was likely inspired by the sight of mounds of earth emerging as the Nile flood receded. With the emergence of the sun god, the establisher of maat, the world has its first ruler. Accounts from the first millennium BC focus on the actions of the creator god in subduing the forces of chaos that threaten the newly ordered world.|$|E
25|$|The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is {{the only}} extant member of the genus Notorynchus, in the family Hexanchidae. It is {{recognizable}} because of its seven gill slits, while most shark species have five gill slits, {{with the exception of}} the members of the order Hexanchiformes and the sixgill sawshark. This shark has a large, thick body, with a broad head and blunt snout. The top jaw has jagged, cusped teeth and the bottom jaw has comb-shaped teeth. Its single dorsal fin is set far back along the spine towards the caudal fin, and is behind the pelvic fins. In this shark the upper caudal fin is much longer than the lower, and is slightly notched near the tip. Like many sharks, this sevengill is counter-shaded. Its dorsal surface is silver-gray to brown in order to blend with <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>water</b> and substrate when viewed from above. In counter to this, its ventral surface is very pale, blending with the sunlit water when viewed from below. The body and fins are covered in a scattering of small black & white spots. In juveniles, their fins often have white margins.|$|E

500|$|To {{depict the}} supernatural {{aspects of the}} show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Businesses, such as visual effects company Entity FX, were {{contracted}} for production of the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes were filmed in Vancouver and required a new crew that works exclusively for the show. Mary Winchester's death scene, which had the character pinned to the ceiling and burning to death, required actress Samantha Smith to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a fake body the crew named [...] "Christina" [...] was made out of wire and papier-mâché, and was then ignited on a fake ceiling. However, the room quickly caught fire, forcing an evacuation. Green screen coincided with the visual effects for the ghostly Woman in White, and executive producer McG chose to make the imagery of her death sequence an homage to Chris Cunningham's Aphex Twin video [...] "Windowlicker". Japanese horror also influenced the scene, such as the school uniforms worn by the ghost children, the water cascading down the stairs, and <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Water</b> elements.|$|E
2500|$|African {{penguins}} grow to [...] {{tall and}} weigh between [...] [...] They {{have a black}} stripe and black spots on the chest, the pattern of spots being unique for every penguin, like human fingerprints. They have pink glands above their eyes, which are used for thermoregulation. The hotter the penguin gets, the more blood is sent to these glands {{so it may be}} cooled by the surrounding air, thus making the glands more pink. This species exhibits slight sexual dimorphism: the males are larger than the females and have larger beaks. Juveniles do not possess the bold, delineated markings of the adult but instead have dark upperparts that vary from greyish-blue to brown; the pale underparts lack both spots and the band. The beak is more pointed than that of the Humboldt. Their distinctive black and white colouring is a vital form of camouflage called countershading white for underwater predators looking upwards and black for predators looking down onto <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In The Lord of the Rings, {{while the}} Fellowship of the Ring {{approach}} Mount Doom to complete its quest of destroying the One Ring {{made by the}} Dark Lord Sauron, Gandalf is forced to decide which path to take: over the mountain of Caradhras through the Redhorn Gate, or through Moria, to the Dimrill Gate. At Aragorn's insistence they first try the mountain pass, but the weather proves too severe, and the Fellowship instead approach the Doors of Durin, beside which the Watcher lived in a lake. When Boromir disturbs the water, the Watcher seizes Frodo with a long, pale-green, luminous, fingered tentacle, succeeded by twenty more. The Company rescue Frodo and retreat into Moria, and the Watcher seals the Doors shut. As Gandalf commented, [...] "Something has crept or been driven out of <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>water</b> under the mountains. There are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Allegory" [...] segment {{began with}} a recitation of a verse from Nobel Prize-winning Greek poet George Seferis' poem [...] "Mythistorema 3". As the verse is being recited on the speakers, the {{spotlights}} are focused upon a woman clad in a black gown looking out to the water. Holding a marble sculpture head, the woman seems to be entering into a dream. As she looks into <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>water,</b> a centaur appears whose human and animal parts supposedly symbolize the duality of spirit and body. The centaur then walks about and then throws a spear of light {{into the center of}} the stadium, from which a giant statue that exemplified Cycladic art (and thus one of the first depictions of the human form in Greek art) emerged. This Cycladic head also represents one of the very first attempts of humanity to understand itself. With the use of lasers, geometrical shapes and other scientific images (such as a stylistic representation of the solar system) were displayed on the figure's face. The statue then broke into pieces that floated away, and from within it emerged a smaller kouros statue from the Archaic Period of Greek sculpture, which in turn broke apart to reveal the depiction of man in a sculpture of the classical period, symbolizing the dawn of individuality and extolling human scale, one of the principal themes of the 2004 Olympics. At the end of this sequence, a cube arises from the water, and a man starts slowly balancing himself on the rotating cube while representations of human kind's greatest achievements, contrasted to humanistic representations and images of men, women, and children of various ethnicities and ages, are projected onto the pieces of broken sculpture, which seem to be floating above the water. This last sequence is meant to symbolize the birth of logical thought, higher learning, and humanity finally making sense of the world in which it lives. After this sequence, the pieces of sculpture descend to the water, meant to symbolize the Greek isles.|$|E
