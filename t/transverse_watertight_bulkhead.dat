40|$|Bulk {{carriers}} {{are subject to}} SOLAS regulations concerning the structural integrity of hold No. 1. SOLAS Chapter XII Regulation 6 mandates that the <b>transverse</b> <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> between the two foremost holds and double bottom of the foremost hold shall have sufficient strength to withstand flooding of the first hold. This regulation applies to all single-skin bulk carriers of 150 m in length and upwards constructed before 1 July 1999. IACS provides rules {{for the construction of}} these areas of such vessels in order to comply with SOLAS Chapter XII. This paper presents a methodology for modelling hold No. 1 of bulk carriers using finite elements in order to assess the structural integrity of these areas under the loads prescribed by IACS. Results from respective nonlinear analyses using IACS loads are also presented. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
