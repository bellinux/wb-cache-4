5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines. They believed that sinking or capturing the trawlers would force the British to spread themselves <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> defend the fishing fleet and might result in some useful auxiliary ships for the Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support.|$|E

5|$|Castles {{can take}} several forms. The most common is the motte-and-bailey which {{consists}} of a motte (a mound)– surmounted by a keep or tower– connected to a bailey, an outer enclosure where the barracks and workshops were located. Other types of castle in Cheshire are ringworks and fortified manor houses. Ringworks are similar to motte-and-bailey castles but lack the motte; although contemporary with motte-and-baileys, they are an uncommon form of fortification. A ringwork may have been built rather than a motte-and-bailey because the soil was too <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> provide a proper motte or {{simply because of the}} preference of the builder. A fortified manor house was the administrative centre of a manor– a division of land in medieval England– and was usually the home of the local lord. Fortified manor houses are considered castles because they often had battlements or crenellations.|$|E
5|$|In February 1940, Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan {{produced}} plutonium-239 {{through the}} bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed {{the creation of}} neptunium, element 93, which then underwent beta-decay {{to form a new}} element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium. He used mica sliced razor <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> produce a window to count alpha particle emissions, and ionization chamber with a magnetic field to separate the beta particles from the neptunium from alpha particles from the plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} {{on the quality of the}} walls around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, the walls were still too <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> block a cannon shot or for a man to stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind the walls, but this was proving very {{expensive}} to maintain. This contemporary assessment of the weakness of the eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E

The spore dimensions are 32–43 by 25–38μm, the walls measuring 1–3μm thick. Although not reactive with Melzer's reagent, spores stain readily with Methyl blue. The asci contain 6 to 8 spores per ascus. They are variably shaped, with dimensions of 70–110 by 60–100μm, with a stem 10–40 by 6–10μm, and a forked base. Initially about 3μm thick, the ascus walls <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> roughly 1μm when mature. The gleba comprises loosely interwoven, thin-walled hyaline hyphae measuring 5–13μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|USS Galena was a wooden-hulled {{broadside}} ironclad {{built for}} the United States Navy during the American Civil War. The ship was initially assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and supported Union forces during the Peninsula Campaign in 1862. She was damaged during the Battle of Drewry's Bluff because her armor was too <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> prevent Confederate shots from penetrating. Widely regarded as a failure, Galena was reconstructed without most of her armor in 1863 and transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in 1864. The ship participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay and the subsequent Siege of Fort Morgan in August. She was briefly transferred to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron in September before she was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for repairs in November.|$|E
5|$|The {{neck of the}} emu is {{pale blue}} and shows through its sparse {{feathers}}. They have grey-brown plumage of shaggy appearance; the shafts and {{the tips of the}} feathers are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by the tips, and the inner plumage insulates the skin. This prevents the birds from overheating, allowing them to be active during the heat of the day. A unique feature of the emu feather is the double rachis emerging from a single shaft. Both of the rachis have the same length, and the texture is variable; the area near the skin is rather furry, but the more distant ends resemble grass. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male's penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates. The plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors, giving the bird a natural camouflage. Feathers of emus in more arid areas with red soils have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue. The juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown, with the head and neck being especially dark. The facial feathers gradually <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> expose the bluish skin. The adult plumage has developed by about fifteen months.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} 4 -year {{growth of}} 15 -year-old damaged and undamaged Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menzesii) after integrating temporary population reductions of mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa) with thinning in a pre-commercial hand-planted plantation in western Washington. Five treatment combinations were considered: (1) trapping mountain beavers in an unthinned area, (2) trapping before <b>thinning</b> <b>to</b> 65 trees/ha (160 trees/ac), (3) no trapping and <b>thinning</b> <b>to</b> 65 trees/ha, (4) no trapping and <b>thinning</b> <b>to</b> 146 trees/ha (360 trees/ac), and (5) no trapping and no thinning. Removal of ≥ 90 % of mountain beavers temporarily reduced mountain beaver activity whether the stand was unthinned or thinned. Diameter growth at breast height (dbh) was greater for undamaged trees than for damaged trees in thinned areas. Tree height growth was greatest in trapped areas whether thinned or not. No differences were detected in 4 -year survival between trees damaged aboveground and those without aboveground damage, {{which may be}} related to undetected root damage to trees without aboveground damage. Basal diameter growth and dbh growth were greatest for areas <b>thinned</b> <b>to</b> 65 trees/ha. Seventyeight percent of stomachs from mountain beaver trapped in winter contained Douglas fir root or stem materials. Overall, short-term removal of mountain beavers integrated with precommercial thinning promoted growth of crop trees...|$|R

5|$|The {{offensive}} {{began at}} 16:00 on 16 September; {{by the second}} day, JNA 9th (Knin) Corps commanding officer Major General Vladimir Vuković modified the initial plan because of significant resistance from the ZNG and Croatian police (who relied on populated areas and terrain features {{to hold back the}} JNA). Vuković's changes involved diverting part of the force to attack Drniš and Sinj, resting the remainder of the attacking force. These orders were confirmed on 18 September by the JNA Military-Maritime District commander, Vice Admiral Mile Kandić. The Yugoslav Navy began a blockade of the Croatian Adriatic coast on 17 September, further isolating Zadar, and the city's electricity supply was cut {{on the first day of}} the JNA attack. The ZNG was driven out of Polača, towards Škabrnja, on 18 September. Croatian forces captured seven JNA facilities in Zadar, the most significant the Turske kuće barracks and depot. The captures provided the ZNG with about 2,500 rifles, 100 M-53 machine guns and ammunition, although the Yugoslav Air Force bombed the barracks on 22 September in an unsuccessful attempt to hinder removal of the weapons. The captured weapons bolstered the Croatian defence, but JNA attacks north of the city resulted in a stalemate; Croatian forces were spread too <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> defend the city and capture the remaining barracks, and the besieged JNA garrisons were too weak to break out.|$|E

Horizontal drilling has changed the way oil and gas drilling is done by allowing producers access to reservoirs which were otherwise too <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> be economically viable through vertical drilling.

25|$|The {{challenge}} for the designers of DualDisc was to produce a dual-sided disc which was not too thick to play reliably in slot-loading drives, while the CD side was not too <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> be tracked easily by the laser.

25|$|An {{efficient}} Tesla turbine requires {{close spacing}} of the disks. For example, a steam-powered type must maintain 0.4 millimeter (.016inch) inter-disk spacing. The disks must be extremely smooth to minimize surface and shear losses. Disks {{must also be}} very <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> prevent drag and turbulence at disk edges. Unfortunately, preventing disks from warping and distorting was a major challenge in Tesla's time. It is thought that this inability to prevent the disks distorting contributed to the commercial failure of the turbines, because metallurgical technology {{at the time was}} not able to produce disks of sufficient quality and rigidity.|$|E
25|$|With {{the coming}} of the monsoon rains however, the Portuguese {{situation}} became critical: the tropical weather claimed a great amount of Portuguese lives, foodstuffs deteriorated and the Portuguese were stretched too <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> hold back the Muslim army. Under these conditions, Pulad Khan launched a major assault on May 11, across the Banastarim ford at low tide amidst a heavy storm, quickly overwhelming the small number of Portuguese troops. As their defenses crumbled, a Muslim revolt broke out in the outskirts of Goa while the Portuguese hurriedly retreated into the city walls with the aid of their Hindu allies but abandoning several artillery pieces by the riverside.|$|E

25|$|The soils {{closest to}} the plains of the Saône are too fertile, with patches of poorly drained soils, that make growing quality wine grapes difficult. As you move upwards along the cote {{escarpment}} the soil becomes progressively less fertile with higher proportions of the well-draining and highly porous oolitic limestone and less clay. At this elevation of around 800ft (250 m) most of the premier cru vineyards start to be found with areas of particularly favored location being designated as grand cru. The band of suitable soils for viticulture is narrow because too far up the hills (beyond 1000ft/300 m) the top soil becomes too <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> support vines.|$|E
25|$|All plywoods bind resin {{and wood}} fibre sheets (cellulose cells are long, strong and <b>thin)</b> <b>to</b> form a {{composite}} material. This alternation of the grain is called cross-graining and has several important benefits: {{it reduces the}} tendency of wood to split when nailed in at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes {{the strength of the}} panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced—this reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, {{it is very hard to}} bend it perpendicular to the grain direction of the surface ply.|$|E
