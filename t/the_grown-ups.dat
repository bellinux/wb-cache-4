Though Jerry does not want to go—he has made plans, he doesn't know the people—his mother coerces him: [...] "At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you'll leave." [...] Jerry knows it won't be that simple, so he persuades Elaine to attend, too. (To their unspoken dismay, she is seated at the kiddie table, lower than <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups.)</b> ...|$|E

Or perhaps Miss Grimmer IS a wicked fairy after all, and won't act up to it because <b>the</b> <b>grown-up</b> people have persuaded her not to. Either way, they would make us ridiculous if we told them what we expected.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you what we will do, Veronica," [...] I said; [...] "we will write a book. You shall help me. And in it the {{children}} shall be the wise and good people who never make mistakes, and they shall boss the show--you know what I mean--look after <b>the</b> <b>grown-up</b> people and bring them up properly. And everything <b>the</b> <b>grown-up</b> people do, or don't do, will be wrong." ...|$|R

60|$|None of us could. We went to <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups</b> {{and told}} them so; and <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups,</b> with unaccustomed {{understanding}} and sympathy, told us that we need not. Then we roamed about in our wretchedness and tried to comfort one another. We avoided the orchard; it was for us too full of happy memories to accord with our bitterness of soul. Instead, we resorted to the spruce wood, where the hush and the sombre shadows and the soft, melancholy sighing of {{the wind in the}} branches over us did not jar harshly on our new sorrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish Aunt Janet and Uncle Alec were home," [...] said Felix. [...] "It's {{not half}} {{so much fun}} having <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups</b> away as I thought it would be." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{scene is}} {{laid in the}} Moon. But {{everything}} is {{just the same as}} down here. With one exception. The children rule. <b>The</b> <b>grown-ups</b> do not like it. But they cannot help it. Something has happened to them. They don't know what. And the world is as it used to be. In the sweet old story-books. Before sin came. There are fairies that dance o' nights. And Witches. That lure you. And then turn you into things. And a dragon who lives in a cave. And springs out at people. And eats them. So {{that you have to be}} careful. And all the animals talk. And there are giants. And lots of magic. And it is the children who know everything. And what to do for it. And they have to teach <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups.</b> And <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups</b> don't believe half of it. And are far too fond of arguing. Which is a sore trial to the children. But they have patience, and are just.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>grown-ups</b> rose reluctantly and strolled away; but we {{children}} lingered for {{a moment}} to talk over an idea the Story Girl broached--a good idea, we thought enthusiastically, and one that promised to add considerable spice to life.|$|E
6000|$|We {{were all}} in the doleful dumps--at least, all we [...] "young fry" [...] were, and even <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups</b> were sorry and condescended to take an {{interest}} in our troubles. Pat, our own, dear, frolicsome Paddy, was sick again--very, very sick.|$|E
60|$|It was, as I {{remember}} it, a lard pail, {{very wide}} across the top, {{and without a}} cover. As I toddled along, the beer slopped over the rim upon my legs. And as I toddled, I pondered. Beer was a very precious thing. Come to think of it, it must be wonderfully good. Else why was I never permitted to drink {{of it in the}} house? Other things kept from me by <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups</b> I had found good. Then this, too, was good. Trust <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups.</b> They knew. And, anyway, the pail was too full. I was slopping it against my legs and spilling it on the ground. Why waste it? And no one would know whether I had drunk or spilled it.|$|E

60|$|At breakfast our appetites were poor. How could <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups</b> eat as they did? After {{breakfast and}} the {{necessary}} chores {{there was the}} forenoon to be lived through. Peter, true to his word, got out his Bible {{and began to read}} from the first chapter in Genesis.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Please, mamma, do tell us {{all about}} it,' said the girl. 'You know I stopped {{directly}} when you made me a sign not to go on asking questions before the little ones. And you said you should have to make us your friends while papa and <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups</b> are away.' ...|$|E
60|$|Well, we had {{all been}} badly hoaxed. But we did not trumpet our wrongs abroad. We did not even call Billy to account. We thought that least said was soonest mended in such a matter. We went very softly indeed, lest <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups,</b> {{especially}} that terrible Uncle Roger, should hear of it.|$|E

60|$|I was {{so small}} that, in order to {{negotiate}} the pail, I sat down and gathered it into my lap. First I sipped the foam. I was disappointed. The preciousness evaded me. Evidently it did not reside in the foam. Besides, the taste was not good. Then I remembered seeing <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups</b> blow the foam away before they drank. I buried {{my face in the}} foam and lapped the solid liquid beneath. It wasn't good at all. But still I drank. <b>The</b> <b>grown-ups</b> knew what they were about. Considering my diminutiveness, the size of the pail in my lap, and my drinking out of it my breath held and my face buried to the ears in foam, it was rather difficult to estimate how much I drank. Also, I was gulping it down like medicine, in nauseous haste to get the ordeal over.|$|E
60|$|In {{the weeks}} and months that {{followed}} I had no more interest in beer than in the kitchen stove after it had burned me. <b>The</b> <b>grown-ups</b> were right. Beer was not for children. <b>The</b> <b>grown-ups</b> didn't mind it; but neither did they mind taking pills and castor oil. As for me, I could manage to get along quite well without beer. Yes, and to the day of my death I could have managed to get along quite well without it. But circumstance decreed otherwise. At every turn in the world in which I lived, John Barleycorn beckoned. There was no escaping him. All paths led to him. And it took twenty years of contact, of exchanging greetings and passing on with my tongue in my cheek, to develop in me a sneaking liking for the rascal.|$|E
60|$|In the afternoon, when Aunt Janet {{was over}} at Uncle Roger's, seeing him and Aunt Olivia off to town, the clock was righted. The Story Girl and Peter {{came over to}} stay all night with us, and we made taffy in the kitchen, which <b>the</b> <b>grown-ups</b> kindly gave over to us for that purpose.|$|E
