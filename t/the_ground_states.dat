500|$|Astatine has 24 known nuclear isomers, {{which are}} nuclei {{with one or}} more nucleons (protons or neutrons) in an excited state. A nuclear isomer may also be called a [...] "meta-state", meaning the system has more {{internal}} energy than the [...] "ground state" [...] (the state with the lowest possible internal energy), making the former likely to decay into the latter. There may be more than one isomer for each isotope. The most stable of these nuclear isomers is astatine-202m1, which has a half-life of about 3 minutes, longer than those of all <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>states</b> bar those of isotopes 203–211 and 220.
