5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter {{from the airport to}} their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage. The man who had helped Dion stands to one side, watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over {{a carton}} of Kool-Aid mix on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and {{sleeping}} at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Trainor leaning {{on a bed}} reciting the song's lyrics, {{interspersed}} with scenes of dolls and a young girl and boy having a tea party. As the video progresses, Trainor proceeds to fail at her attempt to bake pies, setting a pie on fire. Trainor is then shown scrubbing <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor.</b> The entire video is interspersed with scenes of a singing and dancing barbershop quartet. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} video, Trainor tests potential suitors. The first date cooks her a meal consisting of a small portion of scallops, which fails to impress Trainor. The second potential suitor takes her to a carnival and tries to impress her with his strength, which also fails to impress Trainor. The third date takes her boating, with the boat nearly capsizing and Trainor getting seasick. This also fails to impress Trainor. Finally, Trainor meets Charlie Puth on the online dating service, PlentyofFish. Puth comes to Trainor's home with a carryout pizza, which succeeds in impressing Trainor. The video ends with Trainor smiling and inviting Puth into her home.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, {{there were}} no {{dramatic}} changes for the upper classes. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen,</b> located in <b>the</b> basement or the ground floor, continued to be operated by servants. In some houses, water pumps were installed, and some even had kitchen sinks and drains (but no water on tap yet, except for some feudal <b>kitchens</b> in castles). <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> became a much cleaner space {{with the advent of}} [...] "cooking machines", closed stoves made of iron plates and fired by wood and increasingly charcoal or coal, and that had flue pipes connected to the chimney. For <b>the</b> servants <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> continued to also serve as a sleeping room; they slept either on the floor, or later in narrow spaces above a lowered ceiling, for the new stoves with their smoke outlet no longer required a high ceiling in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floors</b> were tiled; kitchenware was neatly stored in cupboards to protect them from dust and steam. A large table served as a workbench; there were at least as many chairs as there were servants, for the table in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> also doubled as the eating place for the servants.|$|R

25|$|Three {{months after}} Nilsen's June 1982 {{promotion}} {{to the position}} of executive officer in his employment, he encountered a 27-year-old named Graham Allen attempting to hail a taxi in Shaftesbury Avenue. Allen accepted Nilsen's offer to accompany him to Cranley Gardens for a meal. As had been the case with several previous victims, Nilsen stated he could not recall the precise moment he had strangled Allen, but recalled approaching him as he sat eating an omelette with the full intention of murdering him. Allen's body was retained in the bathtub for a total of three days before Nilsen began the task of dissecting his body upon <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor.</b> Nilsen is again known to have informed his employers he was ill and unable to attend work on 9 October 1982 — likely in order that he could complete the dissection of Allen's body.|$|E

500|$|Paul McCartney later {{stated that}} Julia living in sin with Dykins {{while she was}} still married was a point of social ostracization for Lennon, as it was often used as a [...] "cheap shot" [...] against him. Although Julia never {{divorced}} Alf, she was considered to be the common-law wife of Dykins. She wanted Lennon to live with them both, but he was passed between the Stanley sisters and often ran away to Mimi's, where she would open the door to find Lennon standing there, [...] "his face covered in tears". Julia was accused by the family of being frivolous and unreliable— she never enjoyed household chores— and was once seen sweeping <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> with a pair of knickers on her head. Her cooking methods were also haphazard, as she would mix things [...] "like a mad scientist", and even put tea [...] "or anything else that came to hand" [...] in a stew. A favourite joke would be to wear a pair of spectacles that had no glass in them, and then to scratch her eye through the empty frame.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{opens in}} 1954 {{in the small}} logging {{settlement}} of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire. A log driving accident on the river has just claimed {{the life of a}} young logger, Angel, who slipped and fell under the logs. Dominic Baciagalupo is the camp's Italian-American cook who lives above the kitchen with his 12-year-old son, Daniel. Dominic lost his wife, Rosie, 10 years previously when a drunk Dominic, Rosie and a logger and mutual friend, Ketchum, were dancing on the frozen river, and the ice broke and Rosie went under. Later another accident happens that changes the lives of Dominic, Daniel and Ketchum. [...] "Injun Jane", the kitchen's dishwasher and girlfriend of the local law officer, Constable Carl, is having an affair with Dominic. One night, mistaking her for a bear attacking his father, Daniel kills her with an eight-inch cast-iron skillet. Dominic takes Jane's body and deposits it on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> of Carl's house, knowing that Carl will be passed out drunk and will probably believe he killed her, as he often beat her up. Early the next morning Dominic and Daniel tell Ketchum what happened and flee Twisted River in case the bad-tempered Carl finds out what really happened.|$|E

Since the house was plastered when built, the summer beams were reduced in depth and concealed within the plaster ceiling. According to Connecticut Architectural historians, the introduction of plaster, as an interior finish, brought about the end to the tradition of using summer beams. The home builder, holding onto more traditional building methods, included summer beams in the framing, but in a reduced size, as they were being phased out altogether.|$|R
2500|$|About midnight, {{the police}} stormed 1395 Lakeview Road. They {{were able to}} get inside, but a locked and barricaded door {{prevented}} them from reaching the second floor. Police also say they saw a body lying on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor.</b> Shortly afterward, the house caught fire. The cause of the fire was never determined, and the Cleveland Fire Department did not fight the blaze since it was believed firefighters would come under attack. Police observers later said they heard the names [...] "Omar" [...] and [...] "Ali" [...] shouted from within the home. 1391 Lakeview Road also caught fire, and both homes burned to the ground.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an account}} first {{published}} in 1999 by the widely cited newsletter Taylorology, on October 21, 1964, while still living in Hollywood, Gibson suffered a heart attack. Sensing that she was dying, a highly distraught Gibson—a recently converted Roman Catholic—asked for a priest and then confessed to neighbors the February 1, 1922 murder of Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor. She may have made statements about a motive but in 1999, the only surviving witness to this incident wrote that at the time, he was young, distracted by the immediate crisis of her heart attack, {{had no knowledge of}} who William Desmond Taylor was or what she was talking about. As a result, he could not remember many further details about what Gibson said as she lay dying on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> of her small house. The witness did recall Gibson also said she had been [...] "nearly caught" [...] and had [...] "fled the country".|$|E
2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> with a cloth, Rose accidentally {{stepped into}} the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got {{to take me to the}} hospital now." ...|$|E

6000|$|This Bourneville was {{germane to}} that matter. It {{had been an}} attempt {{on the part of}} a private firm of {{manufacturers}} to improve the housing of their workers. To our ideas to-day it would seem the feeblest of benevolent efforts, but at the time it was extraordinary and famous, and people came long journeys to see its trim cottages with baths sunk under <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floors</b> (of all conceivable places), and other brilliant inventions. No one seemed to see the danger to liberty in that aggressive age, that might arise through making workpeople tenants and debtors of their employer, though an Act called the Truck Act had long ago intervened to prevent minor developments in the same direction. [...] . But I and my chance acquaintance seemed that night always to have been aware of that possibility, and we had no doubt in our minds of the public nature of the housing duty. Our interest lay rather in the possibility of common nurseries and kitchens and public rooms that should economize toil and give people space and freedom.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} set {{on the west side}} of Manning Street, in the northeastern part of the rural town of Holden. The main house is a 1-1/2 story wood-frame structure, four bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and stone foundation. Modern {{additions}} extend the house to the right and rear. The main entrance, in the bay second from left, is flanked by sidelight windows, with otherwise simple framing topped by a cornice. The interior of the main block has retained much original detail, including its fireplaces, wide wainscoting, and wide pine <b>flooring</b> in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> plan is a central hall plan modified because the house is not a typical five bays wide, with a larger parlor and a smaller hall space on either side of the chimney, and <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> behind.

2500|$|The {{album is}} named after track four, [...] "Talk a Good Game" [...] which {{features}} Kevin Cossom. Over a [...] "snaky but sweet" [...] production from T-Minus Rowland sings [...] "I don’t think I can take another broken promise / Why do things the hard way when you can just be honest". Hampp said that Cossom's rap gave the song a [...] "street edge". It takes the listener on an emotional journey according to The Honesty Hour. The next song, [...] "Down on Love", is a midtempo production featuring another classic sample, this time the 1987 song [...] "Rock Steady" [...] by American R group The Whispers. Using her mezzo-soprano vocals, Rowland takes on a downtrodden romantic situation, [...] "We want two different things at two different times / You know how the story go / Easy come easy go". [...] "Dirty Laundry" [...] was co-written by Rowland, Carlos McKinney and The Dream, and is R [...] "confessional" [...] ballad, containing [...] "R jam spools" [...] and a piano-led melody. It details a [...] "frank and often poignant commentary" [...] on Rowland's life. The song is a [...] "brutal" [...] chronicle of {{the last ten years}} of Rowland's life, covering her envy of Beyoncé's solo success and the end of an abusive relationship. Amongst the lyrics, Rowland sings [...] "Kinda lucky I was in her shadow / Phone call from my sister what’s the matter / She said, 'Oh no / You gotta leave' / I’m on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> / He took the keys." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three clues {{were found}} at the scene. The first was the caliber of bullets. The second was a {{flashlight}} found in the hedge underneath the window that Starks was shot from. The last clue was of bloody prints around the house; shoe-prints on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor,</b> and smudged fingerprints in other places. Sheriff Davis stated that although this murder could not be directly linked to the Phantom because the caliber was a [...]22, [...] "it {{is possible that the}} killer is one and the same man." [...] Those who had been driving in the area near the time of the slaying, along with several men found within the vicinity, were picked up for questioning. Early Saturday morning, bloodhounds were brought in from Hope by the Arkansas State Police. They found two trails that led to the highway before the scent was lost. That night, many officers patrolled lovers' lanes hoping to prevent another attack. By Sunday night, more State Police officers were called in to help in the investigation and to aid in protecting the local civilians. Officers had detained at least twelve suspects but only kept three for further questioning. Forty-seven officers were working around the clock to solve the mysteries. Among them were sheriffs of four counties, Captain Gonzaullas and his staff of Texas Rangers, and Chief Deputy Tillman Johnson. The flashlight was sent to Washington, D.C. for further inspection by the FBI. Meanwhile, Mrs. Starks was showing improvements at Michael Meagher Hospital. The unofficial theory for a motive amongst the majority of the 47 officers was that of [...] "sex mania", because large amounts of money in the home were not taken, nor was Mrs. Starks' purse, which was lying on the bed containing money and jewels, and because nothing was stolen from the home. The title {{on the front page of}} the Texarkana Gazette on Sunday, May 5, 1946 read: [...] "SEX MANIAC HUNTED IN MURDERS".|$|E
