5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all {{guarantees}} of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and <b>the</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is <b>the</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E

25|$|However, {{a problem}} {{occurred}} when an off-the-record comment by Joseph Nye, then Carter’s Assistant Secretary of State for nuclear affairs, was reproduced {{in a newspaper}} article.

25|$|According to Lucian Boia, Arbore's public stances {{under the}} actual German {{occupation}} were surprisingly toned down. His one article for Lumina (November 1917) reviewed the Russian issue in quite different terms, prophesying that a multinational federation could be effected around the Russian Provisional Government. His 1918 public lectures on Bessarabia {{were focused on}} geographic and statistical information—"one would have expected more", Boia notes. Arbore was more outspoken during the interwar period: his December 1918 speech demanded <b>the</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> minority rights in Greater Romania, saluted the policies of Soviet Russia as a liberating force, and predicted a Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War. On the occasion, Arbore also demanded the release of Socialist Party activists held in Romanian custody, {{as well as the}} freeing of Transylvanian collaborationist Slavici.|$|E

40|$|We develop fast {{spectral}} algorithms for tensor decomposition {{that match}} <b>the</b> robustness <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best known polynomial-time algorithms for this problem {{based on the}} sum-of-squares (SOS) semidefinite programming hierarchy. Our algorithms can decompose a 4 -tensor with $n$-dimensional orthonormal components {{in the presence of}} error with constant spectral norm (when viewed as an $n^ 2 $-by-$n^ 2 $ matrix). The running time is $n^ 5 $ which is close to linear in the input size $n^ 4 $. We also obtain algorithms with similar running time to learn sparsely-used orthogonal dictionaries even when feature representations have constant relative sparsity and non-independent coordinates. The only previous polynomial-time algorithms to solve these problem are based on solving large semidefinite programs. In contrast, our algorithms are easy to implement directly and are based on spectral projections and tensor-mode rearrangements. Or work is inspired by recent of Hopkins, Schramm, Shi, and Steurer (STOC' 16) that shows how fast spectral algorithms can achieve <b>the</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> SOS for average-case problems. In this work, we introduce general techniques to capture <b>the</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> SOS for worst-case problems...|$|R
25|$|The Declaration of Montreal on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Human Rights is a {{document}} adopted in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on July 29, 2006, by the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights which formed {{part of the}} first World Outgames. The Declaration outlines a number of rights and freedoms pertaining to LGBT and intersex people that it is proposed be universally guaranteed. It encompasses all aspects of human rights, from <b>the</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> fundamental freedoms to the prevention of discrimination against LGBT people in healthcare, education and immigration. The Declaration also addresses various issues that impinge on the global promotion of LGBT rights and intersex human rights. Intended as a starting point in listing the demands of the international LGBT movement, it will ultimately be submitted to the United Nations.|$|E

The lives of the Francofon soldiers would be spared since 60% of his own cavalry consisted of French deserters.

25|$|The key {{features}} of the 2011 CBA included changes related to health and safety, including {{a reduction in the}} number of off-season practices, a prohibition against training camp “two-a days", and a limit on contact practices in both the preseason and regular season. The new CBA also featured increases in player benefits, including retroactive pension increases for retired players and the creation of a neuro-cognitive benefit for players affected by concussions and other similar injuries. Also, the agreement promised an increase up to $1.5 million in salary guarantees for injured players and a new revenue split, offering players between 47 percent and 48.5 percent of all revenue. Changes were also made in contract-related benefits, with an increase in minimum player salaries and salary cap minimums, including <b>the</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> a 99% -95% league wide spend and a requirement that each club would have to spend an average of 89% of the salary cap over four-year periods.|$|E
