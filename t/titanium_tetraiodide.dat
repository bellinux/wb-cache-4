5|$|Titanium {{tetrachloride}} (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl4) is a colorless volatile liquid (commercial {{samples are}} yellowish) that, in air, hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds. Via the Kroll process, TiCl4 {{is produced in}} the conversion of titanium ores to titanium dioxide, e.g., for use in white paint. It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama aldol condensation. In the van Arkel process, <b>titanium</b> <b>tetraiodide</b> (TiI4) is generated {{in the production of}} high purity titanium metal.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of <b>titanium</b> <b>tetraiodide.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many {{methods have}} been applied to the {{production}} of titanium metal, beginning with a report in 1887 by Nilsen and Pettersen using sodium, which was optimized into the commercial Hunter process. In the 1920s van Arkel had described the thermal decomposition of <b>titanium</b> <b>tetraiodide</b> to give highly pure titanium. Titanium tetrachloride was found to reduce with hydrogen at high temperatures to give hydrides that can be thermally processed to the pure metal. With this background, Kroll developed both new reductants and new apparatus for the reduction of titanium tetrachloride. Its high reactivity toward trace amounts of water and other metal oxides presented challenges. Significant success came with the use of calcium as a reductant, but the resulting still contained significant oxide impurities. Major success using magnesium at 1000 °C using a molybdenum clad reactor, as reported to the Electrochemical Society in Ottawa. Kroll's titanium was highly ductile reflecting its high purity. The Kroll process displaced the Hunter process and continues to be the dominant technology for the production of titanium metal, as well as driving the majority of the world's production of magnesium metal.|$|E
40|$|TiN {{thin films}} were grown by atomic layer epitaxy using <b>titanium</b> <b>tetraiodide</b> (Ti 14) and ammonia (NH 3) as precur-sors. The films were {{characterized}} with Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and resistivity measure-ments, Both {{the growth rate}} and film quality were markedly dependent on thç growth temperature. As the temperature was increased from 400 to 500 °C the growth rate increased from 0. 12 to 0. 30 A/cycle, and the resistivity decreased from 380 to 70 pSi cm. Also, the oxygen content decreased with increasing temperature being about 10 atom % in the films grown at 475 to 500 °C. The iodine contents were below 0. 5 atom %...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} reactor {{system has been}} optimized throughout a series of experiments for making titanium tubes from an electrically heated titanium coil filament by a chemical vapour deposition method, based on the original van Arkel-de Boer -process. The titanium is thermally decomposed on the filament from vapourized <b>titanium</b> <b>tetraiodide</b> in a method not seen in similar experiments. The small-scale reactor is built for this purpose, and the associated systems and methods are developed to maintain the optimal conditions for a continuous metal deposition. A filament current control system is made of an Arduino micro-controller, utilizing a photo-resistor to measure thermal radiation from the filament, working for maintaining a constant filament temperature. Five experiments are conducted with the small-scale reactor and presented in this thesis, where different procedures, materials, duration and amount of starting material is tested. By the use of copper electrodes, it was quickly found that the metal could easily be contaminated from other metal sources. The most important precautions necessary to achieve a good deposition of high purity is to keep {{air out of the}} system, and a purpose-built glove box is made to fulfill this. In the first two experiments, titanium was deposited on a platinum wire and tungsten wire, respectively. In the three following experiments, a titanium coil filament was used, whereas experiment 5 was considered the most successful, by the purity of the deposited titanium and the growth on the coil filament, forming a solid tube.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} from a systematic {{study of the}} composition, texture, and electrical properties of titanium nitride(TiN) films and their performance as diffusion barrier in multilevel interconnect schemes of ultralarge scale integration (ULSI) computer chip device structures. The films were grown by low temperature (< 450 °C) inorganic chemical vapor deposition using <b>titanium</b> <b>tetraiodide</b> as source precursor and ammonia and hydrogen as co-reactants. The TiN films were nitrogen-rich., with iodine concentrations below 2 atom percent, displayed resistivities in the range 100 to 150 p. ul cm depending on thickness, and exhibited excellent step coverage with better than 90 % conformality in both nominal 0. 45 p. m, 3 : 1 aspect ratio and 0. 25 p. m, 4 : 1 aspect ratio contact structures. A comparison of the properties of chemical vapor deposited (CVD) TiN with equivalent physical vapor deposited (PVD) TiN showed that reactivity with Al- 0. 5 a/o Cu alloys was equivalent in both cases. In particular a 10 % increase in the Al-Cu/TiN stack sheet resistance was observed for both types of TiN after a 450 °C, 30 mm sinter. Similarly, the characteristics of CVD tungsten and reflow plug fills were iden-tical on both types of TiN films. However, barrier performance for CVD TiN in aluminum and tungsten plug technologies was superior to that of PVD TiN, as evidenced by lower contact diode leakage for CVD TiN in comparison with PVD TiN films of equal thickness. This improved barrier performance {{could be attributed to}} a combination of factors, which include the nitrogen-rich composition, higher density, and enhanced conformality of the CVD TiN phase in comparison with the PVD TiN. In view of the superior step coverage and diffusion barrier characteristics, the low temperature inor...|$|E
