30|$|In practice, {{the reasons}} varied between types of {{apprenticeship}} and were {{strongly related to}} the net costs incurred by employers. In practice there were two contrasting primary models in operation. Firstly, a demand side approach was discernible where employers engaged in apprenticeships because it provided them with the skills <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> their business objectives and {{because there is no}} alternative forms of training available. Typically in these cases, the apprenticeship had become the industry standard in demonstrating that the workforce possessed the skills required to undertake work competently. This may be contrasted with the second approach, a supply-led one where training providers were instrumental in persuading employers to engage in apprenticeships rather than provide, for example, unaccredited in-house training. Typically, providers would persuade employers {{that there would be no}} additional cost of participating in apprenticeships compared with existing training, but there were additional benefits from making the switch (e.g. in improving staff recruitment and retention).|$|R

Each states total electric generation for 2015 is compared with the states consumption and its share of the system loses and the difference between the generated electric energy and its total consumption (including its share of the system loses) is the amount of energy it exports. For Hawaii (HI), total consumption equals generated energy. For the other states multiplying their direct consumption by 1.1084811845 (4077600939/3758992390) results in USA supply (including net imports) being equal to USA total consumption usage.

The subsistence research and community action projects conducted by and for the Insight Center for Community Economic Development (ICCED) are valuable contributors to this project. A qualitative inquiry comparing actual earned income and expenses of the five participants with the Self-Sufficiency Standard for Riverside County 2011 (ICCED-Riv) revealed gaps <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> subsistence ranging from 12, 327 to 42, 722 in annual income.

Although other educational goals, including traditional literacy, computer literacy, library skills, and critical thinking skills, are related to information literacy and important foundations for its development, information literacy itself is emerging as a distinct skill set and a necessary key to one's social and economic well-being in an increasingly complex information society. [...] According to McTavish (2009), in order to increase and maximize people's contributions to a healthy, democratic and pluralistic society and maintain a prosperous and sustainable economy, governments and industries around the world are challenging education systems to focus people's attention on literacy.
