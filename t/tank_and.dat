5|$|A further {{challenge}} for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times a stunt dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A prosthetic Beagle was also created for the scenes in the isolation <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series Carnivàle and the film The Chronicles of Riddick.|$|E
5|$|A {{voluntary}} {{fire service}} operates on the island. Herm Fire Brigade operates a tractor-hauled fire tender with a hose-reel, a pump, a 2,000-litre water <b>tank,</b> <b>and</b> basic fire-fighting equipment which they use {{while waiting for}} assistance from the Guernsey Fire Brigade, who also provide the Herm volunteers with training and support.|$|E
5|$|After a week {{of being}} {{subjected}} to almost constant artillery, <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> infantry attacks, {{the remnants of the}} brigade were evacuated south of the River Rhine. During the battle of Arnhem, the brigade's total casualties amounted to seventy-eight per cent, and the 4th Parachute Brigade was disbanded rather than reformed, the survivors being posted to the 1st Parachute Brigade.|$|E
5000|$|Leaking {{underground}} <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> piping: Petroleum products, chemicals, and wastes {{stored in}} underground storage <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> pipes {{may end up}} in the ground water. <b>Tanks</b> <b>and</b> piping leak if they are constructed or installed improperly. Steel <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> piping corrode with age. Tanks are often found on farms. The possibility of leaking tanks is great on old, abandoned farm sites. Farm tanks are exempt from the EPA rules for petroleum <b>and</b> chemical <b>tanks.</b>|$|R

5|$|Excess heat can {{be removed}} by {{immersion}} of the cylinder in a cold water bath while filling.

5|$|In 2003, OO-DLL, a DHL Airbus A300, {{was struck}} by a surface-to-air missile shortly after departing from Baghdad International Airport, Iraq. The missile struck the port-side wing, rupturing a fuel <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> causing the loss of all three {{hydraulic}} systems. With the flight controls disabled, the crew used differential thrust to execute a safe landing at Baghdad.|$|E
50|$|It takes a {{few weeks}} to {{transfer}} <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> their supporting equipment by air or sea. Some <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> armoured vehicles can be dropped by parachute, or carried by cargo airplanes or helicopters. The largest transports can only carry one or two main battle tanks. Smaller transports can only carry or air drop light <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> APCs such as the M113.|$|R
50|$|The complex {{was set up}} in 1987 as a heavy {{repair center}} for <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> armored vehicles. The Derg regime had plans to {{eventually}} produce <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> armored vehicles at the complex.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{the limited}} {{availability}} of recovery vehicles and spare parts meant that broken down <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> other non-combat losses often {{could not be}} repaired. Tanks with even insignificant technical failures had to be blown up or burned by their crews upon retreat. The 12th Mechanized Corps, deployed in Baltic Special Military District, had 449 T-26 tanks, 2 flame-throwing <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> 4 T-26T artillery tractors on 22 June 1941. The corps lost 201 T-26 <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> all flame-throwing <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> artillery tractors by 7 July 1941. A further 186 T-26 tanks were lost to technical failures.|$|R
5|$|Olivia rejoins Henry {{and then}} leaves him to swim {{the rest of}} the way in and make her way to the {{isolation}} tank. After injecting herself with the same drugs Walternate (John Noble) had used on her, she enters the <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> soon finds herself back in her own universe. She encounters a cleaning lady, and as Olivia feels herself being dragged back to the parallel universe, she gives the cleaning lady a message to pass along to Peter (Joshua Jackson). Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> directs his agents to lock her up and sedate her.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the costumes}} {{from the film}} had been {{originally}} used in the stage production. Props and set pieces were reused from old Hammer Horror productions and others. The <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> dummy used for Rocky's birth originally appeared in The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958). These references to earlier productions, in addition to cutting costs, enhanced the cult status of the film.|$|E
5|$|Standard US <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> armored {{infantry}} battalions had {{a mortar}} platoon equipped with either M21s or the older M4 MMCs. The M21 was used mainly to illuminate targets {{at night or}} provide indirect fire support to the infantry. The usage was uncommon because the White Motor Company was only able to produce 110 M21s in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty's {{informal}} approach {{changed when}} {{a branch of}} the Naval Research Laboratory was established at Leamington Spa under Commander James Yunge-Bateman to test ship camouflage schemes experimentally.

5|$|The British Fourth Army took 13,000 prisoners {{while the}} French {{captured}} a further 3,000. Total German losses were {{estimated to be}} 30,000 on 8 August.

5|$|The next German {{attack was}} in force, using the 2nd Battalion 857th Grenadier Regiment, the 1st and 2nd Battalion's 858th Grenadier Regiment and several {{companies}} of the 744th Grenadier Regiment with <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> armoured car support. They attempted {{to force a}} gap in the British lines between the commandos and the 3rd Parachute Brigade to reach Ranville.|$|E
5|$|To offset shortages, {{captured}} {{equipment from}} the French and other occupied armies were {{incorporated in the}} defences, casemates designed for non-German artillery, anti <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> machine guns {{and the use of}} turrets from obsolete tanks in tobrukstand pill boxes (tobruk pits).|$|E

50|$|Fuller's {{plan had}} three elements. The {{first was a}} fast attack by medium <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> {{aircraft}} against the German headquarters, removing its ability to control their forces. Then the main assault by heavy <b>tanks,</b> infantry <b>and</b> artillery would make break the German lines. Finally cavalry, light <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> infantry mounted on trucks would follow the retreating Germans preventing them from reforming or counterattacking.|$|R
50|$|On 27 May, {{the attacks}} of the 1st Armoured Division, 2e DLC and the 5e DLC cost the British 65 <b>tanks</b> knocked out <b>and</b> another 55 from {{mechanical}} breakdowns.

5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think <b>tank,</b> <b>and</b> a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he has}} a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel <b>tank,</b> <b>and</b> a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|During {{the times}} of Vasabha, Mahasena (274–301) and Dhatusena, the {{construction}} of large irrigation <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> canals was given priority.
