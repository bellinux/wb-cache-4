5|$|Myrtle Wilson– George's wife, and Tom Buchanan's mistress. Myrtle, who {{possesses}} a fierce vitality, is desperate to find refuge from her complacent marriage, but unfortunately <b>this</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> her tragic ending.

5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Ponnar and Sankar are actually Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, {{who was then}} a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved the twins as small children from Mandhiyappan. Mandhiyappan had attempted to avenge himself on Thamarai for rejecting his hand in marriage. He learns that the twins are still alive and hatches a conspiracy to kill them. He tricks Kali Mannan (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping him. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> an intense battle which ends with good prevailing over evil.|$|E

5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, <b>this</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E
5|$|Betty is mugged in 1982 by Raymond Attwood (Joe Searby) from Ken Barlow's (William Roache) youth club; she {{ends up in}} {{hospital}} with a broken arm. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> a reunion with Ted, the man who fathered Gordon, though he is unaware of his son's existence. Ted visits Betty {{in hospital}} after reading about her mugging in a newspaper. Betty agonises over whether to tell Ted about Gordon, but decides against it, preferring not to stir up the past.|$|E

5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 c is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} outer planets Gliese 876 b and Gliese 876 e: for every orbit of planet e, planet b completes two orbits and planet c completes four. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> strong gravitational {{interactions between the}} planets, causing the orbital elements to change rapidly as the orbits precess. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|Harry {{is back at}} the Dursleys, {{where he}} sees on Muggle {{television}} that a prisoner named Sirius Black has escaped. Harry involuntarily inflates Aunt Marge when she comes to visit after she insults Harry and his parents. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> his running away and being {{picked up by the}} Knight Bus. He travels to the Leaky Cauldron where he meets Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, who asks Harry to stay in Diagon Alley for the remaining three weeks {{before the start of the}} school year at Hogwarts.|$|E

5|$|In around 1 {{percent of}} infections, {{poliovirus}} spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, preferentially replicating in and destroying motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> {{the development of}} paralytic poliomyelitis, {{the various forms of}} which (spinal, bulbar, and bulbospinal) vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} in the series, he oversees FBI agent Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) briefing and debriefing, and later disposes of evidence Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully had brought back from their investigation of an alien abduction. With the Smoking Man hiding truth from the public, Mulder seeks to reveal {{it to the public}} and the truth about the disappearance of his sister, Samantha. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> a rivalry that lasts {{until the end of the}} series.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at alkaline pH. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> {{an increase}} in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, {{it is difficult to}} precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E
50|$|One {{published}} guideline for clincher {{inflation pressure}} is {{to pick the}} value for each wheel that produces a 15% reduction in {{the distance between the}} wheel rim and the ground when loaded (i.e. with the rider and cargo) compared to when unloaded. Pressures below <b>this</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> increased rolling resistance and likelihood of pinch-flats. Pressures above <b>this</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> less rolling resistance in the tire itself, but to larger energy losses in the frame and rider. Bicycle tires are essentially thin-walled pressure vessels and so the circumferential force in the casing is directly proportional to the internal pressure and to the tire diameter, and the force in the longitudinal direction is half of this.|$|R
5000|$|As stated above, the STAT3-Ser/Hes3 {{signaling}} axis {{regulates the}} number of neural stem cells (as well as other cell types) in culture. This prompted experiments {{to determine if the}} same pathway can also regulate {{the number of}} naturally resident (endogenous) neural stem cells in the adult rodent brain. If so, this would generate a new experimental approach to study the effects of increasing the number of endogenous neural stem cells (eNSCs). For example, would <b>this</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the replacement of lost cells by newly generated cells from eNSCs? Or, could <b>this</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the rescue of damaged neurons in models of neurodegenerative disease, since eNSCs are known to produce factors that can protect injured neurons? ...|$|R

5|$|Nitrogen has two stable isotopes: 14N and 15N. The {{first is}} much more common, making up 99.634% of natural nitrogen, and the second (which is {{slightly}} heavier) makes up the remaining 0.366%. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> an atomic weight of around 14.007u. Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the CNO cycle in stars, but 14N is more common as its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step. 14N {{is one of the}} five stable odd–odd nuclides (a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are 2H, 6Li, 10B, and 180mTa.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E
5|$|The manga's reboot, Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration, follows Kenshin's stay in Tokyo {{as in the}} {{original}} series. After attacking a drug dealer known as Takeda Kanryu, Kenshin becomes the target {{of many of his}} warriors. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> a fight against his old enemy Jin-e from the Shinsengumi who tries to encourage his hitokiri be reborn by using Kaoru as a hostage and nearly killing her. However, as Kenshin is about kill Jin-e, Kaoru stops him; following Jin-e's suicide, Kenshin stays in Kaoru's dojo. Before the reboot, Watsuki also wrote a prequel chapter where Kenshin meets a western doctor during his years of wandering.|$|E
