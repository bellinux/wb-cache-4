5|$|Because WALL-E overtly critiques consumerism, it also critiques Disney's {{production}} {{values and}} aesthetic, without being too obvious. In the DVD commentary, Stanton {{said that he}} has been asked if it was his intention <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> about consumerism. His answer was it was not; {{it was a way to}} answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself.|$|E
5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie.</b> He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E

5|$|The festival {{turned out}} to be a huge success, both {{critically}} and financially. The show attracted the attention of entertainment executives, including Columbia Pictures, which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under the pretense of wanting <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> about Cirque du Soleil. Laliberté was unhappy with the deal, claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia, which was attempting to secure all rights to the production. Laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could be concluded, and that experience stands out as a key reason why Cirque du Soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years, until Guy Laliberte announced in April 2015 that he was selling his majority stake to a group headed by a U.S. private equity firm, and its Chinese partners.|$|E

25|$|Although she {{had tried}} for several years to shed her image as a porn star, Chambers {{returned}} to the adult film industry with 1980's Insatiable. In the film she played actress, model, and heiress Sandra Chase, whose appetite for sex is, as the title suggests, insatiable. Sandra is getting ready <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> and her manager, played by Jessie St. James, is working on getting some big names to appear alongside Sandra.

40|$|Promiscuity among {{teenagers}} {{is one of}} {{the necessities}} of human life, because humans are social creatures who need others in their daily, and interpersonal relationships fostered through an association (Rini Fauziyah, 2011). But promiscuity is happening now is very alarming. There are so many that have been occurring deviant behavior and violate social values in society such as sex, drugs, abortion and others. According to BKKBN survey in 2010 showed 51 percent of teens in Jabodetabek have premarital sex. As a source of information to the public about the impact of free association it needs <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> short <b>movie</b> drama genre with a linear circular groove that tells about the impact of promiscuity. The short <b>movie</b> itself is <b>a</b> film with a duration under 60 minutes (Effendy, 2009 : 4). With short duration, movie makers are more selective in conveying the message. In the researchers aim <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> short <b>movie</b> that puts on the information of the impact of promiscuity among teenagers. The method used is an interview, study of existing literature and studies related to the effects of promiscuity and how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> short <b>movie.</b> Further analysis <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> short <b>movie,</b> made concept, synopsis, scenarios and storyboards. After that go on stage and continued shooting at the stage of video editing. The result is <b>a</b> short <b>movie</b> about the information {{of the impact of the}} drama genre promiscuity using linear circular groove. Researchers hope that from this work may reduce that number of teens who commit negative actions due to the influences of promiscuity...|$|R
25|$|Flynn {{wrote and}} co-produced his next film, the low budget Adventures of Captain Fabian (1951), {{directed}} by Marshall and shot in France. Flynn wound up suing Marshall in court over both movies. For Warners {{he appeared in}} an adventure tale set in the Philippines, Mara Maru (1952). That studio released a documentary of a 1946 voyage he had taken on his yacht, Cruise of the Zaca (1952.

25|$|In 1950, Anger {{moved to}} Paris, France, where he {{initially}} stayed with {{friends of his}} (who themselves {{had been forced to}} leave Hollywood after being blacklisted for formerly having belonged to trade union organisations). He would later remark that he travelled to the country after receiving a letter from the French director Jean Cocteau in which he told Anger of his admiration for Fireworks (shown in 1949 at Festival du Film Maudit in Biarritz, France). Upon arrival, Anger and Cocteau became friends, with the Frenchman giving the young protege his permission <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> of his ballet The Young Man and Death, although at the time there were no financial backers for the project. While in Paris he continued producing short films; in 1950 he started filming on Rabbit's Moon, which was also known as La Lune des Lapins and revolved around a clown who was staring up at the moon, in which a rabbit lived, something found within Japanese mythology. Anger produced 20 minutes of footage at the Films du Pantheon Studio in the city before he was rushed out of the studio, leaving the film uncompleted. He stored the footage in the disorganized archives of the Cinémathèque Française, and only collected it again in 1970, when he finally finished and released Rabbit's Moon. It was at the Cinémathèque Française that he was given by the head, Henri Langlois, prints of Sergei Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico!, which he attempted to put into Eisenstein's original order.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1978, {{he started}} an ambitious tour of SFR Yugoslavia with Lokice dance group {{in support of}} the album that had already sold 150,000 copies. Čolić also started to play the guitar {{occasionally}} on stage. Putujući zemljotres (Traveling Earthquake Tour) produced and organized by Maksa Ćatović moved all over the country, soon becoming a phenomenon the likes of which the country had not seen before. The scenes of screaming girls rushing the stage were repeated in city after city. The tour's climax took place in Belgrade at Red Star FC stadium on 5 September 1978 with 70,000 people in attendance despite the fact that Čolić already played two sold out shows in Belgrade a few months earlier on 4 and 8 April at Hala Pionir. Supporting Čolić on stage that night were Chris Nicholls on keyboards and Dado Topić on bass guitar with old favourites Kornelije Kovač, Arsen Dedić, Kemal Monteno, Josip Boček, Trio Strune and RTV Belgrade singing quintet appearing as guests. Čolić and the massive tour essentially became a cultural phenomenon transcending musical boundaries such that in the lead up to the big Belgrade concert journalist Dušan Savković and film director Jovan Ristić decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> about Čolić. Savković wrote a rudimentary screenplay, but the movie ended up being a 90-minute feature documentary titled Pjevam danju, pjevam noću that follows Čolić from Belgrade concert onwards and looks back on his career up to that point. Two days after the Belgrade concert, Čolić was in his hometown Sarajevo at Koševo Stadium for the tour's grand finale, however the rain interrupted much of the concert and the whole thing {{turned out to be a}} little anticlimactic. By the end of its promotion cycle, the album sold more than 700,000 copies and with later re-releases during the 1990s went over the million mark.|$|E
