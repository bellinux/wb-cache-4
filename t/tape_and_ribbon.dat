40|$|International audienceThermomechanical {{shaping of}} {{metallic}} glasses {{has previously been}} reported to result in severe thermal embrittlement. This phenomenon is most likely the reason why little effort {{has been made to}} exploit the mechanical properties of complex shapes attainable by thermomechanical shaping of metallic glass <b>tapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>ribbons.</b> The present study revealed time temperature windows in which metallic glasses can be shaped by thermal annealing while remaining fully ductile. These include binary (Fe(83) B(17), Co(80) B(20) and Pd(82) Si(18)), ternary (Fe(81. 5) B(14. 5) Si(4) and Cu(60) Zr(30) Al(10)) and more complex quaternary Zr(70) Ni(16) Cu(6) Al(8) glassy alloys of both metal metalloid and metal metal types. All showed full bending ductility after shaping. The thermomechanical processing leading to full shaping without thermal embrittlement was successfully modeled using the approach of A. I. Taub (Ada Metallurgica 1981) based on the free-volume model of structural relaxation. The results are of direct interest for applications of metallic glasses as springs. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|We study, {{by means}} of {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) simulations with explicit water, the structure and stability of beta-sheet <b>tapes,</b> <b>ribbons</b> <b>and</b> double <b>ribbons</b> formed by rationally designed oligopeptides P- 11 -I and P- 11 -II in aqueous solutions. Two different methods {{for the treatment of}} the electrostatic interactions were considered: a smoothly shifted spherical cutoff approach under spherical harmonic conditions, and the particle mesh Ewald technique. We investigate the transfer of chirality from single L-aminoacids to the molecular scale of oligopeptides and from the latter to the supramolecular scale of peptide clusters. Furthermore, we obtain structural data for the representative conformations of these clusters, as well as study various average properties of their geometry...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} {{of a single}} beta-aminoethane sulfonyl amide moiety in a highly amyloidogenic peptide sequence resulted in a complete loss of amyloid fibril formation. Instead, supramolecular folding morphologies were observed. Subsequent chemoselective N-alkylation of the sulfonamide resulted in amphiphilic peptide-based hydrogelators. It was found that variation of merely the alkyl chain induced a dramatic variation in aggregation motifs such as helical <b>ribbons</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapes,</b> <b>ribbons</b> progressing to closed tubes, twisted lamellar sheets and entangled/branched fibers...|$|R

40|$|Inspired {{by recent}} work {{describing}} surfactant-like peptides, we have {{carried out a}} systematic study on peptides with the underlying composition of V 6 D 2, altering the absolute sequence to determine {{the importance of the}} surfactant-like structure. All of the peptides examined here formed self-assembled structures in water. However, in contrast to other reports, we have found a surprising diversity of structures including fibers, <b>tapes,</b> <b>and</b> twisted <b>ribbons</b> but an absence of the vesicles and nanotubes described previously. Further investigations demonstrated that peptide purity plays {{a significant role in the}} outcome of the self-assembly. Different batches behave very differently, which can be linked to the compositions of these batches. This work shows that there is a need for not only rational design but also ease of synthesis of the building blocks for self-assembled structures...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{results from}} {{an effort to}} fabricate a shape memory alloy hybrid composite (SMAHC) panel specimen and test the structure for dynamic response and noise transmission characteristics under the action of thermal and random acoustic loads. A method for fabricating a SMAHC laminate with bi-directional SMA reinforcement is described. Glass-epoxy unidirectional prepreg <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> Nitinol <b>ribbon</b> comprise the material system. Thermal activation of the Nitinol actuators was achieved through resistive heating. The experimental hardware required for mechanical support of the panel/actuators and for establishing convenient electrical connectivity to the actuators is presented. Other experimental apparatus necessary for controlling the panel temperature and acquiring structural acoustic data are also described. Deficiency in the thermal control system was discovered {{in the process of}} performing the elevated temperature tests. Discussion of the experimental results focuses on determining the causes for the deficiency and establishing means for rectifying the problem...|$|R
40|$|This report reviews our {{approach}} to the design, synthesis and structural/morphological analysis of backbone-modified amylin(20 – 29) derivatives. Depending on the position in the peptide backbone {{and the type of}} amide bond isostere/modification, the amylin(20 – 29) peptides behave either as inhibitors of amyloid fibril formation, which are able to retard amyloid formation of native amylin(20 – 29), or as templates for the formation of self-assembled supramolecular structures. Molecular fine-tuning of the hydrogen-bond accepting/donating properties allows the control over the morphology of the supramolecular aggregation motifs such as helical <b>ribbons</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapes,</b> <b>ribbons</b> progressing to closed peptide nanotubes, (twisted) lamellar sheets or amyloid fibrils...|$|R
40|$|Multistrand cables may exhibit {{two classes}} of {{parasitic}} magnetization both of which can distort the bore-field of an accelerator magnet: (1) a static magnetization (“hysteretic”) resulting from intrastrand persistent currents, and (2) a dynamic magnetization produced by interstrand coupling currents generated during field ramping. The latter, which are moderated by the interstrand contact resistances (ICR), can be controlled {{by the presence of}} an insulating core inserted between the layers of the cable. Stainless steel ribbon (with its associated native oxide coating) is a frequently used core. Recently, however, MgO-paper <b>tapes</b> <b>and</b> woven s-glass <b>ribbons</b> have been suggested by LBNL (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) as alternative core materials in the interests of improved flexibility and compatibility with the cabling process. This paper reports on the results of calorimetric AC loss (hence ICR) measurements on a set of four such cables and presents the results within the context of previously measured cored and uncored Nb 3 Sn cables. Also considered is a typical ramp-rate-induced coupling magnetization and its relationship to persistent-current magnetizations over the operating range of an accelerator magnet...|$|R

40|$|Bio-inspired {{molecular}} self-assembly {{has attracted}} considerable research interest as a promising route to novel nanostructured materials. Self-assembling peptides have proven particularly popular {{building blocks for}} the construction of a variety of well-defined nanostructures. There is a great interest in learning to control not only the types and properties of nanostructures, but also their precise macroscopic organisation. Here we investigate the effect of water crystallisation during freezing as a possible method for directed organisation of preformed β-sheet <b>tapes,</b> <b>ribbons</b> <b>and</b> fibrils and for the production of microporous materials comprising lamella-like layers. We employ a range of short, systematically designed self-assembling peptides and a wide variety of techniques including SEM, TEM, X-ray tomography, X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy and compression testing. We find that ice growth does not alter the peptide nanostructures but templates the formation of lamella-like layers of mesoscopically aligned peptide <b>ribbons</b> <b>and</b> fibrils into nematic-like domains. The lamella are macroscopically oriented into regularly spaced stacks, giving rise to rather brittle peptide aerogels. This behaviour is contrasted with that of other self-assembling networks such as surfactant rod-like micelles and the polysaccharide agar. The differences in the properties of the self-assembling network seem to prescribe the way it will behave during ice crystallisation, and whether or not it will form ordered lamella structures. This approach may lead to the preparation of well-aligned peptide nanostructures, important for high-resolution structural studies; anisotropic microporous materials comprising lamella-like layers of self-assembling peptide fibrils with incorporated protein-like bioactivity may also be useful in medical applications e. g. tissue engineering, and nanotechnology...|$|R
