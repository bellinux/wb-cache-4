5|$|Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin {{features}} a prototype, motion-based, <b>trackless</b> dark-ride system by Oceaneering International, producer of ride systems for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man, , and The Curse of DarKastle. The ride {{is the first}} of its kind in the world.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin is a theme area at SeaWorld Orlando {{featuring}} a motion-based, <b>trackless</b> dark ride and a penguinarium. The attraction opened on May 24, 2013 {{as the largest}} attraction at any SeaWorld Entertainment theme park. The area was generally well received by critics and the public at its opening.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 film Tomorrowland {{has several}} scenes {{featuring}} Greyhound, including a character {{traveling to the}} 1964 New York World's Fair on a historic bus (a 1969 GMC), a Greyhound Glide-a-Ride <b>trackless</b> train on the World's Fair midway, and the main character traveling on a Greyhound bus in 2015 (a MCI 102DL3) from Cape Canaveral, Florida to Houston, Texas. Greyhound also sponsored a sweepstakes tied in with the film, wrapped several Greyhound buses with imagery from the film, placed promotional items inside terminals, and sponsored the film's Los Angeles premier.|$|E
5|$|When Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin was {{announced}} in November 2011, Oceaneering had already developed a working prototype of the ride vehicle. The first concept art for the attraction was released in April 2012: a circular ride vehicle, seating eight riders in two rows of four. On May 11, 2012 Oceaneering filed a patent application for the ride's technology. At the November 2012 IAAPA Attractions Expo, SeaWorld Orlando and Oceaneering International revealed the <b>trackless,</b> motion simulator-based ride vehicle to the public.|$|E
5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the <b>trackless</b> system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at the loading and unloading platforms.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} {{based on the}} sport of demolition derby. The game contains three vehicles. Collisions in the game affect the controls of each car, limiting their steering and maximum speed. Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's radiator, which causes the car to overheat and stop running. Four game modes are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial. In Destruction Derby, the player earns points by destroying other cars in a large, <b>trackless</b> arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car Racing, the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' Racing is a hybrid of the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and by destroying other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} weeks of the war the {{remnants}} of the 366th Independent Infantry Battalion were pursued by Australian Army patrols, air attacks and groups of local Dayaks organised by the Australian Services Reconnaissance Department. These attacks led to the disintegration of the unit. Major General Akashi led {{the remnants of the}} forces stationed at Brunei {{as well as a number}} of Japanese civilians to the inland town of Tenom; this trek took 40 days and involved traversing mountainous and <b>trackless</b> terrain. However, the forces involved suffered heavy casualties, with 50 percent of the 367th Battalion's soldiers being killed between 10 June and the end of the war. The 369th and 370th Independent Infantry Battalions did not see combat, and remained largely intact at the end of the war. Following the Japanese surrender, the survivors of the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade were concentrated in locations selected by the Australian forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} the gap began at 7:30am on 11 August, as a flight of Savioa-Marchetti SM.81 medium bombers {{attacked}} British defenders on Punjab Ridge. This half-hour assault {{was followed by a}} long artillery bombardment lasting until noon. At 12:30, the infantry attack began. II Brigade began moving slowly towards the Indians through the <b>trackless</b> wilderness north of the road, XIV Brigade attacked Mill, Knobbly, and Observation Hills, and XV Brigade clambered atop Punjab Ridge, engaging its defenders. The attacks of XIV Brigade against the Rhodesians failed, but XV Brigade managed to drive off the Indian defenders of Punjab Ridge. Counterattacks were mounted against the Italians, but these were unsuccessful. The Italian {{attack on the}} hills was renewed the next day, 12 August. Black, Knobbly, and Mill Hills were {{on the receiving end of}} repeated assaults by XIV Brigade, and the weakest of them, Mill Hill, began to reel under the sustained pressure. By 4:00pm, the British defenses were being overrun, and after nightfall the British retreated from the Hill, spiking their guns as they left.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trackless</b> trolley (trolley bus) {{service was}} {{suspended}} in 2003 and the 110 AM General vehicles that had provided service on SEPTA's five <b>trackless</b> trolley routes {{never returned to}} service. However, in early 2006 SEPTA ordered 38 new low-floor <b>trackless</b> trolleys from New Flyer, which entered service in 2008, restoring <b>trackless</b> service on routes 59, 66 and 75. These buses replaced SEPTA Neoplan EZs, ending Neoplan's 26-year domination.|$|E
25|$|The tram is a <b>trackless</b> tram {{that drives}} on the walkway paths around the zoo.|$|E
25|$|In FY2005, {{there were}} on average 363,500 weekday boardings of MBTA-operated buses and <b>trackless</b> {{trolleys}} (not including the Silver Line), or 31.8% of the MBTA system. Another 4,400 boardings (0.38%) occurred on subsidized bus routes operated by private carriers.|$|E
25|$|On Fifth Army's {{far right}} wing, {{on the right}} of the British XIII Corps front, 8th Indian Infantry Division {{fighting}} across <b>trackless</b> ground had captured the heights of Femina Morta, and British 6th Armoured Division had taken the San Godenzo Pass on Route 67 to Forlì, both on 18 September.|$|E
25|$|Doctor Griffin's story {{concerns}} the hardships endured by General Kearney's small force as it crossed the unknown and <b>trackless</b> deserts, and it recounts {{what took place}} in the battles of San Pascual, San Gabriel, La Mesa and Los Angeles, and reveals his methods of treatment for wounds and diseases afflicting the soldiers in his charge. The narrative is most interesting.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, {{the railway}} line was {{electrified}} to Wollongong, and in 1993 to Dapto. In 1986 the Wollongong Mall was completed. For {{a short while}} trams (<b>trackless</b> trains) {{were used in the}} mall, though this ceased due to dangers involved. The mall was re-opened to traffic after the initial test but re-zoned a pedestrian area after and has remained one since.|$|E
25|$|The Cleveland Transit System, which {{operated}} bus, streetcar, and <b>trackless</b> trolley buses in {{the city}} of Cleveland, proposed an RTA Rapid Transit station at the foot of Cedar Hill in 1947. Station plans were proposed in January 1952, and approved two months later. Construction on the station began in May 1954, and it opened on March 15, 1955. The new station was a three-minute walk from the Cedar Glen Apartments.|$|E
25|$|The Flying Turns was {{the name}} of a roller coaster at Euclid Beach Park, but it was also the name for a type of roller coaster. John Norman Bartlett, a British aviator in World War I, came to North America after the war with an idea for a <b>trackless</b> wooden chute, full of twists like a bobsled course, with toboggan-like cars. He filed a patent for the idea in 1926.|$|E
25|$|The Key System {{had ordered}} 40 trolley coaches from ACF-Brill in 1945 {{to convert the}} East Bay trolley lines. The new NCL {{management}} canceled the Key's <b>trackless</b> program in 1946 before wire changes were made, and diverted the order (some units of which had already been painted for the Key and delivered to Oakland) to its own Los Angeles Transit Lines, where they ran until 1963. The last Key streetcars ran in 1948, replaced by buses.|$|E
25|$|The ride {{system used}} on Thor's Hammer is a first-of-its-kind system {{developed}} by ETF Ride Systems. At the 2012 IAAPA Trade Show in Orlando, Florida, ETF showcased a prototype <b>trackless</b> motion-based ride system, confirming a track-based version would be installed at Tusenfryd. The eleven six-seater vehicles on Thor's Hammer each feature two degrees of freedom: pitching and rolling. The vehicles can travel at {{a top speed}} of , spin at a rate of 10 revolutions per minute, and tilt plus or minus 8°.|$|E
25|$|By 1940, {{just four}} {{streetcar}} routes remained in Somerville: the 87 Clarendon Hill – Lechmere via Somerville Avenue and 88 Clarendon Hill – Lechmere via Highland Avenue pair, the 89 Clarendon Hill – Sullivan Square Station route, and the 101 Salem Street – Sullivan Square Station route which {{connected with the}} Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway's Fellsway Line to Stoneham. The 87 and 88 were converted to <b>trackless</b> trolleys in 1941, while the 89 and 101 saw heavy wartime use and lasted until 1946 and 1947, respectively.|$|E
25|$|On September 30, 1968, SEPTA {{acquired}} the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC), which operated a citywide system of bus, trolley, and <b>trackless</b> trolley routes, the Market–Frankford Line (subway-elevated rail), the Broad Street Line (subway) and the Delaware River Bridge Line (subway-elevated rail to City Hall, Camden, NJ) which became SEPTA's City Transit Division. The PTC {{had been created}} in 1940 with the merger of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (formed in 1902) {{and a group of}} smaller, then independent transit companies operating within the city and its environs.|$|E
25|$|The City Transit Division {{operates}} routes mostly {{within the}} City of Philadelphia, including buses, subway–surface trolleys, surface Trolley Lines, the Market–Frankford Line and the Broad Street Line. SEPTA City Transit Division surface routes include bus and <b>trackless</b> trolley lines. Some city division routes extend into Delaware, Montgomery and Bucks counties. This division is the {{descendant of the}} Philadelphia Transportation Company. There are eight operating depots in this division: five of these depots only operate buses, one is a mixed bus/trackless trolley depot, one is a mixed bus/streetcar depot and one is a streetcar-only facility.|$|E
25|$|The {{tunneled}} section extending east of South Station, {{known as}} Silver Line Phase II, {{was constructed in}} conjunction with Boston's Big Dig and was originally {{referred to as the}} South Boston Piers Transitway. Tunnel sections were fabricated in a nearby, World War II–era dry dock and floated into place. Phase II opened on Friday, December 17, 2004, with the first route (Silver Line Waterfront) running only to Silver Line Way, temporarily using new electric trolley buses borrowed from the <b>trackless</b> trolley routes that have their hub in Cambridge, as not enough dual-mode buses were available initially.|$|E
25|$|Bhutanese dzong {{architecture}} {{reached its}} zenith in the 17th century {{under the leadership}} of Ngawang Namgyal, the 1st Zhabdrung Rinpoche. The Zhabdrung relied on visions and omens to site each of the dzongs. Modern military strategists would observe that the dzongs are well-sited with regard to their function as defensive fortresses. Wangdue Phodrang dzong, for instance, is set upon a spur overlooking the confluence of the Sankosh (Puna Tsang) and Tang Rivers, thus blocking any attacks by southern invaders who attempted to use a river route to bypass the <b>trackless</b> slopes of the middle Himalayas in attacking central Bhutan. Drukgyel Dzong {{at the head of the}} Paro valley guards the traditional Tibetan invasion path over the passes of the high Himalayas.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{originally}} built a road across northern Phongsali Province in 1962 and 1963 as {{a foreign}} aid project. They then began an entirely new road construction project in early 1966, extending south from Yunnan Province past Luang Namtha, down the Pakbeng Valley. As Route 46, the new road gathered ever more attention the further south it progressed. The Royal Thai Government worried it might be extended across <b>trackless</b> northwestern Laos to the Thai border. The presence of 25,000 Chinese troops and 400 antiaircraft guns along the new road raised anxiety {{not only in the}} Thai and Lao governments, but also in Washington. The American government had a vested interest in Thailand; the Kingdom was a major American supporter in the ongoing Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|The {{mining company}} held {{an option to}} {{purchase}} a majority stake in Malmfrakt, which they executed to increase their ownership to 96 percent. The shipping company's head office was moved to Kirkenes in 1952. The icebreaker, owned by Dampskipselskapet Pasvik, had been sunk during the war, so a new icebreaker was delivered in 1947, MS Varangis. All heavy transport during the reconstruction was done using railway, and tracks were laid throughout the mining facility. The contracts to build new facilities was awarded to Trondhjem Cementstøberi og Entreprenørforretning. Mining equipment was delivered in 1949 and procured through the Marshall Plan. By 1950 there were 700 employees, in addition to 150 construction workers working for subcontractors. From operations started, transport within the mine was performed using <b>trackless</b> machinery. Production resumed in 1953.|$|E
25|$|However, other {{extensions}} received priority, and the Woburn extension was not built. The B {{dropped the}} Somerville local {{stops in the}} late 1940s and early 1950s due to declining ridership. In 1955–57 the B raised the tracks through Wedgemere and Winchester Center onto a high grade and viaduct in order to eliminate busy grade crossings. However, the elevated portion was only built with two tracks, preventing a rapid transit extension from reaching to Woburn, since two tracks would still be needed for Lowell Line service. All discussion of the project since has focused on an extension no further than West Medford. The <b>trackless</b> trolleys were replaced by buses in 1959 and 1963, leaving most of Somerville with a transit system dependent on buses running on frequently crowded streets.|$|E
25|$|The Gothic Line {{formed the}} last major line of defence {{in the final stages}} of the war along the summits of the Apennines The Gothic Line was {{breached}} on both the Adriatic and the central Apennine fronts during the Battle of Gemmano in August (4th Indian Divisions last battle before moving to Greece). On the United States Fifth Army's far right wing, on the right of the XIII Corps front, 8th Indian Division fighting across <b>trackless</b> ground had captured the heights of Femina Morta, and 6th British Armoured Division had taken the San Godenzo Pass on Route 67 to Forlì, both on 18 September. On 5 October, the 10th Indian Division, switched from British X Corps to British V Corps, had crossed the Fiumicino river high in the hills and turned the German defensive line on the river forcing the German Tenth Army units downstream to pull back towards Bologna.|$|E
25|$|With firmer {{ground the}} pedrails {{came off the}} guns and their teams of eight and ten horses were reduced to six. It also became {{possible}} to use wheeled vehicles, and in January the War Office agreed to the infantry divisions being re-equipped with wheeled transport trains. These were to replace camel transport, {{on the condition that}} drivers would be found locally, as no transfers from other campaigns were possible. Although camel trains remained important throughout the war, together with pack mules and donkeys, where roads were bad and in hilly <b>trackless</b> terrain, where the horse-drawn and mule-drawn wagons, motor lorries and tractors could not go, they began to be replaced. General service and limber wagons drawn by horses or mules were grouped in supply columns, with the transport wagons of the regiments, the machine–gun squadrons, and the field ambulances, to travel on easier but less direct routes. However, all these animals required vast quantities of food and water, which greatly increased pressure on the lines of communication. During the advance across the Sinai, although it was established that horses did better with two drinks a day instead of three, the volume remained the same.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Kurt Chew-Een Lee (MCSN: 0-48880), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity {{while serving as}} a Platoon Leader with Company B, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from 27 November to 8 December 1950. Although sick and in a weakened condition from a previous combat wound, First Lieutenant Lee refused hospitalization and unflinchingly led his unit across <b>trackless,</b> frozen wastes of rocky mountain ridges toward a beleaguered Marine company. Through his indomitable spirit, he contributed materially {{to the success of}} the epic night march of his battalion which resulted in the relief of the isolated Marine unit and the securing of vital ground. On 2 December 1950 when the leading elements of his company were pinned down under intense enemy fire from a rocky hill mass, he skillfully maneuvered his platoon forward in an attack in the face of the heavy fire, personally accounting for two enemy dead and providing such aggressive and inspirational leadership that fire superiority was regained and the enemy was routed. On 8 December 1950, First Lieutenant Lee's platoon was pinned down by intense hostile fire while attacking south on the main service road from Koto-ri. Observing that the heavy fire was inflicting numerous casualties, he exposed himself to the deadly fire to move among his troops, shouting words of encouragement and directing a withdrawal to covered positions. Assured that the last of his wounded was under cover, he was seeking shelter for himself when he was struck down and severely wounded by a burst of enemy machine gun fire. By his daring initiative and great personal valor throughout, First Lieutenant Lee served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E
500|$|The {{difficulty}} of the march had been underestimated, and sick and wounded men had {{to make their way}} through <b>trackless</b> regions. Lieutenant General Kane Yoshihara, the Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Army, recalled the march: ...|$|E

During the reconstruction, Sydvaranger needed to transport large machinery to Bjørnevatn, so the loading gauge was increased to [...] All heavy transport during the reconstruction was done using railway, and tracks were laid throughout the mining facility. From 1945, passenger trains ran between the two settlements, at first with steam locomotives, and from 1950 with electric locomotives. New storage silos were built in Bjørnevatn, but from operations started, transport within the mine was performed using <b>trackless</b> machinery. A new port facility was built in Kirkenes, with the line terminating at the Air Bridge, an elevated railway {{which led to the}} plant. Mining operations and revenue service on the railway did not start until 1952.|$|E
