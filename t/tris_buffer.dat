25|$|A {{specific}} experiment {{example of}} an application of native gel electrophoresis is to check for enzymatic activity to verify {{the presence of the}} enzyme in the sample during protein purification. For example, for the protein alkaline phosphatase, the staining solution is a mixture of 4-chloro-2-2methylbenzenediazonium salt with 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2’-4’-dimethyl aniline in <b>Tris</b> <b>buffer.</b> This stain is commercially sold as kit for staining gels. If the protein is present, the mechanism of the reaction takes place in the following order: it starts with the de-phosphorylation of 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2’-4’-dimethyl aniline by alkaline phosphatase (water is needed for the reaction). The phosphate group is released and replaced by an alcohol group from water. The electrophile 4- chloro-2-2 methylbenzenediazonium (Fast Red TR Diazonium salt) displaces the alcohol group forming the final product Red Azo dye. As its name implies, this is the final visible-red product of the reaction. In undergraduate academic experimentation of protein purification, the gel is usually ran next to commercial purified samples in order to visualize the results and make confusions of whether or not purification was successful.|$|E

Most solutions also have an antioxidant, as oxidized phenol damages the nucleic acids. For RNA purification, the pH is kept at around 4, which retains RNA in the aqueous phase preferentially.

50|$|Measurement of CD is also {{complicated}} by the fact that typical aqueous buffer systems often absorb in the range where structural features exhibit differential absorption of circularly polarized light. Phosphate, sulfate, carbonate, and acetate buffers are generally incompatible with CD unless made extremely dilute e.g. in the 10-50 mM range. The <b>TRIS</b> <b>buffer</b> system should be completely avoided when performing far-UV CD. Borate and Onium compounds are often used to establish the appropriate pH range for CD experiments. Some experimenters have substituted fluoride for chloride ion because fluoride absorbs less in the far UV, and some have worked in pure water. Another, almost universal, technique is to minimize solvent absorption by using shorter path length cells when working in the far UV, 0.1 mm path lengths are not uncommon in this work.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{specific}} properties of the prepared gel and electrophoresis buffer solution (which is basic and contains Tris-HCl and NaN3), most proteins of a biological system (e.g., Helicobacter pylori) are charged negatively in the solution, and will migrate from the cathode to the anode due to the electric field. At the anode, electrochemically-generated hydrogen ions react with Tris molecules to form monovalent Tris ions. The positively charged Tris ions migrate through the gel to the cathode where they neutralise hydroxide ions to form Tris molecules and water. Thus, the Tris-based buffering mechanism causes a constant pH in the buffer system. At 25 °C <b>Tris</b> <b>buffer</b> has an effective pH range between 7.5 and 9.0. Under the conditions given here (addressing the buffer, buffering mechanism, pH and temperature) the effective pH is shifted {{in the range of}} about 10.0 to 10.5.
