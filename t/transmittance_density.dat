The first step consists in calibrating the image acquisition devices, and results are shown for two different models. Then, we present a method inspired by photographic techniques that uses modified binary masks to enhance negatives of too high contrast. This method can be applied in an industrial environment such as in photographic mini-laboratories...|$|R

We describe in detail the entire production process and explain the methods used to measure the characteristic parameters of aerogels, namely the refractive index, <b>transmittance,</b> and <b>density.</b> We use a small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique to relate the transparency to the fine structure of aerogels.

The percentage optical <b>transmittance</b> and <b>density</b> have also been measured for boththe systems. The results have been explained by assuming molecular rotation about the long molecular axis, undera hindering nematic potential. The dielectric anisotropy Δε is positive, and the mean dielectric permittivity falls withrising temperature. Δε {{is also used to}} determine the order parameter with varying temperature...|$|R

The carrier density of the films and dependence of their plasma frequency on the film thickness have been obtained. On the other hand, the dependence of absorptance on the frequency of electromagnetic wave field {{has been set up}} by using the measured reflectance and transmittance, which provides relationship between plasma frequency and film thickness. Both plasma frequency and film thickness proved plasma resonance...|$|R

A potential for early or pre-visual detection of plant water stress was not supported by these measurements made at visible, and reflected infrared wavelengths to 1950 nm. Needles were found to transmit approximately thirty percent of the radiant flux incident on them at 780 nm, ten percent at 700 nm, and {{were found to be}} opaque at 450, 550, 600 and 650 nm...|$|R
40|$|Agfapan Vario-XL {{film was}} faded {{at various levels}} of temperature, humidity, light, and fade time to {{determine}} the mathematical relationships of these variables and to examine whether interaction occurs between each factor. Light stability of the film was measured, and the Arrhenius relationship was used to predict dark stability at ambient storage conditions. It {{was found that the}} amount of fade, as measured as either a change in <b>transmittance</b> or <b>density,</b> could be mathematically modeled {{with a high degree of}} correlation. Each independent variable (temperature, humidity, and time) was interactive with the other two variables. Under the specific conditions tested, as a significant interaction existed between light and dark fading reactions. For example, both the light and dark cyan dye reactions inhibit each other. However, in the case of the magenta and yellow dyes, a synergistic, or catalytic, effect occurs when light fading precedes dark fading. Agfapan Vario-XL is extremely light stable when irradiated by a conventional enlarger light source. An intermittency effect was noted. The dark stability compares with some of the least stable chromoegenic print films - - a ten percent loss in printing density is predicted by Arrhenius extrapolation when the Agfapan Vario-XL is stored at room temperature at 45 percent relative humidity for five years...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to assess the effect of {{ecosystem}} classification systems at various scales on environmental parameters using remote sensing techniques. The processes included applying hybrid classification to generate a land-use map of northern Taiwan using Landsat- 5 image in 1995; using the DTM and the SEBAL model to calculate 16 environmental parameters to compare the differences among various land-use types; and assessing the effects of 2 ecosystem classification (i. e., geographic climate method and watershed division method) on environmental parameters using stepwise discriminated analysis. The result indicated that the study area was classified into 7 land-use types (i. e., forest-land, building, farm-land, baring farm-land, water body, cloud, and shadow). Comparison of environmental parameters among different land-use types showed that forestland had higher value with cosine of solar incidence angle, twenty-four hour extraterrestrial radiation, net radiation, normalized difference vegetation index, emissivity, estimating friction velocity, surface roughness for momentum transport, sensible heat flux, soil heat flux, evapotranspiration, and had lower value with <b>transmittance,</b> air <b>density,</b> surface albedo, surface albedo at the top of atmosphere, aerodynamic resistance to heat transport, surface temperature. As for the assessment of ecosystem classification systems at various scales on environmental parameters, the result showed that ecosystem classification systems at various scales do cause the variation of environmental parameters according to the selected parameters and the number of parameters for discriminating land-use types. However, among environmental parameters, normalized difference vegetation index and emissivit...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOptical {{properties}} of smokes {{have to be}} known because of their influence on visibility which can be reduced during evacuation of people and firemen intervention. Measurements {{have been carried out}} in non-flaming condition on smokes produced by solid materials exposed to an intensive radiation flux of 25 kW·m- 2. Two materials have been studied: wood and PMMA. A smoke chamber has been used to perform measurements of <b>transmittance</b> and optical <b>density</b> of smokes on the visible wavelength spectrum as recommended by standards. To go further, spectral measurements and analysis of the smoke optical properties for wavelengths between 350 and 1125 nm have been carried out. In parallel, the mass concentration of the particles has been measured and it allows to determine the specific extinction coefficient. The spectral measurements have highlighted the dependence of the transmittance, the extinction coefficient and the specific extinction coefficient on the wavelength. The main features of the spectral results are discussed and compared to other studies. A mean value of the specific extinction coefficient on the visible spectrum is proposed and compared to other data...|$|R
40|$|Natural wood {{is used in}} many {{applications}} in Jordan such as furniture, partitions constructions, and cupboards. Experimental work for smoke produced by the combustion of certain wood samples was studied. Smoke generated from burning of natural wood, is considered as {{a major cause of}} death in furniture fires. The critical parameter for life safety in fires is the available time for escape, so the visual obscuration due to smoke release during fire is taken into consideration. The effect of smoke, produced by burning of wood, depends on the amount of smoke released in case of fire. The amount of smoke production, apparently, affects the time available for the occupants to escape. To achieve the protection of life of building occupants during fire growth, fire retardant painting products are tested. The tested samples of natural wood include Beech, Ash, Beech Pine, and white Beech Pine. A smoke density chamber manufactured by fire testing technology has been used to perform measurement of smoke properties. The procedure of test was carried out according to the ISO- 5659. A nonflammable vertical radiant heat flux of 25 kW/m 2 is exposed to the wood samples in a horizontal orientation. The main objective of the current study is to carry out the experimental tests for samples of natural woods to evaluate the capability to escape in case of fire and the fire safety requirements. Specific optical <b>density,</b> <b>transmittance,</b> thermal conductivity, and mass loss are main measured parameters. Also, comparisons between samples with paint and with no paint are carried out between the selected samples of woods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Changes in DNA/chromatin structure, ploidy {{degrees and}} cell death {{possibly}} caused by oxidative stress during the insulin-dependent diabetes {{have been reported}} for different cell types. However, all these studies have been carried in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats or mice and showed contradictory results. In this work, nuclear phenotypes and DNA fragmentation were investigated in fibroblasts from mice spontaneously developing insulin-dependent diabetes (NOD) and compared with healthy (BALB/C) mice. Geometric, densitometric and textural pa-rameters obtained for Feulgen-stained nuclei by image analysis were used to define nuclear phenotypes. Significant differences were observed for nuclear sizes and for densitometric and textural parameters of the tendon nuclei. Op-tical <b>density,</b> Feulgen-DNA values, <b>transmittance</b> variability per nucleus and nuclear entropy values were signifi-cantly higher in the NOD mice. The Feulgen-DNA amounts for the NOD and BALB/C mice {{were found to be}} dis-tributed into several doubling Feulgen-DNA classes. The frequency of nuclei with the smallest Feulgen-DNA amounts, which may represent DNA fragmentation and loss, was lower in fibroblasts of the NOD mice (2. 3 %) in comparison to the BALB/C mice (38 %). In contrast, the frequency of polyploid nuclei in NOD mice was higher (24. 5 %) than that in BALB/C mice (1. 9 %). Based on optical <b>density,</b> <b>transmittance</b> variability per nucleus, and nu-clear entropy data, a larger contrast between highly and less densely packed states, was demonstrated for the fibrob-lasts of the NOD mice. Maybe the deeper condensation of the highly packed chromatin evident in NOD fibroblasts is related to silencing of some genes involved with changes in tendon supraorganization with the diabetes.

40|$|Leaf area index {{estimates}} {{in dense}} evergreen tropical moist forest almost exclusively rest on indirect methods {{most of which}} being of limited accuracy or spatial resolution. In this study we examine the potential of full waveform Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) to derive accurate spatially explicit estimates of Plant Area Index (PAI). A discrete representation of the forest canopy is introduced {{in the form of}} a 3 D voxelized space. For each voxel (elementary volume, typically one cubic m) a first estimate of local transmittance of vegetation is computed as the ratio of the sum of energy exiting a voxel to the sum of energy entering the same voxel. A spatially hierarchical model is subsequently applied to refine estimates of individual voxel <b>transmittance.</b> Plant area <b>density</b> (PAD) profiles are then computed from the local transmittance values by applying Beer Lambert's turbid medium approximation. PAI values are obtained from vertical integration of PAD profiles. The model is shown to be robust to low sampling intensity and high occlusion rates. We further compared simulated values of gap fraction obtained by ray tracing for 5 angular sectors with in situ LAI 2200 measurements taken at 135 positions in a 0. 5 ha forest plot located in the center of the scene. The overall patterns of simulated and measured values (average value per inclination and pattern of variation along a 70 m transect line) were highly consistent. A slight but systematic discrepancy was observed along the inclination gradient, gap fractions derived from ray tracing in the voxelized scene being slightly lower than the measured values. This difference might be the consequence of multiple reflections which have been found to bias gap fractions estimates produced by LAI 2200. PAI estimates derived from LAI 2200 measurements (either simulated 6. 8 or observed 5. 9) are much lower than the PAI derived from vertical integration of local PAD (13. 6). This large difference reflects the fact that distribution of foliage is strongly spatially structured and that this structural information is not properly accounted for in PAI estimates derived from mean gap fraction per elevation angle. After adjusting local transmittance to match mean LAI 2200 profiles the PAI at plot level was found to be 13. 2 m 2 ·m− 2. We conclude that Aerial Laser Scanning can produce accurate maps of Plant Area Index over large areas with unmatched efficacy, accuracy and ease. This should be of major relevance for many forest ecological studies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
