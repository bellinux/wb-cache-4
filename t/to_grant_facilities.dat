To understand the kind of relations established between the Ottoman Empire and its vassal states scholars took into consideration also peace treaties (sulhnâme) and how these agreements changed in the course of time. The most ancient documents were capitulations (ahdnâme) with mutual oaths, derived from the idea of truce (hudna), such as those made with sovereign countries which bordered on the Empire. Little by little they changed and became imperial decrees (berat), which mean that the sultan was the lord and the others subordinate powers. In the Middle Ages bilateral agreements were used to make peace with European countries too, but, {{since the end of the}} 16 th c., sultans began to issue berats <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> commercial <b>facilities</b> <b>to</b> distant countries, such as France or England.

In current study {{which is based on}} the time series data, the effects of inflation on Iranian banking system performance in terms of absorbing deposits and <b>granting</b> <b>facilities</b> have been studied during 1990 to 2009.

40|$|In {{countries}} where the health service is run by national and regional governments, costs have risen dramatically since the early 2000 s. The consequently smaller contributions <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> hospital <b>facilities</b> have forced managers to implement cost-reduction strategies. The Authors' purpose is to avoid strategies which interfere with care processes such as linear cuts (fewer services to patients) and standard cost (a policy of equalizing the cost of purchasing goods and services). A {{health care system is}} strongly similar, in an operative way, to a production system. For this reason, the Authors decide to face the efficiency improvement of this kind of system with the same approach they generally use for production systems. Through the construction of simulation models (Discrete Event Simulation, System Dynamics) are, therefore, obtained quantitative data on the basis of which, in agreement with the Management, the corresponding improvement actions are made. The proposed approach allows Managers, at zero cost and without interfering with care processes, the recovery of significant resources as demonstrated in the test case application. Through the System efficiency improvement proposed by the Authors it is possible to maintain a high level of care even in the presence of budget reductions.

Here we propose a slightly more elaborate, but self-consistent method whereby the allocation is adaptive and self-tuned to the local energy scenario by sharing the fuel savings {{on the basis of the}} average primary energy factors for electricity and heat in the given local area including the cogeneration facility of interest. We call it the Self-Tuned Average-Local-Productions Reference (STALPR) method.
