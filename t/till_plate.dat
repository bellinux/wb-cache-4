Solar distillation using a wick-type solar still was investigated theoretically and experimentally. A <b>tilled</b> flat <b>plate</b> wick-type solar still was designed and constructed. Charcoal cloth {{was used as an}} absorber/evaporator material and for saline water transport. A theoretical model for the performance of the wick-type solar still has been developed and analysed. It investigates the effect of various factors on the still productivity. A Fortran computer program has been developed and a finite difference technique was used to solve the main equations and to determine related parameters. Indoor experimental testing was carried out to investigate the effect of input water flow rate and salinity on the still productivity together with the variation of the solar still efficiency with absorber temperature. The tests were conducted using the irradiance from a lamp array. Outdoor testing was carried out with and without a V-trough solar concentrator on clear days in summer and winter. Representative daily efficiencies of the still with and without the solar concentrator were about 60...|$|R

It is concluded from test results that, in terms of mechanical properties, the RTM-made cross-joint holds superiority over other two, and both stitch-RTM and cobonding methods have significant adverse effects on mechanical properties. Experimental observation and finite element (FE) numerical simulation show that the delamination first {{takes place at the}} upper triangle-like resin-rich zone of joints, then propagates along the interface between the zone and the curved webs/flanges to the bottom plate, and grows along the horizontal bottom <b>plate</b> <b>till</b> failure of the joint accurs at last.

It was also observed that lightning strikes {{had a significant effect}} on compass deviation, identified in some extreme cases as being caused by the reversal of the ship's magnetic signature. In 1866, Evan Hopkins of London registered a patent for a process [...] "to depolarise iron vessels and leave them thenceforth free from any compass-disturbing influence whatever". The technique was described as follows: [...] "For this purpose he employed a number of Grove's batteries and electromagnets. The latter were to be passed along the <b>plates</b> <b>till</b> the desired end had been obtained... the process must not be overdone for fear of re-polarising in the opposite direction." [...] The invention was, however, reported to be [...] "incapable of being carried to a successful issue", and [...] "quickly died a natural death".|$|R

DESIGN: Prospective, two-arm, randomized, controlled clinical trial with three participating cleft palate centers (Dutchcleft). SETTING: Cleft Palate Centers of the University Medical Center Nijmegen, Academic Center of Dentistry Amsterdam, and Dijkzigt University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Children with complete UCLP (n = 54) were included. INTERVENTIONS: In a concealed allocation procedure, half of the patients was randomized to wear a <b>plate</b> <b>till</b> surgical closure of the soft palate (IO+), and the other half (IO-) did not have a plate. MEAN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dental arch relationships were assessed at 4 and 6 years of age with the 5 -year-old index; the Huddart-score; and measurements of overjet, overbite, and sagittal occlusion. RESULTS: There were no significant differences found between the IO+ and IO- groups for the 5 -year-old index; the Huddart-score; and overjet, overbite, and sagittal occlusion.

The revolt of his incredulity had passed away almost as quick as the first emotion of discovery, and for the next twenty-four hours he had no sleep. That would never do. At meal-times (he took the foot of the table set up for the white men on the bridge) he could not help losing himself in a fascinated contemplation of Captain Whalley opposite. He watched the deliberate upward movements of the arm; the old man put his food to his lips as though he never expected to find any taste in his daily bread, as though he did not know anything about it. He fed himself like a somnambulist.

All he had to do was to raise his voice and pronounce a single short sentence, and yet that simple act seemed as impossible to attempt as moving the sun out of its place in the sky. The old chap could eat in his terrific mechanical way; but Sterne, from mental excitement, could not--not that evening, at any rate.|$|R

30|$|The {{functional}} {{outcome of}} shoulder following {{removal of the}} hook plate improved significantly during subsequent follow-ups. The Constant Score after 12  weeks post hook plate removal hook was on an average 60, primarily due to improving but painful shoulder motion and moderate pain. In this study, we did not allow the patients to attempt overhead abduction beyond 90 degrees, while hook plate was in situ to avoid inadvertent damage to acromion and subsequent acromial osteolysis and subacromial bursitis which {{has been reported in}} the earlier studies on hook plate fixation [26, 27]. There was a significant improvement in the Constant Score at 18  months post hook plate removal in all the patients. There were 19 patients (57  %) with Constant Score above 90 at the last follow-up. All the patients had significant improvement in overhead abduction (beyond 120 °) and returned to active sports such as basketball, handball and kabaddi. The functional outcome was similarly excellent as seen in UCLA Scores at the last follow-up at around 2  years post-surgery. The ultimate goal of surgical intervention in this set of injuries was to facilitate return to their pre-injury level of active sports which was achieved in all the patients which is comparable to the results of earlier studies where hook plate has been used [26]. The major disadvantages of hook plate cited in earlier series have been repeat surgery, persistent shoulder pain, incomplete shoulder function, acromial osteolysis and acromioclavicular subluxation [27]. In our study, we had no surgical site infection, and in the early and midterm follow-up, there was no incidence of osteolysis, subluxation of acromioclavicular joint after hook plate removal. There was no requirement of any repeat surgical intervention other than the removal of hook plate itself. The concern of subacromial impingement was pertinent <b>till</b> the hook <b>plate</b> was in situ. However, after plate removal, there was no clinicoradiological evidence of the same. The radiological assessment of a sound acromioclavicular joint can be done with stress radiographs and measurement of the coracoclavicular distance comparing with the contralateral side or an absolute value which should be 11 – 13  mm generally [28].|$|R
