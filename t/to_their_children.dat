5|$|In 1912, the {{governor}} of Indiana instituted Riley Day on the poet's birthday. Schools were required to teach Riley's poems <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> and banquet events were held in his honor around the state. In 1915 and 1916 the celebration was national after being proclaimed in most states. The annual celebration continued in Indiana until 1968. In early 1916 Riley was filmed {{as part of a}} movie to celebrate Indiana's centennial, the video is on display at the Indiana State Library.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{language of the}} region is Mayali, a dialect of Bininj Gun-Wok traditionally associated with the region surrounding Maningrida, in Western Arnhem Land. As it is a strong language with hundreds of speakers and {{a high rate of}} child acquisition, members of the Wagiman ethnic group gradually ceased teaching the Wagiman language <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> As a result, many Wagiman people speak Mayali, while only a handful of elders, possibly no more than six, speak Wagiman.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Roman {{education}} was moral and practical. Stories about great men and women, or cautionary tales about individual failures, {{were meant to}} instil Roman values (mores maiorum). Parents and family members were expected to act as role models, and parents who worked for a living passed their skills on <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> who might also enter apprenticeships for more advanced training in crafts or trades. Formal {{education was}} available only to children from families who could pay for it, {{and the lack of}} state intervention in access to education contributed to the low rate of literacy.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Louisville Public Schools {{announced}} {{a plan to}} merge Manual and its rival Male High School into Louisville Boys High so that the two schools could share a new $300,000 facility. The plan took effect in 1915. Industrial training classes continued at the old Manual building. Parents objected <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> having to travel between the two buildings and the consolidation did not save the school board any money, so they voted to end the experiment in 1919. The new building became Male's home for the next 70 years and Manual returned to its old building at Brook and Oak. In 1923 an expansion added new laboratories, a cafeteria, and the largest gym ever built in Louisville at the time. The addition eventually burned {{and had to be}} destroyed in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Olivia {{suggests}} {{the possibility that}} the effect is due to quantum entanglement between Alice in the prime universe and Derek in the parallel one. Alice previously told Olivia that Derek died recently from trying to replace a faulty fuse after they flipped a coin to decide who would replace it, and Walter surmises that the parallel universe Alice died in a similar fashion due to a different outcome of the coin flip. Alice's connection to the parallel universe Derek is causing the crack. As the building starts to exhibit the initial signs of a singularity and Broyles (Lance Reddick) prepares to release the amber, Olivia and Peter attempt to persuade Alice that the man she sees is not really her husband. Alice does not believe them until Derek starts to refer <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> Alice, who is childless, realizes Peter and Olivia are telling the truth; the connection is broken and the effects on the building ebb away.|$|E
5|$|Stay-at-home dads {{make up a}} {{very small}} portion of the Australian {{population}} although this appears to be rapidly changing. In 2003, 91% of fathers with children aged under 15 years were employed with 85% employed full-time. Because of this, there are few role models or resources that can help Australian fathers with the stay-at-home dad role. The Australian Bureau of Statistics show that approximately 7% of two parents families with {{children under the age of}} 14 have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full-time. Stay at home dads in Australia have almost doubled over the past decade from 57,900 to 106,000, and expected to increase in the future. Recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time and support <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in comparison to the 19th century. The idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream, however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise.|$|E
5|$|The first {{drinking}} age law in New Jersey {{was passed}} in 1846. It allowed {{the parents of a}} student under 21 to sue for up to $10 ($ in modern dollars) in damages against a tavern keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> In 1880, a criminal statute was enacted, fining businesses that sold liquor to people under 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child. The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate the parental consent provision, thus making it illegal in all cases for a tavern or liquor store to sell alcohol to person under 18. In 1908, the penalties were increased so that a tavern keeper who served a minor could be jailed. Upon the start of Prohibition, New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of alcohol to minors since the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited almost all liquor sales.|$|E

5|$|The {{parents and}} {{families}} of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence. Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including {{the increase of}} centrally located day schools to improve access <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> and made repeated requests for improvements {{to the quality of}} education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.|$|E
5|$|Though slavery persisted, {{some aspects}} of the {{relationship}} changed with the French administration. Escaped slaves could find official protection by French authorities in the cities for a limited time. Slaves could sometimes renegotiate the terms of their servitude in the changed political situation. Some were willing to agree to remain in servitude if they received control over their family life and some land to pass <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> In addition, the French administration actively worked to end slave raiding and the most clear manifestations of the slave trade, greatly reducing those means of acquiring slaves. However, for many decades after the 1905 abolition of slavery, the practice continued in much of French Sudan.|$|E
5|$|Visitation, {{for those}} {{able to make}} the journey, was {{strictly}} controlled by school officials {{in a manner similar to}} the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases visitors were altogether denied access <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> while in others families were required to meet in the presence of school officials and forced to communicate in English. For parents unable to speak the language, verbal communication with their children was impossible. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the pass system. Introduced by Reed without legislative authority to do so, the system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves. Launched in 1885 as a response to the North-West Rebellion, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.|$|E
50|$|Parents with a dismissing meta-emotion {{philosophy}} feel {{as though}} <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> anger or sadness could be harmful <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> that <b>their</b> primary job is to alleviate these harmful emotions as quickly as possible, and that <b>their</b> <b>child</b> should know that these negative emotions will not last. Although parents with a dismissing philosophy may be sensitive <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> emotions and truly want to be helpful, these parents believe that ignoring or denying negative emotions is the best approach <b>to</b> helping <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> Parents with a dismissing meta-emotion philosophy are often unable to provide insight into <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> emotions and do not view negative emotions {{as an opportunity for}} growth or intimacy. Parents may partake in a dismissing approach by attempting to distract the child or belittling the causes of the negative emotions.|$|R
