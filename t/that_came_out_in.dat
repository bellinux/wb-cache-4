25|$|Whatever is good, bad or {{indifferent}} about Streets of Fire, {{it had a}} {{huge impact}} on other filmmakers. The two movies <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the years after that are completely saturated in the iconography of Streets of Fire are RoboCop and Se7en. Se7en’s taking place in another world. It’s not New York. It’s not Chicago. A world where it’s raining all the time. Always dark. Always night, just about. Those are two very successful movies that figured out how to do the stylization with the appropriate amount of gore that they hooked the audience. And I think that if we’d done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater.|$|E

[...] Schakowsky held that the costs were not kept secret, citing the $40billion for the Children's Health Insurance Program as an example [...] "There was a robust debate about whether or not that should be included, etc. So this idea of somehow, now at the last minute, there was a secret addition to some kind of funding... is absolute nonsense." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Alexei Uteshev of St. Petersburg University, Russia, Uspensky {{came upon}} the {{statement}} (and proof) of Vincent's theorem in the 20th century in Serret's Algebra, pp 363–368, which means {{that he was not}} aware of the statement of Budan's theorem (because Serret included in his book Fourier's theorem). Moreover, this means that Uspensky never saw Vincent's papers of 1834 and 1836, where Budan's theorem is stated and Vincent's method is explained with several examples (because Serret directed all interested readers to Vincent's papers for examples on how the theorem is used). Therefore, in the preface of his book <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 1949, Uspensky erroneously claimed that, based on Vincent's theorem, he had discovered a method for isolating the real roots [...] "much superior in practice to that based on Sturm's Theorem". Uspensky's statement is erroneous because, since he is not using Budan's theorem, he is isolating the real roots doing twice the amount of work done by Vincent (see, pp.127–137).|$|E

2500|$|The company’s {{second book}} was Molokai: An Island in Time by {{photographer}} Richard Cooke III <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 1985. The publishing company relocated to Oregon in 1986 {{where it was}} incorporated, and by 1988 Bob Goodman had left the company that had failed {{to turn a profit}} after putting out 12 titles. Beyond Words settled on Cohn’s [...] farm near Hillsboro. Both of the first two books were printed by Oregon printer Dynagraphics, Inc., with printing costs exceeding $500,000 for the books that were to retail for $2,000 each. Beyond Words had an exclusive distribution with Waldenbooks for the first two titles, but the deal later fell through. The company was left deeply in debt after these two books, with founder Black taking a job to help pay off the debt. In October 1988, a lawsuit between the printer Dynagraphics and U. S. National Bank concerned Beyond Words’ ability to pay its bill to Dynagraphics for the printing. Dynagraphics won the lawsuit for $321,000 when the jury decided that the bank had a duty to warn Dynagraphics that co-owner Cohn lacked the funds to pay for the printing of the two books that were part of their Earthsong Project.|$|E

According to Bryant, Atta wanted to finance the purchase of a crop-duster.

He insisted that she write his name as ATTA, that he originally was from Egypt but had moved to Afghanistan, that he was an engineer and that his dream was to go to a flight school. He asked about the Pentagon and the White House. He said he wanted to visit the World Trade Center and asked Bryant about the security there. He mentioned Al Qaeda and said the organization [...] "could use memberships from Americans". He mentioned Osama bin Laden and said [...] "this man would someday be known as the world's greatest leader." [...] Bryant said [...] "the picture <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the newspaper, that's exactly what that man looked like." [...] Bryant contacted the authorities after recognising Atta in news reports. Law-enforcement officials said Bryant passed a lie-detector exam.|$|E

6000|$|While this {{periodical}} recital {{was going}} on, Gertrude {{lived in a}} fantastic world; she seemed to herself to be reading a romance <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> daily numbers. She had known nothing so delightful since the perusal of [...] "Nicholas Nickleby." [...] One afternoon she went to see her cousin, Mrs. Acton, Robert's mother, who was a great invalid, never leaving the house. She came back alone, on foot, across the fields--this being a short way which they often used. Felix had gone to Boston with her father, who desired to take the young man to call upon some of his friends, old gentlemen who remembered his mother--remembered her, but said nothing about her--and several of whom, with the gentle ladies their wives, had driven out from town {{to pay their respects}} at the little house among the apple-trees, in vehicles which reminded the Baroness, who received her visitors with discriminating civility, of the large, light, rattling barouche in which she herself had made her journey to this neighborhood. The afternoon was waning; in the western sky the great picture of a New England sunset, painted in crimson and silver, was suspended from the zenith; and the stony pastures, as Gertrude traversed them, thinking intently to herself, were covered with a light, clear glow. At the open gate of one of the fields she saw from the distance a man's figure; he stood there as if he were waiting for her, and as she came nearer she recognized Mr. Brand. She had a feeling as of not having seen him for some time; she could not have said for how long, for it yet seemed to her that he had been very lately at the house.|$|E
