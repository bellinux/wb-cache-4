40|$|Should {{management}} control <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation in companies? And if so, how? This thesis examines {{the use of}} {{management control}} in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation, how <b>the</b> different management control mechanisms are associated with <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance, and how technology and market uncertainty influence this relationship. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation is generally regarded as the most troublesome phase of the innovation process {{and at the same}} time as one of the greatest opportunities to improve the overall innovation capability <b>of</b> a company. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation has been characterized as a highly uncertain and creative phase, thereby requiring considerable amounts of freedom and independence for those executing <b>front</b> <b>end</b> activities. However, a certain amount of control is necessary to secure the effective use of resources and the achievement of the company's strategic goals. The current findings on management control and its influence on performance in a new product development context in general are conflicting. For example, while many authors argue that behavioral control kills creativity, others emphasize the advantages of improved communication and coordination created by process formalization. Some authors stress the importance of setting specific and challenging strategic goals for development work, yet other articles indicate this inhibits creativity and learning. One challenge in interpreting the conflicting results of existing management control research in a new product development context is the fact that most studies treat <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation simultaneously with product development projects, thereby averaging the totally different characteristics of these two innovation phases. Studies investigating management control in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation are still scarce. This theoretical gap is the focus of this thesis. This study develops a framework for management control in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation and tests hypotheses on the relationship between different management control mechanisms and <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance. Management control is covered through seven variables: input control, <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization, outcome-based rewarding, strategic vision, informal communication, participative planning, and intrinsic task motivation. Product concept superiority and strategic renewal are used as <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance indicators, reflecting both the short-term and long-term development needs of the organization. The influence of technology and market uncertainty as potential moderators on the control mechanism-performance relationship is investigated in relation to <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization and outcome-based rewarding. Data from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> phase <b>of</b> 133 new product development projects from different large and medium-sized Finnish companies have been collected and analyzed. A factor model was used to test the validity of the management control framework and a linear regression analysis used for hypothesis testing. The results show that management control mechanisms are associated with performance in different manners depending on the performance variable used. <b>Front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization, strategic vision, and intrinsic task motivation were positively associated with product concept superiority. No association was found between input control, outcome-based rewarding, informal communication, participative planning, and product concept superiority. The results show that input control and intrinsic task motivation were positively associated with strategic renewal in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation. No association existed between <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization, outcome-based rewarding, informal communication, participative planning, and strategic renewal. Three significant moderating relationships were found in the study: Market uncertainty positively moderates the positive association between <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization and product concept superiority; Technology uncertainty negatively moderates <b>the</b> relationship between <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization and strategic renewal, i. e. under high technology uncertainty, <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization is negatively related to strategic renewal; Technology uncertainty also negatively moderates the relationship between outcome-based rewarding and strategic renewal, i. e. under high technology uncertainty, outcome-based rewarding is negatively related to strategic renewal. This study contributes to management control literature by making management control in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation <b>the</b> focal point - an area which is still barely touched in management control theory. The findings contribute to the body <b>of</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> management by showing that management should be actively involved in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation and by providing evidence of the importance of this phase on a firm's dynamic capabilities. This thesis contributes to contingency theory also by demonstrating how both market uncertainty and technology uncertainty moderate the association between management control mechanisms and <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance. <b>The</b> findings have practical implications for management as they show certain mechanisms lead to effective control in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> innovation...|$|R

5|$|In the {{original}} description of Dinocephalosaurus, Li recognized the postorbital {{region and the}} elongated cervical centra as being indicative of {{a close relationship with}} Tanystropheus, which led him to assign it to the Tanystropheidae. However, Rieppel and colleagues subsequently noted characteristics that distinguished Dinocephalosaurus from derived protorosaurs such as Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos; these include the lack of tapering at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nasal and an unreduced contribution of the ilium to the acetabulum. This led Rieppel and colleagues to consider Dinocephalosaurus as an indeterminate protorosaur, with its neck elongation been convergent upon that of Tanystropheus. Their phylogenetic tree, based on a dataset derived from the separate analyses of Jalil (1997), David Dilkes (1998), and Michael Benton & Jackie Allen (1997), is reproduced below, at left.|$|E
5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has {{cervical}} vertebrae {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third cervical is set slightly higher than the back end, which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes – the rounded parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, {{there is also a}} deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E

5|$|One {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the Cifelli #2 quarry, a right dentary catalogued as CEUM 34447, is unusual {{compared to other}} Eolambia specimens, including both adults and juveniles. While the ratio between the mid-point depth and overall length of the dentaries in other individuals generally ranges from 0.19 to 0.24, the same value in CEUM 34447 is 0.31, making it unusually deep. The dentary also does not deepen substantially at the front end, and thus lacks one of the distinguishing traits of Eolambia dentaries. However, the other distinguishing trait, which is the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coronoid process, {{is present in the}} specimen. Although it is possible that this individual represents an unusual Eolambia specimen, McDonald and colleagues cautioned that it may represent a distinct hadrosauroid that differs in the morphology of the dentary from Eolambia (albeit one that is not suggested by any of the other materials at the quarry). Thus, they regarded it as an indeterminate basal hadrosauroid.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but without compromising {{the performance of the}} car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E
