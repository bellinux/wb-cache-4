40|$|A 50 -year-old man was {{operated}} on for acute type I (DeBakey classification) aortic dissection. The supracoronary ascending aorta {{was replaced with}} an interposition graft. Postoperative computed tomography and angiography clearly revealed a double-barrelled aortic arch, left common carotid artery and <b>descending</b> <b>thoracoabdominal</b> <b>aorta</b> with contrast filling of both true and false lumen starting from the distal anastomosis. The same finding was noted at 1 year follow-up with severe compression of the true lumen by the false lumen. At this time, anticoagulation therapy was stopped. One year later: computed tomography showed spontaneous resolution of the dissection in the aortic arch, left common carotid artery and <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> over its full length.

40|$|The {{residual}} tense false lumen following surgical {{repair of}} aortic dissection {{remains one of}} the most difficult and challenging postsurgical problems. Percutaneous fenestration of the dissecting membrane under the guidance of intravascular ultrasound has been recently introduced to depressurize the tense false lumen. A 63 -year-old woman who underwent repair of acute type I dissection was readmitted because of claudication and numbness of the left lower extremity. Angiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging clearly showed a dissection flap starting from the thoracic aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. Compressed true lumen by the markedly enlarged tense false lumen was also noted in the double-channeled <b>descending</b> <b>thoracoabdominal</b> <b>aorta.</b> Under intravascular ultrasound guidance, the intimal flap was punctured with a Brockenbrough needle advanced to the true lumen through a femoral artery, and then, a balloon catheter was introduced over the guidewire which was placed across the dissection flap. Desired fenestration was obtained successfully by inflation of the balloon without complications. After procedure, symptoms resolved promptly and she is currently (clinical follow-up of 12 months postfenestration) ambulating without claudication. In conclusion, percutaneous fenestration of the intimal flap is a technically feasible and an effective alternative procedure to surgical repair for restoration of perfusion to an ischemic extremity in selected patients complicated with aortic dissection.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The serious {{disturbances}} in ventriculoarterial coupling after thoracic aorta bypass grafting are addressed through aortic entry impedance {{in the frequency}} domain from flow-pressure waves. We designed a method for synthesizing pressure and flow waves to evaluate opposal to aortic flow along the cardiac cycle, addressing myocardial, brain, and visceral tissue perfusions from pressure-flow hysteresis loops and forward-backward aortic entry impedance in the ascending aorta, transverse aortic arch, and distal <b>descending</b> <b>aorta,</b> respectively, before and after extra-anatomic grafting of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> in the swine. Methods: Twelve pigs underwent extra-anatomic grafting (woven double-velour prosthesis, 18 -mm diameter), bypassing the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta.</b> Periarterial flow and endovascular pressure signals were mathematically synthesized (error minimization) to yield continuous functions of flow, pressure along the cardiac cycle before treatment for mean hemodynamics, pressure-flow hysteresis loops, and aortic entry impedance. Results: Grafting of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> overshadowed pressure-flow hysteresis loops in the ascending aorta by shortening maximum pressure delay on maximum flow and diastolic flow reversal. Clamping of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> substantially restored hemodynamics in the ascending aorta, although the diastolic flow decrease was accelerated. Identical processes developed in the transverse <b>aorta.</b> Subdiaphragmatic <b>descending</b> aortic flow was flattened after grafting and restored, although thickened, after clamping of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta.</b> Flow wave peak was framed by a diastolic aortic entry impedance peak, which was damped along the transverse aortic arch (aortic entry impedance peak in the ascending aorta, 1700 ± 102 kN · s · m− 5; aortic entry impedance peak in the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta,</b> 292 ± 45 kN · s · m− 5; P <. 05). After grafting, the aortic entry impedance peak was transferred to early systole (aortic entry impedance peak in the transverse aortic arch, 2104 ± 94 kN · s · m− 5; aortic entry impedance peak in the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta,</b> 450 ± 75 kN · s · m− 5; P <. 05). Clamping of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> attenuated the early systolic aortic entry impedance peak (aortic entry impedance peak in the transverse aortic arch, 1269 ± 104 kN · s · m− 5; aortic entry impedance peak in the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta,</b> 491 ± 75 kN · s · m− 5; P <. 05), although aortic entry impedance in the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> remained higher than before grafting (P <. 05). Specifically, the backward flow ascending aorta to coronary trunks generated a backward aortic entry impedance peak (2234 ± 350 kN · s · m− 5) superimposed onto the forward aortic entry impedance peak with asymptotic boundaries that diminished after grafting and further enlarged after clamping of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta.</b> Conclusions: Hemodynamic opposition of grafting of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> are specific to the aortic site and cardiac cycle and are dependent on clamping of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta.</b> Our approach to thoracic aorta hemodynamics could enable optimization of bypass grafting.

Moreover, dilation of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> and retrograde flow into the peri-graft space at the distal elephant trunk are frequent problems. We hypothesized that optimal graft diameter and location would reduce complications after total arch replacement with a long elephant trunk by achieving complete thrombosis and minimal dilation of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> around the elephant trunk. MethodsWe treated 65 patients with arch aneurysm by total arch replacement with a long elephant trunk anastomosed {{at the base of}} the innominate artery. The graft diameter was undersized (10 %– 20 % of the distal aorta’s diameter). Elephant trunk length was determined by preoperative computed tomography to locate the distal end at Th 6 to Th 8. Thrombosis around the elephant trunk, diameter of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta,</b> and distance between the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> and the graft near the distal end of the elephant trunk were evaluated using computed tomography. ResultsThe distal end of the elephant trunk was located at Th 8 ± 1. There were no operative deaths, 3 patients (5 %) died in the hospital, and 3 patients (5 %) experienced spinal cord injury, including 1 in whom permanent paraplegia developed. Computed tomography revealed complete thrombosis around the elephant trunk in 58 patients (89 %). The <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> did not dilate further, and distance between the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> and the graft progressively decreased.

40|$|Purpose: Multiple {{studies have}} shown pulse {{pressure}} (PP) {{to be a strong}} predictor of aortic calcification. However, no studies are available that correlate PP with aortic calcification at the segmental level. Methods: We identified 37 patients with aortic PP measured during cardiac catheterization. Their noncontrast chest computed tomography scans were evaluated for the presence of calcium in different segments (ascending aorta, arch of <b>aorta</b> [arch], <b>descending</b> <b>aorta)</b> and quantified. Patients with calcification (Calcified Group A) were compared against patients without calcification (Noncalcified Group B) in terms of PP, calcification and compliance. Results: The mean of the total calcium score was higher in the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> than the arch or ascending aorta (691 vs 571 vs 131, respectively, P < 0. 0001). PP had the strongest correlation with calcification in the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> (r = 0. 47, P = 0. 004). Calcified Group A had a much higher PP than Noncalcified Group B, with the greatest difference in the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> (20 mmHg, P < 0. 0001), lesser in the ascending aorta (10 mmHg, P = 0. 12) and the least in the arch (5 mmHg, P = 0. 38).

Conclusions: These are the first data to evaluate the relative impact of aortic segments in PP.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Although {{some authors}} {{advocate}} hypothermic circulatory arrest for spinal cord protection in <b>descending</b> thoracic and <b>thoracoabdominal</b> repair, this method {{has been associated}} with high morbidity and mortality rates in other studies. The safety and effectiveness of this surgical adjunct were evaluated. Methods: Between February 1991 and April 1997, 409 patients underwent thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic repair. Because of an inability to gain proximal aortic control because of anatomic or technical difficulty, hypothermic circulatory arrest was used in 21 patients (4. 9 %). Thirteen patients were men, 8 were women, and the median age was 57 (range, 21 to 81 years). Four patients (19 %) had Marfan's syndrome, and 1 had aortitis. Seven patients (33 %) had aortic dissection (4 chronic type A, 2 chronic type B, 1 acute B), and 1 had aortic laceration. All but 6 patients had hypertension. Fifteen patients (73 %) were operated on for repair of the distal arch and <b>descending</b> thoracic <b>aorta,</b> 4 (19 %) for repair of the distal arch and thoracoabdominal aorta, and 2 for repair of either the <b>thoracoabdominal</b> or <b>descending</b> thoracic <b>aorta</b> alone. Surgery for 9 patients (43 %) also included bypass grafts to the subclavian or innominate arteries. Six operations (29 %) were urgent. Results: The overall 30 -day mortality rate was 29 % (6 of 21 patients). Among urgent patients, the mortality rate was 50 % (3 of 6 patients) versus 20 % (3 of 15) for elective patients. Of the remaining 15 patients, renal failure occurred in 1 (7 %) and heart failure in 2 (13 %). Ten patients (67 %) had pulmonary complications. Encephalopathy occurred in 5 patients (33 %) and stroke in 2 (13 %), and spinal cord neurologic deficit developed in 2 (13 %). The median recovery was 28 days (range, 10 to 157 days). Conclusion: Hypothermic circulatory arrest did not reduce the incidence of deaths and morbidity to a rate comparable with our conventional methods. We recommend the judicious application of this method in rare instances when proximal control is not feasible or catastrophic intraoperative bleeding leave the surgeon with no other option.

30|$|Quantitative {{analyses}} were performed by a third reader (M.M.) in a separate reading session. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of each primary lung tumor was recorded using a standard volume of interest (VOI) tool. Herewith, the VOI was automatically propagated to cover exactly the same volume in all seven different reconstruction datasets. Moreover, background SUVs were assessed in the right lobe of the liver (parenchymal organ background) and within the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> (bloodpool background) {{at the level of}} the carina, with 4.0 -cm- and 1.0 -cm-diameter spherical VOIs, respectively. Only liver parenchyma with normal appearance on both PET and CT was used as a reference. The mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) and the standard deviation of the standardized uptake value (SUVSD) within the VOIs were recorded in both backgrounds for all reconstructions. Based on these measurements, a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) was calculated for each lung tumor, defined as the lung lesions’ SUVmax divided by the SUVmean in the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta.</b> The liver SUVSD was used as a measure of noise.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} diagnostic {{utility of}} Doppler measurements in fetal <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> and umbilical arteries in predicting intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) fetuses {{at risk in}} pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and/or HELLP syndrome. Methods: Doppler measurements were taken in fetal <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> and umbilical arteries of 53 patients with pre-eclampsia, 10 of whom had HELLP syndrome using fetometry (ACUSON 128 XP/ 10, 3. 5 MHz probe). These values were {{compared with those of}} 44 appropriate-for-gestational age singleton pregnancies (AGA). Doppler Indices (Resistance Index (RI), Systolic/Diastolic (S/D) ratio) and end-diastolic flows were related to fetal heart rate (FHR) during contraction stress test, to cord blood parameters (pH, Base Excess) and to Apgar Scores. Results: In contrast to AGA fetuses, IUGR fetuses had decreased end-diastolic flow and an increase of Doppler Indices significantly earlier in the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> (p < 0. 05), compared to umbilical artery. Increased RI’s, S/D ratios and a decrease of end-diastolic flow in fetal aorta were significantly correlated to frequency of FHR decelerations during contraction stress tests, pH, Base Excess (p < 0. 01) and Apgar Scores in IUGR fetuses. Conclusion: A decrease in end-diastolic flow paralleled with an increase in Doppler indices in fetal <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> reflect oxygen deprivation in IUGR fetuses during pre-eclamptic pregnancies with or without HELLP syndrome.

Fetal <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> blood flow was increased (P, 0. 05) in MEL- versus CON- and LUZ-infused dams, while fetal <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> blood flow relative to fetal weight was increased in MEL- versus CON-infused dams and decreased in LUZ- versus CON-infused dams. Following the 4 -wk infusion, we observed an increase in placental efficiency (fetal-placentome weight ratio) in MEL- versus LUZ-infused dams. The increase in umbilical artery blood flow due to chronic uterine melatonin infusion is potentiated by an increased fetal cardiac output through the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta.</b> Moreover, melatonin receptor antagonism decreased fetal <b>descending</b> <b>aorta</b> blood flow relative to fetal weight.
