In rejecting these arguments, the court said that the MPDA did not apply to an out-of-state entity like MediaSentry, and that [...] "There is no expectation of solitude or seclusion when a person activates a file sharing program and sends a file to the requesting computer. By participating in Kazaa, a user expects millions of other users to view and copy her files, each time receiving the very information that Thomas-Rasset sent to MediaSentry and MediaSentry recorded." ...|$|E

50|$|Section eleven {{protects against}} {{unreasonable}} searches and seizures and creates {{the necessity for}} law enforcement to obtain warrants to conduct either one. Part of section eleven was struck down numerous times in court as being {{in violation of the}} United States Constitution (Lucas v. People, Caver v. Kropp, People v. Pennington, and People v. Andrews); that part reads, “The provisions of this section shall not be construed <b>to</b> <b>bar</b> from <b>evidence</b> in any criminal proceeding any narcotic drug, firearm, bomb, explosive or any other dangerous weapon, seized by a peace officer outside the curtilage of any dwelling house in this state.” Section twelve protects the writ of habeas corpus, while section thirteen provides “A suitor in any court of this state has the right to prosecute or defend his suit, either in his own proper person or by an attorney.” It could be interpreted as the right of access to the courts.|$|R
40|$|In Crawford v. Washington, the Supreme Court {{announced}} {{a major change}} in Confrontation Clause doctrine, abandoning a decades-old framework that focused on the common law principles of hearsay analysis: necessity and reliability. The new doctrine, grounded in an originalist interpretation of the Sixth Amendment, requires courts to determine whether a particular statement is testimonial. But the Court has struggled to present a coherent definition of the term testimonial. In its subsequent decisions, the Court illustrated that its new Confrontation Clause doctrine could be used <b>to</b> <b>bar</b> forensic <b>evidence,</b> including laboratory test results, if the government failed to produce the technician who conducted the test. This Note explores the implications of Crawford and its progeny through the lens of one piece of forensic evidence: facial recognition technology. As facial recognition technology continues to gain purchase as a law enforcement tool, prosecutors are increasingly likely to attempt to introduce such evidence in court. Recognizing the interpretative difficulty created by the deep divides that remain on the Court over the proper scope of the Confrontation Clause, this Note argues that, under the Crawford framework, facial recognition evidence is testimonial and, therefore, requires confrontation...|$|R

40|$|Most galaxies have a warped shape {{when they}} are seen edge-on. The reason for this curious form is not {{completely}} known so far, so in this work we apply dynamical system tools to contribute to its explanation. Starting from a simple, but realistic model formed by a bar and a disc, we study {{the effect of a}} small misalignment between the angular momentum of the system and its angular velocity. To this end, a precession model was developed and considered, assuming that the bar behaves like a rigid body. After checking that the periodic orbits inside the <b>bar</b> continue <b>to</b> be the skeleton of the inner system even after inflicting a precession to the potential, we computed the invariant manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits departing from the equilibrium points at the ends of the <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> find <b>evidence</b> of their warped shapes. As is well known, the invariant manifolds associated with these periodic orbits drive the arms and rings of barred galaxies and constitute the skeleton of these building blocks. Looking at them from a side-on viewpoint, we find that these manifolds present warped shapes like those recognised in observations. Lastly, test particle simulations have been performed to determine how the stars are affected by the applied precession, this way confirming the theoretical results.

40|$|The use of victim impact {{evidence}} (VIE) {{has been}} a standard feature of capital trials since 1991, when the Supreme Court lifted the previously existing constitutional <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> such <b>evidence.</b> Legal scholars have almost universally condemned the use of VIE, criticizing it {{on a variety of}} grounds. Yet little empirical analysis exists that examines how VIE influences the course and outcome of capital trials. We analyze the influence of VIE based on interviews with over two-hundred jurors who sat on capital trials in South Carolina between 1985 and 2001. First, we describe the VIE introduced at sentencing trials, using a subset of the interviews that posed questions directly focusing on VIE. Second, we analyze a factor closely related to, and influenced by, VIE [...] a factor we refer to as victim admirability. We find evidence of a strong correlation between victim admirability and VIE use. Victim admirability substantially increases with the increased use and refinement of VIE. In addition, we find some correlation between victim admirability and jurors 2 ̆ 7 perceived seriousness of the crime. Our third topic focuses on sentencing outcomes. We study the relation between capital sentencing outcomes and VIE itself, as well as the relation between victim admirability [...] found to be influenced by VIE [...] and capital sentencing outcomes. We find no significant relation between increased victim admirability and juror capital sentencing votes, nor do we find a significant relation between the introduction of VIE and sentencing outcomes...|$|R
