50|$|By that date, the {{residents}} of Knossos and almost certainly of its port, Amnisos, were speaking Greek. In the thumbnail historical sketch given by John Chadwick in The Mycenaean World, Chapter 1, Chadwick writes:"Crete was occupied down to the fifteenth century by {{people who did not}} speak Greek..."Instead, they spoke the language that was written in the yet undeciphered script called Linear A. These people, called Minoans by Arthur Evans, were extremely influential at sea:"Around the sixteenth century the Minoan influence on the mainland becomes very marked."During this floruit, the House of Lilies was occupied. Minoan civilization is not believed to have been warlike; there are few <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and armor.

40|$|Weapons are evidence. Most carry marks that, {{combined}} with their structural characteristics, identify them uniquely. If {{they can be}} identified uniquely, their ownership history may be traced and {{the point at which}} they were diverted into the illicit sphere revealed. Weapons tracing can help uncover illicit supply channels, providing a firm basis for disrupting such trade and prosecuting those involved in it. In recent years, the international community has come to recognize that weapons tracing can be central to efforts designed to detect, and hence address, the illicit proliferation and misuse <b>of</b> small <b>arms.</b> For now, however, it remains primarily a law enforcement tool. Its potential application to conflict and post-conflict settings remains poorly understood.

40|$|We have spectroscopically {{identified}} 60 Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, including 38 nitrogen types (WN) and 22 carbon types (WC). Using photometry {{from the}} Spitzer/GLIMPSE and 2 MASS databases, the WRs were selected via a method we have established that exploits their unique infrared colors, which is mainly {{the result of}} excess radiation from free-free scattering within their dense ionized winds. The selection criteria has been refined since our last report, and now yields WRs {{at a rate of}} ~ 20 % in spectroscopic follow-up of candidates that comprise a broad color space defined by the color distribution of all known WRs having B> 14 mag. However, there are subregions within the broad color space which yield WRs at a rate of > 50 %. Cross-correlation of WR candidates with archival X-ray point-source catalogs increases the WR detection rate of the broad color space to ~ 40 %; ten new WR X-ray sources have been found, in addition to a previously unrecognized X-ray counterpart to a known WR. The extinction values, distances, and galactocentric radii of all new WRs are calculated using the method of spectroscopic parallax. Although the majority of the new WRs have no obvious association with stellar clusters, two WC 8 stars reside in a previously unknown massive-star cluster that lies near the intersection <b>of</b> the Scutum-Centaurus <b>Arm</b> and the Galaxy's bar, in which five OB supergiants were also identified. In addition, two WC and four WN stars were identified in association with the stellar clusters Danks 1 and 2. A WN 9 star has also been associated with the cluster [DBS 2003] 179. This work brings the total number of known Galactic WRs to 476, or ~ 7 - 8 % of the total empirically estimated population.

Both tricking and hatching were applied by the Benedictine monk, philologist and historian Vincenzo Borghini (1515 - 1580).
