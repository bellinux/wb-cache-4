50|$|The V251 is {{somewhat}} awkward {{to play as}} the neck is wider at the nut end than at the body, and a player's natural tendency <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>a</b> string results in it slipping off the divided fret. Additionally it is very heavy, weighing, nearly 9 lbs.|$|R
50|$|At first glance, it {{may seem}} that it is optics or {{electronics}} which is involved, rather than mechanics. Actually, the changes in optical behavior, etc. are associated with changes in orientation. In turn, these are produced by couples.

5000|$|The most {{difficult}} moment for beginners practicing bends {{is getting the}} note bent to proper pitch. Usually the bend changes note pitch exactly by one semitone or one whole tone (two semitones), and most beginners fail <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>a</b> string exactly <b>to</b> proper pitch, producing overbends and underbends. Most guitar teachers advise playing the target note on a higher fret, listening closely to its sound and trying <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> the string aiming to get exactly the same pitch.|$|R

50|$|For instance, if {{one were}} to move the arm of someone with waxy flexibility, they would keep their arm where one moved it until it was moved again, as if it were made from wax. Further {{alteration}} of an individual's posture is similar <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> <b>a</b> candle. Although waxy flexibility has historically been linked to schizophrenia, there are also other disorders which it may be associated with, for example, mood disorder with catatonic behaviour.|$|R

50|$|Ben {{grows up}} under Bender's care and {{states that he}} wants <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>bending</b> robot like his father. However, because arm-control {{software}} is inherited maternally and Bev has no arms, Ben is unable <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> objects. In addition, he only has one expansion slot, which houses his memory card. Despite this, Bender continues to raise Ben {{in the hopes that}} Ben will overcome his disability. During a ceremony celebrating Ben's passage into adulthood, Bev returns and takes custody of her son from Bender. Bender kidnaps Ben and tries to run, but the two are caught by the police when Ben tries <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>a</b> grate at a dam as the police catch up to them. As Bender prepares to return Ben to Bev, she gives birth to another child conceived with Officer URL and decides to keep this child instead, leaving Bender and Ben alone. To fulfill Ben's dream of becoming <b>a</b> <b>bending</b> robot, <b>a</b> tearful Bender allows Farnsworth to replace Ben's memory card with <b>a</b> <b>bending</b> software card, erasing Ben's memories of his childhood and leaving him unaware of Bender's identity.

40|$|We {{developed}} a protocol <b>to</b> measure the <b>bending</b> rigidity of filamentous rod-shaped bacteria. Forces are applied with an optical trap, a microscopic three-dimensional spring made {{of light that}} is formed when a high-intensity laser beam is focused to a very small spot by a microscope's objective lens. <b>To</b> <b>bend</b> <b>a</b> cell, we first bind live bacteria to a chemically-treated coverslip. As these cells grow, {{the middle of the}} cells remains bound to the coverslip but the growing ends are free of this restraint. By inducing filamentous growth with the drug cephalexin, we are able to identify cells in which one end of the cell was stuck to the surface while the other end remained unattached and susceptible <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> forces. <b>A</b> <b>bending</b> force is then applied with an optical trap by binding a polylysine-coated bead to the tip of a growing cell. Both the force and the displacement of the bead are recorded and the bending stiffness of the cell is the slope of this relationship.

25|$|Shaw and Edwards (aged 18 and 17, respectively, at {{the time}} Alpha started) were skilled amateur magicians who managed to fool the {{researchers}} with fairly simple tricks during the first stages of investigations. The project had originally started with spoon bending, so the two quickly developed a way to accomplish this. Contrary {{to one of the}} caveats Randi noted in his letter, the test setup included not one, but many and all sorts of spoons on the table, labeled with paper on a loop of string instead of some permanent marking. When starting <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>a</b> spoon, they would actually pick up two or more and remove the labels, which they were allowed to do, because they claimed they were in the way. They would then simply switch the labels when putting them back and wait. The spoons were measured before and after the experiment, and since all sorts of spoons were used, simply switching the labels would produce different measurements, causing the scientist to believe that something paranormal had occurred. In other cases, they would drop one of the spoons in their lap and bend it below the table with one hand, while pretending <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>a</b> spoon in their other hand, distracting the scientists.|$|R
40|$|Thin shells are {{characterized}} by a high cost of stretching compared <b>to</b> <b>bending.</b> <b>As</b> a result isometries of the midsurface of a shell {{play a crucial role}} in their mechanics. In turn, curves with zero normal curvature play a critical role in determining the number and behavior of isometries. In this paper, we show how the presence of these curves results in a decrease in the number of linear isometries. Paradoxically, shells are also known to continuously fold more easily across these rigidifying curves than other curves on the surface. We show how including nonlinearities in the strain can explain this phenomena and demonstrate folding isometries with explicit solutions to the nonlinear isometry equations. In addition to explicit solutions, exact geometric arguments are given to validate and guide our analysis in a coordinate free way...|$|R
