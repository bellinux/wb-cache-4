5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

500|$|On 15 April 2013 Boyd {{announced}} the book's title at the London Book Fair. The announcement {{was part of}} the [...] "Author of the Day" [...] event at the English Pen Literary Café. Selected press were invited to the event and were given a brief opportunity to question Boyd about the book's title. Boyd believes the short title is [...] "strikingly apt" [...] for the novel. He remarked that [...] "titles are very important" [...] to him, and that as soon as he [...] "wrote down Solo on a sheet of paper I saw its potential. Not only did it fit the theme of the novel perfectly, it's also a great punchy word, instantly and internationally comprehensible, graphically alluring and, as an extra bonus, it's strangely Bondian in the sense <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> subliminally aware of the '00' of '007' lurking just behind those juxtaposed O's of SOLO".|$|E

2500|$|According to Orthodox theology, {{the purpose}} of the Christian life is to attain theosis, the mystical union of mankind with God. This union is {{understood}} as both collective and individual. St. Athanasius of Alexandria wrote concerning the Incarnation that, [...] "He (Jesus) was made man <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> made god (θεοποιηθῶμεν)." [...] See , , [...] The entire life of the church is oriented towards making this possible and facilitating it.|$|E
2500|$|Dawkins then {{discusses}} the New Testament which, at first, {{he describes as}} being a huge improvement from the moral viewpoint. But he is repelled by what he calls St Paul's nasty sadomasochistic doctrine that Jesus had to be hideously tortured and killed so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> redeemed – the doctrine of atonement for original sin – and asks [...] "if God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who is God trying to impress?" [...] He says that modern science demonstrates that the alleged perpetrators Adam and Eve never even existed, undermining St Paul's doctrine." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is common}} to see it {{asserted}} that {{the length of the}} current interglacial temperature peak is similar to the length of the preceding interglacial peak (Sangamon/Eem), and from this conclude <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> nearing the end of this warm period. This conclusion is mistaken. Firstly, because the lengths of previous interglacials were not particularly regular; see figure. Petit et al. note that [...] "interglacials 5.5 and 9.3 are different from the Holocene, but similar to each other in duration, shape and amplitude. During each of these two events, there is a warm period of 4 kyr followed by a relatively rapid cooling". Secondly, future orbital variations will not closely resemble those of the past.|$|E

2500|$|Wilhelm Pauk {{wrote in}} 1931 (Karl Barth Prophet Of A New Christianity) that Kierkegaard's {{use of the}} Latin phrase Finitum Non Capax Infiniti (the finite does not (or cannot) {{comprehend}} the infinite) summed up Barth's system. David G. Kingman and Adolph Keller each discussed Barth's relationship to Kierkegaard in their books, The Religious Educational Values in Karl Barth's Teachings (1934) and Karl Barth and Christian Unity (1933). Keller notes the splits that happen when a new teaching is introduced and some assume a higher knowledge from a higher source than others. But Kierkegaard always referred to the equality of all {{in the world of}} the spirit where there is neither [...] "sport" [...] nor [...] "spook" [...] or anyone who can shut you out of the world of the spirit except yourself. All are chosen by God and equal in His sight. The Expectancy of Faith," [...] Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> justified by faith. Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law. You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. The Bible – NIV" [...] Galatians 3:23–29; [...] "In the world of spirit to become one’s own master, is the highest – and in love to help someone toward that, to become himself, free, independent, his own master, to help him stand alone – that is the greatest beneficence. The greatest beneficence, to help the other to stand alone, cannot be done directly." [...] "If a person always keeps his soul sober and alert in this idea, he will never go astray in his outlook on life and people or [...] "combine respect for status of persons with his faith." [...] Show no partiality as you hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. (James 2.1) Then he will direct his thoughts toward God, and his eye will not make the mistake of looking for differences in the world instead of likeness with God.|$|E
