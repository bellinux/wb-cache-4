6000|$|Pippin {{drove him}} home at a furious pace, not uttering a single word. As they {{turned into the}} main street, a young woman {{starting}} out before the horses obliged Pippin to pull up.

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>asked</b> no more {{questions}} until the match was over, but stood looking on intently as the players {{came off the}} ground. Rupert and Edgar were together, laughing and talking in high spirits; for each had kicked a goal, and the town boys had been beaten by four goals to one. The boy to whom she had been speaking had long before strolled away {{to another part of}} the field, but she turned to another as the Clintons approached.|$|E
6000|$|As he {{laid her}} head back on the pillows, he ventured to touch her cold cheek with his lips. [...] "Has she taken it?" [...] <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>asked.</b> He was just able to answer [...] "Yes"--just able to look once more at the dear face on the pillow. The tumult of contending emotions, against which he had {{struggled}} thus far, overpowered his utmost resistance. He ran to hide the hysterical passion in him, forcing its way to relief in sobs and cries, on the landing outside.|$|E

60|$|The {{woman said}} that he had gone off to borrow a team of oxen and would not be back until the next day, and then she led Alison into a little roughly match-boarded room with an {{uncovered}} floor and very little furniture except the big stove in the middle of it. A child was toddling about the floor and another, a very little girl, lay with a flushed face in a canvas chair. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>asked</b> Alison no questions, but set about getting supper ready, and after a while Thorne, who had apparently been putting up the team, came in. As he did so the child in the chair held out her hands to him.|$|E
60|$|The trial began, {{and after}} the {{advocate}} against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out {{the whole of the}} night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>asked</b> her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight o'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.|$|E
6000|$|And yet {{the mother}} {{when she looked at}} her {{daughter}} almost persuaded herself that it need not be so. The girl was very lovely,--so lovely that, were she but seen, men would quarrel for her as to who should have her in his keeping. Such beauty, such life, such capability for giving and receiving enjoyment could not have been intended to wither on a lone cliff over the Atlantic! There must be fault somewhere. But yet to live had been the first necessity; and life in cities, among the haunts of men, had been impossible with such means as this woman possessed. When she had called her daughter to her, and had sought peace under the roof which her friend the priest had found for her, peace and a roof to shelter her had been the extent of her desires. To be at rest, and independent, with her child within her arms, had been all that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>asked</b> of the gods. For herself it sufficed. For herself she was able to acknowledge that the rest which she had at least obtained was infinitely preferable to the unrest of her past life. But she soon learned,--as she had not expected to learn before she made the experiment,--that that which was to her peace, was to her daughter life within a tomb. [...] "Mother, is it always to be like this?" ...|$|E

And fear, there where she sat, froze the woman to stone: Not fear of the crazy boat and the weltering deep alone; But a keener fear of the night, the dark, and the ghostly hour, And the thing that drove the canoe with more than a mortal's power And more than a mortal's boldness.
