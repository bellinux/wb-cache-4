Regarding technological evaluation, contact lines of 45 #mu#m printed on 10 x 10 cm" 2 wafers demonstrate the fine line printing ability of pad printing on large areas. The ability to print on uneven and fragile substrates like EFG material is proven. However, low paste transfer limits the line resistance and, thus, fill factor. Nevertheless, based on an extensive optimization of printing parameters including different pad types, values > 75 % are achieved for double printing.

2500|$|This type of {{thickness}} variation has many causes, {{but there are}} three primary mechanisms which contribute the most to the propagation of disc {{thickness variation}}s connected to uneven <b>pad</b> <b>transfer.</b> The first is improper selection of brake pads for a given application. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking {{for the first time}} in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven material transfer is improper break in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc as a whole) every time the pads are changed on a vehicle. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven <b>pad</b> material <b>transfer</b> is known as [...] "pad imprinting." [...] This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken in brake system (with properly selected <b>pads),</b> this <b>transfer</b> is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the brake pad. This small thickness variation can begin the cycle of uneven <b>pad</b> <b>transfer.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Once {{the disc}} has {{some level of}} {{variation}} in thickness, uneven pad deposition can accelerate, sometimes resulting in changes to the crystal structure of the metal that composes the disc in extreme situations. As the brakes are applied, the pads slide over the varying disc surface. As the pads pass by the thicker section of the disc, they are forced outwards. The foot of the driver applied to the brake pedal naturally resists this change, and thus more {{force is applied to}} the pads. The result is that the thicker sections see higher levels of stress. This causes an uneven heating of the surface of the disc, which causes two major issues. As the brake disc heats unevenly it also expands unevenly. The thicker sections of the disc expand more than the thinner sections due to seeing more heat, and thus the difference in thickness is magnified. Also, the uneven distribution of heat results in further uneven <b>transfer</b> of <b>pad</b> material. The result is that the thicker-hotter sections receive even more pad material than the thinner-cooler sections, contributing to a further increase in the variation in the disc's thickness. In extreme situations, this uneven heating can actually cause the crystal structure of the disc material to change. When the hotter sections of the discs reach extremely high temperatures ( [...] ), the metal can undergo a phase transformation and the carbon which is dissolved in the steel can precipitate out to form carbon-heavy carbide regions known as cementite. This iron carbide {{is very different from the}} cast iron the rest of the disc is composed of. It is extremely hard, very brittle, and does not absorb heat well. After cementite is formed, the integrity of the disc is compromised. Even if the disc surface is machined, the cementite within the disc will not wear or absorb heat at the same rate as the cast iron surrounding it, causing the uneven thickness and uneven heating characteristics of the disc to return.|$|R
40|$|Wafer probing is {{the state}} of-the-art {{procedure}} to test the electrical functionality of devices in semiconductor manufacturing and packaging process. During measurement, a probe tip is pressed onto the metal pad of the device with a defined force thus achieving a low-resistive and stable electrical contact. However, the contact forces have to be kept below a critical limit to avoid chip damage and to reduce the remaining scrub mark. This becomes particularly important for probing highly integrated devices with their increasingly reduced pad sizes and pitches, to maintain the wire bonding capability of the pads after testing, and when probing over active areas. It is thus important to analyze the amount of plastic deformation in the pad metal and the risk for crack initiation and chip damage during the probing process. In this study, the deformations <b>transferred</b> to the <b>pad</b> metal and the underlying active areas through probing were analyzed by finite element (FE) simulati on. For this purpose, two different bond pad metals were experimentally investigated by mechanical testing for a given probe tip geometry and displacement.

40|$|International audienceThe {{printing}} of multilayered pixels using single picosecond laser pulses is investigated {{by using an}} improved laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) technique. Micrometric low-k dielectric capacitors of hybrid organic polymer (parylene-C) and silver thin films have been <b>transferred</b> on laser-printed <b>pads</b> of annealed silver nanoparticles (AgNP) paste. This printing technique allows to design and print directly on virtually any substrate, {{in order to make}} the capacitors directly interface with other components, such as transducers or sensing devices, and which are further used for improving or complementing the characteristics of these devices. This study focuses on the use of the optimized LIFT technique using a double mask setup, i. e. smart beam shaping (SBS) in the picosecond laser pulse regime. The purpose is to optimize the energy repartition of the Gaussian beam on the thick multilayer donor by using a beam profile with increased intensity at the edges and low intensity in the center. This allows to keep the incoming irradiation fluence on the donor layer as low as possible in the centre area, and thus preventing the multilayer pixels from damage induced by laser irradiation. Electrical investigations of the SBS-LIFT printed micro-capacitors demonstrate that they are fully functional and stable over time, with capacities in the pF range. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) catalyzes three transglycosylation {{reactions}} via {{a double}} displacement mechanism involving a covalent enzyme-intermediate complex (substituted-enzyme intermediate). Characterization {{of the three}} transglycosylation reactions, however, revealed that they differ in their kinetic mechanisms. Disproportionation (cleavage of an alpha-glycosidic bond of a linear malto-oligosaccharide: and <b>transfer</b> of one <b>pad</b> to an acceptor substrate) proceeds according to a ping-pong mechanism. Cyclization (cleavage of an alpha-glycosidic bond in amylose or starch and subsequent formation of a cyclodextrin) is a single-substrate reaction with an affinity for the high molecular mass substrate used, which was too high to allow elucidation of the kinetic mechanism. Michaelis-Menten kinetics, however, have been observed using shorter amylose chains. Coupling (cleavage of an alpha-glycosidic bond in a cyclodextrin ring and transfer of the resulting linear malto-oligosaccharide to an acceptor substrate) proceeds according to a random ternary complex mechanism.

Construction of CGTase mutants that synthesize linear oligosaccharides instead of cyclodextrins thus appears feasible.

In the cyclization reaction this conversion rate, together with initial binding of the high molecular mass substrate, may determine the product specificity of the enzyme. These new insights will allow rational design of CGTase mutant enzymes synthesizing cyclodextrins of specific sizes...|$|R

In addition, clean finger pads were pressed on artificially contaminated stainless steel and Trespa® surfaces.

MNV 1 infectivity <b>transfer</b> from finger <b>pads</b> to stainless steel ranged from 13 ± 16 % on the first to 0. 003 ± 0. 009 % on the sixth transfer on immediate transfer.

MNV 1 infectivity transfer from stainless steel and Trespa® to finger pads after 40 min of drying was 2. 0 ± 2. 0 % and 4. 0 ± 5. 0 % respectively.

40|$|As {{science and}} {{technology}} has developed, the manner by which drugs can be delivered has grown. This research explores an alternative method for the delivery of therapeutic compounds to the body. The basis of the study involves the application of traditional medicines on textiles. Boswellia Serrata Extract (B. S. E.) is a common traditional medicine used for curing body pains. The {{most common form of}} B. S. E. based products are creams that are applied directly to the skin. Experiments show that these creams were not suitable as a basis for applying to textile materials because the creams contain highly volatile compounds, which on drying the treated textile, post application, cause almost total loss of the B. S. E. The approach used was the application on textiles of a &# 039;commercial&# 039; topical medicine applied as a cream for, where B. S. E. is a major constituent. Cotton woven fabric was padded with this cream and tested for washing and rubbing fastness. The presence of highly volatile substances in the topical cream resulted in a negligible amount of the medicine on the dried treated fabric. Another approach was used for the application of B. S. E. onto the textile substrate. A commercially available B. S. E. powder was applied to woven fabric using a pad mangle. Tests were carried out to validate the "take-up" of the B. S. E. powder on the woven cotton fabric and to measure the wash fatness and rubbing fastness of the padded fabric. The aim was to assess the possibility of using the padded fabric for assembly into a garment, also assessing was whether the garment could withstand laundering and retain the B. S. E. for transdermal permeability in addition, a test was conducted to measure the amount of B. S. E. <b>transferred</b> from <b>padded</b> fabric to the simulated skin over a specified span of time. Due to ethics involvement, the tests were not conducted on humans or animals, but rather an alternative method was devised to evaluate the transfer of material from woven fabric to the skin surface. Leather was used in the evaluation of dermal transfer of B. S. E. Other tests completed were conducted on Perkin Elmer Spe ctrum 2000 FTIR Spectrum and ESEM on FEI Quanta 200. Due to low wash and rubbing fastness values on the apparel fabrics and negligible transfer of B. S. E. powder from the treated fabric surface to the skin surface, an alternative approach was followed. The B. S. E. powder was coated on polyester viscose blended non-woven fabric. Using coated fabrics as patches that do not require washing fastness make them easy to use. The effectiveness of the dermal transfer was assessed using rubbing fastness, scanning electron microscopy and FTIR Spectroscopy. This thesis has shown that the effective approach for using a textile fabric as a medium for applying B. S. E. to the skin is coating on non-woven material {{that can be used in}} patch form. The application of B. S.

40|$|Plasmids pAD 1 (37. 8 megadaltons) and pAD 2 (17. 1 megadaltons) of Streptococcus faecalis strain DS 16 {{have been}} mapped with {{restriction}} enzymes. The {{location of a}} hemolysin-bacteriocin determinant on the conjugative pAD 1 plasmid was derived from analyses of transposon insertions. Electron microscope and hybridization analyses located Tn 917 (Em) and the streptomycin (Sm) and kanamycin (Km) resistance determinants on the nonconjugative pAD 2 plasmid. It was shown previously that the erythromycin (Em) resistance associated with Tn 917 is inducible and that transposition from pAD 2 to pAD 1 is also stimulated by exposure of cells to low concentrations of Em. Here we show that inducing concentrations of Em also increase the conjugative <b>transfer</b> potential of <b>pAD</b> 1; this is possibly related to a mild and short-lived inhibitory stress placed on the cells before full induction of resistance. Selection of Em-resistant transconjugants arising from matings between DS 16 and a plasmid-free recipient gave rise to transconjugants which primarily harbor stable pAD 1 ::pAD 2 cointegrates. A 30 -min exposure of donors to Em (0. 5 microgram/ml) before mating resulted in a severalfold {{increase in the number}} of such transconjugants. However, a small fraction (e. g., 3 of 40) of these Emr Smr Kmr transconjugants harbored pAD 1 ::Tn 917 and pAD 2 molecules. Since we believe pAD 2 is incapable of being mobilized by pAD 1 without being covalently linked, it is likely that transfer in these cases involved cointegrates representing structural intermediates in the transposition of Tn 917 from pAD 2 to pAD 1. It follows that such intermediates probably had two copies of Tn 917 and readily resolved after transfer. (These cointegrates are different from the stable cointegrates which were shown to have only a single copy of Tn 917; the latter are assumed not to be related to transposition.) Two variants with altered Tn 917 transposition properties were derived. One of them transposed at an elevated frequency, whereas the other showed no detectabel transposition. In neither case was transposition influenced by Em exposure; however, both remained inducible for Em resistance...|$|R

An intuitive LabView program faciliates the user interaction by allowing the setting of all analog bias voltages and digital controls, which are transmitted to the measurement and control setup by a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) (written in C) using a USB interface. The prospect of using a fingerprint sensor chip as an alternative bio-electrocnic device was also investigated in addition {{to the development of the}} said chips and their peripheral systems. Similarly, a measurement and controls setup as well as another LabView software were also implemented for the fingerprint sensor. The 2 afromentioned, in-house designed chips are called Calibur and Zulfiqar, with the latter being the one developed later. Calibur was manufactured with a 3 metal 2 poly (3 M 2 P) 0. 5 μm technology from ON Semiconductor, while a 5 metal 1 poly (5 M 1 P) 0. 35 μm technology was chosen for Zulfiqar. Both chips were first simulated using the Cadence IC 5. 1. 41 software on the circuit level to test their electrical features. Later, their individual layouts were created and evaluated using the Calibre tool (Mentor Graphics). The final fabrication of both chips took place in the cleanroom facillities of ON Semiconductor through the Europractice membership of our institute. The first chip, Calibur, was developed by Dr. Mathias Schindler during his PhD. A 64 x 64 pixel (12. 5 μm pitch) array was implemented at the center of the chip, followed by a bank of 64 amplifiers (1 per row of the array) to ist right hand side. These amplifiers carried out the on-chip amplification of the analog signals recorded from electrogenic cells, prior to their transfer to the measurement setup. The central array was flanked by 2 decoders to its left and bottom side: A row and column decoder. These digital circuits were responsible for the activation and calibration of entire columns, as well as for the selection of individual pixels for electrical stimulation. Further down on the signal path, a bank of 8 8 -to- 1 multiplexers were implemented on the right hand side of the 64 amplifiers to reduce the number of simulatenously read-out channels from 64 to 8. The outputs of the multiplexers were connected to I/O <b>pads,</b> <b>transferring</b> the signals off-chip. Zulfiqar was implemented using a similar floor plan. The use of a different technology however, madet the re-design of the entire circuitry and layout along with it necessary. The greatest challenge in the Zulfiqar project was the integration of a gain stage directly into each pixel in the central array to amplify the analog signals directly at their source, prior to their amplification by the 64 off-pixel amplifiers. To this end, a differential common-source amplifier was implemented in each pixel. The avenue of using the pixels bi-directional, meaning both for read-out and stimulation was preserved by adapting the circuitry. The neccessity to keep the pixel size and pitch as small as possible imposed restrictions on the complexity and the dimensions of the circuit implemented. After the passing through initial gain stage in the pixels, the analog signals were again amplified in the 64 amplifiers on the right hand side of the array. This concept greatly increased the sensitivity of Zulfiqar in comparison to Calibur, enabling the detection of much lower signals. Subsequent to the fabrication, the chips were coated with a thin film high-k material. A great deal of effort was also spent on the optimization of this step, as it was considered to be crucial to improve the chips performances. Different methods of deposition and materials (and combinations of those materials) were tested and characterized in order to achieve a surface passivation with the highest electrical permittivity value possible. As a result, a 3 -stack double layer of TiO 2 / HfO 2 and a 4 -stack double layer of Al 2 O 3 / Ta 2 O 5 deposited using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) based method called atomic layer deposition (ALD) proved acceptable for our purposes. Finally, the fingerprint sensor also underwent electrical characterization to evaluate the prospect of using it as an alternative, cheap and off-the-shelf solution to the custom designed IC’s. Though the proof of principle could be shown by detecting signals delivered to the chip through an electrolyte (much like the characterization of Calibur and Zulfiqar), the range of signals still detectable was well over the „electrophysiologically relavant“ region. Thus the fingerprint sensor cannot be used as an alternative for the custom designed IC’s as it is now, after improvements to its sensitivity however, this avenue should be re-investigated...|$|R
