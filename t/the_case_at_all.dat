They followed a series of epidemics of Coxsackie virus infection in their part of France. After each epidemic there were increased numbers of cases with EFE coming to autopsy.

6000|$|... § 5. So {{much for}} the first of Dr. Whewell’s conditions, that conceptions must be appropriate. The second is, that they shall be “clear:” and let us {{consider}} what this implies. Unless the conception corresponds to a real agreement, it has a worse defect than that of not being clear: it is not applicable to <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Among the phenomena, therefore, which we are attempting to connect by means of the conception, we must suppose that there really is an agreement, and that the conception is a conception of that agreement. In order, then, that it may be clear, the only requisite is, that we shall know exactly in what the agreement consists; that it shall have been carefully observed, and accurately remembered. We are said not to have a clear conception of the resemblance among a set of objects, when we have only a general feeling that they resemble, without having analyzed their resemblance, or perceived in what points it consists, and fixed in our memory an exact recollection of those points. This want of clearness, or, as it may be otherwise called, this vagueness in the general conception, may be owing either to our having no accurate knowledge of the objects themselves, or merely to our not having carefully compared them. Thus a person may have no clear idea of a ship because he has never seen one, or because he remembers but little, and that faintly, of what he has seen. Or he may have a perfect knowledge and remembrance of many ships of various kinds, frigates among the rest, but he may have no clear but only a confused idea of a frigate, because he has never been told, and has not compared them sufficiently to have remarked and remembered, in what particular points a frigate differs from some other kind of ship.|$|E

In the spring he had introduced {{a change in the}} mode of issuing deficiency bills, limiting the quarterly amount to such a sum as would cover the maximum of dividends payable, as known by long experience to be called for. The Bank held this to be illegal; claimed the whole amount required, along with balances actually in hand, to cover the entire amount payable; and asked him to take the opinion of the law officers. The lawyers backed the chancellor of the exchequer. Then the Bank took an opinion of their own; their counsel (Kelly and Palmer) advised that the attorney and solicitor were wrong; and recommended the Bank to bring their grievance before the prime minister. Mr. Gladstone was righteously incensed at this refusal to abide by an opinion invited by the Bank itself, and by which if it had been adverse he would himself have been bound. 'And then,' said Bethell, urging Mr. Gladstone to stand to his guns, 'its counsel call the Bank a trustee for the public! Proh pudor! What stuff lawyers will talk. But 'tis their vocation.'

60|$|It must {{be remembered}} that before this issue of Nicholas Nickleby his work, {{successful}} as it was, had not been such as to dedicate him seriously or irrevocably to the writing of novels. He had already written three books; {{and at least two}} of them are classed among the novels under his name. But {{if we look at the}} actual origin and formation of these books we see that they came from another source and were really designed upon another plan. The three books were, of course, the Sketches by Boz, the Pickwick Papers, and Oliver Twist. It is, I suppose, sufficiently well understood that the Sketches by Boz are, as their name implies, only sketches. But surely it is quite equally clear that the Pickwick Papers are, as their name implies, merely papers. Nor is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> different in spirit and essence when we come to Oliver Twist. There is indeed a sort of romance in Oliver Twist, but it is such an uncommonly bad one that it can hardly be regarded as greatly interrupting the previous process; and if the reader chooses to pay very little attention to it, he cannot pay less attention to it than the author did. But in fact the case lies far deeper. Oliver Twist is so much apart from the ordinary track of Dickens, it is so gloomy, it is so much all in one atmosphere, that it can best be considered as an exception or a solitary excursus in his work. Perhaps it can best be considered as the extension of one of his old sketches, of some sketch that happened to be about a visit to a workhouse or a gaol. In the Sketches by Boz he might well have visited a workhouse where he saw Bumble; in the Sketches by Boz he might well have visited a prison where he saw Fagin. We are still in the realm of sketches and sketchiness. The Pickwick Papers may be called an extension of one of his bright sketches. Oliver Twist may be called an extension of one of his gloomy ones.|$|E

Mr. Gilmore was on the bench, along with Sir Thomas Charleys, who was the chairman, and three other gentlemen. Lord Trowbridge was in the court house, and sat upon the bench, but gave it out that he was not sitting there as a magistrate. Samuel Brattle was called upon to answer to his bail, and Jones, the {{attorney}} appearing for him, explained that he had gone from home to seek work elsewhere, alluded to the length of time that had elapsed, and to the injustice of presuming that a man against whom no evidence had been adduced, should be bound to remain always in one parish,--and expressed himself without any doubt that Mr. Fenwick and Mr. George Brattle, who were his bailsmen, would cause him to be found and brought forward. As neither the clergyman nor the farmer were in court, nothing further could be done at once; and the magistrates were quite ready to admit that time must be allowed. Nor was <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> ready against the two men who were in custody. Indeed, against them the evidence was so little substantial that a lawyer from Devizes, who attended on their behalf, expressed his amazement that the American authorities should have given them up, and suggested that it must have been done with some view to a settlement of the Alabama claims. Evidence, however, was brought up to show that the two men had been convicted before, the one for burglary, and the other for horse-stealing; that the former, John Burrows, known as the Grinder, was a man from Devizes with whom the police about that town, and at Chippenham, Bath, and Wells, were well acquainted; that the other, Acorn, was a young man who had been respectable, as a partner in a livery stable at Birmingham, but who had taken to betting, and had for a year past been living by evil courses, having previously undergone two years of imprisonment with hard labour. It was proved that they had been seen in the neighbourhood {{both before and after the}} murder; that boots found in the cottage at Pycroft Common fitted certain footmarks in the mud of the farmer's yard; that Burrows had been supplied with a certain poison at a county chemist's at Lavington, and that the dog Bone'm had been poisoned with the like. Many other matters were proved, all of which were declared by the lawyer from Devizes to amount to nothing, and by the police authorities, who were prosecutors, to be very much. The magistrates of course ordered a remand, and ordered also that on the day named Sam Brattle should appear. It was understood that that day week was only named pro formâ, the constables having explained that at least a fortnight would be required for the collection of further evidence. This took place on Tuesday, the 25th of April, and it was understood that time up to the 8th of May would be given to the police to complete their case.|$|E

40|$|Scaling {{effect of}} area-averaged NDVI {{is known as}} a source of error induced by {{differences}} in spatial resolution of two independent measurements over a fixed area. It deteriorates accuracy in parameter retrieval via NDVI, thus its mechanism needs to be fully understood for a better rectification of NDVI. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate error bounds of averaged NDVI within a fixed area as a function of spatial resolution under assumptions of multiple-endmember linear mixture model (LMM). The NDVI behavior was first analyzed to identify the conditions regarding the choice of endmember spectra at which the averaged NDVI becomes the maximum and minimum. A series of numerical simulations were conducted by assuming a four-endmember LMM to demonstrate the finding such that the values of NDVI which show non-monotonic behavior fall into the ranges estimated from <b>the</b> two-endmember <b>cases</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> resolutions by choosing appropriate pairs of endmember spectra predicted from the analysis. It was concluded that the error in the averaged NDVI over a fixed size of area composed of multiple endmembers can be bounded from <b>the</b> simpler two-endmember <b>cases</b> which would be a key to predicting the maximum and minimum errors caused by the scaling effect. ...|$|R
40|$|Testing is a {{difficult}} process that becomes more difficult with scaling. With smaller and faster devices, tolerance for errors shrinks and devices may act correctly under certain condition and not under others. As such, hard errors may exist but are only exercised by very specific machine state and signal pathways. Targeting these errors is difficult, and creating test cases that cover all machine states and pathways is not possible. In addition, new complications during burn-in may mean latent hard errors are not exposed in the fab and reach the customer before becoming active. To address this problem, we propose an architecture we call BlackJack that allows hard errors to be detected using redundant threads running on a single SMT core. This technique provides a safety-net that catches hard errors that were either latent during test or just not covered by <b>the</b> test <b>cases</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Like SRT, our technique works by executing redundant copies and verifying that their resulting machine states agree. Unlike SRT, BlackJack is able to achieve high hard error instruction coverage by executing redundant threads on different front and backend resources in the pipeline. We show that for a 15 % performance penalty over SRT, BlackJack achieves 97 % hard error instruction coverage compared to SRT’s 35 %. ...|$|R
