50|$|Chamber reamers come in {{two general}} types - solid pilot reamers and {{floating}} pilot reamers. A solid pilot reamer has, as the name suggests, a solid steel pilot on the end to guide <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> through the bore of the barrel. These reamers are generally more durable and less expensive than floating pilot reamers. Floating pilot reamers use interchangeable pilots that are positioned {{at the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>reamer.</b> The primary advantage of a floating pilot reamer is that it is self-centering and can be fitted with a pilot that is an exact match with the barrel it is passing though. Barrels tend to vary in diameter by minute amounts, and this variation can create a situation whereby the solid pilot reamer fits too loosely or too snugly in the bore. Another advantage of floating pilot reamers is that the pilot itself does not spin with <b>the</b> <b>reamer,</b> and therefore is less likely to damage the bore. The primary disadvantage of the floating point reamer is that the nose of <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> must be cut down in diameter to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> pilot, resulting in a more delicate reamer.|$|E
50|$|The final {{hole size}} that is {{achieved}} by a reamer subsequently depends on the reaming process being {{used in conjunction with}} <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> design and materials involved. Studies have been conducted which demonstrate the effect of coolant use during reaming. The continuous use of a coolant stream during the reaming process has been shown to consistently (75% of the time) result in hole sizes that are 0.0001 in. (0.0025 mm) larger than <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> itself, with a process spread of +/- 0.0002 in. the remainder of the time. Similarly, using a semi-wet reaming process often results in hole sizes that are 0.0004 in. larger than <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> itself, approximately 60% of the time, with a process spread of 0.0006 in. favoring an increase in size. Dry reaming should be discouraged due to its low level of repeatability (20%) in size and wide process spread of sizes up to 0.0012 in. (0.030 mm) larger than <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> size.|$|E
5000|$|The Remington SAAMI {{submitted}} specifications. It {{was supposed}} to have a 0.050 in freebore, 45° cone angle, 0.278 in ⌀ freebore. The reamers and PTG prints had an 80° neck to freebore cone angle, which was a result of a mistake in <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> drawing submitted, and was never corrected by <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> maker or Remington during the process of tooling up for the testing protocols that eventually drove the SAAMI submission.|$|E

50|$|To use a hand reamer, {{the user}} first slices a chosen fruit in half {{with a knife}} along its {{equatorial}} midsection. Grasping the fruit {{in one hand and}} <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> in the other, the user first pierces the exposed flesh of the fruit with the tip of <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> blade, then grinds out the inside with a twisting wrist motion until nearly all of the juice is extracted. This dislodges the seeds and some amount of pith, so the juice must generally be strained before use. It works well with limes and lemons, but larger citrus fruits (grapefruit in particular) require a larger device.|$|E
25|$|These {{core drill}} bits {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to reamers as they have no cutting point or means of starting a hole. They have 3 or 4 flutes which enhances the finish of the hole and ensures the bit cuts evenly. Core drill bits differ from <b>reamers</b> in <b>the</b> amount of material {{they are intended to}} remove. A reamer is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on <b>the</b> <b>reamers</b> size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps a millimeter. A core drill bit may be used to double the size of a hole.|$|R

50|$|The Boilermaker Special is the {{official}} mascot of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. It resembles a Victorian-era railroad locomotive and is built on a truck chassis. It is operated and maintained by the student members of <b>the</b> Purdue <b>Reamer</b> Club.|$|R
50|$|Generally, reaming is done using a drill press. However, lathes, {{machining}} {{centers and}} similar machines {{can be used}} as well. The workpiece is firmly held in place by either a vise, chuck or fixture while <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> advances.|$|E
50|$|On June 16, 2017, <b>the</b> <b>Reamer</b> Club {{announced}} the Boilermaker Special VI will be retired {{and replaced by}} the Boilermaker Special VIII. The new X-tra Special will be completed and presented to the public during the fall 2017 football season.|$|E
50|$|A {{hand reamer}} has a longer taper or lead {{in at the}} front than a machine reamer. This is to {{compensate}} for the difficulty of starting a hole by hand power alone. It also allows <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> to start straight and reduce the risk of breakage. The flutes may be straight or spiral.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]338 Norma Magnum was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} long-range sport shooting wildcat cartridge by the American sport shooter Jimmie Sloan {{with the help of}} Dave Kiff, owner of Pacific Tool and Gauge, who made <b>the</b> <b>reamers</b> and headspace gauges. It was designed as a way to optimize shooting the 19.44 g (300 gr) 8.59 mm (.338 in) caliber Sierra HPBT MatchKing projectile from actions and magazines that lack the length to handle cartridges exceeding 91.44 mm (3.60 in) in overall length.Later the design was purchased by the Swedish ammunition manufacturer Norma.The [...]338 Norma Magnum cartridge was C.I.P. certified on 26 May 2010 and thus became an officially registered and sanctioned rimmed rifle cartridge.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Mechanical {{instrumentation}} of {{the complex}} root canal system is very demanding procedure which requires use of the various manual and rotary instruments. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the frequency and to verify the possible deformation of the working part of endodontic instruments after their multiple clinical use. Material and Methods. New sets of the manual endodontic instruments (reamers, K-files and Hedstroem) used in routine clinical use (44 instruments) and for root canal instrumentation of extracted teeth (44 instruments) were included in the study. Instrumentation was performed by Step-Back technique and constant irrigation with 0. 5 % NaOCl solution, 10 ml for each root canal. All the instruments were used 10 times and after use sterilized in a dry sterilizer or autoclave. The working parts of deformed instruments were analyzed using optimagnetic print. Results. The results obtained after clinical use showed deformations of the working part of <b>the</b> <b>reamers</b> in 50 %, K-files in 43 % and Hedstroem in 66. 7 % of used instruments. After instrumentation the canal of the extracted teeth, deformations were observed in 87. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>reamers,</b> in 50 % of the K-files and in 62. 5 % of Hedstroem files. The difference in frequency of the deformations was not statistically significant. On the instruments used for the preparation the canals of the extracted teeth and sterilized in autoclave, malformations were observed in 86. 4 %, comparing to the instruments sterilized in a dry sterilizer where malformations of the working part were registered in 59. 1 % of the cases. That difference was statistically significant (χ 2 = 5. 250; p= 0. 072). Conclusion. Multiple use of the manual endodontic instruments in clinical conditions leads to increased frequency of malformations of the working part in all types of manual endodontic instruments...|$|R
30|$|Then, a blunt tipped {{intramedullary}} {{guide wire}} for <b>the</b> nail <b>reamers</b> is inserted along the pre-prepared canal {{of the lower}} fragment and along the medullary canal of the upper segment. Reaming is then continued until the planned canal diameter is reached. A retrograde IM nail is then inserted.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Reamer</b> Barn is a {{historic}} barn {{near the village of}} Oberlin in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Constructed {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century, it was built to house a gentleman farmer's cattle herd, and it has been named {{a historic}} site because of its distinctive architecture.|$|E
50|$|Reamers are {{stabilizers}} {{that have}} cutting elements embedded on their fins, {{and are used}} to maintain a gauged well-bore. They {{can be used to}} drill out doglegs and key-seats in hard formations. Due to the cutting ability of <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> the bit does less work in maintaining well-bore gauge and more work drilling.|$|E
50|$|The spiral may be {{clockwise}} or counter-clockwise {{depending on}} usage. For example, a tapered hand reamer with a clockwise spiral {{will tend to}} self feed as it is used, possibly leading to a wedging action and consequent breakage. A counter-clockwise spiral is therefore preferred even though <b>the</b> <b>reamer</b> is still turned in the clockwise direction.|$|E
30|$|Infection, {{iatrogenic}} radial nerve palsy {{and hardware}} failure {{are most important}} complications associated with plating. We had higher rates of infection and iatrogenic radial nerve palsy in the plating group, as has been seen by Changulani et al. [26]. However, in a meta-analysis, Bhandari et al. [27] did not show higher risks of infection or radial nerve palsy with plating. Radial nerve is at a definite risk in plating, with special precautions being taken to prevent nerve from coming beneath the plate. Although radial nerve injury after nailing is rare, the risk can be further minimized by ensuring accurate reduction of the fracture (no gap) before passage of <b>the</b> <b>reamers</b> or <b>the</b> nail and by avoiding reaming in areas of comminution where the nerve is closely apposed to the bone.|$|R
