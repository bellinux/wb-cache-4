The objective of this thesis was to search for and evaluate methods for measuring the surface temperature of a Yankee cylinder during operation. Metso Paper is looking for a method having an accuracy of ΔT = 1 °C, a response time of t 300 °C, making this method unsuitable for measuring the surface temperature of <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> cylinder.
