Throughout the single, Fantasia reveals her personal [...] "journey to happiness" [...] by singing, [...] "When I met you, I met me too." [...] She also shares memories of her past heartbreaks using lyrics such as: “Listen <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> tell you/Without him {{there would be no}} you/So yes, I thank my ex a little still." [...] The song ends with a spoken word monologue, in which Fantasia details the first time she met Taylor. This part of the track includes lines such as: [...] "I still remember the day, it was beautiful. And if I hadn’t went through the things I went through before then I wouldn’t know how special you are." ...|$|E
500|$|Haynes {{had first}} heard about the film in 2012 from costume {{designer}} Sandy Powell, who informed him that Blanchett was attached and Karlsen was producing. Blanchett, who served as an executive producer through her production company Dirty Films Ltd., had {{been involved with the}} project for [...] "a long time". Haynes learned {{they were looking for a}} director when Vachon approached him in 2013. He regarded the story, its historical and social context, and collaborating again with Blanchett as motivating factors for his involvement. [...] "What was so interesting <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first read this script", Haynes said, [...] "is how it basically links that hothouse mentality of the desiring subject ... to that of the criminal subject, in that both are these over-productive minds that are conjuring narratives constantly ... this crazy state of this furtive hyperactivity in the mind." [...] Haynes collaborated with Blanchett on a dramaturgical level.|$|E

He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E

"I'll Need Someone <b>to</b> Hold <b>Me</b> (<b>When</b> <b>I</b> Cry)" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Bob McDill and Wayland Holyfield, and {{recorded}} by American country music artist Janie Fricke.

500|$|... Darwin's {{belief that}} black people had the same {{essential}} humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from John Edmonstone in 1826. Early in the Beagle voyage, Darwin nearly lost {{his position on the}} ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. [...] He wrote home about [...] "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." [...] Regarding Fuegians, he [...] "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like Jemmy Button: [...] "It seems yet wonderful <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." ...|$|E
500|$|They reached Tierra del Fuego on 18 December 1832 and Darwin {{was taken}} aback at what he {{perceived}} as the crude savagery of the Yaghan natives, {{in stark contrast to}} the [...] "civilised" [...] behaviour of the three Fuegians they were returning as missionaries (who had been given the names York Minster, Fuegia Basket and Jemmy Button). He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians as being [...] "without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement." [...] In contrast, he said of Jemmy that [...] "It seems yet wonderful <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." [...] (Four decades later, he recalled these impressions in The Descent of Man to support his argument that just as humans had descended from [...] "a lower form", civilised society had arisen by graduations from a more primitive state. He recalled how closely the Fuegians on board the Beagle [...] "resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental faculties.") ...|$|E
500|$|Threatened financially by Burroughs' condemnation, Long's {{publishers}} came {{to their}} client's defense by distributing a pamphlet defending his positions. In late 1903, Long published a new book titled A Little Brother to the Bear. In the preface, he wrote: [...] "Except where it is plainly stated otherwise, all the incidents and observations have passed under my own eyes and have been confirmed later by other observers... I have simply tried to make all these animals as interesting to the reader as they were <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> discovered them." [...] While The New York Times reviewed it favorably, pointing out its [...] "close observation and loving attention {{to the details of}} wood life", Long's critics were quick to note a number of propositions regarding wildlife. An essay in the book titled [...] "Animal Surgery", in which Long wrote of various animals' ability to treat and mend their own injuries, particularly riled his critics. He told of how animals such as muskrat, beaver and bear were capable of intentionally bandaging their wounds and stumps of amputated limbs by coating them with materials such as tree resin or clay to keep the injury clean. The example that received the greatest attention was the story about a [...] "woodcock genius" [...] who set his own broken leg and applied a cast to the injury: ...|$|E

500|$|Welles said, [...] "the {{film was}} not {{intended}} as a lament for Falstaff, but {{for the death of}} Merrie England. Merrie England as a conception, a myth which has been very real to the English-speaking world, and is to some extent expressed in other countries of the Medieval epoch: the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and all that. It is more than Falstaff who is dying. It's the old England dying and betrayed." [...] Many film theorists and Welles biographers have written about the recurrent theme of the [...] "Lost Eden" [...] in Welles's work and of characters who are nostalgic for an idealized past, which Welles called [...] "the central theme in Western culture." [...] Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that [...] "even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive of such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit." [...] Film scholar Beverle Houston argued that this nostalgia made Welles's depiction of Falstaff infantile and called his performance a [...] "ower baby...an eating, sucking, foetus-like creature." [...] Welles also called Falstaff [...] "the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all of drama", and said that [...] "the closer I thought I was getting to Falstaff the less funny he seemed <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> played him before in the theater, he seemed more witty than comical. And in bringing him to the screen, I found him only occasionally, and only deliberately, a clown." ...|$|E

Joey Waronker (Beck, Atoms for Peace) played drums and percussion on all songs, while Cranny played various instruments on the album. Blasko recalled: [...] "I stayed in a backpackers hostel right near Hollywood Boulevard and worked on the album six days a week for two months ...

2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} Diogenes' death.

2500|$|Carl Frederick Buechner, {{the eldest}} son of Katherine Kuhn and Carl Frederick Buechner Sr., was born on July 11, 1926 in New York City. During Buechner's early {{childhood}} the family moved frequently, as Buechner's father searched for work. In The Sacred Journey Buechner recalls: [...] "Virtually every year of my life until I was fourteen, I lived in a different place, had different people {{to take care of}} me, went to a different school. The only house that remained constant was the one where my maternal grandparents lived in a suburb of Pittsburgh called East Liberty...Apart from that one house on Woodland Road, home was not a place <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a child. It was people." [...] This changed in 1936, when Buechner's father committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, a result of his conviction that he had been a failure. Immediately afterwards, the family moved to Bermuda, where they remained until World War II forced the evacuation of Americans from the island. [...] In Bermuda, Buechner experienced [...] "the blessed relief of coming out of the dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light." ...|$|E
