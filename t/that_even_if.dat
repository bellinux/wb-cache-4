5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
5|$|Although Sandra Panem in {{the journal}} Science praised Shilts' efforts and the {{attention}} the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight {{to the issue of}} homophobia hampering attention on the disease, but remarks <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, astronomers using {{computer}} simulations speculated <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> Betelgeuse is not rotating it might exhibit large-scale magnetic activity in its extended atmosphere, a factor where even moderately strong fields {{could have a}} meaningful influence over the star's dust, wind and mass-loss properties. A series of spectropolarimetric observations obtained in 2010 with the Bernard Lyot Telescope at Pic du Midi Observatory revealed {{the presence of a}} weak magnetic field at the surface of Betelgeuse, suggesting that the giant convective motions of supergiant stars are able to trigger the onset of a small-scale dynamo effect.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Horner {{admitted}} that specimen TMP2002.76.1 {{seemed to indicate}} that Achelousaurus was not descended from Einiosaurus, as it preceded both in age, and yet had a nasal boss. But he stressed <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the lineages split off, its ancestor might have resembled Einiosaurus. Furthermore, it might still be possible that Einiosaurus was a direct descendant of Rubeosaurus. Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology.

Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road.

Lindow compares the appearance of Gullveig/Heiðr into the Æsir to that of Hœnir and Mímir's disruption amongst the Vanir in Heimskringla. Lindow further states that all three accounts share the notion of acquisition of tools for the conquest of wisdom; the practice of seiðr in two accounts and the head of Mímir in one.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies found}} that the {{financial}} crisis and accompanying recession could {{not account for the}} entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit. A 2013 study estimated that changes to the health system had been responsible for {{about a quarter of the}} recent reduction in inflation. Paul Krawzak claimed <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.|$|E

Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code to be amended to allow for the automatic and unconditional renewal of all leased land for a period of 99 years.|$|E

He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant.

5|$|Meanwhile, the German {{conquest of}} Norway in April 1940 further eroded {{any chance of}} {{completing}} Graf Zeppelin. Now responsible for defending Norway's long coastline and numerous port facilities, the Kriegsmarine urgently needed large numbers of coastal guns and anti-aircraft batteries. During a naval conference with Hitler on 28 April 1940, Admiral Erich Raeder proposed halting all work on Graf Zeppelin, arguing <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> she was commissioned {{by the end of}} 1940, final installation of her guns would need another ten months or more (her original fire control system had been sold to the Soviet Union under an earlier trade agreement). Hitler consented to the stop work order, allowing Raeder to have Graf Zeppelins 15cm guns removed and transferred to Norway. The carrier's heavy flak armament of twelve 10.5cm guns had already been diverted elsewhere.|$|E
