The most active research topic in Cloud Computing is its economic aspect. In this article we give overview of existing literature on Cloud Computing economics (pricing of Cloud services, costs, benefits and risk of Clouds, ROI and cost/benefits models) and propose some new research challenges. Some {{of the most interesting}} future topics are a complete cost-benefit analysis methodology development, using simulations to identify <b>tangible</b> <b>cost</b> reduction, sustainability of current prices of Cloud services and system administration cost in a Cloud environment...|$|R

40|$|Flood risk {{assessment}} usually focuses on damages to material objects (indirect <b>tangible</b> <b>costs)</b> and downplays the broader socio-economic aspects of flood-prone systems. Such aspects are crucial for an accurate {{assessment of risk}} to human receptors and {{of the benefits of}} non-structural measures. For example, an early warning system (EWS) that reduces the amount of direct <b>tangible</b> <b>costs</b> only partially could: (i) save lives (direct intangible costs); (ii) help avoid long-lasting trauma (indirect intangible costs); (iii) prevent post-disaster evacuation costs (indirect <b>tangible</b> <b>costs).</b> We present a methodology to assess flood risk to people, which integrates people’s vulnerability and ability to cushion hazards by coping and adapting. The study area covers {{the lower part of the}} Sihl valley (Switzerland) including the city of Zurich. Flood risk to people is modelled using a spatially explicit Bayesian network model calibrated on expert opinions (25 experts were involved). Risk to people is assessed in terms of: (1) likelihood of non-fatal physical injury; (2) likelihood of post-traumatic stress disorder; (3) likelihood of death. The model is used to estimate the benefits of improving an existing EWS, taking into account reliability, lead-time and scope. The proposed approach can: (1) improve flood cost estimation by extending its scope beyond direct and tangible damages; (2) complement quantitative and semi-quantitative data with subjective and local knowledge, improving the use of commonly available information; and (3) produce estimates of model uncertainty by providing probability distributions for all its outputs...|$|E

Quantification {{of the immediate}} and direct costs of fire provide a metric for understanding {{the social and economic}} impact of fire and for assessing progress in fire prevention and protection. In addition to their physical costs, fires have a range of less immediate and obvious adverse consequences on the natural environment. These include air contamination from the fire plume (whose deposition is likely to subsequently include land and water contamination), contamination from water runoff containing toxic products, and other environmental discharges or releases from burned materials.|$|E
40|$|Human-wildlife {{conflict}} (HWC) is {{a complex}} conservation issue and acknowledging the human dimensions {{of the problem is}} critical. Here we propose the Wildlife Tolerance Model (WTM), a novel theoretical framework to identify key drivers of tolerance to living with damage-causing wildlife. The WTM proposes an outer model, where {{the extent to which a}} person experiences a species determines perceptions of costs relative to benefits of living with a species. This in turn determines tolerance. A second component, the inner model predicts eleven variables that may further drive perceptions of costs and benefits. In the current paper we test the outer model while in a forthcoming publication we test the inner model using a case study of human-baboon conflict in Cape Town, South Africa. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling we found support for the outer model. Experience explained 30 % of variance in costs and benefits and 60 % of tolerance was explained by perceptions of costs and benefits. Intangible costs and intangible benefits equally contributed to driving tolerance but <b>tangible</b> <b>costs</b> had no significant effect on tolerance. Separating two dimensions of experience, (i) exposure to a species explained costs more than benefits, and (ii) positive experiences explained intangible costs and benefits more than <b>tangible</b> <b>costs</b> while negative experiences equally explained costs and benefits. We discuss management implications of the findings and conclude that the WTM could be a useful diagnostic tool and theoretical framework to inform management interventions and policies to mitigate HWC...|$|E
40|$|The flood risk is a {{function}} of the flood hazard, the exposed values, and their vulnerability. In addition to extreme hydrological events, different anthropogenic activities such as extensive urbanization and land use play an important role in producing catastrophic floods. Considerations of both physical and social dimensions are therefore equally important in flood risk assessment. However, very often the risk assessment studies focus either on physical or social dimensions. In addition, the available studies often focus on economic valuation of only direct <b>tangible</b> <b>costs.</b> In this study, we provide an integrated flood risk assessment approach that goes beyond the valuation of direct <b>tangible</b> <b>costs,</b> through incorporating physical dimensions in hazard and exposure and social dimensions in vulnerability. The method has been implemented in the Dhaka City, Bangladesh, an area internationally recognized as hot spot for flood risk. In this study, flood hazards for different return periods are calculated in spatial environment using a hydrologic model, HECRAS. Vulnerability is assessed through aggregation of various social dimensions, i. e., coping and adaptive capacities, and susceptibility. We assess vulnerability for both baseline and improved scenarios. In the baseline scenario, current early warning for study area is considered. In the alternative scenario, the warning system is expected to improve. Aggregating hazard, exposure and vulnerability, risk maps (in terms of both tangible and intangible costs) of several return period floods are produced for both baseline and improved scenarios. Compared to traditional assessments, the integrated assessment approach used in this study generates more information about the flood risk. Consequently, the results are useful in evaluating policy alternatives and minimizing property loss in the study area...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: This study adopts an {{interdisciplinary}} approach in conducting the&# 13; study on curiosity with a toolset of experimental economics. Approach: I hypothesized that the&# 13; Decision Makers (DMs) tended to exhibit curiosity behavior when two conditions were met: (1) The&# 13; DMs faced small feedback-based decision problems; (2) The DMs bore <b>tangible</b> <b>costs</b> of their&# 13; curiosity behavior. Results: This {{study was the}} first to address the phenomenon of curiosity, using an&# 13; economics experiment, where the DMs received financial performance-based incentives (i. e., monetary&# 13; payoffs that were contingent on their performance in the experiment). Economics studies the cost and&# 13; benefit of any action made by the DMs, whereas psychologists do not. A key feature of the current&# 13; experiment was that the DMs faced 100 -fold binary choice between two alternatives, both of which&# 13; yielded fixed payoffs. Conclusion/Recommendations: Experimental results were interpreted as a&# 13; confirmation of the hypothesis that curiosity was aroused when the aforementioned two conditions&# 13; were met...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of large and multinational organizations are moving to shared services models in delivering the human resource function. It is commonly believed that the adoption of an HR shared services model can transform the role of HR by enabling the HR function to be more strategic at the corporate level and more cost-effective at the operational level. However, few academic studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate challenges to implementing an HR services center successfully and the impact of adopting an HR shared services model on different groups of employees. Through a case study of a multinational corporation, this article reveals that there remains a significant gap between literature espousing the efficacy and utility of HR shared services {{and the extent to which}} the adoption of such a model is successful.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of a sunk cost effect in the decision making processes of the Major League Baseball clubs’ management. This study builds on previous research, which points to an influence of these prior investment costs on decisions in the National Basketball Association. Since in a drafting system team franchises only can make a one player selection per round, the draft order represents a <b>tangible</b> <b>cost</b> to teams both in opportunities forgone and the financial investment of salary contracts. If a sunk cost effect is present, then a franchise will keep a player regardless of the player's performance because of the prior investment made in the player. Using OLS, Logit, and survival analysis models, 7681 players were analyzed over 20 draft years, 1985 - 2005. Findings showed that a player’s overall draft pick had a significant effect on games played and number of at bats. The higher (lower numerically) a player was drafted; the greater was the probability that the player would reach the Major Leagues. Additionally, survival analysis results showed that low draft picks made it to the Major League teams quicker...|$|R

40|$|More {{than half}} of Americans suffer from one or more chronic diseases. Each year {{millions}} of people are diagnosed with chronic disease, and millions more die from their condition.

This failure to contain the containable is undermining prospects for extending health insurance coverage and for coping with the medical costs of an aging population.

Of course, the personal and financial consequences of avoidable illness are greatest for those who become ill and their families.

40|$|When people speak, {{they often}} insinuate their intent {{indirectly}} rather than stating it as a bald proposition. Examples include sexual come-ons, veiled threats, polite requests, and concealed bribes. We propose a three-part theory of indirect speech, {{based on the}} idea that human communication involves a mixture of cooperation and conflict. First, indirect requests allow for plausible deniability, in which a cooperative listener can accept the request, but an uncooperative one cannot react adversarially to it. This intuition is supported by a game-theoretic model that predicts the costs and benefits to a speaker of direct and indirect requests. Second, language has two functions: to convey information and to negotiate the type of relationship holding between speaker and hearer (in particular, dominance, communality, or reciprocity). The emotional costs of a mismatch in the assumed relationship type can create a need for plausible deniability and, thereby, select for indirectness even when there are no <b>tangible</b> <b>costs.</b> Third, people perceive language as a digital medium, which allows a sentence to generate common knowledge, to propagate a message with high fidelity, and to serve as a reference point in coordination games. This feature makes an indirect request qualitatively different from a direct one even when the speaker and listener can infer each other's intentions with high confidence...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{summarize}} {{results of}} studies that estimate the social costs of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug abuse in Russia. The purpose of these studies was to inform policymakers about the real economic burden of risky behaviors and to provide conditions for evidence-based and well-informed decision making in this area. MethodsThe cost-of-illness method was applied to estimate the social cost of substance abuse. The intangible cost {{was not included in}} estimation. A prevalence-based approach was applied to estimate the <b>tangible</b> <b>cost.</b> For the estimation of direct costs, a top-down method was used. Indirect costs were estimated using two methods: the human capital and the friction cost. ResultsIn 2008, the social cost of substance abuse in Russia comprised 677. 2 billion rubles if the friction cost method is applied and 1965. 9 billion rubles if the human capital method is used. The social cost of substance abuse is defined to the greatest extent by alcohol consumption, comprising about 45 % of the economic burden. Illicit drug use comprises about 30 % of the economic burden and tobacco consumption 25 %. ConclusionsThe results of economic studies demonstrated that psychoactive substances impose a considerable economic burden on society. Analysis of the substance abuse social cost pattern shows that the main losses that society bears because of these behavioral risk factors fall outside the health care system and lay in other sectors of the economy such as social care, law enforcement, and productivity losses...|$|R
