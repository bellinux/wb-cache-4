Tamil Student Associations at the University of Toronto and Ryerson University staged demonstrations on campus to promote awareness of the ethnic conflict to fellow students.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} going to feature online elements, offered through Square's PlayOnline service. The features, however, were dropped during production, and online gaming would not {{become part of}} the Final Fantasy series until Final Fantasy XI. Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional Final Fantasy game, in line with the realism of the game's 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds. As a player of the games in the Final Fantasy series, battle director Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the Active Time Battle system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused Conditional Turn-Based Battle system. Originally, Final Fantasy X was going to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters. Battle art director Shintaro Takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in Final Fantasy X come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element. However, due to hardware limitations, this idea was not used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> {{at the end of an}} event scene. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game. Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such that they will be able to observe the development of those attributes firsthand. The developers experienced difficulty with the scene of Tidus and Yuna kissing, as they were not used to animating romance scenes. Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori stated that this was due to the use of 3D models in the scene. Because of the negative response from female members of staff, the scene was remade multiple times.|$|E

25|$|McKittrick {{remained}} at large for several months, but was finally arrested in Dallas on September 21, 1973, after attempting to cash a forged payroll check at a drive-in bank. Under questioning, she corroborated Vandiver's story, and also told Carpenter and Gamino {{that she had}} met Ash Robinson while she was staying with Lilla Paulus in 1972. McKittrick claimed that Robinson had {{said he would do}} anything to get custody of his grandson, but that the only way <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> was if Hill was dead. She said that Robinson and Paulus had met frequently at Ben Taub Hospital, where money was handed over, and that Robinson had also visited Paulus at her home, where he gave her plans of Hill's home and $7,000 {{on the day of the}} shooting. McKittrick was scheduled to be tried in 1974, alongside Paulus. However, Paulus's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, argued for Vandiver's evidence to be dismissed under the Sixth Amendment, which gives a defendant the right to confront their accuser; the request was granted. DeGuerin also asked for McKittrick's evidence against Paulus to be ruled as inadmissible. But although this request was also granted, presiding Judge Price ruled that McKittrick's evidence could be used in the state's case against her. McKittrick's attorney, John Caperton, then sought consensus for her to enter a not guilty plea, but accept a guilty verdict, something to which Bennett agreed. McKittrick was convicted of being Vandiver's getaway driver and given a ten-year jail sentence. She was paroled after serving five years.|$|E

This was wrought by the debut of the United Kingdom's new dreadnought concept, which was represented by the surprisingly fast construction and commissioning of the eponymous ship in 1906. The hallmark of this new warship type was its [...] "all-big-gun" [...] armament, which utilized many more heavy-caliber weapons than previous battleships, and it rendered the Brazilian ships obsolete before they were completed.|$|E

In an interview with IGN, Clive Russell stated he was hopeful {{to return to the}} role saying [...] "I'd hoped that he'd come back because he comes back in the books again. But they're not doing the books -- there is no book to do it from.

Soderbergh was not interested in depicting Guevara's personal life because he felt that [...] "everybody on these campaigns has a personal life, they all left families behind, that doesn't make him special and why should I go into his personal life and nobody else's?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Mindy Kaling, her eighteenth writing credit for the series. Rainn Wilson, who portrays Dwight Schrute on the series, directed the episode, his second directing credit of the series after the sixth-season episode [...] "The Cover-Up". The episode {{was also the first}} of several season seven episodes that saw the return of Amy Ryan as Holly. Kaling purposely made Dwight [...] "complicated" [...] and [...] "mean" [...] in the script; she wanted to avoid a situation wherein Jim and Dwight become best friends, calling it something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> in a [...] "crappy sitcom feel-good formula." [...] She wanted to stress the fact that [...] "Jim [...] are not friends." [...] Kaling specifically wrote Jim to be [...] "off-guard [...] surprised" [...] in the episode, because she reasoned that [...] "perfect isn't always nearly as fun to play or watch as flawed." [...] The episode was filmed in early November and was shot out of order. This required the assistant directors of The Office to re-dress [...] "the sets from white, spare 'classy Christmas' look to the elaborate, colorful 'regular Christmas look.|$|E

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E
500|$|When Jason Takes Manhattan {{failed to}} perform {{successfully}} {{at the box}} office, Sean Cunningham decided {{that he wanted to}} reacquire the rights to Friday the 13th and start working with New Line Cinema on Freddy vs. Jason, as New Line owned the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The concept of a fight between Freddy and Jason was not new, since Paramount had approached New Line about filming a crossover years before the latter had gained the licensing rights to Friday the 13th. At that time, both companies wanted the license to the other's character so that they could control the making of the film. Negotiations on the project were never finalized, which led Paramount to make The New Blood. After Jason Takes Manhattan was released in 1989, the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto, who sold them to New Line. Before Cunningham could start working on Freddy vs. Jason, Wes Craven returned to New Line to make New Nightmare. This effectively put Freddy vs. Jason on hold, but allowed Cunningham the chance to bring Jason back into the spotlight with Jason Goes to Hell. The ninth installment [...] "turned a healthy profit", though it was only intended to open the door for a crossover with Freddy Krueger rather than to start a new series for New Line. Ultimately, the film series would go through another sequel before <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> Cunningham's [...] "frustration" [...] with the delayed development of the Freddy vs. Jason project forced him to create another sequel {{in an effort to keep}} the franchise in the minds of audiences. Based on Jason Takes Manhattans concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the 10th film would put the titular character in space. The film suffered from the loss of its biggest supporter, President of Production Michael De Luca, when he resigned from his position. Lack of support forced the finished film to sit for two years before finally being released on April 26, 2002, and it would go on to become the lowest-grossing film in the franchise at the domestic box office. It also held the distinction of having the largest budget of any of the previous films at that time.|$|E

According to the official Navy Department Library website, [...] "The 36-day (Iwo Jima) assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead" [...] with 19,217 wounded. To put this into context, the 82-day Battle of Okinawa lasted from early April until mid-June 1945 and U.S. casualties (out of five Army and two Marine divisions) were above 62,000, of which more than 12,000 were killed or missing.|$|E
