5|$|The {{withdrawal}} plan formulated by General Phạm Văn Phú and his General Staff {{was made with}} the belief that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would stop and consolidate their territorial gains before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on the attack again. However, during the spring offensive of 1975, North Vietnamese commanders were more than willing to maneuver their units away from newly captured territories, in order to pursue retreating South Vietnamese units.|$|E
5|$|One night {{towards the}} end of 1942, Gröning and his comrades in their SS barracks on the {{outskirts}} of Birkenau were awakened by an alarm. They were told that a number of Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught and shot. The SS men told Gröning and his comrades that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> home but they decided to hang around {{in the shadows of the}} woods.|$|E

25|$|The {{tracks were}} made of {{concrete}} and fiberglass, which led to numerous serious abrasions on riders who took even mild spills. The tendency of some to ride in bathing suits so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on to Waterworld attractions afterward made this problem worse.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{children}} were not raised directly by their parents, they knew who their parents were and formed close bonds with them.

25|$|After Arnhem 1st Airborne Division and 16 PFA were reformed, now {{commanded}} by Lieutenant-Colonel N.J.P Hewlings.

The 16 PFA landed at Oslo on 10 May 1945, their role was the medical screening of {{the large numbers of}} Russian prisoners of war and assist in the evacuation of the German Army. By the end of June 1945 the 1st Airborne Division was withdrawn back to England and in October, 16 PFA was disbanded.|$|E
25|$|The staff's {{indifference}} {{to many of}} the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders. A state official lamented that many water-slide accidents were due to guests who, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would often discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> down together.|$|E

25|$|As {{soon as the}} Angevin host {{left the}} city the queen's army attacked. They pressed past the rearguard to attack the main body. The advance guard avoided the trap and {{delivered}} Empress Matilda safely to Gloucester, but the queen's army destroyed the Angevin main body as an effective fighting force; only remnants managed to escape. Robert of Gloucester's soldiers held together, but when his soldiers reached the Test <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> no further. Surrounded by {{a part of the}} queen's troops under William of Surrey and facing a bridge choked with panicked Angevins, Robert surrendered with his men.|$|E
25|$|Schmid and {{his friends}} took Rowe to the desert, where Schmid and Saunders murdered her. Before murdering Alleen, Schmid told Saunders to rape her, but he couldn't do it, because Saunders was gay. While the murder occurred, Mary French {{was waiting in the}} car and {{listening}} to the radio. Afterwards the three buried her. When Alleen went missing, her father told her mother he felt she had been murdered and left in the desert. The mother, Norma Rowe, went to the police and was told that she needed more evidence before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> looking in the desert.|$|E
25|$|Filet-O-Fish – a {{fish fillet}} with tartar sauce {{and a half}} slice of cheese, on a steamed bun. It was {{introduced}} in Cincinnati in 1962 when {{it was discovered that}} many Roman Catholics chose to eat at Frisch's Big Boy on Fridays and during Lent, as it offered a fish sandwich so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> without meat. This was replaced with the Fish Filet Deluxe in 1996 and brought back in 1998 albeit a larger fish patty. During the Easter period in Hawaii and Guam, a Double Filet-O-Fish meal is offered with two pieces of fish on one bun.|$|E

25|$|The {{thalidomide}} tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill {{to enhance}} drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth {{had to prove}} to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.|$|E
25|$|Square dancers {{dance to}} a variety of music, mostly Chinese popular songs, both {{contemporary}} and historic. The hobby began in the mid-1990s, as middle-aged women who had been forced into retirement began doing it to keep themselves occupied. Its popularity notwithstanding, square dancing {{has been the subject of}} considerable controversy in the 2010s China due to complaints of noise pollution in the evening or morning hours. Dancers in China's increasingly populous cities congregate in public areas because there are few dedicated facilities where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go.</b> Residents of nearby apartment complexes who have been disturbed by the high volume of multiple dance groups' musical accompaniment, especially late in the evening and early in the morning when they are trying to sleep, have sometimes reacted violently.|$|E
25|$|The first Test {{match was}} {{played at the}} Adelaide Oval from 10 December to 14 December. Australia won the toss (cricket) and elected to bat first. Australia were reduced to 4–52 in the first session before Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting scored {{hundreds}} to take them near 300. Shane Warne scored 86 low down the order to take Australia to 441. India started their second innings on the second day, but lost both openers quickly and were reduced to 2–9. Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman did well to steady the innings, but both were dismissed before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on to big scores. Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly were both unbeaten on 12 as India ended the second day at 4–123. On the third day, Tendulkar and Ganguly went on to score fifties, but the lower order failed to put up serious resistance, and India were bowled out for 285.|$|E

25|$|On September 13, the Athenians left camp {{leaving their}} wounded behind and their dead unburied. The survivors, {{including}} all the non-combatants, numbered 40,000, {{and some of the}} wounded crawled after them as far as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go.</b> As they marched they defeated a small Syracusan force guarding the river Anapus, but other Syracusan cavalry and light troops continually harassed them. Near the Erineus river, Demosthenes and Nicias became separated, and Demosthenes was attacked by the Syracusans and forced to surrender his 6,000 troops. The rest of the Syracusans followed Nicias to the Assinarus river, where Nicias's troops became disorganized in the rush to find drinking water. Many Athenians were trampled to death and others were killed while fighting with fellow Athenians. On {{the other side of the}} river a Syracusan force was waiting, and the Athenians were almost completely massacred, by far the worst defeat of the entire expedition in terms of lives lost. Nicias personally surrendered to Gylippus, hoping the Spartan would remember his role in the peace treaty of 421. The few who escaped found refuge in Catana.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen cycling was {{reported}} at the 31st annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. About {{a third of the}} 66 participants - women with metastatic breast cancer that had developed resistance to standard estrogen-lowering therapy - a daily dose of estrogen could stop the growth of their tumors or even cause them to shrink. If study participants experienced disease progression on estrogen, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back to an aromatase inhibitor that they were previously resistant to and see a benefit - their tumors were once again inhibited by estrogen deprivation. That effect sometimes wore off after several months, but then the tumors might again be sensitive to estrogen therapy. In fact, some patients have cycled back and forth between estrogen and an aromatase inhibitor for several years. PET (positron emission tomography) scans before starting estrogen and again 24 hours later predicted those tumors which responded to estrogen therapy: the responsive tumors showed an increased glucose uptake, called a PET flare. The mechanism of action is uncertain, although estrogen reduces the amount of a tumor-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1).|$|E
25|$|Horses were {{central to}} Cuman culture {{and way of}} life, and their main {{activity}} was animal husbandry. The knight, Robert de Clari, described the Cumans as nomadic warriors who raised horses, sheep, goats, camels, and cattle. They moved north with their herds in summer and returned south in winter. Some of the Cumans led a semi-settled life and took part in trading and farming, as well as blacksmithing, furriery, shoe making, saddle making, bow making, and clothes making. They mainly sold and exported animals, mostly horses, and animal products. They attached feeding sacks to the bridles of their horses, allowing them to cover great distances. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on campaign with little baggage and carry everything they needed. They wore sheepskin and were armed with composite bows and arrows. They prayed to the first animal they saw in the morning. Like the Bulgars, the Cumans were known to drink blood from their horse (they would cut a vein) when {{they ran out of}} water far from an available source. Their traditional diet consisted of soup with millet and meat and included beer, curdled mare's milk, kumis, and bread (though bread could be rare depending on location).|$|E
60|$|Some of the Mangaboos {{discovered}} them {{as soon as}} {{they left}} the House of the Sorcerer; but when they started toward the mountain the vegetable people allowed them to proceed without interference, yet followed in a crowd behind them so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> back again.|$|R
