5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, <b>trammel</b> <b>nets,</b> and bottom longlines; it has little economic value and is mostly discarded at sea when captured. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough population and fishery data to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. At least in the northern Mediterranean, surveys have found that it remains the most common {{electric ray}}, and is perhaps becoming more abundant in Italian waters. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in acetylcholine receptors, which {{play an important role}} in the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} 19th and early 20th centuries {{indicate}} that the angelshark was once abundant all around the coasts of Western Europe. Yarrell (1836), Day (1880–04), and Garstang (1903) all noted that the angelshark was common around the British Isles, and Rey (1928) recorded that this species was common around the Iberian Peninsula and in the Mediterranean. However, from {{the latter half of}} the 20th century onwards, the angelshark has come under intense pressure from commercial fisheries operating across much of its range. Due to its benthic, near-shore habits, individuals of all ages are susceptible to incidental capture by bottom trawls, <b>trammel</b> <b>nets,</b> and bottom longlines; the low reproductive rate of this shark limits its capacity to withstand population depletion.|$|E
25|$|Large {{numbers of}} pale-edged {{stingrays}} are caught incidentally in bottom trawls and <b>trammel</b> <b>nets,</b> {{particularly in the}} Gulf of Thailand, the Java Sea, and off the Indian coast. Most individuals landed are retained for human consumption, although {{the small size of}} this species limits its economic significance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pale-edged stingray as Near Threatened and notes that it is approaching the criteria for Vulnerable. Across most of its range, this species experiences heavy and increasing fishing pressure, with all size classes susceptible to capture.|$|E

500|$|S.latus is edible, {{but it is}} a {{relatively}} rare species, and is therefore of little interest to fisheries. However, it is caught in small numbers throughout its distribution, mostly in <b>trammel</b> <b>nets,</b> by trawling and in lobster pots. An annual catch of [...] has been reported for Israel. Catching by hand has become increasingly frequent, since the advent of SCUBA diving made the animal's habitat more accessible to humans. This may have affected population sizes of S.latus in some areas.|$|E
500|$|In his {{original}} description, John Witt Randall {{noted that the}} California spiny lobster is [...] "used as food by the natives" [...] of Upper California. The California spiny lobster is now the most economically important lobster on the American West Coast. Sport fishing may account for up to half the entire catch, {{while most of the}} commercial catch comes from lobster traps, with smaller amounts coming from the use of <b>trammel</b> <b>nets</b> or by trawling. The major fishing area is west of Baja California, and imports from Mexico to the United States are twice the amount produced in California.|$|E
500|$|Common {{stingrays}} {{are caught}} incidentally by commercial fisheries across {{many parts of}} its range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, bottom longlines, beach seines, and <b>trammel</b> <b>nets.</b> Because of its inshore habitat preferences, this ray is more susceptible to small-scale coastal fisheries than to industrial operations, {{such as in the}} Balearic Islands, where it makes up 40% of the shark and ray trammel net catch. Surveys indicate that common stingrays have declined in the Mediterranean and the northeastern Atlantic, and may have been extirpated from the Bay of Biscay. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened in those two regions, while the species as a whole is listed under Data Deficient. The common stingray is protected within five marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Balearic Islands, and also benefits from a European Union ban on the use of trawls within [...] of the coast.|$|E

40|$|The project WAKO {{wants to}} give a first attempt to map the current {{knowledge}} and the knowledge gaps {{on the effects of}} <b>trammel</b> <b>net</b> and beam trawl fisheries for the Belgian part of the North Sea. The project focuses on three ecosystem components, i. e. benthic invertebrates, sea birds and marine mammals. The aim of this project consists of three phases: (1) compilation and analysis of existing, experimental data for the Belgian part of the North Sea on the effects of <b>trammel</b> <b>net</b> and beam trawl fisheries; (2) current knowledge on the impact of beam trawl and trammel/gill net fisheries, based on literature review and (3) evaluation of the direct effects of beam trawl and trammel/gill net fisheries on three ecosystem components, knowledge gaps and investigation of an appropriate methodology to evaluate the environmental impact of fishing gears. WAKO indicates that direct, short-term effects of <b>trammel</b> <b>net</b> and beam trawl fisheries are clearly directed to different ecosystem components. Similarities between analogous, scientific studies allow a first evaluation of the effects, but quantitative data (on both biological impact data and data related to fishing effort and distribution) are so far insufficient to allow the development of a decision support tool for environmental and fisheries management...|$|R
