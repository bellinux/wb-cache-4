5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus <b>that</b> <b>supports</b> <b>the</b> ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E

It was released for the Xbox 360 video game console in March 2010, through the Xbox Live Arcade download service.

5|$|A {{remake of}} Conker's Bad Fur Day, titled , was {{ultimately}} released for the Xbox in 2005 to generally favourable critical reception. Developers {{noted that it}} was difficult to port the game to the Xbox system because Bad Fur Days microcoded performance optimisations had been deeply customised for the Nintendo 64 hardware. Conker: Live & Reloaded features updated graphics and a multiplayer mode <b>that</b> <b>supports</b> <b>the</b> Xbox Live service. Additionally, some aspects in the single-player mode were adjusted: several minor obscenities within the voice dialogue that are present in the Nintendo 64 game were censored at Microsoft's request, the camera control was refined and improved with a zoom function, and an auto-targeting system was added to the game.|$|E

5|$|As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in {{the core}} of a main-sequence star, the {{reduction}} in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. Since it is the outflow of fusion-supplied energy <b>that</b> <b>supports</b> <b>the</b> higher layers of the star, the core is compressed, producing higher temperatures and pressures. Both factors increase the rate of fusion thus moving the equilibrium towards a smaller, denser, hotter core producing more energy whose increased outflow pushes the higher layers further out. Thus there is a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time. For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70% of its current value. As a star ages this luminosity increase changes its position on the HR diagram. This effect results in a broadening of the main sequence band because stars are observed at random stages in their lifetime. That is, the main sequence band develops a thickness on the HR diagram; it is not simply a narrow line.|$|E
5|$|Hands Across Hawthorne was a rally {{held at the}} Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011. The {{demonstration}} was {{in response}} to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been holding hands while walking across the bridge. According to the couple and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, a nonprofit organization <b>that</b> <b>supports</b> <b>the</b> LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area.|$|E

In 2008, Coulter became the face of Jeans for Genes Day in Australia, a charity fundraising event organised by the Children's Medical Research Institute which sponsors investigation into childhood genetic diseases. Coulter has supported the charity since she was in high school. She raised $100,000 for the campaign, including profits made from her nude photo shoot with Cleo magazine. Alongside recording artist Marcia Hines, Coulter became {{a spokeswoman for the}} annual Australian red ribbon appeal in November 2011, raising money in the fight against HIV and AIDS, and helping people with HIV. A month later, on 19 December 2011, she performed at the Pitt Street Mall in Sydney, as part of the Optus Celebrity Carols initiative to raise money for The Smith Family, a charity benefiting disadvantaged children and their families. In 2015, Coulter became {{an ambassador}} for McHappy Day again.|$|E

5|$|Stars {{far more}} massive than the sun evolve in more complex ways. In {{the core of}} the star, {{hydrogen}} is fused into helium, releasing thermal energy that heats the sun's core and provides outward pressure <b>that</b> <b>supports</b> <b>the</b> sun's layers against collapse in a process known as stellar or hydrostatic equilibrium. The helium produced in the core accumulates there since temperatures in the core are not yet high enough to cause it to fuse. Eventually, as the hydrogen at the core is exhausted, fusion starts to slow down, and gravity causes the core to contract. This contraction raises the temperature high enough to initiate a shorter phase of helium fusion, which accounts for less than 10% of the star's total lifetime. In stars with fewer than eight solar masses, the carbon produced by helium fusion does not fuse, and the star gradually cools to become a white dwarf. White dwarf stars, if they have a near companion, may then become Type Ia supernovae.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{election}} since the Act on a Candidate's Election Funding came into force in May 2009, along with the 2010 amendments to the Act on Political Parties. Both laws mandate the disclosure {{of the sources of}} campaign finance and expenses. Every candidate and party as a whole must disclose their source of funding. Campaign funding may start six months before the election day and end two weeks after the election regardless of when the costs are actually paid. The candidates must file a public report with the National Audit Office detailing their sources of all contributions of over €1,500 in value raised in support of the election campaign. The funds include expenses from the candidate's own assets, loans taken out for the campaign, and contributions received by either the individual or by a group <b>that</b> <b>supports</b> <b>the</b> candidate.
