5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, {{but there was still}} a shift of about 2metres. This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary <b>trim</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Scylla was a {{land-based}} {{development of}} the Short Kent (S.17) flying boat, essentially using the Kent's aerostructure above a redesigned fuselage. It was an all-metal biplane (wingspan of 113ft, 34,44 m) powered originally by four Bristol Jupiter XFBM radial engines mounted on vertical struts between {{the upper and lower}} planes. The square-section braced-framed fuselage was below the lower wing; the tail had a single vertical stabilizer and a horizontal stabilizer at about one quarter height. The Scylla was originally fitted with a Flettner-type servo tab <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> to ease the forces on the rudder controls. An experimental servo tab on the rudder was tested on G-ACJJ Scylla for a time. Experience gained with the latter possibly contributed to a later patent application submitted jointly by Shorts and Dudley Lloyd Parkes on 7 August 1936.|$|E

50|$|Beginning with {{model year}} 1987, all trim levels were also {{available}} in a long wheelbase variant, marketed as the Grand Caravan, which allowed more cargo space behind the rear seat. Interior <b>trim,</b> <b>controls,</b> and instrumentation were borrowed from the Chrysler K platform, and coupled with the lower floor enabled by the front-wheel-drive, the Caravan featured car-like ease of entry. There were three trim levels: base, SE, and LE.|$|R
40|$|Restructured, pre-cooked roasts were {{prepared}} from four hot-boned USDA Utility grade cow carcasses. Before forming the roasts, meat was either blade tenderized, manually trimmed of large connective tissue deposits, or both blade tenderized and <b>trimmed.</b> <b>Control</b> roasts received neither treatment.

5000|$|Elevator trim frees {{the pilot}} from exerting {{constant}} {{pressure on the}} pitch controls. Instead, the pilot adjusts a longitudinal <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> (often {{in the form of}} a wheel) to cancel out control forces for a given airspeed / weight distribution. Typically, when this <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> (wheel or lever) is rotated or moved forward, the nose is held down; conversely, if the <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> is moved back, the tail becomes [...] "heavy". Many newer aircraft, especially jet aircraft, have electric trim controls.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 1987, {{improperly}} assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the low-pressure turbine disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but <b>trim</b> tabs to <b>control</b> the crippled aircraft, but on the final approach, the <b>trim</b> <b>controlling</b> links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft.

25|$|Chief Designer James C. Floyd {{was upset}} by these developments, {{but in the}} end found a number of {{advantages}} to the four-engine layout. The main advantage was that in an engine-out situation, the aircraft would lose only a quarter of its thrust, rather than half, which made power tolerances easier to meet. In particular, the asymmetry in thrust originally called for a powered rudder to correct for yaw {{in the case of an}} engine failure, but with four engines it was found yaw was so small it could be corrected easily with just the manual <b>trim</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both {{elevator}} trim and pitch trim affect the small trimming {{part of the}} elevator on jet airliners. The former {{is supposed to be}} set in a certain position for a longer time, while the pitch <b>trim</b> (<b>controlled</b> with the landing pilot's thumb on the yoke or joystick, and is thereby easy to maneuver) is used all the time after the flying pilot has disabled the autopilot, especially after each time the flaps are lowered or at every change in the airspeed, at the descent, approach and final. Elevator trim is most used for controlling the attitude at cruising by the autopilot.|$|R
