5|$|According to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an {{important}} influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of David Hilbert. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. This phase {{marks the beginning of}} her engagement with abstract algebra, the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> De Administrando Imperio {{written by}} the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Croats had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7thcentury; however, that claim is disputed and {{competing}} hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. Eventually two dukedoms were formed—Duchy of Pannonia and Duchy of Croatia, ruled by Liudewit and Borna, as attested by chronicles of Einhard starting in 818. The record represents the first document of Croatian realms, vassal states of Francia at the time.|$|E

50|$|During the 19th century, {{the term}} 'rigorous' {{began to be}} used to {{describe}} decreasing levels of abstraction when dealing with calculus which eventually became known as analysis. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> of Cauchy added rigour <b>to</b> <b>the</b> older <b>works</b> of Euler and Gauss. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> of Riemann added rigour <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> of Cauchy. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> of Weierstrass added rigour <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> of Riemann, eventually culminating in the arithmetization of analysis.

5|$|After traffic issues {{during the}} 2008 {{reconstruction}} {{work on the}} Wheeling Tunnel, local politicians suggested closing the twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over Wheeling Hill instead. After opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which represented the affected Wheeling Hill residents, the suggestions were dropped. The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost of the tunnel reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7million, due in part <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> delays.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} {{mainline}} Protestant churches, the Presbyterian Church in the USA was {{a founding member}} of the Federal Council of Churches (a predecessor to the National Council of Churches) in 1908.

5|$|Haley's {{contribution}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> is notable, {{and several}} scholars discuss {{how it should}} be characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.|$|E

5|$|Motte was a London {{publisher}} {{who took}} over Benjamin Tooke's publishing business, which printed many of Swift's earlier works. In 1726, Swift sent Motte a copy of Gulliver's Travels to be printed anonymously.

In 1727, Motte formed his first direct contract with Swift in order to publish Swift's Miscellanies.
