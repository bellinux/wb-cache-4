He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men.

No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory may be explained by <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign. Karmal became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s, electing Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership.|$|E

5|$|It is {{generally}} accepted by historians that Andrianjaka did indeed succeed {{to the throne}} around 1610 or 1612 after his older brother's claim {{was rejected by the}} public. All speculation about fanorona and royal summons aside, Ralambo may have chosen Andrianjaka based on <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{he was the son of}} Ralambo's first wife. Ralambo's father, Andriamanelo, had established rules of succession by which Ralambo's first son by his first wife must rule after his father in order to fulfill a mandate established by his Vazimba antecedents Rafohy and Rangita. The passing over of Andriantompokoindrindra in favor of his younger brother was partially mitigated by the establishment of a royal tradition maintaining that all reigning descendants of Andrianjaka would henceforth be required to marry a princess directly descended from Andriantompokoindrindra, thereby preserving the royal status of descendants in both brothers' bloodlines.|$|E
5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E

25|$|England's group {{games in}} the World Cup 2011 were watched by up to four million viewers on German television, but less than a million on BBC, which means even with no German involvement, England games are at this point more popular in Germany than in the country the England team {{actually}} represents.

School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace.

The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.|$|E
25|$|Key to {{the rituals}} {{associated}} with the Grito is the gift, given by Chilean writer Gabriela Mistral to Albizu's family, of a tamarind tree obtained from Simón Bolívar's estate in Venezuela. The tree was planted at the Plaza de la Revolución with soil taken from the eighteen other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Albizu meant to give the Plaza a living symbol of solidarity with the struggle for freedom and independence initiated by Bolivar (who, while visiting Vieques, promised to assist the Puerto Rico independence movement, but whose promise never materialized due to <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> most Puerto Ricans {{did not want the}} island's independence from Spain), as well {{as a symbol of the}} bittersweet (as the trees' fruit) hardships needed to reach Puerto Rico's independence.

40|$|The Multi-spectral Thermal Imager (MTI) is a {{high-performance}} remote-sensing satellite designed, {{owned and operated}} by the U. S. Department of Energy, with a dual mission in environmental studies and in nonproliferation. It has enhanced spatial and radiometric resolutions and state-of-the-art calibration capabilities. This instrumental development puts a new burden on retrieval algorithm developers to pass this accuracy on to the inferred geophysical parameters. In particular, the atmospheric correction scheme assumes the intervening atmosphere will be modeled as a plane-parallel horizontally-homogeneous medium. A single dense-enough cloud in view of the ground target can easily offset reality from the calculations, hence the need for a reliable cloud-masking algorithm. Pixel-scale cloud detection relies on <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> clouds are generally whiter, brighter, and colder than the ground below; spatially, dense clouds are generally large on some scale. This is a good basis for searching multispectral datacubes for cloud signatures. However, the resulting cloud mask can be very sensitive to the choice of thresholds in whiteness, brightness, temperature, and connectivity. We have used a genetic algorithm trained on (MODIS Airborne Simulator-based) simulated MTI data to design a cloud-mask. Its performance is compared quantitatively to hand-drawn training data and to the EOS/Terra MODIS cloud mask...|$|R
