Bryan was defeated in the election by former Ohio governor William McKinley, and in 1900, Congress passed <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Standard</b> Act, placing that standard into law. <b>The</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> was departed from for many purposes by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal administration, and completely ended by President Richard Nixon in 1971.|$|E
5|$|American negotiators soon {{concluded}} a reciprocity treaty with France, {{and the two}} nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism. The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy, Edward O. Wolcott, {{that he would be}} amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy's Executive Council there agreed. News of a possible departure from <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard.</b> Even without the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law, and was able to sign <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Standard</b> Act on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{declared}} his candidacy {{early for the}} Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged prior to the Republicans' nominating convention. Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention. The major issue of the campaign was whether the country should maintain a monetary system based on <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> or allow the coinage of silver {{at a ratio of}} 16 to 1, commonly called the free silver position. At their convention, the Republicans adopted a platform that was unequivocally in favor of <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies {{gained control}} of the Democratic party in 1896, repudiated his {{administration}} and <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a Silver Platform. Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats' third-party ticket that promised to defend <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> limit government and oppose high tariffs, but he declined their nomination for a third term. The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and William McKinley, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan. Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900.

5|$|For twenty years, Americans {{had been}} bitterly divided over the nation's {{monetary}} standard. <b>The</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> which the United States had effectively been on since 1873, limited {{the money supply}} but eased trade with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that bimetallism (making both gold and silver legal tender) was necessary for the nation's economic health. The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates, and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> against the will of much of his party, activists became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E

5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

40|$|Aim. This paper reports {{findings}} {{from a study}} which investigated the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Standards</b> Framework for improving end-of-life care into care homes in England. Background. <b>The</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Standards</b> Framework was developed in primary care to improve the care provided for people at the end-of-life. Following its successful introduction to this setting it was adapted and implemented in care homes. Design. A case study approach was appropriate for this study of a care programme into a 'real life' setting. Method. Fourteen managers participated in an initial telephone interview. Ten of these homes participated in the case study phase and 61 staff participated in individual or group interviews. Seven residents and three relatives participated in face to face interviews. Qualitative data were analysed {{in line with the}} template approach. Survey data were also analysed and a validated Teamworking Questionnaire was used. Results. It was found that teamwork is central to the successful introduction of <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>Standards</b> Framework in Care Homes. Good staffing levels and management support were also perceived to be key factors in homes where the Framework became established. Conclusion. Effective teamwork was necessary for changes in end-of-life care to be achieved in the care homes. If end-of-life care and other improvements in practice are to continue, teamwork will need to be supported and developed. Relevance to clinical practice. Effective teamwork appears to be a pre-requisite for successful implementation of new programmes of care. Organisations wishing to implement such programmes should assess the quality of teamwork and may need to address this first...|$|R
