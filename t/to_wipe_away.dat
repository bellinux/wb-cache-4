25|$|Some of this {{development}} was also encouraged by Ireland's dominant nationalist ideology of that era, which wanted <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> all physical reminders of Ireland's colonial past. An extreme {{example of this}} kind of thinking was the destruction of Nelson's Pillar in O'Connell Street in 1966. This statue of the famous British admiral was a Dublin landmark for a century, but was blown up by a small bomb shortly before the 50-year commemorations of the Easter Rising. In 2003, the Pillar was replaced as a landmark by the Dublin Spire which was erected on the same spot. A 120 m tall tapered metal pole, it is the tallest structure of Dublin city centre, visible for miles. It was assembled from seven pieces with the largest crane available in Ireland and is the tallest street sculpture in the world.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005 Zimbabwe toured Bangladesh, playing two Tests {{and five}} ODIs. Bangladesh won the Test series one Test to nil, their first series victory in Test cricket. In addition, Bangladesh's {{victory in the}} first Test at the MA Aziz Stadium was their first Test win. In the final innings of the first match, Mortaza took the ninth wicket and with victory {{imminent}} he struggled to bowl the next ball and had <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> tears and regain his composure before starting his run up. Despite a sore {{back in the second}} Test, Mortaza continued to bowl. In the two Tests, Mortaza scored 93runs at an average of 31.00 and took nine wickets at an average of 24.88. In a close ODI series, Bangladesh won 3–2 after being 2–0 down, Mortaza played in four matches and took four wickets at an average of 40.00.|$|E
500|$|Lhermitte {{subsequently}} {{came under}} criticism from historians for {{his failure to}} inflict greater damage on the light force in Algoa Bay: William James described it as [...] "a somewhat discreditable action". Granger was also heavily criticised for his performance in the action on 11 October: William Laird Clowes considered that [...] "No explanation of the Jupiters failure can be given", while James wrote of the action with Jupiter that [...] "Undoubtedly it was a cause of triumph to Captain L'Hermite and well calculated <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> the disgrace incurred by Preneuse at Algoa bay".|$|E

50|$|A heavy 3-0 {{defeat at}} Southampton was to follow before the Canaries chalked up their first win over Man City in nearly 30 years. This came {{courtesy}} of 2 goals {{in as many}} minutes.

[...] He said he was certain from his success in encouraging engraving that Englishmen wanted nothing but proper encouragement and a proper subject to excel in historical painting. [...] The encouragement he would endeavor to find if a proper subject were pointed out. [...] Mr. Nicol replied that there was one great National subject concerning which {{there could be no}} second opinion, and mentioned Shakespeare. [...] The proposition was received with acclaim by the Alderman [...] and the whole company.|$|E
500|$|Gielgud was {{uninterested in}} {{religion}} or politics. As a boy {{he had been}} fascinated by the rituals at Westminster Abbey, but his brief attraction to religion quickly faded, and as an adult he was a non-believer. His indifference to politics was illustrated at a formal dinner {{not long after the}} Second World War when he asked a fellow guest, [...] "Whereabouts are you living now?", unaware that, as he was talking to the prime minister, Clement Attlee, the answer was [...] "10 Downing Street". In his Who's Who entry Gielgud listed his hobbies as music and painting, but his concentration on his work, which Emlyn Williams called fanatical, left little scope for leisure activities. His dedication to his art was not solemn. The critic Nicholas de Jongh wrote that Gielgud's personality was [...] "such infinite, mischievous fun", and Coward's biographer Cole Lesley recalled the pleasure of Gielgud's company, [...] "the words tumbling out of his mouth in an avalanche, frequently having <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> his own tears of laughter at the funniness of the disasters he recounted, disasters always against himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{frequent}} {{target of}} Roller's many articles in , [...] and [...] was the pre-communist historiography, which he accused of falsifying {{the role of}} the working class and of the masses more broadly. He reiterated that pre-communist historians served the [...] "bourgeois-landowning" [...] regimes dominated by [...] "foreign imperialists", who wished the Romanian people to remain ignorant of their history so they could more easily be exploited. The rise of Roller coincided with a concerted effort by the new regime <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> traces of previous writers, so that works by historians including Giurescu, Papacostea and Nicolae Benescu were eliminated from the curriculum, while some historians, such as Gheorghe Brătianu and Ion Nistor died in prison, their works hidden from public view.|$|E

60|$|Hearing this, the big king {{began to}} weep bitterly, and the tear-drops {{ran down his}} face in such a stream that Prince Marvel ordered Nerle <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> them <b>away</b> with his handkerchief, as the thief's hands were tied behind his back.|$|R
2500|$|If God is ever <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> {{the tears}} {{from the face of}} man this age-long wrong [...] must be overthrown. If the mission of Jesus is ever to get the upperhand in human affairs, the social {{revolution}} must come to pass. There is no more good news to the poor unless there is the message and the task to abolish this age-long night of poverty. There is no deliverance for captives unless this social captivity is ended. There is no setting at liberty the people that are bruised unless this age-long bruising machinery is stopped. If we are ever to call the poor and the maimed and the halt to the banquet of creation, the program of the revolution must be inaugurated. The Heavenly Father may know we have need of all these things, and He may have provided for these needs in the limitless resources of nature, but we never can have them for the people except by seeking the kingdom of social justice and human brotherhood — which is the Kingdom of God — which is the social vision of the social revolution.|$|E
2500|$|Mina's father, Egberto, {{enters and}} observes her writing a letter. [...] Already {{suspicious}} {{of what he}} believes {{has been going on}} between Godvino and Mina, he demands to know if she is writing to Godvino. Snatching away the unfinished letter, he reads the words addressed not to Godvino but to Aroldo - [...] "I am no longer worthy of you" [...] - and realizes that he was not mistaken. [...] He begins to demand that Mina keep silent and ensure Aroldo's continued love (Duet: Dite che il fallo a tergere / [...] "You mean that your heart lacks the strength <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> your guilt?") while she further resists. [...] Again, demanding that she obey him, he continues to make his demands: (Duet: Ed io pure in faccia agl'uomini / [...] "And must I smother my rage....Must I conquer my shame?"). [...] Finally, Egberto repeats his demands that she relent: it is his will, it is her duty as a wife, she must stop crying, and no one must suspect anything. She appears to relent (Duet: Or meco venite, il pianto non vale / [...] "Come with me now, weeping will not help you").|$|E
2500|$|... "A terrible cry" [...] heralds the {{entrance}} of Lucky, a silent, baggage-burdened slave with a rope tied around his neck, and Pozzo, his arrogant and imperious master, who holds the other end and stops now to rest. Pozzo barks abusive orders at Lucky, which are always quietly followed, while acting civilly though tersely towards the other two. Pozzo enjoys a selfish snack of chicken and wine, before casting the bones to the ground, which Estragon gleefully claims. Having been in a dumbfounded state of silence ever since the arrival of Pozzo and Lucky, Vladimir finally finds his voice to shout criticisms at Pozzo for his mistreatment of Lucky. Pozzo ignores this and explains his intention to sell Lucky, who begins to cry. Estragon takes pity and tries <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> Lucky's tears, but, as he approaches, Lucky violently kicks him in the shin. Pozzo then rambles nostalgically but vaguely {{about his relationship with}} Lucky over the years, before offering Vladimir and Estragon some compensation for their company. Estragon begins to beg for money when Pozzo instead suggests that Lucky can [...] "dance" [...] and [...] "think" [...] for their entertainment. Lucky's dance, [...] "the Net", is clumsy and shuffling; Lucky's [...] "thinking" [...] is a long-winded and disjointed monologueit is the first and only time that Lucky speaks. The soliloquy begins as a relatively coherent and academic lecture on theology but quickly dissolves into mindless verbosity, escalating in both volume and speed, that agonises the others until Vladimir finally pulls off Lucky's hat, stopping him in mid-sentence. Pozzo then has Lucky pack up his bags, and they hastily leave.|$|E
