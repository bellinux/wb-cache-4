5|$|<b>The</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is {{the region}} {{comprising}} the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. Composed mainly of silicates and metals, {{the objects of}} <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region {{is less than the}} distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This region is also within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In addition, most {{solar panels}} on {{spacecraft}} are also made of high efficient multi-junction photovoltaic cells to derive electricity from sunlight when operating in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> history.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> also {{contains}} near-Earth asteroids, {{many of which}} cross the orbits of the inner planets. Some of them are potentially hazardous objects.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp {{may have}} had a near {{collision}} with Jupiter in early June 2215BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215BC may have been its first passage through <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> {{period of}} giant impacts {{probably}} {{played a role}} in the Earth acquiring its current water content (~6kg) from the early asteroid belt. Water is too volatile to have been present at Earth's formation and must have been subsequently delivered from outer, colder parts of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The water was probably delivered by planetary embryos and small planetesimals thrown out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter. A population of main-belt comets discovered in 2006 has been also suggested as a possible source for Earth's water. In contrast, comets from the Kuiper belt or farther regions delivered not more than about 6% of Earth's water. The panspermia hypothesis holds that life itself may have been deposited on Earth in this way, although this idea is not widely accepted.|$|R
5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner, because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets. It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net {{decrease in the number of}} comets that pass through <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The evolution of the outer Solar System also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Earth and its {{neighbor}} planets may have formed from fragments of planets after collisions with Jupiter destroyed those super-Earths near the Sun. As Jupiter came toward <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> in what theorists call the Grand Tack Hypothesis, gravitational tugs and pulls occurred causing {{a series of}} collisions between the super-Earths as their orbits began to overlap.|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric escape {{is largely}} a thermal process. The {{atmosphere}} a body can retain therefore varies from <b>the</b> warmer <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> to <b>the</b> cooler outer regions. Different bodies in different <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> regions provide analogous or contrasting examples. The atmosphere of Titan is considered analogous to an early, colder Earth; the atmosphere of Pluto is considered analogous to an enormous comet.|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} the flux of gamma-rays {{that result from}} collisions of high energy galactic cosmic rays with the solar atmosphere. An important aspect of our model is the propagation of cosmic rays through the magnetic fields of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems.</b> We use diffusion to model propagation {{down to the bottom}} of the corona. Below the corona we trace particle orbits through the photospheric fields to determine the location of cosmic ray interactions in the solar atmosphere and evolve the resultant cascades. For our nominal choice of parameters, we predict an integrated flux of gamma rays (at 1 AU) of F(E(sub gamma) greater than 100 MeV) approximately = 5 x 10 (exp - 8) /sq cm sec. This can be an order of magnitude above the galactic background and should be observable by the Energetic Gamma Ray experiment telescope (EGRET) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system’s</b> {{biggest and}} most recent known {{collision}} was the Moon-forming giant impact between a large protoplanet and proto-Earth. Not only did it create a disk near Earth that formed the Moon, it also ejected several percent of an Earth mass out of the Earth-Moon system. Here, we argue that numerous kilometer-sized ejecta fragments from that event struck main-belt asteroids at velocities exceeding 10 kilometers per second, enough to heat and degas target rock. Such impacts produce ~ 1000 times more highly heated material by volume than do typical main belt collisions at ~ 5 kilometers per second. By modeling their temporal evolution, and fitting the results to ancient impact heating signatures in stony meteorites, we infer that the Moon formed ~ 4. 47 billion years ago, which is in agreement with previous estimates. I nsights into the last stages of terrestrial planet formation can be gleaned from the abun-dances and chondritic signatures of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) (such as Re, Os...|$|R
5|$|Halley's {{returns to}} <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> have been {{observed}} and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC. Clear records of the comet's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time.

5|$|On July 23, the IAU issued Circular 6187 to {{announce}} the joint discovery of the new comet.

40|$|International audienceThere is {{a long-standing}} debate {{regarding}} {{the origin of}} the terrestrial planets' water as well as the hydrated C-type asteroids. Here we show that <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> water is a simple byproduct of the giant planets' formation. Giant planet cores accrete gas slowly until the conditions are met for a rapid phase of runaway growth. As a gas giant's mass rapidly increases, the orbits of nearby planetesimals are destabilized and gravitationally scattered in all directions. Under the action of aerodynamic gas drag, a fraction of scattered planetesimals are deposited onto stable orbits interior to Jupiter's. This process is effective in populating the outer main belt with C-type asteroids that originated from a broad (5 - 20 AU-wide) region of the disk. As the disk starts to dissipate, scattered planetesimals reach sufficiently eccentric orbits to cross the terrestrial planet region and deliver water to the growing Earth. This mechanism does not depend strongly on the giant planets' orbital migration history and is generic: whenever a giant planet forms it invariably pollutes its inner planetary system with water-rich bodies...|$|R

5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto.

5|$|In {{the outer}} Solar System, comets remain frozen and {{inactive}} and are extremely {{difficult or impossible}} to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have been questioned.

50|$|In <b>the</b> warmer <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> planetesimals {{formed from}} rocks and metals cooked {{billions of years}} ago in the cores of massive stars.These {{elements}} constituted only 0.6% of the material in the solar nebula. That is why the terrestrial planets could not grow very large and could not exert large pull on hydrogen and helium gas. Also, the faster collisions among particles close to the Sun were more destructive on average. Even if the terrestrial planets had had hydrogen and helium, the Sun would have heated the gases and caused them to escape. Hence, solar terrestrial planets such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are dense small worlds composed mostly from 2% of heavier elements contained in the solar nebula.|$|R
40|$|In {{the closing}} {{years of the}} 20 th Century {{humankind}} began its exploration of the planetary <b>systems</b> in the <b>solar</b> neighborhood. Precision radial velocity measurements have now yielded the discovery of over 160 planets.

Gemini and the VLT are building the first generation of high contrast adaptive optics systems, which deliver planet-imaging performance within few Airy rings of the host star. These systems will make the first surveys of the outer regions of <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> by detecting the self-luminous radiation of young planets. These instruments will establish whether Jovian planets form predominantly through 'top-down' (global gravitational instability) or 'bottom-up' (core accretion) processes. The 8 -m 'extreme' AO systems cannot see close enough to the host stars to image Doppler planets, and they cannot reach the relatively distant, young clusters and associations where planets are forming.
