The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> tolerated, with more palatable meals.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> to watch things than to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E
25|$|Several exobiologists have {{suggested}} that a Mars sample return is not necessary at this stage, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> {{to focus more on}} in situ studies on the surface first.

25|$|The {{controversial}} {{surgical procedure}} known as 'debarking' is a veterinary procedure for modifying the voice box {{so that a}} barking dog will make a significantly reduced noise. It is considered a last resort by some owners, on the basis <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> than euthanasia, seizure, or legal problems if the matter has proven incapable of being reliably corrected any other way.|$|E
25|$|This work is chiefly {{remarkable}} {{because in}} some places it seems to recommend parents not to bequeath anything to their children, on the plea <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> {{for the children to}} suffer want in this world than that their parents should be damned in the next (iii. 4). Salvian is very clear on the duty of absolute self-denial in the case of sacred virgins, priests and monks (ii. 8-10).|$|E

ODA leader Pavel Sehnal said that Kulhánek is a right-wing candidate, that was missing in the election. Miloš Zeman stated {{that he does not}} know Kulhánek well but remembers him as a successful manager of Škoda Auto, adding that he does not have a problem with Kulhánek's candidacy because he believes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> to have more candidates.|$|E

25|$|The goal of full {{employment}} was of most importance to Petty, having recognised that labour {{was one of}} the major sources of wealth for individuals and 'the greatest Wealth and Strength of the Kingdom'. In this vein, he extended the cloth-wine argument above, arguing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> to employ men and burn their product or to engage in extravagant public works projects, than to have indolent 'supernumeraries' in an economy – hence his famous example of relocating Stonehenge across the plains of Salisbury.|$|E
25|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that {{for two and a}} half years the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel debated, the House of Shammai asserting that it would have been better for {{humanity}} not to have been created, and the House of Hillel maintaining <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> that humanity was created. They finally took a vote and decided that it would have been better for humanity not to have been created, but now that humanity has been created, let us investigate our past deeds or, as others say, let us examine our future actions.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the main}} users of Kunrei-shiki are native {{speakers}} of Japanese, especially within Japan, and linguists studying Japanese. The main advantage of Kunrei-shiki is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> able to illustrate Japanese grammar, as Hepburn preserves the irregularity of certain conjugations (see table, right). The most serious problem of Hepburn {{in this context}} is that it may change the stem of a verb, which is not reflected in the underlying morphology of the language. One notable introductory textbook for English-speakers, Eleanor Jorden's , uses her JSL romanization, a system strongly influenced by Kunrei-shiki in its adherence to Japanese phonology, but it is adapted to teaching proper pronunciation of Japanese phonemes.|$|E

25|$|Wherein it {{concerns}} states and rulers, Plato has made interesting arguments. For instance he asks which is better—a bad democracy or a country reigned by a tyrant. He argues <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> to be {{ruled by a}} bad tyrant, than by a bad democracy (since here all the people are now responsible for such actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds.) This is emphasised within the Republic as Plato describes the event of mutiny on board a ship. Plato suggests the ship's crew to be {{in line with the}} democratic rule of many and the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant. Plato's description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state and the inherent problems that arise.|$|E
25|$|Various {{cultural}} and social values have historically contributed to gender disparity in education. According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> for the woman {{to stay home and}} learn to tend to her family instead of attending school. To explain the fact that more boys than girls participated in education, Nigerian researcher Obasi identified a host of constraints with 'Nigerian tradition' being named as top of the list. The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a man than a woman, whose place {{is believed to be the}} kitchen. A study by the University of Ibadan linked the imbalance in boys' and girls’ participation in schooling was to the long-held belief in male superiority and female subordination. This situation was further aggravated by patriarchal practices which gave girls no traditional rights to succession. Therefore, the same patriarchal practices encouraged preference to be given to the education of a boy rather than a girl.|$|E
500|$|Knight {{believes}} that Earth's non-human organisms {{have a higher}} overall value than humans and their accomplishments, such as art: [...] "The plays of Shakespeare {{and the work of}} Einstein can't hold a candle to a tiger". He argues that species higher in the food chain are less important than lower species. His ideology is drawn in part from deep ecology, and he sometimes refers to the Earth as Gaia. He notes that human extinction is unavoidable, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> to become extinct soon to avoid causing the extinction of other animals. The potential for evolution of other organisms is also cited as a benefit.|$|E

500|$|The New Age {{is a term}} {{applied to}} a range of spiritual or {{religious}} beliefs and practices that developed in Western nations during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the New Age differ in their emphasis, {{largely as a result of}} its highly eclectic structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of spiritual or Mind, Body, Spirit and rarely use the term [...] "New Age" [...] themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement, although others contest this term and suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> seen as a milieu or zeitgeist.|$|E
500|$|During the 2010 {{closed season}} the {{football}} pitch and hospitality areas were renovated, with a £1 million investment {{being made in}} the playing surface so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> able to tolerate concerts and other events without damage. In October 2010, Manchester City renegotiated the stadium lease, obtaining the naming rights to the stadium in return for agreeing to now pay the City Council an annual fixed sum of [...] £3million where previously it had only paid half of the ticket sales revenue from match attendances exceeding 35,000. This new agreement occurred {{as part of a}} standard five-year review of the original lease and it amounts to an approximate £1million annual increase in council revenues from the stadium.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{portable}} console ports, Patterson stated that [...] "no Game Boy owner should go without this" [...] {{and called the}} Game Gear version [...] "still the best handheld beat-'em up" [...] on the market despite all the content that was not present in {{this version of the}} game. EGM reviewers concurred that the Game Gear version [...] "has eye-popping graphics, and great control - so much so that you won't believe this is a portable," [...] but were less enthusiastic about the Game Boy version. Though they commented <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> than most fighting games for the system, two of their four reviewers felt that it was not worth getting with the game available on much more powerful platforms.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{approval}} of Sinclair's purchase of Allbritton, commissioner Ajit Pai further criticized the FCC's new policies and its endorsement of Sinclair's proposal to shut down stations to comply with them. Describing the three Allbritton stations as being [...] "victims" [...] of the [...] "crackdown" [...] against joint sales agreements, he stated regarding WCIV that [...] "apparently the Commission believes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> for that station {{to go out of}} business than for Howard Stirk Holdings to own the station and participate in a joint sales agreement with Sinclair. I strongly disagree. And so too, I'll bet, would consumers in Charleston." [...] In September 2014, Sinclair backtracked on its original plans, and reached deals to sell WCIV, WCFT and WJSU's license assets to Howard Stirk Holdings for $50,000 each and lease them studio space, pending FCC approval. Unlike Howard Stirk Holdings' other stations, they are operated and programmed independently, and Sinclair did not enter into any agreements to operate the stations on HSH's behalf.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{three out of}} five stars, Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone {{summarized}} that the messages on the album are dour, but complimented Madonna for talking about the then-current situation of the nation. Johny Davis from NME gave the album a rating of seven out of ten, saying that technically the album sounds good, but overall it felt like an unnecessary sequel to Madonna's previous endeavors like Ray of Light and Music. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that American Life is better for what it promises than what it delivers, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> in theory than practice. Kelefa Sanneh from Blender awarded the album three stars out of five. [...] "Just as disjointed as Music and much more severe... Without a compelling back story, her songs seem diminished". Dorian Lynskey from Q magazine also rated it three out of five, stating [...] "'Nothing Fails', the album's centerpiece, {{is as good a}} showstopper as 'Live to Tell'... it's no wonder that a record about feeling confused ends up sounding confused".|$|E
