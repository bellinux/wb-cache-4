And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|In word learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language to <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been argued against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities. Specifically, their meaning is determined by <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are about in the external world. This {{makes it difficult to}} explain how they can play the causal roles that they are supposed to in cognitive processes.|$|E

At the same time, God commanded Moses to impart to the Israelites laws for them to observe in the land that they were about to occupy.|$|E
25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, {{and that would be the}} end of our contribution... They would shout back at us and that would be the end of the story.

25|$|Individualized {{learning}} was also integral to {{his theory of}} child education. He argued that the student combines information he already knows with what is learned, and forms a unique perspective on the newly learned information. Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage a student’s natural curiosity {{and allow them to}} question things.He postulated that successful students were those who were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves, rather than simply accepting what they had heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a child’s curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are curious about.|$|E

25|$|Healthy narcissism {{might exist}} in all individuals. Freud {{said that this}} is an {{original}} state from which the individual develops the love object. He argued that healthy narcissism {{is an essential part of}} normal development. According to Freud, the love of the parents for their child and their attitude toward their child could be seen as a revival and reproduction of their own narcissism. The child has an omnipotence of thought; the parents stimulate that feeling because in their child they see <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have never reached themselves. Compared to neutral observers, parents tend to overvalue the qualities of their child. When parents act in an extreme opposite style and the child is rejected or inconsistently reinforced depending on the mood of the parent, the self-needs of the child are not met. Freud contrasts the natural development of active-egoistic and passive-altruistic tendencies in the individual with narcissism, in the former, and what Trevor Pederson refers to as echoism, in the latter.|$|E
500|$|I have no {{argument}} with someone having a fundamentalist belief in Christianity or Islam or Judaism or Buddhism or anything else, but I {{do have a}} serious objection to people trying to impose their values on other people. [...] And that's what this episode is about. No one {{has the right to}} force anyone to believe <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> believe. That's one of the beautiful things about Gene Roddenberry's vision of IDIC (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations), {{and that was one of}} the things that we really wanted to hammer home here. Sisko does everything he can not to impose his values on the Bajorans, but Vedek Winn is determined to impose her values on everyone.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{go for a}} shiny, {{high-tech}} {{science fiction}} look, the designers opted to recreate the setting and feel of the original Alien film using the work of concept artists Ron Cobb and Mœbius. As a result, the game features a lo-fi, 1970s vision of what the future would look like. For example, the game features clunky machinery like phone receivers, monochrome displays, and distorted CRT monitors. To create period authentic distortion on in-game monitors, the developers recorded their in game animations onto VHS and Betamax video recorders, then filmed those sequences playing on an [...] "old curvy portable TV" [...] while adjusting the tracking settings. As digital hacking was not conceived in the 1970s, the game's hacking device was built the way {{it would have been}} built on the set of the movie, and requires players to tune into a computer's signal while selecting icons on its screen. Artist Jon McKellan noted, [...] "We had this rule: If a prop couldn't have been made in '79 with <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had around, then we wouldn't make it either." ...|$|E

500|$|The show {{revolved}} around themes of evolution, {{as well as}} her paranoias represented on The Fame Monster. While developing the tour Gaga spoke about original sin and demons inside human beings; [...] "So we talked about growth, and that led us into this kind of scientific space, and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as one thing, and we become another." [...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was [...] "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.|$|E
500|$|On March 1, 2001, HBO {{announced}} that a Las Vegas show at MGM Grand Arena would be broadcast on November 18, 2001. The special was directed and produced by Marty Callner. Spears requested that HBO aired the concert to the American Forces Network (AFN) on its AFN-Atlantic and AFN-Pacific channels at no cost. She also interacted with soldiers based at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Naval Base San Diego, Fort Polk, and Lackland Air Force Base. The special won an Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction on the 2002 ceremony. In January 2002, Jive Records released the DVD Live from Las Vegas; it was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 200,000 copies in units. On September 18, 2002, Jive Records announced {{the release of a}} photographic book and DVD titled Stages and [...] Stages: Three Days in Mexico. The DVD was directed by Albert Maysles and chronicled her stay in Mexico and Japan. Spears explained the release, saying, [...] "I wanted to share with my fans all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> never get to see that make it all so special for me.

500|$|Before {{the second}} season premiere aired in September 2009, co-creator J.R. Orci hinted that the {{audience}} was going to meet [...] "many Observers", {{and that in the}} season's eighth episode, [...] "You're going to find out their role in the world, what they're named after, and their connection to some of these characters." [...] Later on, when still leading up to the airing of [...] "August" [...] in another interview, Roberto Orci elaborated that [...] "Individuality will be one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be fanatically struggling with, actually. That was a fun one, because that one was one where you're finally getting to pay off things you've been setting up for a year. You finally get to open the toy box and really play with those toys". Actor Michael Cerveris, who plays September, commented in an interview {{that as a result of}} the episode, viewers would learn that the Observers [...] "are not completely devoid of feelings, and are not incapable of being attached to people they're observing". He also expressed relief that his character was no longer the sole Observer on the show, joking that [...] "it was nice to feel like I'm not the only freak in town for once".|$|E

[...] It symbolized equality between men and women. ... he hippies' chosen clothing also made statements. Drab work clothes (jeans, work shirts, pea coats) were a rejection of materialism. [...] Clothing from other cultures, particularly the Third World and native Americans, represented their awareness of the global community and their rejection of U.S. imperialism and selfishness. [...] Simple cotton dresses and other natural fabrics were a rejection of synthetics, a return to natural things and simpler times. [...] Some hippies wore old World War II or Civil War jackets as way of co-opting the symbols of war into their newfound philosophy of nonviolence.|$|E
500|$|Academic Peter Hutchings, {{noting the}} many {{definitions}} of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known {{in part for}} their excesses. [...] Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms. [...] Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema. Film censorship can make these films obscure and difficult to find, common criteria used to define cult films. [...] Despite this, these films remain well-known and prized among collectors. [...] Fans will occasionally express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis, which they believe marginalizes and misinterprets paracinema. [...] In marketing these films, young men are predominantly targeted. [...] Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films. [...] Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes, such as misogyny, using these films as catharsis for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> hate most in life. [...] Exploitative, transgressive elements can be pushed to excessive extremes for both humor and satire. Frank Henenlotter faced censorship and ridicule, but he found acceptance among audiences receptive to themes that Hollywood was reluctant to touch, such as violence, drug addiction, and misogyny. Lloyd Kaufman sees his films' political statements as more populist and authentic than the hypocrisy of mainstream films and celebrities. Despite featuring an abundance of fake blood, vomit, and diarrhea, Kaufman's films have attracted positive attention from critics and academics. [...] Excess can also exist as camp, such as films that highlight the excesses of 1980s fashion and commercialism.|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} {{was met with}} highly critical reviews from the Russian press, whose complaints were mostly all pointed towards Craig. One critic described the performance as being “smothered by Craig’s screens”. [...] The overall opinion of the Russian critics was that Craig’s modern concept distracted from the play itself. However, Nikolay Efros, insisted that despite the flaws of the production, the theatre must be admired for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> aspired to achieve, and the immense amount of work they put in. The press in England [...] was much kinder, and rumors spread very quickly through western Europe of the great triumph of Craig’s vision, despite the production in actuality being a complete failure. While Olga Knipper (Gertrude), Nikolai Massalitinov (Claudius) and Olga Gzovskaia (Ophelia) received poor reviews in the Russian press, Vasili Kachalov's performance as Hamlet was praised as a genuine achievement, one which succeeded in displacing the legend of Mochalov's mid-19th-century Romantic Hamlet.|$|E
