5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E

5|$|Months {{before each}} Games, the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a {{ceremony}} that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it {{plays an important role}} in the opening ceremony.

25|$|The {{construction}} of the plant in Ashdod by Mekorot had been delayed by an injunction in court from the private company IDE which had built the Ashkelon plant. It alleged that the contract had been awarded to Mekorot without a tender. In June 2008, the Tel Aviv District Court decided that IDE was right. In February 2009 Mekorot Development and Initiatives Ltd, a subsidiary of Mekorot, published an international tender for the planning and {{construction of}} the plant.

25|$|In {{the early}} {{development}} of many organisms, the action potential is actually initially carried by calcium current rather than sodium current. The {{opening and closing}} kinetics of calcium channels during development are slower {{than those of the}} voltage-gated sodium channels <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> the action potential in the mature neurons. The longer opening times for the calcium channels can lead to action potentials that are considerably slower than those of mature neurons. Xenopus neurons initially have action potentials that take 60–90 ms. During development, this time decreases to 1 ms. There are two reasons for this drastic decrease. First, the inward current becomes primarily carried by sodium channels. Second, the delayed rectifier, a potassium channel current, increases to 3.5 times its initial strength.|$|E

25|$|The {{process to}} build the SAS tower atop its {{foundation}} consisted of five phases. The first four phases each consisted of lifting four similar columns and bolting them into place and to elements connecting them, while the last phase was to lift the final top cap <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> the crowning main cable saddle. On July 28, 2010, {{the first of four}} below-deck main tower pillars was erected, having arrived earlier in the month by barge from China. They were placed by lifting one end from a barge into a temporary scaffold, with a carriage on the barge to allow the lower end to move into place. After the columns were bolted into place, the scaffolding was then extended upward to allow the next set of above deck columns to be erected, lifted, and translated into position, a process repeated for each of the remaining phases.|$|E
