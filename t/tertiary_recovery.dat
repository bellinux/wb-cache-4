2500|$|Wells are drilled into oil {{reservoirs}} {{to extract}} the crude oil. [...] "Natural lift" [...] production methods that rely on the natural reservoir pressure to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped. In some reservoirs, {{such as in the}} Middle East, the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time. The natural pressure in most reservoirs, however, eventually dissipates. Then the oil must be extracted using [...] "artificial lift" [...] means. Over time, these [...] "primary" [...] methods become less effective and [...] "secondary" [...] production methods may be used. A common secondary method is [...] "waterflood" [...] or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or [...] "wellbore." [...] Eventually [...] "tertiary" [...] or [...] "enhanced" [...] oil recovery methods may be used to increase the oil's flow characteristics by injecting steam, carbon dioxide and other gases or chemicals into the reservoir. In the United States, primary production methods account for less than 40 percent of the oil produced on a daily basis, secondary methods account for about half, and <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> the remaining 10 percent. Extracting oil (or [...] "bitumen") from oil/tar sand and oil shale deposits requires mining the sand or shale and heating it in a vessel or retort, or using [...] "in-situ" [...] methods of injecting heated liquids into the deposit and then pumping out the oil-saturated liquid.|$|E
5000|$|The field may {{undergo a}} {{secondary}} or <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> project, {{discussed in the}} next section.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{microbial}} treatments {{is another}} <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> method. Special blends of the microbes {{are used to}} treat and break down the hydrocarbon chain in oil, making the oil easy to recover. It is also more economical versus other conventional methods. In some states such as Texas, there are tax incentives for using these microbes in {{what is called a}} secondary <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery.</b> Very few companies supply these, however, companies like Bio Tech, Inc. have proven very successful in waterfloods across Texas.|$|E
30|$|A JF- 2 bio-surfactant and butanol mixture was {{the model}} in this formulation. First fresh water was {{injected}} into the core model and then surfactant solutions were injected to see the effect of secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>recoveries.</b>|$|R
50|$|Enhanced, or <b>Tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> methods, {{increase}} {{the mobility of}} the oil {{in order to increase}} extraction.|$|R
30|$|Higher {{permeability}} promotes volumetric sweep efficiency, thereby {{improving the}} ultimate oil recovery during secondary and <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery.</b>|$|R
50|$|The company's {{focus is}} on a method of oil {{extraction}} called enhanced oil recovery (<b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery),</b> which utilizes carbon dioxide to extract oil from fields that have been previously exploited.|$|E
5000|$|CO2 {{flooding}} is {{the second}} most common <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> technique and is used in facilities around the world. In connection with greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, CO2 flooding sequesters [...] underground and therefore offsets CO2 emissions elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> allows another 5% to 15% of the reservoir's oil to be recovered. In some California {{heavy oil}} fields, steam {{injection}} has doubled or even tripled the oil reserves and ultimate oil recovery. For example, see Midway-Sunset Oil Field, California's largest oilfield.|$|E
30|$|At University of Regina, HPAM {{solution}} was tested on homogeneous and heterogeneous sand packs (Wang and Dong 2007). The viscosity of test oil was 1, 450  cP {{at room temperature}} of 22.5 °C. The homogeneous sand had porosity of 0.35 and permeability of 7  Darcy. The sand pack was first flooded with water till oil recovery of 42 %, and polymer {{solution was}} subsequently injected. The <b>tertiary</b> <b>recoveries</b> ranged from 4 % with polymer solution of medium viscosity, to 19 % with high-viscosity polymer solution.|$|R
30|$|For the {{laboratory}} research surveyed here, polymer flood {{could lead to}} <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> of more than 10 %. However, high polymer concentration and viscosity were required to mobilize heavy oil.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1970 [...] "Rothsay" [...] was one {{of several}} Royal Navy vessels that were {{stationed}} for a possible <b>tertiary</b> splashdown <b>recovery</b> of Apollo XIII in a position just south of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.|$|R
50|$|Since Perenco's {{arrival in}} the region in 2000, {{production}} has increased significantly through continual investment in new production wells (about 30 per year), and through the company's technical expertise (such as modifications to the pumping systems) focused on completing the primary recovery process and starting the secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> processes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> {{begins when}} {{secondary}} oil recovery {{is not enough}} to continue adequate extraction, but only when the oil can still be extracted profitably. This depends on the cost of the extraction method and the current price of crude oil. When prices are high, previously unprofitable wells are brought back into use, and when they are low, extraction is curtailed.|$|E
50|$|Microbial {{enhanced}} oil recovery, specifically, has received special attention. In 1999, Bognolo reported that biosurfactants not only reduced the viscosity of the Venezuelan heavy crude oils, but also increased their mobility in transport lines. Currently, the biodegradation {{of the heavy}} crudes has become an integral <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> method in the field, {{as it is a}} cost-efficient and eco-friendly way to drive the residual oil trapped in the reservoirs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} response surface methodology to predict the optimum aqueous phase composition of a triglyceride microemulsion for enhanced oil recovery. The two models capturing the relationships between interfacial tension and <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> data with the aqueous phase composition were validated prior to optimization. It was predicted that the optimum aqueous phase contains 3 wt% sodium chloride, 0. 98 wt% alkyl polyglycosides, and 2. 98 wt% glyceryl monooleate. At this composition the corresponding interfacial tension is minimum (0. 000229451 mN/m) and the <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> is maximum (71. 7865 %). The predicted optimum aqueous phase composition using historical-data design {{is close to the}} experimental value...|$|R
30|$|Reducing oil {{viscosity}} in water-wet fracture media made them favorable candidates for waterflooding process. However, this reduction leads to lower residual oil saturation {{at the beginning}} of gas-injection process which consequently, reduces the <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> efficiency.|$|R
30|$|The {{modified}} Eclipse simulator simulated {{the effect}} of secondary and <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery,</b> using water with a green surfactant and alcohol solution, and with a solution of anionic and nonionic surfactants blended with alcohol. These features were tested by core-flood experiments.|$|R
50|$|As an {{oil field}} matures and {{production}} rates decline, {{there is growing}} incentive to intervene and attempt to increase oil output utilizing <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> techniques (also termed improved or enhanced oil recovery). Petroleum engineers assess available options for increasing well productivity, options that include chemical injection, thermal/steam injection, and CO2 injection. Based on data-gathering and computer simulations, the most optimal enhanced oil-recovery technique to maximize well-productivity is determined. To increase the rate of oil production, the pressure within the reservoir must be increased.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advent of}} <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> {{techniques}} in the 1960s made possible another pulse of {{development of the}} field. In 1963, several cyclic steam projects commenced, followed by steam flooding, {{and in some cases}} fire flooding - all techniques for mobilizing heavy, viscous oil relatively close to the surface. [...] At the end of 2009, all of the cyclic steam and steam flood wells were reported to be shut in, while water flood and water disposal wells remained in use on the field.|$|E
50|$|Enhanced oil {{recovery}} (abbreviated EOR) is {{the implementation of}} various techniques for {{increasing the amount of}} crude oil that can be extracted from an oil field. Enhanced {{oil recovery}} is also called <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> (as opposed to primary and secondary recovery). According to the US Department of Energy, there are three primary techniques for EOR: thermal recovery, gas injection, and chemical injection. Sometimes the term quaternary recovery is used to refer to more advanced, speculative, EOR techniques. Using EOR, 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir's original oil can be extracted, compared with 20 to 40 percent using primary and secondary recovery.|$|E
30|$|Three {{formulations}} of green surfactants were simulated, {{and the results}} were used to investigate the effectiveness of each surfactant mixture. Three core models for three formulations were simulated {{to examine the relationship between}} oil recovery and injected surfactant solutions. In all cases, fresh water was first injected into the core model and then surfactant solutions were injected to see the effect of secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>recoveries.</b> The JF- 2 bio-surfactant from anionic green surfactants with butanol as a co-surfactant was modeled in the first formulation. The second formulation was the nonionic surfactant APG with butanol. The final one was a mixture of anionic and nonionic surfactants with a co-surfactant, in this case APG and JF- 2 bio-surfactant blended with butanol.|$|R
30|$|The huge {{potential}} of nanoparticles in upstream {{oil and gas}} is shown by various applications of nanoparticles in different oil and gas processes. Owing to the inherent characteristics of silica nanoparticles, they have been studied {{in recent years to}} improve the sweep efficiency of water flooding. Ogolo et al. (2012) studied the effect and {{potential of}} a combination of three nanoparticles, including Al 2 O 3, MgO, Fe 2 O 3, and SiO 2 nanoparticles. Some combinations of these nanoparticles were better than silica nanoparticles alone. Hendraningrat et al. (2012) found nanoparticles could decrease the interfacial tension between oil and brine/nanofluid. Also, the nanofluid could increase oil recovery by 13  % for both secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>recoveries</b> (Hendraningrat et al. 2012, 2013; Li et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} West Hackberry Tertiary Project is to {{demonstrate}} the technical and economic feasibility of combining air injection with the Double Displacement Process for <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery.</b> The Double Displacement Process is the gas displacement of a water invaded oil column {{for the purpose of}} recovering oil through gravity drainage. The novel aspect of this project is the use of air as the injection fluid. The target reservoir for the project is the Camerina C- 1, 2, 3 Sand located on the West Flank of West Hackberry Field in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. If successful, this project will demonstrate that the use of air injection in the Double Displacement Process can economically recover oil in reservoirs where <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> is presently uneconomic...|$|R
50|$|Thermally {{enhanced}} oil recovery methods (TEOR) are <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> techniques that heat the oil, reducing its viscosity {{and making it}} easier to extract. Steam injection is {{the most common form of}} TEOR, and it is often done with a cogeneration plant. This type of cogeneration plant uses a gas turbine to generate electricity, and the waste heat is used to produce steam, which is then injected into the reservoir. This form of recovery is used extensively to increase oil extraction in the San Joaquin Valley, which yields a very heavy oil, yet accounts for ten percent of the United States' oil extraction. Fire flooding (In-situ burning) is another form of TEOR, but instead of steam, some of the oil is burned to heat the surrounding oil.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2) {{flooding}} is {{a process}} whereby carbon dioxide is injected into an oil reservoir {{in order to increase}} output when extracting oil.When a reservoir’s pressure is depleted through primary and secondary production, carbon dioxide flooding can be an ideal <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> method. It is particularly effective in reservoirs deeper than 2,500 ft., where [...] will be in a supercritical state, with API oil gravity greater than 22-25° and remaining oil saturation greater than 20%. It {{should also be noted that}} carbon dioxide flooding is not affected by the lithology of the reservoir area, but simply by the reservoir porosity and permeability, so that it is viable in both sandstone and carbonate reservoirs.By injecting CO2 into the reservoir, the viscosity of any hydrocarbon will be reduced and hence will be easier to sweep to the production well.|$|E

50|$|The {{versatility}} of PNIPA has led {{to finding}} uses in macroscopic gels, microgels, membranes, sensors, biosensors, thin films, tissue engineering, and drug delivery. The tendency of aqueous solutions of PNIPA to increase in viscosity {{in the presence of}} hydrophobic molecules has made it excellent for <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery.</b>|$|R
30|$|Studies of oil {{recovery}} by alkali-polymeric surfactant (APS) flooding {{showed that the}} 0.8  wt% alkali and 0.6  wt% surfactant had the best performance in recovering residual oil after waterflooding. <b>Tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> of 16.2  % OOIP was recovered when 0.5  PV of the APS slug was followed by chase water.|$|R
40|$|The West Hackberry Tertiary Project is a {{field test}} of the concept that air {{injection}} can generate <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> through the Double Displacement Process. The Double Displacement Process is the gas displacement of a water invaded oil column {{for the purpose of}} recovering tertiary oil through gravity drainage. The novel aspect of this project is the use of air as the injection fluid. In Gulf Coast oil reservoirs with pronounced bed dip, reservoir performance has shown that gravity drainage recoveries average 80 % to 90 % of the original oil in place while water drive recoveries average 50 % to 60 % of the original oil in place. The target for <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> with the Double Displacement Process is the incremental oil between the 50 % to 60 % water drive recoveries and the 80 % to 90 % gravity drainage recoveries...|$|R
30|$|In this {{reservoir}} model, {{secondary recovery}} {{is more efficient}} than <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> mode because it leads to earlier oil recovery.|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of oil saturation was also tested. The sand pack was flooded till oil recovery of 35 %, and polymer flood was then initiated. It {{was discovered that}} polymer solution with relatively low viscosity achieved good <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery</b> between 8 and 21 %. This indicated that polymer flood could be more effective when applied early. The tests on heterogeneous sand pack lead to much lower <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery,</b> compared with the results for homogeneous sands.|$|E
30|$|Decreasing matrix {{permeability}} {{reduces the}} ultimate recovery significantly (secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>recovery)</b> while increasing oil physical properties such as viscosity or density {{leads to the}} raise of ultimate oil recovery.|$|E
25|$|Three industrial-size single {{downcomer}} Jameson Cells {{were sold}} by Xstrata Technology to Shell Canada in 2007 {{for a large}} scale pilot plant project and eight 500mm downcomers were sold to Syncrude Limited in 2008. In the latter case, the downcomers were used to treat middlings in an existing <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> vessel in a bitumen recovery process patented by Syncrude.|$|R
30|$|Simulated {{secondary}} recovery results in Figs.  6, 10 and 14 are poorly matched {{with those of}} experimental. It would be most likely because of (1) using constant values such as viscosity and adsorption, (2) higher flow rate with respect to field rate, (3) generated permeability table using Stone II model. However, <b>tertiary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> curves are close to laboratory values.|$|R
