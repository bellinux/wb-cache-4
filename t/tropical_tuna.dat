Biometric condition factors have been widely used and preferred over costly and time-consuming biochemical condition. Here, we investigated the relevance of four common condition factors based on biometric measurements (Le Cren's index, girth -length index, gonado-somatic index and hepato-somatic index) and of size- and weight -based empirical models to describe the physiological condition of <b>tropical</b> <b>tunas.</b> Biometric condition factors of bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tunas sampled throughout 2013 in the western Indian Ocean region were assessed against benchmark biochemical indices (lipid content, protein content, triacylglycerol:sterol ratio and energy density) estimated in tissues with different physiological functions, i. e. red muscle, white muscle, liver, and gonads. Our findings suggest that <b>tropical</b> <b>tunas</b> do not store lipids in white muscle and that protein content is less variable than lipid content, which largely varies with ontogeny and the seasons according to tissue and species. This variability induced inconsistency between biometric factors, including the empirically adjusted ones, and biochemical indices, {{with the exception of the}} gonado-somatic index that fitted well to the composition of the gonads in the three species, and especially in females.

The published article is copyrighted by Inter-Research {{and can be}} found at: [URL] ecological consequences of widespread fisheries-induced reductions of large pelagic predators are not fully understood. <b>Tropical</b> <b>tunas</b> are considered a main component of apex predator guilds that include sharks and billfishes, and thus may seem unsusceptible to secondary effects of fishing top predators. However, intra-guild predation can occur because of size-structured interactions. We compiled existing data of apex predator diets to evaluate whether skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tunas might be vulnerable to top-down control by large pelagic predators in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. We identified potentially important predators on tunas by the frequency, quantity, and size/age of tunas in their diets and considered the degree that predated tunas could have potentially contributed to the reproductive output of the population. Our results indicate that the proportion of predator diets consisting of skipjack and yellowfin tuna was high for sharks and billfishes. These predators also consumed a wide size range of tunas, including sub-adults are capable of making a notable contribution to the reproductive output of tuna populations. Our study suggests that, in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, <b>tropical</b> <b>tunas</b> act as mesopredators more so than apex predators. Sharks and billfishes have the potential {{to play an important role}} in regulating these tuna populations.

40|$|The biomass of {{available}} forage {{is a key}} factor in controlling the abundance and distribution of surface <b>tropical</b> <b>tunas,</b> as they have high energy demands and live in a poor environment. The direct estimate of this forage biomass is not possible with existing techniques.

In a previous study, this fraction of the zooplankton has been identified, both by taxa and by size, by analysing the stomach contents of the fishes which are the preys of tunas. In this paper, we use 331 plankton samples from tuna fishing grounds of the tropical Indian ocean, to define the characteristics of the planktonic fraction actually participating in the tuna food-chain.

40|$|Temperate tunas in the North Pacific {{including}} Pacific {{bluefin tuna}} {{and the northern}} stock of albacore tuna have been observed to experience considerable fluctuations in stock abundance {{over a long period}} of time, whereas the abundance of <b>tropical</b> <b>tunas</b> in the western and central Pacific (i. e. the southern stocks) has consistently decreased during relatively short exploitation histories. In consideration of these characteristics, we examined, theoretically as well as empirically, the applicability of historically-based limit reference points (LRPs) such as Floss to North Pacific stocks and contrasted these with maximum sustainable yield (MSY) -based LRPs such as FMSY proposed for Western and Central Pacific southern stocks. Numerical simulations indicated that historically-based LRPs are appropriate for northern stocks when recruitment compensation is high (i. e. when “steepness ” in the stock recruitment relationship is high). In contrast, MSY-based LRPs often have a high risk of allowing recruitment overfishing of northern stocks when process errors are large. Based on these results, we suggest that LRPs set with reference to historical stock sizes are worthy of consideration for temperate tunas in the North Pacific...|$|R

Catch and effort data come from detailed daily logbooks. Catch rates are modelled using the delta lognormal model. The method estimates a combined CPUE of the three species from aggregated catches, {{and the proportion of}} catches for each species, so the final individual abundance indices are calculated multiplying both estimators for each species. Explanatory variables used in the analysis are: year, zone, quarter, harvest capacity, country, and starting date of the vessel.

I have used generalized linear models (GLMs) to estimate standardized CPUE. Gamma density distributions were used to model the positive catches, while binomial distributions were used to model the proportion of positive catches. Factors included in the GLMs were area, quarter and year. Two databases were analyzed, namely “complete ” and “set by set”. In the latter, fishing days are reported one by one. However, “complete ” data set includes all available data, no matter if effort and catch were summed up by trip, fleet, month or area. Standardized catch rates as calculated using both dataset showed slight increasing trends.
