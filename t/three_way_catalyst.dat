40|$|The rhodium (Rh) {{component}} in automotive <b>three</b> <b>way</b> <b>catalysts</b> (TWC) experiences severe thermal deactivation during fuel shutoff, an engine mode (e. g., at downhill coasting) used for enhancing fuel economy. In a subsequent {{switch to a}} slightly fuel rich condition, in situ catalyst regeneration is accomplished by reduction with H 2 generated through steam reforming catalyzed by Rh 0 sites. The present work reports {{the effects of the}} two processes on the activity and properties of 0. 5 % Rh/Al 2 O 3 and 0. 5 % Rh/CexOy-ZrO 2 (CZO) as model catalysts for Rh-TWC. A very brief introduction of <b>three</b> <b>way</b> <b>catalysts</b> and system considerations is also given. During simulated fuel shutoff, catalyst deactivation is accelerated with increasing aging temperature from 800 °C to 1050 °C. Rh on a CZO support experiences less deactivation and faster regeneration than Rh on Al 2 O 3. Catalyst characterization techniques including BET surface area, CO chemisorption, TPR, and XPS measurements were applied to examine the roles of metal-support interactions in each catalyst system. For Rh/Al 2 O 3, strong metal-support interactions with the formation of stable rhodium aluminate (Rh(AlO 2) y) complex dominates in fuel shutoff, leading to more difficult catalyst regeneration. For Rh/CZO, Rh sites were partially oxidized to Rh 2 O 3 and were relatively easy to be reduced to active Rh 0 during regeneration...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the role of}} cerium oxide（ceria, CeO 2 ）and the mixed oxide of cria-zirconia system, which are {{important}} as an excellent promoter for oxygen storage capacity in automotive <b>three</b> <b>way</b> <b>catalyst,</b> for readers in ceramic engineering field. Automotive <b>three</b> <b>way</b> <b>catalyst</b> system（TWC）is generally operating under the condition of the certain range in air-fuel ratio（A/F）. Most automotive catalysts consist of precious metals such as Pt, Rh and Pd, promoters and transitionalumina support. CeO 2 can provide oxygen for oxidizing CO and HC under rich A/F condition, and remove it from exhaust gas phase for reducing NOx under lean A/F. For the highest purifying activity, the action that Ce 4 ＋ in CeO 2 lattice easily changes to Ce 3 ＋ is useful. Its nonstoichiometrical behavior in the state of crystalline fluorite-type oxide is essential for this catalytic operation. The practical use of automotive catalyst under harsh condition has required better durability performance of catalysts for advanced engine systems, which are matched in various kinds of new version automobiles. Ceria-zirconia system, which was first developed by Ozawa and coworkers in 1980 's, has been still important composition in recent automotive catalysts. Here, it is described that alumina-supported ceria is affected by the addition of zirconia regarding with specific surface area stability. Newly, the fractal sintering of zirconia based powders has been investigated by neutron scattering techniques in order to describe powder-state sintering in a catalyst.

Experimental results show that the addition of Zr, Mn, Co, and Cu promoters improved the activity of Pt Rh Pd/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst remarkably for CO, CH and NOx conversion, respectively. The effective order of the promoters is CuO > ZrO 2 Co 3 O 4 MnO 2.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of CO with ceria under conditions typical for oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements of <b>three</b> <b>way</b> <b>catalysts</b> (TWC) {{has been investigated}} by in situ Raman spectroscopy.

Exposure of the carbonized ceria to gaseous O 2 at room temperature resulted in the disappearance of the bands attributed to the carbon in Raman spectra, accompanied by the emerging of bands of surface formates, carbonates, and adsorbed peroxide species. Even though the kinetics of the ceria-catalyzed CO disproportionation reaction has yet to be measured, the present investigation suggests that the generally accepted procedure for OSC measurements of TWCs results in an OSC overestimation and, hence, needs to be reconsidered...|$|R

Nanocrystalline ceria particles were successfully produced by one-step microwave-assisted synthesis from a glycol solution of metal nitrates under mild conditions (140 ?C, 1 atm). The as-prepared powder showed a good crystallinity and nanometric particle size.

40|$|Emissions {{from modern}} SI-engines are reduced by a <b>three</b> <b>way</b> <b>{{catalyst}}.</b> However {{if there are}} leaks in the exhaust system before the catalyst emissions increase for two reasons. First the untreated emissions leak out. Second which is worse, due to waves in the exhaust system, oxygen leaks into the manifold and causes an oxygen sensor offset. The result is increased emissions as the air/fuel controller makes the engine run rich. Here a method to detect leakages in the exhaust manifold is presented. The sensors used are binary oxygen sensor(s), intake manifold pressure and temperature, and the air mass flow sensor. Injection time {{is also used to}} estimate air/fuel ratio.

In particular higher CH 4 conversion is {{obtained in the}} rich part of the cycle than in the lean one, the difference being more pronounced at high temperature. A narrow turning point for the TWC activity is finally observed under slightly rich conditions, which is characterised by a marked increase of CH 4 conversion, paralleled by total consumption of O 2 and NO and formation of small amounts of CO, H 2 and NH 3.

Therefore, a fuzzy MIMO Control system is designed for robust control of lambda. As an accurate and control oriented model, an air to fuel ratio model of a Spark Ignition (SI) marine engine is developed to generate simulation data of the engine's subsystems.

It could be shown that both the oxygen storage degree and the soot loading can be monitored directly, but not simultaneously due to their competitive effects.

At high temperatures, the resonance frequencies for oxidized catalysts (λ = 1. 02) are not influenced by aging, but are significantly affected by aging in the reduced case (λ = 0. 98). The catalyst aging state can therefore potentially {{be inferred from}} the resonance frequency differences between reduced and oxidized states or from the resonance frequency amplitudes during lambda oscillations. Secondly, adsorbed water at low temperatures strongly affects the resonance frequencies. Light-off experiment studies showed that the resonance frequency depends on the aging state at temperatures below the oxygen storage light-off. These differences were attributed to different water sorption capabilities of differently aged samples due to a surface area decrease with proceeding aging. In addition to the aging state, the water content in the feed gas and the temperature affect the amount of adsorbed water, leading to different integral electrical material properties of the catalyst and changing the resonance properties of the catalyst-filled canning. The classical aging-related properties of the catalyst (oxygen storage capacity, oxygen storage light-off, surface area), agreed very well with data obtained by the microwave-based method...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} work {{is divided into}} (1) a portable sample collection technique (2) developing a suitable catalyst combination and (3) manufacturing a catalytic converter with novel design. Taking into account the hazards of aldehydes in ambient air, and carbonyl emissions compounds, an effort {{has been made to}} investigate the carbonyl compounds and measure their concentrations for diesel engines using Bio Ethanol (BE) -diesel fuel. From the said analysis, development of a potential catalytic converter is envisioned in order to reduce these emissions along with carbon monoxides, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. Catalytic converter is specially manufactured for reduction of carbonyl emissions from the BE-diesel fuelled engine and its comparison and its integration with conventional <b>three</b> <b>way</b> <b>catalysts</b> is discussed. The retention time of the raw sample peak is comparable to the retention time of formaldehyde standard solution. Solitary formaldehyde peak is obtained. Peaks of acetaldehyde and acetone are not obtained due to their lower concentrations than the limit of detection, at the given loading condition. Retention time of each arrangement is close to that of formaldehyde standard. It is observed that CO, HC and NOx conversion efficiencies remained constant irrespective of combination with specially designed ZrO 2 catalyst. Formaldehyde concentration obtained for one ZrO 2 catalyst sample is significantly lower than raw emissions. Added ZrO 2 catalyst showed further reduction. Thus, wit...|$|R
