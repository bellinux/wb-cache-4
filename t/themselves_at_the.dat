5|$|Beginning in 1920, the Piber Federal Stud, near Graz, Austria, {{became the}} main stud for the horses used in Vienna. Breeding became very selective, only {{allowing}} stallions that had proved <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Riding School {{to stand at}} stud, and only breeding mares who had passed rigorous performance testing.|$|E
5|$|Continuing their attack, the squadrons on {{the left}} of the Household Brigade then {{destroyed}} Aulard's brigade.

5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for the}} repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. Süß enables them to enrich <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of the populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his {{excessively}} opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E

5|$|Beginning at the post–World War I 1920 Summer Olympics, the {{lighting}} of the Olympic Flame {{was followed by}} the release of doves, symbolizing peace. (Experienced athletes brought newspapers to cover themselves because of the birds' droppings.) The release was discontinued after several doves perched <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cauldron's rim and were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics. It was later replaced with a symbolic release of doves after the flame has been lit.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door of a workhouse were {{at the mercy of}} the porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E
5|$|Making slow going amidst {{considerable}} resistance, the Australians nevertheless reached KB Mission {{late in the}} day. A {{force of}} Japanese remained there, and the Australians attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese were killed or wounded. The Australians were then able to firmly establish <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th to continue its advance the following morning.|$|E

An engineman from Florida won the lightweight title, a chief carpenter's mate from New York won the middleweight title, and a fireman from the same ship reached the heavyweight finals.|$|E
5|$|The European Ombudsman {{is elected}} by the Parliament, who deals with public {{complaints}} against all institutions. Petitions can also be brought forward by any EU citizen on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The Committee on Petitions hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Parliament. While the Parliament attempts {{to resolve the issue}} as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary to resolve the citizens dispute.|$|E

5|$|Boston College {{began its}} second {{possession}} of the fourth quarter knowing it had to score a touchdown to tie the game. Quarterback Matt Ryan had his best success of the day, connecting on sevenof tenpasses during the drive and picking up 58yards. All of the Eagles' yardage on the drive came through the air, and with 2:25 remaining, the Eagles found <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech 14-yard line. Facing a fourth down and needing fouryards for a first down, Matt Ryan fell back to attempt a pass. The throw was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Vince Hall.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{came in at}} 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hooked Hollies for two fours just before stumps. On the second morning, Morris registered his third century of the Test series and his sixth in Ashes matches. The innings had taken 208 minutes and included four fours. Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped the former for 37. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to establish <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crease. Miller made five, before Harvey came to the crease and hit two quick boundaries before being dismissed. Hollies took both wickets.|$|E

5|$|In 1635, without {{reference}} to a general assembly of the Parliament, the King authorised a book of canons that made him head of the Church, ordained an unpopular ritual and enforced {{the use of a}} new liturgy. When the liturgy emerged in 1637 it was seen as an English-style Prayer Book, resulting in anger and widespread rioting, said to have been set off with the throwing of a stool by one Jenny Geddes during a service in St Giles Cathedral. The Protestant nobility put <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of the popular opposition. Representatives of various sections of Scottish society drew up the National Covenant on 28 February 1638, objecting to the King's liturgical innovations. The King's supporters were unable to suppress the rebellion and the King refused to compromise. In December of the same year, {{at a meeting of the}} General Assembly in Glasgow, the Scottish bishops were formally expelled from the Church, which was then established on a full Presbyterian basis.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} morning, Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand ended with Hassett's fall for 37. The {{following}} four batsmen {{were unable to}} establish <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crease and none passed 20. Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving; it took a run out to remove Morris. Australia were eventually out for 389. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Blackmer and Culp depart {{the next}} morning, their boat is {{attacked}} by an alligator, now enlarged {{because of the}} contamination. Orchard's assistant, Hector McGill, manages to rescue only Blackmer. The house is quickly surrounded by three giant alligators, which throw <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> building with Orchard, McGill, Blackmer and Mrs Files trapped inside. On the advice of Mrs Files, McGill contacts International Rescue and John (voiced by Ray Barrett) alerts Tracy Island. Jeff (Peter Dyneley) dispatches Thunderbirds 1 and 2. Arriving at the scene, Scott (Shane Rimmer) briefly dispels the reptiles with his hoverjet cannon and accesses the house through the laboratory window. Eventually the laboratory caves in, forcing Scott and the others {{to move to the}} lounge. There, the group is confronted by none other than Culp, who survived the alligator attack and holds them at gunpoint.|$|E
5|$|The Pope {{commissioned}} French abbot Bernard of Clairvaux {{to preach}} the Second Crusade, and granted the same indulgences for it which Pope Urban II had accorded to the First Crusade. A parliament was convoked at Vezelay in Burgundy in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly on March 31. Louis VII of France, his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and the princes and lords present prostrated <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> feet of Bernard {{to receive the}} pilgrims' cross. Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed {{to the success of}} his mission. At Speyer, Conrad III of Germany and his nephew, later Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, received the cross from the hand of Bernard. Pope Eugene came in person to France to encourage the enterprise.|$|E
5|$|At 07:50, Cota led {{the charge}} off of Dog Green, between WN-68 and WN-70, by forcing gaps in the wire with a Bangalore torpedo and wire cutters. Twenty minutes later, the 5th Rangers joined the advance, and blew more openings. The command party {{established}} <b>themselves</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the bluff, and elements of G/116 and H/116 joined them, having earlier moved laterally along the beach, and now the narrow front had widened to the east. Before 09:00, small parties from F/116 and B/116 reached the crests just east of Dog White. The right flank of this penetration was covered by {{the survivors of the}} 2nd Rangers’ A and B companies, who had independently fought their way to the top between 08:00 and 08:30. They took WN-70 (already heavily damaged by naval shells), and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland. By 09:00 more than 600 American troops, in groups ranging from company sized to just a few men, had {{reached the top of the}} bluff opposite Dog White and were advancing inland.|$|E
