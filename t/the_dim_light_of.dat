2500|$|President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, {{which took}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} {{the freedom of}} all slaves in Confederate-held territory. (Slaves in Union-held areas and Northern states were freed with {{the adoption of the}} 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: [...] "We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with both}} the {{original}} Dark Fall and the sequel, , Jonathan Boakes worked primarily alone on Lost Souls, writing, designing and programming the game, as well as voicing several characters, designing the sound effects (with Matt Clark), and composing the music (with Ben Gammons). Boakes has said he prefers working on the Dark Fall games without a development team as [...] "the worlds of Dowerton and Fetch Rock are created from an informed imagination, using textures and sounds from the world around me. I think {{a little of that}} personality would be lost if tackled by a small team." [...] Of Lost Souls, he felt working alone helped him establish the game's atmosphere of isolation; [...] "working alone in <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the Darkling Room {{is the best way to}} approach this game [...] It's an eerie, isolating experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 16, 1804, {{at seven}} o'clock in the evening under <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> a waxing {{crescent}} moon, Intrepid slowly sailed into Tripoli harbor. Decatur's vessel was {{made to look like}} a common merchant ship from Malta and was outfitted with [...] To further avoid suspicion, on board were five Sicilian volunteers including the pilot Salvador Catalano, who spoke Arabic. The boarding party remained hidden below in position, prepared to board the captured Philadelphia. The men were divided into several groups, each assigned to secure given areas of the ship, with the additional explicit instruction of refraining from the use of firearms unless it proved absolutely necessary. As Decatur's ship came closer to Philadelphia, Catalano called out to the harbor personnel in Arabic that their ship had lost its anchors during a recent storm and was seeking refuge at Tripoli for repairs. By 9:30p.m. Decatur's ship was within 200 yards of Philadelphia, whose lower yards were now resting on the deck with her foremast missing, as Bainbridge had ordered it cut away and had also jettisoned some of her guns in a futile effort to refloat the ship by lightening her load.|$|E

60|$|Presently The Sheik {{came and}} parted the rugs. He glared through <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the interior.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan shuddered at her fate, {{for even}} in <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the vault he was {{impressed}} by her beauty.|$|E
60|$|De Batz {{stood and}} watched him {{for as long as}} <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> street lamps illumined his slim, soberly-clad figure; then he turned on his heel and walked off in the {{opposite}} direction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, Davy, Davy!" [...] they shouted, {{for they}} were in the mood for anything. There stood Colonel Clark in <b>the</b> <b>dimmer</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background. [...] "We must keep 'em screwed up, Davy," [...] he had said that very day.|$|R
60|$|Therefore, {{just before}} he saw <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{lanterns}} disappearing down the road, which at this point makes a sharp dip before rising abruptly once more {{on the outskirts of}} the wood, Sir Marmaduke finally put his foot in the stirrup and started to follow.|$|R
60|$|The man's {{white face}} shone eagerly in <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the gloomy little apartment. His eyes glittered. He waited almost breathlessly.|$|E
60|$|The {{flash of}} scorn, which shot across the {{features}} of the Teton, was visible, even by <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the stars.|$|E
60|$|Malvina's {{eyes were}} fixed on the Professor. In <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the low-ceilinged room, those eyes seemed all of her that was visible.|$|E
50|$|Desert rainbow-skinks {{shelter in}} {{woodland}} leaf litter, feeding mainly on invertebrates. Their large eyes {{help them to}} see their prey in <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter, and the eyes are covered by an eyelid with a transparent window that protects the eye while burrowing in the litter.|$|R
60|$|I {{was able}} in a moment's lull to peer {{through the windows}} and see <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> Capri--the glimmer of Anacapri up on the black shadow--the lighthouse. We had passed the island. In {{the midst of the}} babel I sent out a few {{thoughts}} to a few people on the island. Then I had to come back.|$|R
60|$|Soon after, her weary {{head was}} on her pillow, and <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> grey <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summer night showed the quiet peace and calmness that had settled on her {{sleeping}} face.|$|R

25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is first mentioned in Red Mars; it takes off when Sax creates an alga {{to withstand the}} harsh Martian temperature and convert its atmosphere into breathable air. Eventually this is done on a massive scale, with thousands of types of GE algae, lichen and bacteria being created to terraform the planet. In Green Mars, GE animals began to be created to withstand the thin Martian atmosphere, and to produce a working planetary-biosphere. By Blue Mars, GE is commonly being done on humans, willingly, to help them better adapt to the new worlds; to breathe thinner air (e.g. Russell), or to see better in <b>the</b> <b>dimmer</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer planets.|$|R
2500|$|Aircraft pilots used an eye patch, {{or close}} one eye to {{preserve}} night vision {{when there was}} disparity in the light intensity within or outside their aircraft, such as when flying at night over brightly lit cities, so that one eye could look out, and the other would be adjusted for <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cockpit to read unlit instruments and maps. [...] The FAA still recommends, [...] "a pilot should close one eye when using a light to preserve some degree of night vision". [...] Some military pilots have worn a lead-lined or gold-lined eyepatch, to protect against blindness in both eyes, {{in the event of}} a nuclear blast or laser weapon attack.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Beth, quickly. [...] "It's Eliza Parsons. But Tom was mistaken. He {{saw her in}} <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> a corridor, and the {{resemblance}} confused him." ...|$|E
60|$|So therewith Sir Tristram gave {{orders to}} Gouvernail, and Gouvernail brought him his shining golden harp, and the harp glistered with great splendor in <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the pavilion.|$|E
60|$|Nelly Bryant {{gazed at}} the note with wide eyes. She was stunned. She took it limply, {{and looked at it}} under <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the gas-lamp over the door.|$|E

60|$|Now {{they were}} in the nave of the old fane where the cold struck them like a sword. <b>The</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torches showed them that, short as had been the time, the news of this marvellous {{marriage}} had spread about, for at least a score of people were standing here and there in knots, or a few of them seated on the oak benches near the chancel. All these turned to stare at them eagerly as they walked towards the altar where stood the priest in his robes, and since his sight was <b>dim,</b> behind him <b>the</b> old clerk with a stable-lantern held on high to enable him to read from his book.|$|R
6000|$|... and dappled with hanging mists, {{white as}} snow, and 'sun-clouds,' as the natives term the cottony nimbus--is easily mistaken, in <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> dawn, for {{a line of}} towering cliffs.|$|E
60|$|Sam {{had been}} asleep {{about two hours}} when he awoke with a start. He sat up, and in <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the room saw his brother {{thrashing}} wildly in the bed.|$|E
60|$|The {{young artist}} {{remained}} by the table, while his sister followed her lover to the door. In <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the hall {{he could see}} their figures and overhear their words.|$|E
5|$|In Constantinople, drums with {{twelve or}} {{fourteen}} sides were popular {{beginning in the}} 11th century. The 11th century rock-cut churches of Cappadocia, such as Karanlik Kilise and Elmali Kilise in Göreme, have shallow domes without drums due to <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> natural <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> cave interiors.|$|R
60|$|The {{walls of}} the enciente had been {{repaired}} and greatly strengthened, and covered by bastions and other works, so that even {{were one of the}} forts taken the work of the enemy would but be begun. The theatres had been closed from the first. The café's chantants, and the open-air concerts had long since followed the example, partly because of the increasing seriousness of the temper of the people, partly because of the failure of the gas. The café's themselves were no longer crowded until midnight; <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lamps that had taken the place of gas gave a sombre air to these establishments, and by eight o'clock in the evening most of them put up their shutters.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} in the room now. Through the narrow barred window the steely rays of the moon fought with <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> yellow <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil lamp, and lit up the pale face of the Committee's agent with its lines of cruelty in sharp {{conflict}} with those of greed.|$|R
