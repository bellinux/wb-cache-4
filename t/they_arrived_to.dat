25|$|The late Bronze Age (14th-13th-12th centuries BC) saw a vast {{migration}} {{of the so-called}} Sea Peoples, described in ancient Egyptian sources.

According to Giovanni Ugas the Sherden, {{one of the most}} important tribes of the sea peoples, are to be identified with the Nuragic Sardinians. Another hypothesis is that <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> the island around the 13th or 12th century after the failed invasion of Egypt. However, these theories remain controversial.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of Remedios was torn between {{the option of}} leaving their city, constantly besieged by pirate attacks, or staying in place. While most of them finally decided to stay, these 37 persons traveled south and, on June 1, 1689 <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> the hill where they rejoined the other two existing families. A mass was given under a supposed Tamarind tree and the city was born. Since then, the place under the tree is known as “Loma Del Carmen” (Carmen’s Hill).

25|$|Human {{sacrifice}} {{and other forms}} of torture—self-inflicted or otherwise—were common to many parts of Mesoamerica. Thus the rite was nothing new to the Aztecs when <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> the Valley of Mexico, nor was it something unique to pre-Columbian Mexico. Other Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Purépechas and Toltecs, performed human sacrifices as well and from archaeological evidence, it probably existed since the time of the Olmecs (1200–400 BC), and perhaps even throughout the early farming cultures of the region. Although the extent of human sacrifice is unknown among several Mesoamerican civilizations, such as Teotihuacán, what distinguished Maya and Aztec human sacrifice was the importance with which it was embedded in everyday life.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the immense}} {{scale of the}} Operation Priboi, which spanned three Soviet republics, {{considerable}} resources were needed. MGB needed to assemble personnel, transport vehicles, and communication equipment all the while keeping the operation secret. MGB also needed to draw up plans for where the operative groups to be deployed and how the deportees to be transported to the railway stations. Local MGB officials, which numbered 635 in Estonia, were not sufficient and 1,193 MGB operatives {{from other parts of}} the Soviet Union were transferred to Estonia alone. In addition to the troops already stationed in Latvia and Estonia, an additional 8,850 soldiers were deployed to Estonia and Latvia {{from other parts of the}} Soviet Union to take part in the operation. <b>They</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> the republics between 10–15 March. They were not told of their actual mission until later and their arrival was explained as a military exercise.|$|E
25|$|The {{offensive}} by the French Second Army forced Falkenhayn {{to divert}} the XXI and I Bavarian corps as soon as <b>they</b> <b>arrived,</b> <b>to</b> extend the front northwards from Chaulnes to Péronne on 24 September and drive the French back over the Somme. Overcrowded and damaged railways behind the German front slowed the transit of German forces and infantry marched from Namur and Cambrai. On 25 September, the German reinforcements attacked, crossed the Somme south of Péronne and then advanced to take a bridge between Hem and Feuillères. A French attack north of the Somme against the II Bavarian Corps, forced a hurried withdrawal. As more Bavarian units arrived in the north, the 3rd Bavarian Division advanced north of the Somme through Bouchavesnes, Leforest and Hardecourt until held up at Maricourt. The 4th Bavarian Division further to the north, defeated the French Territorials and then attacked westwards towards Albert, through Sailly, Combles, Guillemont and Montauban.|$|E

25|$|So practically, at 1 {{o'clock in}} the noon, the battle ended. Although Görgei, at sunrise, than his chief of the general staff Colonel József Bayer at 9 o'clock, sent order to Lieutenant-Colonel Ernő Poeltenberg, the new {{commander}} of the VII. corps (taking the place of General András Gáspár, who not long before went on permission) to come quickly from Perbete, where they were stationed to Komárom. Poeltenberg hurried as he could, but his troops movements were slowed {{by the fact that}} the roads were flooded because of the spring rains, and when <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> the northern shores of the Danube, the raft bridge improvised by Görgei's sappers almost crumbled, and had to be strengthened before they accomplished the crossing o the Southern shores of the river. So Poeltenberg's two Hussar regiments and cavalry batteries arrived only at 3 o'clock to the battlefield, when the battle was already over, while the infantry divisions arrived only in the evening, but they departed in that night towards Győr, to pursue the enemy, and to occupy that very important city.|$|E
25|$|When the sloop Santiago docked in San Juan {{carrying}} royal {{documents and}} the governor-elect of Caracas, Danío ordered Enríquez to loan another vessel {{to transport the}} politician. The privateer complied and granted them La Venganza, which sailed under Mateo de Luque. The ship then stopped at Cumaná to deliver the documents. In the return trip, La Venganza captured a British ship, sending its prey back to San Juan and docking at Buenavista waiting further orders. While there, Danío ordered that La Venganza completed a escort mission to Santiago. The governor had declared the British ship a legitimate prey, {{but as soon as}} the party left he changed his original ruling. The mission was concluded and they had received orders to return directly, but were low on supplies and where ambushed while trying to fool the crew of a ship by flying a friendly flag. The British crew intended to leave them stranded in Jamaica, however, they found the papers of the ship captured during their previous mission. The crew were treated as pirates and placed on trial as soon as <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> Jamaica. 33 of the 41 members of the crew were executed shortly afterwards. Enríquez blamed the orders of Danío for the audacious actions of his fleet.|$|E

The Fifth Army Corps resumed activity on June 10, 1863, {{as it began}} to travel northward through enemy territory, with skirmishes frequently occurring. These travels ultimately led the Fifth Army Corps to Pennsylvania, where, on July 2, 1863, <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> aid the Union Army during the Battle of Gettysburg. Gwyn, still as acting commander of the regiment, was given the orders to position the 118th Regiment on Cemetery Hill and to hold the position.

[...] On July 3, {{the second day of}} the battle, Gwyn led the 118th to Little Round Top where they held their position for two days until Union forces had achieved albeit a costly victory. Following Gettysburg, the 118th Regiment moved around the state to various positions. On August 6, the regiment stationed at Warrenton, Virginia, received 109 new recruits, and on September 5, another 185. On September 30, 1863, Prevost officially retired, and Gwyn was promoted to colonel and the commanding officer of the 118th.
