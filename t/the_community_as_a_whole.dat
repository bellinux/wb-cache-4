5|$|The Sihanaka {{are one of}} the few Malagasy {{groups who}} {{historically}} branded their cattle. This was done by clipping the clipping the ear of the cow and was a religious act conducted once annually on a dedicated day of feasting. Cattle generally belonged to <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> and were used principally to assist with farming.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{appointed}} by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to {{pledge not to}} represent their national interest, but rather took an oath to defend the general interests of <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office. To further ensure impartiality, {{one third of the}} membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).|$|E
5|$|Comparative {{analyses}} between metagenomes {{can provide}} additional {{insight into the}} function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health. Pairwise or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made {{at the level of}} sequence composition (comparing GC-content or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. Comparisons of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can be {{made on the basis of}} 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or—in the case of low-diversity communities—by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset. Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as COG or KEGG, and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance. This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions. Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is especially important in comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.|$|E

25|$|There are ISKCON {{communities}} {{around the world with}} schools, restaurants and farms. In general, funds collected by ISKCON are treated as communal property and used to support <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> and to promote the preaching mission. Many temples also have programs (like Food for Life) to provide meals for the needy. In addition, ISKCON has recently brought the academic study of Krishna into eastern academia as Krishnology.|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{traditional}} program design, community-based program design often utilizes {{a range of}} tools and models which are meant to enhance the efficacy and outcomes of the program’s design. The difference between traditional design and community-based design, when using these tools, is in {{the dynamics of the}} relationship between the designers, the participants, and <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> It evolved from the Charity Organization Society (COS) and the settlement house movements.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{a speech}} {{community}} that presuppose the existence of that community may reproduce stereotypes that fail to accurately depict the social reality of variance among subgroups within a community and overlapping identities for individuals. Furthermore, studies of gay male language use often look at middle class European Americans who are out as gay {{to the exclusion of}} other subgroups of the LGBTQ community, and hence may draw misleading conclusions about <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} couple of decades there was no {{traditional}} marriage in the kibbutz. If a man and woman wanted to get married, they went to the housing office and requested a room together. Not having traditional marriage was seen as a way to dissolve the patriarchy and give women their own standing without depending on a man (economically or socially) and was also viewed as a positive thing for <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> as communal life was the main aspect of the kibbutz.|$|E
25|$|As {{prescribed}} in the Constitution of Tokelau, {{individual human}} rights are {{those found in the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reflected in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. When exercising these rights, there must be proper recognition of the rights of others and to <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> If an individual believes their rights have been breached they may go to the Council for the Ongoing Government who may make any appropriate order to protect that individual’s rights. There have been no such complaints to date.|$|E

25|$|The Maya calendar, {{connected}} to networks of sacrificial shrines, is fundamental for ritual life. The rites of the 260-day cycle are treated below ('Sciences of Destiny'). Among the highland Maya, the calendrical rites of <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> {{relate to the}} succession of the 365-day years, and to the so-called 'Year Bearers' in particular, that is, the four named days that can serve as new year days. Conceived as divine lords, these Year Bearers were welcomed on the mountain (one of four) {{which was to be}} their seat of power, and worshipped at each recurrence of their day {{in the course of the}} year.|$|E
500|$|The {{impact of}} Rosita has alerted {{residents}} {{to prepare for}} any cyclones that may threaten the town in the future.

[...] Serve & Protect activities, including cooking demonstrations, cook-offs and dinners, are designed to encourage visitors and participants to consume sustainable seafood such as catfish, squid, arctic char and summer flounder, {{as a way of}} removing pressure from threatened fisheries. [...] The Aquarium also participates in the AZA's SAFE (Saving Animals From Extinction) program, focusing on shark conservation.|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the film refers to a video game character, [...] "The Chumscrubber", who helps his friends {{to survive in a}} {{superficial}} world by keeping things authentic, and is portrayed as a post-apocalyptic hero, carrying his severed head in his hand as he fights the forces of evil. The Chumscrubber's world was intended to be a reflection of the Hillside community, shown by the repetition of characters' lines in the video game; a voice in the game yells [...] "Kill him! Stab him! Get him again!", the exact line said by Billy to Lee {{at the end of the}} film, urging him to stab Charlie Bratley. Producer Bonnie Curtis described the character as [...] "this sub-human monster the kids feel they are becoming". Posin commented that [...] "the Chumscrubber is everything that that community has suppressed or denied or tried to ignore, and [...] the idea that the collective denial of <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> finally gives birth to a character that will not be ignored".|$|E
