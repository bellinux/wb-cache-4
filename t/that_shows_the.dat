5|$|Before every battle, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice of using 'Political Tactics,' such as {{increasing}} or decreasing time limit of battles or preventing enemy reinforcements from arriving during battles. The player can also secure alliances with other forces; these alliances can change how the game progresses, such as requesting reinforcements from the allied forces against opposing forces. However, these alliances only last for a set time decided by the tactic used. There's also an 'Archives Mode' <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> motions and voices of the officers. A gallery of character artworks and game movies is also presented within the Archives Mode.|$|E
5|$|From a {{behavioral}} standpoint, {{one of the}} most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops, providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. Cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod Majungasaurus.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} groups of {{dissolved}} phase models: In parallel compartment models, several compartments with varying rates of gas absorption (half time), are considered to exist independently of each other, and the limiting condition {{is controlled by the}} compartment <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> worst case for a specific exposure profile. These compartments represent conceptual tissues and don't represent specific organic tissues. They merely represent the range of possibilities for the organic tissues. The second group uses serial compartments, which assumes that gas diffuses through one compartment before it reaches the next.|$|E

5|$|Several hôtels particuliers (large townhouses) {{date from}} the Renaissance. Most of them have oriel windows that are {{characteristic}} of German Renaissance architecture. The grandest of these hôtels belonged to the Ebersmunster abbey {{and it has a}} large three-story granary. The Ziegler house has a beautiful oriel <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> interest of the elite of that time in Antiquity. The oriel partly reflects Vitruvius's architectural legacy and displays the portraits of four key figures of Antiquity. Baroque architecture is visible on some later hôtels dating from the 17th and 18th century. French classical architecture and its main feature, the mansard roof, were largely employed in the 18th century. To reduce costs, buildings were still built with timber framing, but as this technique was considered too Germanic and rustic, they were often covered with a rendering imitating stone.|$|E
5|$|The Annie Award for Best Animated Video Game {{is awarded}} {{annually}} by ASIFA-Hollywood, {{a non-profit organization}} that honors contributions to animation, to one animated video game each year. The award {{is one of the}} Annie Awards, which are given to contributions to animation, including producers, directors, and voice actors. The Annie Awards were created in 1972 by June Foray to honor individual lifetime contributions to animation. In 1992, the scope of the awards was expanded to honor animation as a whole; the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature was created {{as a result of this}} move, and subsequent awards have been created to recognize different contributions to animation. The Annie Award for Best Animated Video Game was created in 2005, and has been awarded yearly since except in 2009. To be eligible for the award, the game must have been released in the year before the next Annie Awards ceremony, and the developers of the game must send a five-minute DVD <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> gameplay and graphics of the game to a committee appointed by the Board of Directors of ASIFA-Hollywood.|$|E
