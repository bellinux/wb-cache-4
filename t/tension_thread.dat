40|$|Branching {{structures}} {{are based on}} geometric systems that expand through bifurcation without returning to form closed cells. In this sense, branching structures resemble the structure of trees that branch continually outward. In architectural engineering, these forms can be used either as tension or compression systems. Numerous built examples have been produced since the initial inspiring studies made by Frei Otto in the early 1960 's. Form finding techniques based on models {{have been used in}} the past to study these forms. Although thread models can be effective in the study of force paths, they cannot distinguish between tension and compression and have no way to take member buckling into account. But buckling does have an influence on appropriate geometry of a compression system. Also, minimal paths (or pseudo minimal paths based on surface <b>tension</b> <b>thread</b> models) have been used to explore possible geometries for branching structures. In this paper, both surface <b>tension</b> <b>thread</b> models dipped in water, and weighted string models are shown in comparison with ideal tension and compression forms found with a computational method based on Genetic Algorithms. The same computational model is used to find geometries with minimal overall member length. Both 2 D and 3 D geometries are derived...|$|E

40|$|Sewability is very {{significant}} for industrial sewing machines and has received much attention and improvement. In this research, four on-line monitoring sensors are developed for industrial sewing machines {{in order to}} measure sewing parameters and help to detect sewability problems. Specifically, the developed sensors are thread length measurement sensor, thread tension sensor, thread tension setting sensor, and needle force sensor. These sensors can provide detailed information on thread consumption, instantaneous thread <b>tension,</b> <b>thread</b> tension setup, and needle penetration force. The thread length measurement sensor can measure the top thread length that goes into a given sew: According to the experimental results, it is found that this sensor can be used to set up the thread tension properly. Therefore, it can help to minimize the sewability problems. The thread tension sensor can measure the instantaneous thread tension during sewing stitches. Hence, it can detect an improper thread tension setup and help to minimize the sewability problems. However, its high cost limits its application. The thread tension setting sensor is then developed in order for sewing operators to set up the thread tension properly and quickly. It is also a cost-effective sensor that can provide data leading to solutions to the sewability problems. The needle force sensor can measure the instantaneous needle force during needle penetration and withdrawal. The new design of the sensor ensures that the measurements are more accurate than other measurement methods. This sensor can be used to help detect sewability problems resulting from an improper needle penetration force. In summary, the developed sensors can not only be used to measure the sewing parameters and help to detect the sewability problems, but they can also provide a data acquisition method for the automatic control of industrial sewing machines. With these sensors instrumented on industrial sewing machines, the sewability problems will be minimized. Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

30|$|Prediction of {{sewing thread}} {{consumption}} requires an accurate {{method of calculation}} since {{it relates to the}} cost of manufacturing and distribution of apparel products. Previous researchers highlighted problems in existing thread consumption calculation methods; i.e. limitations in existing formulae which cause inaccurate predictions of thread amount needed for sewing operations. The existing methods of consumption calculations exhibit significant error percentages due to the ignorance of important parameters which affect on thread consumption. This paper investigates on correlation of <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> to <b>thread</b> consumption of lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. The existing thread consumption formulae are optimized by considering a new parameter; <b>thread</b> <b>tension,</b> using regression analysis and geometrical modeling techniques. For the chain-stitch 401, results indicate that the <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> significantly affects in determination of the thread consumption. The error analysis of proposed formulae was performed to indicate that the proposed formulae more accurate compared to the available methods of predicting sewing thread consumption. In addition, there are combined effects of <b>thread</b> <b>tensions</b> together with parameters such as fabric thickness and stitch density which determines accurate consumption values considering the properties of the stitch. In comparison, inclusion of the proposed <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> variable depicts reduction in error percentages, so that the proposed formulae are expected to be a better approach to calculate thread consumption of lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401.|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} new parameter; <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> being experimented using standard procedures for two main types of stitches namely lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. For both stitches, <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> affects significantly in determination of thread consumption. In case of chain-stitch 401, there are combined effects of <b>thread</b> <b>tensions</b> together with fabric thickness and stitch density which determines accurate consumption values considering {{the properties of}} the stitch. The analysis of lock-stitch 301 shows a joint effect of <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> and yarn count to the consumption of the needle thread. In comparison, inclusion of proposed <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> variable depicts reduction in error percentages, so that the proposed formulae are expected to be a better approach to calculate thread consumption of lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. Once tension parameter is included in the formulae, apparel manufacturers need to optimize and measure the tension during garment pre-production stage as specified for the geometric requirement of the stitch. The average tension value set for a given stitch under selected stitch density can be measured using MLT Wesco tension meter and that figure need to be substituted in calculating the thread consumption. If researchers are able to introduce a standard table which represents average tension values which determine the correct geometry of the stitches under different stitch density levels, industry personnel or software system can easily refer such table and substitute the tension values to the proposing formulae.|$|R

The three peaks in needle <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> curve and the two peaks in looper <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> curve were observed, but the needle thread was fed twice and the looper thread was fed only once during a cycle of the sewing operation. As the tensions pulling out the needle thread increased, the range of arm shaft turning angle when needle thread was being fed the second time, decreased, a smaller amount of needle threads was fed and the each peak values of needle <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> became large. Also as the tensions pulling out the looper thread increased, the same result was obtained on looper threads. However a smaller amount of needle threads was not fed the first time.

In this research, we shall address the <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> problem.

The thread breakage rate can be reduced from the improvement of the tension system. However, a reliable and economical breakage detection system is also indispensable for an embroidery machine system. But current design of the breakage detection system cannot meet the requirements of the embroidering process at higher and higher speeds. A new detection system is constructed in this research.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A monitored thread guiding device in a knitting machine, in which at least one thread is guided under predetermined tension along a free thread transport zone, has unit(s) for supplying the thread along the zone and a unit for receiving and/or further guiding the <b>tensioned</b> <b>thread.</b> An optical sensor unit, for contact-free detection of thread in the transport zone, generates a control or regulation signal for the thread supply and/or receiving unit(s). The novel feature is that a device for causing sideways oscillation of the thread from its path is provided along the transport zone. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a corresponding monitored thread guiding process, in which controlled transverse oscillations are induced in the thread in the transport zone, optical detection of a consequent dynamic sensor signal is used to indicate an undamaged thread and lack of detection of such a signal is used to detect a broken thread, in which case operation of the knitting machine is halted. USE - For monitored guiding of thread in a knitting machine, especially a circular knitting machine. ADVANTAGE - Guiding of the threads is effectively monitored (especially as regards <b>thread</b> <b>tension)</b> while avoiding additional wear on the knitting machine side components (including the thread itself), so {{that the need for}} expensive and time-consuming maintenance operations is eliminated. Constant thread quality is ensured, especially so that threads of low (specifically non-optically resolvable) roughness are obtained. Yarn guiding within several thread guides can be individually monitored, so that a higher quality knitted product is obtained.
