5|$|A <b>trade</b> {{route is}} a {{logistical}} network {{identified as a}} series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo.

Among notable <b>trade</b> routes was the Amber Road, which served as a dependable network for long-distance <b>trade.</b> Maritime <b>trade</b> along the Spice Route became prominent during the Middle Ages, when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route.

5|$|Economic {{globalization}} grew under free <b>trade,</b> {{starting in}} 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} free <b>trade</b> agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, {{the golden age of}} this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective <b>trade</b> policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international <b>trade</b> continued to grow without slowing.

5|$|In the High Middle Ages, {{although}} the Scottish economy was still dominated by agriculture and by short-distance, local <b>trade,</b> {{there was an}} increasing amount of foreign <b>trade.</b> Coins were replacing barter goods, with Scottish coins being struck from the reign of David I.

Until the disruption caused by the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in the early fourteenth century, most naval <b>trade</b> was probably coastal and most foreign <b>trade</b> was with England.

40|$|Often, a {{relatively}} small group of <b>trades</b> causes the {{major part of the}} <b>trading</b> costs on an investment portfolio. Consequently, reducing the <b>trading</b> costs of comparatively few expensive <b>trades</b> would already result in substantial savings on total <b>trading</b> costs. Since <b>trading</b> costs depend to some extent on steering variables, investors can try to lower <b>trading</b> costs by carefully controlling these factors. As a fi rst step in this direction, this paper focuses on the identifi cation of expensive <b>trades</b> before actual <b>trading</b> takes place. However, forecasting market impact costs appears notoriously diffi cult and traditional methods fail. Therefore, we propose two alternative methods to form expectations about future <b>trading</b> costs.

5|$|The Convention on International <b>Trade</b> in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) first {{listed the}} two known species of slow loris under Appendix II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} Appendix II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international <b>trade,</b> as long as <b>trade</b> will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the <b>trade</b> in slow lorises, however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal <b>trade</b> reported to the CITES Secretariat {{is shown in the}} CITES <b>trade</b> database, where minimal <b>trade</b> by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow lorises remained vulnerable to international <b>trade</b> under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet <b>trade</b> was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow lorises be elevated to Appendix I, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial <b>trade,</b> such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of knowledge as to how to distinguish them.|$|E
