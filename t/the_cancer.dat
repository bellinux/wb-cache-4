5|$|Occasionally {{neuroblastoma}} {{may be due}} to a mutation {{inherited from}} a person's parents. Environmental factors have not been found to be involved. Diagnosis is based on a tissue biopsy. Occasionally it may be found in a baby by ultrasound during pregnancy. At diagnosis <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> has usually already spread. <b>The</b> <b>cancer</b> is divided into low, intermediate, and high risk groups based on a child's age, cancer stage, and what <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> looks like.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibodies}} {{found in}} LEMS associated with lung cancer also bind to calcium channels in <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> cells, {{and it is}} presumed that the antibodies originally develop {{as a reaction to}} these cells.

5|$|Culverhouse was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer in 1992. After a successful operation to remove a tumor and part of his lung, he began chemotherapy a few months later, when a routine exam revealed a recurrence of <b>the</b> <b>cancer.</b> Despite his health problems, he remained a hard worker until the end, and even went hunting in Tanzania only four days after having part of his lung removed.

50|$|Those {{who survive}} cancer develop a second primary cancer at {{about twice the}} rate of those never diagnosed.

5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> {{is located in}} {{the upper part of the}} uterus, and the cervix when <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> is in the lower part of the uterus. <b>The</b> <b>cancer</b> usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Chapman made {{a routine}} {{visit to a}} dentist, who found a small, but {{malignant}} tumour {{on one of his}} tonsils, leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy.

Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill.

40|$|The {{naturally}} occurring virus papillomas of western cottontail rabbits become malignant occasionally. <b>The</b> <b>cancers</b> derive from <b>the</b> papilloma cells, {{that is to}} say from elements already rendered neoplastic by the virus and still infected therewith.

To all three species the virus is foreign. The character of <b>the</b> <b>cancers</b> of <b>the</b> wild rabbits is described and the relation of the virus to them discussed on the basis of experimental findings.

40|$|A {{study of}} 501 new breast cancers in {{patients}} {{seen in a}} consulting surgical practice revealed that 87 % were in patients 45 {{years of age or}} older.

Two thirds of <b>the</b> <b>cancers</b> had an associated visible clinical sign, demonstrating the importance of inspection in the examination of the breast. Dimpling, sometimes apparent only on manipulation of the tumour, was present with 264 of <b>the</b> <b>cancers</b> and was often associated with "minimal" lesions. Mammography was done for 63 of <b>the</b> breast <b>cancers</b> but it missed 27. Of <b>the</b> physician-found <b>cancers</b> 15 were in patients who had already had breast cancer, 4 were in patients presenting with symptomatic metastases and 14 were in women presenting with other disorders. Of <b>the</b> 52 <b>cancers</b> found by periodic examination 3 were locally advanced and 21 had axillary metastases, while among <b>the</b> 28 "early" <b>cancers</b> 12 were in women who were senile, mentally defective or psychotic. Only four of <b>the</b> <b>cancers</b> found by <b>the</b> physicians were in women under age 45; two were rapidly fatal, one had an axillary metastasis, and the fourth was in a woman who had had <b>cancer</b> of <b>the</b> opposite breast. The remaining 284 lesions found by periodic or routine examination in women under age 45 were benign. Thus, periodic or routine examination for unsuspected breast cancer in women under age 45 seems unjustified except in those who have already had breast cancer...|$|R

5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E
