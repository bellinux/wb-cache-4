5000|$|After {{several months}} of {{dramatic}} improvement, Elle, along with Warner and Vivian, is given a surprise internship at Callahan's law office. Callahan is defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, {{who is one of}} Elle's role models and a former member of her sorority. Accused of murdering her husband, Brooke is unwilling <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi</b> (she later reveals to Elle that she was having liposuction). Enrique Salvatore, a pool cleaner and the prosecution's main witness, says that he {{was having an affair with}} Brooke and that they were planning to run off with her husband's money. Elle deduces that Enrique is gay, and Emmett (revealed to be Callahan's junior partner) believes her and during cross-examination tricks Enrique into confessing his homosexuality after tricking him into admitting he has a boyfriend named Chuck, and after denying this Chuck himself stands up and says [...] "You Bitch!" [...] to Enrique in an effeminate voice. In spite of her victory, Elle quits the firm after Callahan attempts to seduce her. When Emmett explains how Callahan's behavior caused Elle to quit her internship, Brooke fires Callahan and replaces him with Elle as her defense. Elle cross-examines Brooke's step-daughter Chutney, forcing her to reveal that she had killed Brooke's husband, though she had actually planned to kill Brooke because she hated that her father married someone her age.|$|E
40|$|The list {{of motives}} by Kanin (1994) {{is the most}} cited list of motives to file a false {{allegation}} of rape. Kanin posited that complainants file a false allegation out of revenge, <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi</b> or to get sympathy. A new list of motives is proposed in which gain is the predominant factor. In the proposed list, complainants file a false allegation out of material gain, emotional gain, or a disturbed mental state. The list can be subdivided into eight different categories: material gain, alibi, revenge, sympathy, attention, a disturbed mental state, relabeling, or regret. To test {{the validity of the}} list, a sample of 57 proven false allegations were studied at and provided by the National Unit of the Dutch National Police (NU). The complete files were studied to ensure correct classification by the NU and to identify the motives of the complainants. The results support the overall validity of the list. Complainants were primarily motivated by emotional gain. Most false allegations were used to cover up other behavior such as adultery or skipping school. Some complainants, however, reported more than one motive. A large proportion, 20 % of complainants, said {{that they did not know}} why they filed a false allegation. The results confirm the complexity of motivations for filing false allegations and the difficulties associated with archival studies. In conclusion, the list of Kanin is, based on the current results, valid but insufficient to explain all the different motives of complainants to file a false allegation...|$|E
60|$|He {{proposed}} to call witnesses {{to show how}} the prisoner, a profligate and spendthrift, had been {{at the end of his}} financial tether, and had also been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a neighbouring farmer's wife. This having come to his stepmother's ears, she taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel ensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner had purchased strychnine at the village chemist's shop, wearing a disguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon another man--to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp's husband, of whom he had been bitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> unimpeachable <b>alibi.</b>|$|R

Brian Fitzgerald (Arthur Shirley) is arrested {{for the crime}} and brought to trial, but is acquitted {{at the last minute}} by Sal Rawlin, a missing witness who <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi.</b> The mystery {{involves}} Brian's fiancee, Madge (Grace Glover).|$|R

She calls {{her friend and}} neighbor Jocelyn Norris, whose daughter is a classmate of Alex's, and learns Alex never went to school. She immediately calls the New York City Police Department, and officers descend on the townhouse, led by Lieutenant Al Menetti. Susan is questioned closely on all aspects {{of her life and}} her son's, and the police initially suspect her estranged husband, Graham, a professor at New York University, but he <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In 1901 he unsuccessfully defended Herbert John Bennett in the Yarmouth Beach case. Bennett {{was charged}} with {{strangling}} his wife, Mary, in order to marry Alice Meadows. At a late stage in the trial Marshall Hall dramatically <b>produced</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi</b> witness, Sholto Douglas, who testified that {{on the day of}} the murder he had met Bennett in Bexley, after the last train for Yarmouth had departed. Douglas was clearly a truthful witness but he had never met Bennett before the date of the murder and the prosecution easily convinced the jury that he had made an honest mistake (which was also Marshall Hall's private opinion [...] ).The defence was weakened by the absence of any other suspect or motive, and by the fact that Bennett was such an obvious liar that he could not be put into the witness box. Curiously enough Marshall Hall, despite the overwhelming evidence, was never entirely sure of Bennett's guilt.|$|R

The unscrupulous lawyer was <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> power of attorney dated some days before, {{so that he might}} act in place of the brokers.

5000|$|The tragedy {{occurred}} when Dr Rosen {{was found at}} the bottom of the stairs, possibly having fallen down, possibly having been pushed. The four people in the locked house were out at the time, but none can <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi</b> for the time of the death. In addition, no strangers were seen in the vicinity, where they would easily have stood out and been spotted, therefore one of the four must be guilty. One puzzle is how the killer received his or her instructions. The only people to come to the house that day were the butcher, the grocer's assistant, and the postman. The latter brought several letters for various members of the house, including a gardening catalogue and a letter for Charles Templeton which appeared to have been sent from relatives in Germany. Templeton ripped it up and threw it away. Of the letters the police were able to examine, the strangest was one addressed to Dr Rosen himself which was from someone called [...] "Georgine" [...] and mentioned several people of whom Rosen had never heard. Sir Henry shows the group the letter and Miss Marple wonders why the word [...] "Honesty", which appears in the middle of a sentence, is spelt with a capital letter.|$|R

50|$|The EBAC first {{coined by}} Samuel et al. (2009) uses {{efficiency}} {{as the main}} determinant to calculate the absorption rate.

For example if Product A needs 200 set ups <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> 100 of its units and Product B needs 50 set ups <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> 100 of its units, Product B is more efficient. This is because Product B needs lesser input or drivers <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> given number of outputs.|$|R
