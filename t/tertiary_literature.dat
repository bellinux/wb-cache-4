'e {{aim of this study}} was to investigate primary performance outcomes through an analysis of temporal patterns. In particular, we were interested in verifying if changes in tertiary performance outcomes may be related to changes in primary ones. We selected three soccer matches played by a top club during the Serie A league over the 2012 - 2013 season in which there was a change in match result between *rst and second half (tertiary level of performance).

40|$|Background: Drug-drug {{interactions}} (DDIs) {{can lead}} to adverse clinical outcomes, particularly in oncology, because of the narrow therapeutic index of chemotherapeutic agents and because patients with cancer are at a high risk due to polypharmacy and age-related organ dysfunction. In a previously published study, drug profiles were developed based on primary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>literature</b> reviews {{for a list of}} clinically significant DDIs involving 28 oral anticancer agents (OAAs). Objective: This study was based on a Delphi survey of oncology pharmacists; the survey results were used to develop a consensus list of clinically significant DDIs involving OAAs and nonanticancer agents. Methods: In this study, the DDI profiles previously developed were updated, and the DDI pairs that were listed both in the 2009 Drug Interaction Facts (DIF) and the Thomson Micromedex DrugDex System compendia and that also met the predetermined criteria for clinical significance were selected for further evaluation. In a 2 -round, electronically administered Delphi survey of oncology pharmacists, a 5 -point Likert scale (1 – 5, where 1 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree) was used to evaluate the DDI pairs based on 8 clinical aspects (clinical importance; irreversible morbidity and mortality; quality of data; quantity of data; patient's organ functions; comorbid conditions; awareness of interaction; and management burden).

These attitudes are indicators of how the Chinese view the natural environment {{and how they are}} likely to behave toward it and respond to efforts to protect it—whether they will practice 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 development and preservation of nature, or instead contribute to practices that are turning China 2 ̆ 7 s air, land and water brown (or even black) with pollution. These attitudes are also important precursors to individual Chinese behaviours and the policies and actions of the Chinese government to combat global warming and climate change. As such, attitudes toward all manner of environmental issues are connected to the issue of climate change. Gathering, synthesizing and comparing findings on Chinese environmental attitudes and related behaviours can help us assess them and ascertain how they influence environmental protection (or harm) and energy use in China. Different people in different parts of China have different environmental attitudes. Environmental awareness and attitudes are associated with individuals 2 ̆ 7 educational level, socio-economic status, living environment and exposure to mass media. By understanding the Chinese view of the environment {{and the degree to which}} the Chinese prioritize it (or not) relative to other important issues, we can perhaps enhance our capacity to start shifting attitudes, values and behaviours toward those that might at least do somewhat less harm to the environment of the Chinese and the world. With this in mind, this essay seeks to summarize some findings on environmental awareness, attitudes and behaviours, while also making some observations regarding their implications.

The general perception and anecdotal {{evidence suggests that}} upon leaving secondary school, people participate less in sports. The decline in physical activity and participation in sport among young people has been discussed in the media during recent decades.

However, the evidence of decreased sport participation is scarce.

40|$|Increasingly, in many leading South African <b>tertiary</b> {{departments}} of <b>literature,</b> early modern studies {{have a fairly}} slim hold on the core curriculum.

Whatever the reason, in such departments, it is no longer possible to get to grips with the contribution of the renaissance to the formation of the modern world. The significance of the broader nomenclature, early modern studies, doesn’t appear to strike home, especially the point that, if students want to understand the world we live in, they have to know this period particularly well. Indeed, they need to have some idea of the interaction between early modern Europe and the literature and ideas of the ancient civilizations of Rome and Greece. If we fail them in this regard, as I believe we are doing to an increasing extent, the result will be generations of intellectual sleepwalkers, denizens of mental landscapes they are responding to, or ‘reading’, in terms of an inner life unaware of important historical continuities and disjunctions; cut off, moreover, from understanding essential features of modernity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Robotic {{technology}} {{is used in}} multiple fields of surgery, especially radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the introduction of robotic technology in the Italian Public Heath-care context, from the perspective of the Health Technology Assessment (HTA). An economic analysis that compares the costs and effectiveness of the method was developed. Data were compared with those of the most important international literature, analyzing structural and organizational problems related to the method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of literature on <b>tertiary</b> <b>literature</b> (Health Technology Assessment reports) and secondary (systematic reviews) published since 2002 was conducted. The review was also conducted on more recent primary literature regarding the clinical effectiveness and the economic analysis in the fields of surgery where Da Vinci robot is most promising. RESULTS: 18 studies were selected out of a total of 65 evaluated. The "Break-Even Point" (BEP) is the minimum number of cases needed to be treated in order to achieve a balance between costs and revenues, below which the system is losing money. It was calculated that the total fixed costs are € 378, 000 and variable costs are € 3, 810 per surgery. Considering that the current value of DRG (Diagnosis-Related Group) refunded by the public Health-care system is actually € 4, 553, the BEP would be achieved performing 508 surgeries, so that the robotic technology does not generate neither profit nor loss. CONCLUSIONS: It is not possible to demonstrate the superiority of robotic surgery in terms of efficacy. The robotic surgery is safe and effective only if performed by surgical teams with relevant experience. Considering the reported case of an Italian University Hospital with public Health-care system refund, the BEP target of 508 radical prostatectomies could be achieved after a few years. The use of the robot in multiple fields on one hand shortens recovery time costs, but on the other hand increases costs due to organizational issues. The value of the DRG refund does not appear adequate to new robotic technolog...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates what {{classroom}} participants do with {{literary texts}} and how literary texts are pedagogically recontextualized through classroom activities in L 2 <b>tertiary</b> <b>literature</b> classrooms. Premised upon the pedagogic processes of decontextualization and recontextualization {{that take place}} in the meaning-making practices of the literature classroom, the current study examines the process of literary text recontextualization via the multimodal partnership of vocalization and gesticulation. Through this process, esoteric literary meanings requiring specialist knowledge are transformed into mundane meanings from one semiotic-institutional domain to another, where the literary text qua cultural artifact is recontextualized via first-order languaging by dint of pedagogic activities. To understand the real-time first-order languaging dynamics (Thibault, 2011 a) that enable the pedagogic recontextualization of literary texts to take place, a micro analytical toolkit grounded in qualitative multimodal interaction analysis is used. This toolkit draws upon the concept of the Growth Point (McNeill & Duncan, 2000) in conjunction with Systemic Functional Grammar (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2004) and McNeill‘s (1992) theory of language and gesture. Classroom observation and video recording in university literature classrooms in Hong Kong and Taiwan provide multimodal data on students‘ languaging behaviours when they engage with literary texts in classroom talk. In order to make links with second-order socio-cultural norms that regulate first-order classroom interactivity (Thibault, 2011 a), Bernstein‘s (1990) sociological theory of recontextualization in education is re-thought from the distributed language view (Cowley, 2011; Steffensen, 2011; Thibault, 2011 a). Maton‘s (2007) Legitimation Codes of Specialization and Hunter‘s (1988) Foucaultian analysis of literature education (Foucault, 1972, 1985 / 1984) also inform the conceptual framework. The findings indicate the stability of the textual and lexicogrammatical constructions that function as second-order constraints and the variations in gesture use in its embodied coordination with speech in the pedagogic process of literary text recontextualization through different pedagogic activities. The semantic cohesive relations of Elaboration, Extension, Enhancement, Engagement, and Equipment, fostered by different gesture types together with their corresponding linguistic constructs in the recontextualized texts, demonstrate that the semiotic integration of speech and gesture comprise a single languaging system in the meaning-making process. Based on the production of literary meaning in moral judgement, the specialized consciousness of the ethical self is raised, with ethical subjects constituted through processes of subjectivity, self-reflexivity, and self-confession in the process of literary interpretation and appreciation. The conceptual framework integrating macro- and micro-levels of analysis manifests its theoretical originality by establishing both the methodological framework for multimodal interaction analysis and the cognitive framework for languaging dynamics. The understanding of the meaning-making process in the first-order languaging dynamics suggests that language is an embodied multimodal process. This major conclusion stimulates a re-thinking of important aspects of classroom interaction that have received little attention. Hopefully, the analysis and findings in the current study illustrate the significance of English literature education and suggest new directions for multimodal research in classroom interaction studies. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Computer Engineering, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2015. Software product line engineering (SPLE) aims to provide pro-active, pre-planned reuse {{at a large}} granularity (domain and product level) to develop applications from a core asset base. By investing upfront in preparing the reusable assets, {{it is expected to}} develop products with lower cost, get them to the market faster and produce with higher quality. In alignment with these goals di erent SPLE processes have been proposed that usually de ne the SPLE process using the two lifecycles of domain engineering and application engineering. In domain engineering a reusable platform and product line architecture is developed. In application engineering the results of the domain engineering process are used to develop the product members. One of the most important core assets in SPLE is the software architecture. Hereby we can distinguish between the product line architecture and application architecture. The product line architecture is developed in the domain engineering process and represents the reference architecture for the family of products. The application architecture represents the architecture for a single product and is developed by reusing the product line architecture. It is important that the application architectures remain consistent with the product line architecture to ensure global consistency. However, due to evolution of the product line architecture and/or the application architecture inconsistencies might arise leading to an architecture drift. In the literature several architecture conformance analysis approaches have been proposed but these have primarily focused on checking the inconsistencies between the architecture and code. Architecture conformance analysis within the scope of SPLE has not got much attention. In this thesis we rst present the results of our <b>tertiary</b> systematic <b>literature</b> review to systematic reviews on software product line testing. Subsequently, we propose a systematic architecture conformance analysis approach for detecting inconsistencies between product line architecture and application architecture. For supporting the approach we adopt the notion of re exion modeling in which architecture views of product line architecture are compared to the architecture views of the application architecture. For illustrating our approach we use the Views and Beyond approach together with a running case study. Furthermore, we present the provided tool support for the presented approach. Our evaluation shows that the approach and the corresponding tool are e ective in identifying the inconsistencies between product line architectures and application architectures. by Onur Özdemir. M.

40|$|When an asphalt {{mixture is}} {{subjected}} to a destructive compressive load, it experiences a sequence of three deformation stages, as follows: the (1) primary, (2) secondary, and (3) <b>tertiary</b> stages. Most <b>literature</b> research focuses on plastic deformation in the primary and secondary stages, such as prediction of the flow number, which {{is in fact the}} initiation of the tertiary stage. However, little research effort has been reported on the mechanistic modeling of the damage that occurs in the tertiary stage. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a mechanistic characterizing method for the damage modeling of asphalt mixtures in the tertiary stage. The preliminary study conducted by the writers illustrates that deformation during the tertiary flow of the asphalt mixtures is principally caused by the formation and propagation of cracks, which was signaled by the increase of the phase angle in the tertiary phase. The strain caused by the growth of cracks is the viscofracture strain, which can be obtained by conducting the strain decomposition of the measured total strain in the destructive compressive test. The viscofracture strain is employed in the research reported in this paper to mechanistically characterize the time-dependent fracture (viscofracture) of asphalt mixtures in compression. By using the dissipated pseudostrain energy-balance principle, the damage density and true stress are determined and both are demonstrated to increase with load cycles in the tertiary stage. The increased true stress yields extra viscoplastic strain, which is the reason why the permanent deformation is accelerated by the occurrence of cracks. To characterize the evolution of the viscofracture in the asphalt mixtures in compression, a pseudo J-integral Paris' law in terms of damage density is proposed and the material constants in the Paris' law are determined, which can be employed to predict the fracture of asphalt mixtures in compression...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{case study}} explores {{the connection between}} electronic communication technology and faculty productivity. Despite the pervasive use of e-mail and other electronic communication media at educational institutions, few studies investigate the relationship of electronic communication to faculty productivity. In this study, sixteen faculty members from a public, medium-sized, and instruction-oriented college in Western Canada answered detailed questions about their professional on-line behaviour. Questions explored response times to student on-line enquiries, the appropriateness of using electronic communication for certain tasks and topics, and its overall impact on faculty productivity. Suggestions were also solicited for improving application of the technology at the college. Participants tracked all incoming and outgoing electronic communications for seven consecutive days, recording quantity of communications sent and received, time spent, and actions taken. In addition, instructors rated incoming communications {{in terms of their}} work-related relevance. Results were evaluated, using Anthony Giddens’ Structuration Theory as a theoretical framework, and were compared to related studies performed at <b>tertiary</b> institutions. The <b>literature</b> review of studies on electronic communication at higher-education institutions identified themes of gender, age, time, and communication; all of these themes, along with faculty productivity, are explored in the current study. The majority of participants in this study feel that electronic communication increases their overall productivity. However, most also mention elements of this technology which decrease their productivity, citing factors such as miscommunications, reduced face-to-face contact, and excessive volume and time spent on electronic messaging. Time logs maintained during the study reveal that participants may delete or not read electronic communications relevant to their work, suggesting other avenues of communication may be more effective for dissemination of information. This analysis indicates a need for policy regarding response times and suitable on-line behaviour and recommends further training in effective and appropriate use of electronic communication...|$|R
40|$|The Lifelong Learning and Library Connection as a {{model for}} {{tertiary}} library customer education examined the transitional skill and ability expectations of undergraduate tertiary education students to propose a Perceptual Model of lifelong learning as an alternative to behavioural and relational models which are more experientially or practice based. The hypothesis was that the personal perceptions of customers can mirror personal reality. What customers believe can predict what they will pursue. Therefore a Perceptual Model can offer the advantage of facilitating lifelong learning through library customer education approaches geared to the sequential levels of skills needed by customer groups. The perceptual model proposed is comprised of areas that, according to literature, can most affect the lifelong learning skills and abilities of students. It considered the affect of perceptions on these areas rather than measuring skills as in other models. The model may be visualized as a ladder that sequentially leads to higher level skills as perceptual awareness of information needs increases. Using details obtained from literature reviewed about the theoretical and practical applications of lifelong learning and the role of tertiary libraries, questions on the perceptions of customers were raised. Literature was categorized into four foci: customer group segmentation; library use issues; library skills assessment; and library integration into <b>tertiary</b> life. <b>Literature</b> portrayed gaps in customer perceptions research in these areas. These gaps were manipulated to encapsulate the key questions, concepts and principals for the study. These were: • Segmentation (Focus A) – What are the most appropriate divisions of customer groups to facilitate a lifelong learning development through library customer education? What are the segments customers belong to and do these groups have homogeneous customer education needs? What are the lifelong learning needs to be met or assisted by the library through customer education? • Library Issues (Focus B); Skills Assessment (Focus C); Course Integration (Focus D) – What are customer 2 ̆ 7 s personal methodologies for using libraries and information resources, and the library use rationale or personal feelings and motivations associated with using libraries and information resources? What are the personal perceptions of students regarding the value of library customer education required for the library to positively influence lifelong learning behaviour and philosophies? What are the future directions for the library to improve their lifelong learning role through customer education? One of the primary goals of libraries is to facilitate lifelong learning. These are the pivotal points for lifelong learning but because personal perceptions are developed by individuals over many years, library customer education is required to help develop a lifelong learning attitude. This case study targeted the students of a tertiary institute to assist in identifying the most affective library customer education segment focus for fostering lifelong learning attitudinal and skill development.

40|$|M. A. In {{the pages}} that follow, a reader {{training}} model is presented (in chapter one) {{which may be}} used to implement a training programme for <b>tertiary</b> students of <b>literature.</b> Many students enrolling for literature courses do not have sufficient background knowledge required to become critical readers; they often lack the linguistic ability and the literary insight needed to deal with texts in a meaningful manner. Research into reading plays a significant role in teaching students how to activate background knowledge, and how to become skilled, critical readers. The reader training model presented deals with reading on three levels. The first phase deals with the recognition of textual conventions and the activation of schemata and basic links. Technical skills are involved in reading at this level. During the second phase, the reader moves into the comprehensibility of language and the interpretation oftext. Reading activities focus on naturalisation and higher order integration. To read on this level students require integrative cognitive skills and strategies in order to establish links and recognise parallels in the text. The third phase of the reader training model is the focus of this study. Creative and critical cognitive skills and strategies are required to interpret, criticise and contextualise the text. Relevant literary (and non-literary) texts are essential to the reader, since meaningful interaction with the text cannot take place at an advanced level if the reader is unable to contextualise the discourse. The aim {{of this study is to}} equip the literature facilitator with practical guidelines for the implementation of a bridging course for <b>literature</b> students at <b>tertiary</b> level.

40|$|Master of EducationThis {{research}} project explored an expansive but as yet unexplored topic-global managerial identity. It developed {{an understanding of}} this phenomenon {{in the context of}} Australia's tall poppy syndrome and the experience of global chief executive officers in the postmodern era. The rationale for conducting the research was: Australia's ability to create world-class managers will be improved through understanding the management learning trajectories of global managers. In the context of this research and from the perspective of management learning theory a dilemma presents itself. While management learning (phronesis or practical knowledge - practical wisdom) appears inevitably to accompany management education (techne or technical knowledge), the literature of management learning as learning `from', `at' and `through' work reveals that considerable learning occurs outside formal <b>tertiary</b> curricula. The <b>literature</b> on management education, on the other hand, identifies descriptive and prescriptive lists of management attributes, characteristics, profiles, generic skills and competency structures without explaining how these are linked to global managerial identities in the context of whole-of-life learning. This research was conducted as a qualitative investigation of the formation of a global manager's professional identity in the context of management learning; it gained rich descriptions of the learning trajectory of this individual. Data extracted and analyzed from an interview with the global manager in London and consequent follow-up questions focused upon a global manager's ideas, thoughts, experiences and values. Findings reveal that global CEO learning focuses on whole-person learning and whole-of- life learning; it is intense and multifaceted. Conclusions of the research assert that: (i) both informal and formal learning are important to the formation of global managerial identities; (ii) a three-dimensional model of 1 eaming/education is conducive to global managerial identity: intensification (management learning), specialization (core competency skills) and generalization (the liberal arts); and (iii) Australian managers can learn from the' learning trajectory of a global chief executive officer who did not suffer from the tall poppy syndrome.

30|$|Note {{that the}} {{coefficient}} estimates {{on the control}} variables fit what is widely known from traditional wage regressions, {{in terms of both}} signs and magnitudes. The gender wage penalty ranges from 15 to 24 log points, depending on the set of control variables included in the model. The age earnings profile is concave, peaking around age 45 (results in column 4, which includes controls for job and firm attributes, as most often found in the <b>literature).</b> <b>Tertiary</b> education yields a large return over upper secondary education, in the order of 13 to 14 log points (in column 4, see the difference between the return to tertiary and upper secondary education) (for an overview of the effect of educational levels on earnings, see Psacharopoulos 1994). Introducing controls for the worker ability as proxied by its capacity to understand the survey questions (column 3) does not change the sign or magnitude of the coefficients previously estimated, while pointing to a wage premium for more able workers (ability 2); nevertheless, the impact of ability becomes non-significant once we account for the job characteristics, firm characteristics, and worker broad occupation. Larger firms pay higher wages. Part-time work is associated with lower wages, either because there is a penalty on hourly wages for part-time work or, by construction, when relying on earnings data instead of hourly wages. The impact of individual trade union membership, though positive, is not significant, as would be expected in European countries, where extension of collective bargaining contracts to non-unionized workers is widespread. Workers performing supervisory tasks earn a wage premium of approximately 12 %; those on open-ended contracts earn a wage premium of 21 %. 11 Married or cohabiting workers earn higher wages, consistent with the literature on the marital-status wage premium (Blackburn and Korenman 1994). All of these estimates are very robust to the introduction of controls for the regional unemployment rate in Table 3. The fact that the estimates of the coefficients on the other variables included in the model fit remarkably well the expectations drawn from the profusion of literature on wage regressions in general, and the regional wage curve in particular, points to the reliability of the procedure followed to infer earnings data from the ESS data.|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. (Science Education) The {{topic of}} {{evolutionary}} theory {{is new to}} the South African Life Sciences curriculum, having only been introduced in 2008 to the grade 12 cohort. A great deal of controversy and discussion surrounds {{the teaching and learning}} of evolution in many countries, and since the introduction of the topic, including South Africa. The primary source of this controversy arises from the conflict that many Christian and Muslim people experience between what their respective religions teach them about the act of Creation by God and the biological theory of evolution. As a result of its recent inception into South African school, not much research has been done to explore how this topic is experienced by Hindu secondary school learners and teachers. The aim of this study is therefore to address two gaps, firstly to add to the almost total lack of information about the Hindu perspective of the topic of evolution. Secondly, to add to the knowledge base of the teaching and learning of evolution in secondary schools since the scant information available on the teaching and learning of evolution in South Africa is mainly confined to <b>tertiary</b> education. <b>Literature</b> was reviewed on various aspects relevant to this study such as the PCK, NOS, CCC, Hinduism and the teaching and learning of evolution overseas and locally. In order to investigate the lived experiences of Hindu Life Sciences teachers and learners to the topic of evolution a qualitative study with elements of phenomenology was the chosen research design. This prompted the need to use a series of focus group and individual interviews with the various role-players as laid out by the overarching conceptual framework CHAT, the lens through which this study was viewed. Triangulation of data increased {{the reliability and validity of}} this study and was obtained by interviewing a Hindu priest as well as Hindu parents of Life Sciences learners. Interviews were transcribed, coded using the coding model by Saldana (2009) and analysed according to common themes. The main finding of this study was that Hindu teachers and learners experience no conflict with the topic of evolution thus displaying a lack of major tensions linked to the CHAT model. Many Hindus are however ignorant of their religion and scriptures but nevertheless remain accepting of the theory of evolution. Their acceptance could be attributed to three major tenets of Hinduism that link to evolutionary concepts: the cyclical concept of time; the evolution of the soul during reincarnation and the idea that during times of calamity, God manifests on Earth in the form of Avatāras. Misconceptions of evolutionary theory abound among learners and to a lesser extent the parents and teachers, particularly with respect to the notion of common ancestry. The teachers had adequate PCK but their knowledge of the NOS was limited. Recommendations emerging from these findings therefore warrant greater attention to the NOS in both PRESET and INSET teacher training courses. These courses can also use the lack of tensions between the Hindu religion and the topic of evolution as a case in point to show that religion and science can exist in harmony with each other. The concept of a nearest common ancestor (NCA) should also be emphasised in these courses – thereby helping to dispel the misconception that humans descended directly from apes...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Chemistry) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Computational {{chemistry}} is growing more versatile in assisting in understanding chemical phenomena. As computing power becomes more expeditious, so can {{the complexity and}} rigor of quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate through computational procedures that QM calculations can help predict and explain {{the complexities of the}} chemical phenomena within reaction mechanisms. The first system to be studied was the catalytic mechanism of deformylation by the metalloenzyme peptide deformylase, which is a potential antibacterial target. A biomimetic model was used for the active site that was modified with varying substituents. Hammett plots were used to examine trends in reaction energies with the varying substituents, which were tracked to changes in the bond orders between the metal center and substrate throughout the reaction. As the substituents became more electron-donating, the reaction became more thermodynamically favorable, and as the substituents became more electron-donating or electronwithdrawing the rate of reaction decreased. The second project examined competing pathways of electron transfer (inner sphere versus outer sphere) between multiple metal-salens (Ni(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), and Co(II)) and electron-deficient alkenes (methyl acrylate and acrylamide). Overall, the order of thermodynamic favorability for electron transfer was found to be Zn(II) >Ni(II) ??Co(II) >Cu(II). Results indicate a vi kinetic preference for OS electron transfer, which holds generally across the different metal centers and alkenes. The reduced Ni(II) - and Zn(II) -salen have significantly lower OS electron transfer barriers versus reduced Cu(II) - and Co(II) -salen, consistent with the higher oxidation potentials for reduced Ni(II) - and Zn(II) -salen. Reduced Ni(II) - and Zn(II) -salen likewise show a much lower activation energy for IS electron transfer, which is attributed to ligand- versus metalbased reduction of the neutral salen in the Ni(II) and Zn(II) cases. The last project was to design a theoretical enzyme active site (theozyme) for a Morita- Baylis-Hillman reaction that would be lower in activation energy compared to a tertiary amine catalyzed reaction as well as an uncatalyzed reaction. Single amino acids were placed around a transition state complex between p-nitrobenzaldehyde and acrylamide in order to stabilize the formation of charges as well as to coordinate the reactants to an optimal arrangement. The amino acids that stabilized the transition state the most at each position would have their individual stabilization energies combined, and this overall stabilization then compared to the energy barriers of the literature mechanisms. The final theozyme arrangement lowered the energy barrier of the uncatalyzed reaction by nearly 50 kcal*mol- 1, and was lower in activation energy by over 20 kcal*mol- 1 compared to the <b>literature</b> <b>tertiary</b> amine catalyzed mechanisms.
