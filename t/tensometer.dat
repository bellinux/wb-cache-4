50|$|A <b>tensometer</b> is {{a device}} used to {{evaluate}} the tensile properties of materials such as their Young's modulus (i.e. {{the degree to which they}} stretch under stress) and tensile strength. It is usually a universal testing machine loaded with a sample between two grips that are either adjusted manually or automatically to apply force to the specimen. The machine works either by driving a screw or by hydraulic ram. The latter have the great advantage of being able to create much more complex loading patterns, such as the cyclical loads needed for measurement of fatigue strength. Machines can also be equipped with environmental chambers for testing at different temperatures or variable humidity, for example.|$|E
50|$|The {{so-called}} calibration coefficients play {{an important}} role in the residual stress evaluation. They are used to convert the relieved deformations to the original residual stress in the material. The coefficients can be theoretically derived for a through hole and a homogeneous stress. Then they depend only on the material properties, hole radius, and the distance from the hole. In the vast majority of practical applications, however, the preconditions for using the theoretically derived coefficients are not met, e.g., the integral deformation over the <b>tensometer</b> area is not included, the hole is blind instead of through, etc. Therefore, coefficients taking into account the practical aspects of measuring are used. They are mostly determined by a numerical computation using the finite element method. They express the relation between the relieved deformations and the residual stresses, taking into account the hole size, hole depth, shape of the tensometric rosette, material, and other parameters.|$|E

40|$|Ever more {{attention}} has been paid to geotechnical problems induced by wetting and drying of soils recently. Suction up to 80 kPa, measured by tensometers, has been used for analyzing geotechnical problems such as slope instability during wetting and drying. However, existing <b>tensometer</b> generally has a long response time and is easy to cavitate since it has a large volume of water reservoir and complicated internal structure. These drawbacks affect the sensitivity and reliability of a conventional <b>tensometer</b> seriously. In order to overcome these shortcomings, a newly developed fabricated <b>tensometer</b> is introduced. This type of new <b>tensometer</b> with fabricated structure has a simple internal structure and a small volume of water reservoir. At the same time, a drainage hole is introduced to prevent large excess pore water pressure during the process of reassembling. More importantly, its saturation procedure is simple and efficient since the high air-entry ceramic disc and pore pressure transducer of this new <b>tensometer</b> can be disassembled for saturation separately and effectively. After the saturation of the high air-entry ceramic disc and pore pressure transducer, these key components are reassembled together as a <b>tensometer</b> ready for use. As compared with a conventional <b>tensometer,</b> the sensitivity and reliability of this new <b>tensometer</b> are justified. The results of calibration test show that the sensitivity of the new <b>tensometer</b> increases by 90 % by comparing with the conventional <b>tensometer.</b> In the case of measuring the pore water pressure of - 80 kPa, the equilibrium time required for this new <b>tensometer</b> is only 1. 5 minite, about 10 % of that for the conventional tensiometer. Moreover, the reliability of the new <b>tensometer</b> is better than that of the conventional <b>tensometer.</b> The measurement error of the conventional tensiometer is about 30 %, when measuring the pore water pressure of - 80 kPa.

Results for these analyses were used to generate 1) guidelines for designing a <b>tensometer</b> that satisfies the necessary accuracy requirements, and 2) a formula for calculating PS and the instrument sensitivity.

Soils sampled from vegetable farms in south east Queensland were incubated in the laboratory under controlled moisture and temperature conditions. Three methods were used to measure soil microbial activity, a respirometry method and two methods using the cotton strip assay (CSA) technique (image analysis and <b>tensometer).</b> The standard CSA method measured loss of tensile strength over a 35 day incubation period of buried cotton strips using a <b>tensometer.</b> The new CSA technique measured the intensity of staining by microbes using a flatbed scanner to create {{an image of the}} cotton strip whose staining percentage was determined using Photoshop® software. The respirometry method used the substrate induced respiration rate (SIR) to determine microbial biomass in the soil at day 12 of incubation. The strong correlation between the image analysis method and the <b>tensometer</b> method (r 2 = 0. 81), a technique used by scientific researchers, suggests that the image analysis method could be used to monitor aspects of soil biological health by general community land-care groups and farmers. The image analysis method uses equipment which is readily available and, while not strongly correlated with more precise measurements of soil biological activity such as microbial biomass (r 2 = 0. 26), it can detect gross trends in biological health in a soil monitoring program. The CSA method using image analysis was the cheapest technique to measure soil microbial activity. CSA using image analysis can be a valuable tool in conjunction with other simple indicators of soil physical and chemical health such as slaking and pH to monitor soil amelioration or rehabilitation programs...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of an in-situ <b>tensometer</b> is described along with preliminary results of x-ray line profiles from copper foils under tensile stress. The <b>tensometer</b> was designed and constructed on the high resolution diffraction instrument, Station 2. 3 at the synchrotron radiation source (SRS) Daresbury Laboratory, and is capable of collecting data in either symmetric or asymmetric geometry including transmission and reflection modes. Experiments were carried out using 18 J [...] Lm thick copper foil up to strain levels of 5 % using both symmetric reflection and symmetric transmission diffraction. All profiles displayed diffraction broadening and asymmetry which increased with strain. In addition, the asymmetry observed in symmetric transmission was associated with extended tails on the low angle side of the profiles, but in symmetric reflection data the opposite asymmetry was observed. In the analysis, the measured profiles were fitted using the software TOPAS, a fundamental parameters approach to profile fitting. The instrumental profile function was characterised and modelled using annealed LaB 6 powder. The diffraction broadening was then determined by refining the convolution of a Voigt function, an asymmetric exponential function and a fixed instrument function to reproduce the observed broadened profiles. The integral breadth and asymmetry results display a strong order dependence and increase almost linearly with strain.
