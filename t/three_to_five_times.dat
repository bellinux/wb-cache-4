40|$|AbstractSuperparasitism {{occurs in}} Cotesia glomerata L. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a gregarious endoparasitoid of Pieris spp. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae). The {{responses}} of Pieris brassicae L. larvae to superparasitism {{were examined in}} order to elucidate the ecological significance of this behaviour. Models of tritrophic interactions often imply that attraction of herbivore natural enemies by the plant constitutes a defence. Parasitoid attack on herbivores is assumed {{to result in a}} reduction in herbivory and or an increase in plant fitness. Coupled with the active involvement of the plant in producing signals, this can be seen as an indirect mediation of wound induced defence. The results show that superparasitism of P. brassicae by the parasitoid C. glomerata reduced survivorship but increased food consumption and weight growth in P. brassicae larvae. The duration of host larval development was found prolonged as the number of oviposition increased and superparasitized larvae (<b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>time</b> parasitized) grew slower than unparasitized larvae or larvae parasitized one or two times...|$|R

The HIV vertical transmission can occur in utero, during delivery or while breastfeeding. The present study investigated the phylodynamics of the HIV- 1 env gene in mother-to-child transmission, by analyzing one chronically infected pair from Brazil and three acutely infected pairs from Zambia, with <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>time</b> points. Sequences from 25 clones from each sample were obtained and aligned using Clustal X. ML trees were constructed in PhyML using the best evolutionary model.

The genetic variability of previously described epitopes were investigated and compared between each individual time points and between mother and child sequences. The relaxed molecular clock was the best-fitted model for all datasets. The tree topologies did not show differentiation in the evolutionary dynamics of the virus circulating in the mother from the child viral population. In the BSP, the effective population size was more constant along the time in the chronically infected patients while in the acute patients it was possible to detect bottlenecks. The genetic variability within viral epitopes recognized by the human immune system was considerably higher among the chronically infected pair in comparison with acutely infected pairs.

Over 460 genomes were generated from <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> different <b>time</b> points over a 2 -year period. We found multiple-linked-resistant mutations in both treatment failures. However, the CT-F patient showed a stepwise accumulation of diverse, linked mutations whereas the STI-F patient had lineage turnover between treatment periods with recirculation of wild-type and resistant variants from reservoirs. The STI-F patient showed a 7 -fold increase in the third codon position substitution rate relative to the first and second positions compared to a 2 -fold increase for CT-F and increased purifying selection in the pol gene (62 vs. 22 sites, respectively).

30|$|In 2008, a law {{change was}} {{introduced}} to require self-support of all resident partners requesting entry for existing or new spouses, including Norwegian citizens above 23  years (who had previously been exempted).

As Helga Eggebø notes, it is ironic that while the new income requirement was intended to incentivize more resident spouses to be independent of their families’ support, the same rule - by not including incoming spouses’ income in the tally of the required amount – assumed the latter to be dependent on their already resident partners (Eggebø, 2010, p. 304).

40|$|Forecasts of {{financial}} distress {{have been less}} frequently studied for privately held firms than for publicly traded firms. To contribute to the scarce literature on financial distress prediction for private firms, this study develops logistic regression and neural network models to forecast financial distress for privately held firms in the European Union using a set of risk factors as explanatory variables. Using a very large private dataset of over 6 million firm-year observations extracted from the ORBIS database, the study consists of three applications of predictive models to financial distress problems: the first focuses on using a set of risk factors as early symptoms or indicators {{of financial}} distress, the second on estimating financial distress prediction models over short and long time horizons and the third on comparing logistic regression and neural networks as two distinct classifiers in a very large private dataset. This study conducts a descriptive analysis of private firms’ data from 2002 to 2011 {{in order to address}} the first research problem. The descriptive analysis includes the variation of annual failure rates across industries and regions, the association of failure rates with macroeconomic variables, and a comparison of firm-specific variables for failed and active firms over a five-year period leading up to failure. In addition to the effects of industry, region and business cycles on failure risk, this study finds that the symptoms of financial distress include a relatively constant value of natural logarithm of total assets and a stable increase in creditors/total liabilities over a 4 -year period prior to failure, and a steady or rapid decline in liquidity and asset structural soundness and a stable or rapid increase in leverage over a 5 -year period prior to failure. To address the second and third research problems, this study estimates logistic regression and neural network models to predict financial distress for privately held firms over one <b>to</b> <b>five</b> year <b>time</b> horizons, incorporating both firm-specific and macroeconomic variables. The study provides evidence of the incremental value of macroeconomic variables over firm-specific variables for both logistic regression and neural networks predict financial distress up to as early as <b>five</b> years prior <b>to</b> failure with acceptable discrimination. The predictive models estimated also allow us to compare the predictive accuracy of logistic regression and neural networks in a very large private dataset: over one to two year time horizons, logistic regression and neural networks achieve similar predictive accuracy; over <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> year <b>time</b> horizons, neural networks outperform logistic regression but not substantially. To check whether the finding holds that logistic regression compares well with neural networks, this study conducts two additional tests. The first test, which estimates single-period models with the addition of new explanatory variables, finds that neural networks do not substantially outperform logistic regression until {{a very large number of}} explanatory variables are used. The second test estimates multiple-period models conditional on the current levels of the continuous variables, and their lagged levels and changes separately. The second test yields evidence of the overfitting of neural networks: neural networks outperform logistic regression in terms of in-sample distress prediction, but they compare unfavourably with logistic regression in terms of out-of-sample distress prediction. Overall, logistic regression remains a predictive alternative to neural networks given its predictive accuracy, high generalisability and highly interpretable and easy-to-share output...|$|R

Subglacial P weathering is mainly a physical process and detrital P represents more than 99 %, of the precipitation-corrected total P denudation flux (234 and 540 kg km(- 2) yr(- 1) for the Rhone and Oberaar catchments, respectively). The calculated detrital P flux rates are <b>three</b> <b>to</b> almost <b>five</b> <b>times</b> higher than the world average flux. The precipitation-corrected soluble reactive P (SRP) flux corresponds to 1. 88 - 1. 99 kg km(- 2) yr(- 1) (Rhone) and 2. 12 - 2. 44 kg km(- 2) yr(- 1) (Oberaar), respectively. These fluxes are comparable to those of tropical rivers draining transport-limited, tectonically inactive weathering areas. In order to evaluate the efficiency of detrital P weathering in the Rhone and Oberaar proglacial areas, we systematically graded apatite grains extracted from the chronosequence in each catchment relative to weathering-induced changes in their surface morphologies (grades 1 - 4). Fresh apatite grains are heavily indented and dissolution rounded (grade 1). LIA grains from two 0 - 10 cm deep moraine samples show extensive dissolution etching, similar to surface grains from the YD profile (mean grades 2. 7, 3. 5 and 3. 5, respectively). In these proglacial deposits, the weathering front deepens progressively as a function of time due to biocorrosion in the evolving acidic pedosphere, with mechanical indentations on grains acting as sites of preferential dissolution. We also measured iron-bound, organic and detrital P concentrations in the chronosequence and show that organic and iron-bound P has almost completely replaced detrital P in the top layers of the YD profiles. Detrital P weathering rates are calculated as 3 10 and 280 kg km(- 2) yr(- 1) for LIA moraines and 10 kg km(- 2) yr(- 1) for YD tills. During the first 300 years of glacial sediment exposure P dissolution rates are shown to be approximately 70 times higher than the mean global dissolved P flux from ice-free continents. After 11. 6 kyr the flux is 2. 5 times the global mean. These data strengthen the argument for substantial changes in the global dissolved P flux on glacial-interglacial timescales. A crude extrapolation from the data described here suggests that the global dissolved P flux may increase by 40 - 45 % during the first few hundred years of a deglaciation phas...|$|R
40|$|U-Pb {{data from}} lunar meteorites Yamato (Y) - 86032 and Y- 793274 confirm {{that they are}} of lunar origin, but also {{indicate}} {{that they are not}} from the same source region on the Moon and experienced different events while residing as lunar regolith. The Pb of both clast and matrix from Y- 86032 is the least radiogenic among lunar meteorites thus far analyzed, similar to that of lunar anorthosite 60025,and indicates derivation from a low-^ U/^ Pb (μ) source, assuming initial lunar Pb compositions were essentially primitive in nature. Whereas the data from Y- 86032 plot slightly above the geochron on a ^ Pb/^ Pb vs. ^ Pb/^ Pb diagram, data from 60025 and Y- 82192 (considered a pare of Y- 86032) plot precisely on the geochron. Very small amounts of U, Th, and Pb were leached from Y- 86032 using 0. 1 N HBr; the Pb isotopic compositions of the leaches are essentially modern terrestrial values, indicating that this rock probably did not reside long at the lunar surface and was not exposed to volatile-rich gases expelled during impact event (s). In contrast, large amounts of the <b>three</b> elements (up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> those of Y- 86032) were removed from Y- 793274 during leaching, and the Pb isotopic compositions of these leaches are very radiogenic and similar to those of mare basalt and some lunar soils, indicating that this rock was subjected to lunar impactrelated, volatile-rich gases containing radiogenic ^ Pb-rich Pb, very similar to typical lunar soils and some breccias containing significant amounts of marederived material. This is the first occurrence of leaches that are more ^ Pb-rich than their corresponding residues and indicate that the meteorite may have originated from near a mare region. To compare, the Pb from leaches of Y- 791197 clasts (N. NAKAMURA et al.; Mem. Natl Inst. Polar Res., Spec. Issue, 41, 106, 1986 a) was ^ Pb-poor, indicating the meteorite may have originated from the lunar highlands. The Pb in residues of Y- 793274 is more radiogenic than that of Y- 86032 and Y- 82192,similar to that in ALHA 81005 and lunar anorthositic gabbros 78155 and 15418,and indicate a lunar source region with high-μ (> 100 and possibly as high as 300).
