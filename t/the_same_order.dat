5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the {{diffraction}} pattern because their wavelength λ is typically <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>order</b> of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial diffraction gratings for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Chargers got 16 first downs, {{compared}} to 5 for the Buccaneers. Chargers {{players and coaches}} praised the Buccaneers’ defense, who held them to 9 points until the final three minutes of the game, saying that they played the equivalent of five quarters.

The Chargers finished with 325 yards of offense to the Buccaneers’ 125. Inconsistent blocking was blamed for the offensive problems, a situation that was not helped by the injury to tackle Dave Reavis. Mercury Morris, who had been picked up on waivers by the Chargers from the Miami Dolphins after the Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Dolphins, commented that the difference in Buccaneers’ offensive line protection between the two games was like watching two different teams.

5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>order</b> as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E
