5|$|As the {{fighting}} was seemingly coming to an end, Carmelo Anthony confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Jared Jeffries immediately tried to attack Anthony but tripped over Marcus Camby, before being restrained by coaches and teammates, while Anthony backed up towards the Nuggets' bench. Collins also ran down <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> get at Anthony but was blocked by Nenê and Smith.

5|$|Despite his retirement, Johnson {{was voted}} by fans {{as a starter}} for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game at Orlando Arena, {{although}} his former teammates Byron Scott and A. C.

Johnson led the West to a 153–113win and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25points, 9assists, and 5rebounds.

5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>to</b> review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{appointed}} four justices to the Supreme Court of the United States.

After briefly considering awaiting another vacancy and appointing them both, he chose Taft as chief justice.

5|$|In Marbury, the Supreme Court {{held that}} Madison's failure {{to deliver the}} {{commission}} to Marbury was illegal, but did not grant Marbury a writ of mandamus {{on the ground that}} § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>to</b> issue such writs under its original jurisdiction. Stuart v. Lairdinvolving a civil judgment rendered by a circuit court constituted under the Midnight Judges Act and enforced by a circuit court constituted under the Judiciary Act of 1802challenged the constitutionality both of abolishing the circuit judgeships and of requiring the Supreme Court justices to ride circuit. In a brief opinion, the Court rejected both challenges.|$|E
