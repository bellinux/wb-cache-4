5|$|The {{report was}} the result of many {{cooperating}} agencies that often had conflicting goals. An initial draft was submitted to Everglades National Park management who asserted not enough water would be released to the park quickly enough—that the priority went to delivering water to urban areas. When <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> refuse to support it, the plan was rewritten to provide more water to the park. However, the Miccosukee Indians have a reservation in between the park and water control devices, and <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> sue to ensure their tribal lands and a $50million casino would not be flooded. Other special interests were also concerned that businesses and residents would take second priority after nature. The Everglades, however, proved to be a bipartisan cause. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000. It approved the immediate use of $1.3billion for implementation to be split by the federal government and other sources.|$|E
5|$|The salvage {{party were}} {{suspicious}} of Keseberg's story, {{and found a}} pot full of human flesh in the cabin along with George Donner's pistols, jewelry, and $250 in gold. <b>They</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> lynch Keseberg, who confessed that he had cached $273 of the Donners' money at Tamsen's suggestion, {{so that it could}} one day benefit her children. On April 29, 1847, Keseberg was the last member of the Donner Party to arrive at Sutter's Fort.|$|E
5|$|Keeler {{was known}} for his {{commitment}} to ecumenism. When Pope John Paul II visited the United States in 1987, Keeler helped arrange his meetings with Jewish leaders in Miami, Florida and Protestant leaders in Columbia, South Carolina. The meeting with the Jews took place after <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> boycott the meeting after the Pope met with former U.N. General Secretary Kurt Waldheim, whom, as it had recently been revealed, had previous connections to Nazi Germany. After Keeler intervened, the Jewish leaders agreed to attend the meeting. On November 18, 2005, at the annual general assembly of the National Council of Churches, he reassured delegates that the Catholic Church, and Pope Benedict XVI, were firmly ecumenical.|$|E

5|$|The Supremes' {{name change}} fueled already present {{rumors of a}} solo career for Ross {{and contributed to the}} {{professional}} and personal dismantling of the group. In fact, Gordy intended to replace Ross with Barbara Randolph as early as the fall of 1966, but changed his mind and instead kept Ross in the group for several more years. Gordy's caution may have been sparked by an incident in early 1966 as the group prepared to make their second appearance at the Copacabana. Angered by erratic behavior from Florence Ballard, Gordy intended to replace her with Marlene Barrow, a member of the Motown in-house singing group the Andantes. However, when club management heard of this change, <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> cancel the group's appearance if Ballard was replaced, as they saw Ballard's banter with her group mates as a major part of their act's success.|$|E
5|$|Hassett enjoyed greater {{success on}} the Services tour of India, {{although}} the Australians had little to celebrate as a team. It was a tougher proposition for Hassett’s men, as {{all but one of}} the nine matches were against first-class opposition, and many of the players regarded the local umpires as being deliberately biased in favour of the home teams. After arriving in October, conflict hit the team after a series of ineffective displays. The team, mostly made up of RAAF personnel, had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the Indian subcontinent via long and bumpy train journeys for the first month. The airmen wanted to travel by air, and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel. When this was refused, <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> abandon the tour or replace infantryman Hassett with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller—who were RAAF fighter pilots—if their wish was not granted. With incumbent Australian captain Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand, the Services leader would be one of the frontrunners for the national captaincy. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team; after a month in India, their first flight came in late November.|$|E

When they could not find the letter in her baggage, they realised she must have concealed it on her person, so <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> strip her. The spy then produced the letter, which she had hidden in her hair, and Al-Zubayr and Ali brought it back to Muhammad, confident that the Muslims would now take Mecca by surprise.|$|E

In a message, the mutineers demanded to be discharged and to be sent home, with money and a pardon from Villettes. <b>They</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> open fire on Valletta, but Villettes refused their demands and ordered them to surrender.|$|E

25|$|In May 2010, {{a lawsuit}} was filed against Hooters in Michigan after an {{employee}} {{was given a}} job performance review {{and was told that}} her shirt and short size could use some improvement by two women who held positions at the headquarters in Atlanta.

The plaintiff alleges that the women made the offer of a free gym membership and that if she did not improve in 30 days, her employment would be terminated. The company denied that <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> fire the plaintiffs, and the suit was settled out of court.|$|E
25|$|A {{large body}} of Irish men engaged in {{constructing}} the Great Western Railway went to The Stag beerhouse, where a few Englishmen had assembled, and a row commenced. Hearing that the Rev. Dr. Walmisley, the rector, had dispatched a messenger to Brentford for the police, their rage was diverted to that worthy magistrate, whom <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice to their fury. Three prisoners were sentenced to two months in the House of Correction by the magistrates, who {{sent a letter to}} the Company, and stated that unless something was done, it would be necessary to apply to the Government for a body of police or military, to be stationed at Hanwell.|$|E
25|$|On 12 May 2009, Yudhoyono chose Boediono, the {{governor}} of Bank Indonesia (Indonesia's central bank), as his running mate. Four parties which had planned to form a coalition with Yudhoyono's Democratic Party (PAN, PPP, the National Awakening Party (PKB), and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS)) had expected that the vice presidential nominee would come from one of their parties. Although <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> form their own coalition with Gerindra and present their own candidate, PKB became the first party in the coalition to support Yudhoyono's decision. The remaining three parties eventually agreed to support the Yudhoyono–Boediono ticket and attended the nomination ceremony in Bandung on 15 May.|$|E

25|$|In 1853, Isaac Cody {{sold his}} land in rural Scott County, Iowa, for $2000, {{and the family}} moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Territory. In the years before the Civil War, Kansas was {{overtaken}} by political and physical conflict over the slavery question. Isaac Cody was against slavery. He was invited to speak at Rively's store, a local trading post where pro-slavery men often held meetings. His antislavery speech so angered the crowd that <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> kill him if he didn't step down. A man jumped up and stabbed him twice with a Bowie knife. Rively, the store's owner, rushed Cody to get treatment, but he never fully recovered from his injuries.|$|E
25|$|As {{archbishop}} in Portland, Levada removed Father Joseph Baccellieri, {{a parish}} priest accused of child molestation, in 1992 {{but did not}} refer the matter to the police. In 1993, he learned of allegations that the priest had abused not one but three male victims. Levada authorized secret payments to the victims after <b>they</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> make the allegations public in a lawsuit. Levada allowed Baccellieri to return to duty in 1994 after he had undergone therapy and with the condition that he couldn't be around children and couldn't counsel adults or children. Levada did not inform parishioners or law enforcement about the allegations. Baccellieri went on {{to serve as a}} pastor or associate pastor in four Portland-area parishes between 1994 and 2001, when he went on leave to study canon law.|$|E
25|$|Immediate further {{pressure}} {{to remove the}} Lords' veto now came from the Irish MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Irish Home Rule. <b>They</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> vote against the Budget unless they had their way. With another general election likely before long, Asquith had to make clear the Liberal policy on constitutional change to the country without alienating the Irish and Labour. This initially proved difficult, and the King's speech opening Parliament was vague on {{what was to be}} done to neutralise the Lords' veto. Asquith dispirited his supporters by stating in Parliament that he had neither asked for nor received a commitment from King Edward to create peers. The cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.|$|E
