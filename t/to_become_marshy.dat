40|$|The Sybaris Plain {{faces the}} Ionian coast of Calabria {{in an area}} characterised by a complex and active tectonics. The {{landscape}} evolution {{has been driven by}} the rates of glacio-eustatic sea level rise, by subsidence and bed-load fluvial discharge mainly of the Crati and Coscile rivers. During Holocene – through several progradation phases – the area switched from a wide embayment into a coastal/delta plain with growth of lagoon/marsh areas, whose persistence due to by high subsidence rates caused by sediment compaction. The present delta plain of the Crati River appears cuspate and double-winged. Morphological evidences observed show that the southern wing was built mainly by repeated and notable floods of the Crati River responsible for burial of beach ridges and filling of coastal ponds. Conversely, the northern wing, bordered at its inner edge by the wide Torrente Raganello alluvial fan, grew mainly by the action of the Coscile River filling large barrier-lagoon systems. Already during the early Neolithic (about 7000 BP) settlements at Favella della Corte a settlement was placed {{on the top of a}} terrace whose scarps formed a cliff, at its foot bordered by a beach. The Crati River flowed into the sea at about 5 - 6 km more to the east of the present shoreline and about 2 km more to the south of the present course. The mouth area prograded more than the northern one fed by the Coscile River characterised by a reduced solid discharge. The Favella della Corte village, about 40000 m 2 large, was inhabited during the early and recent Neolithic, with an abandonment period during middle Neolithic when some caves of the surroundings started being used. Entering the Eneolithic, the village was completely abandoned. Up to Archaic times settlements close to the coast are lacking. The scenery changed considerably during the Archaic Age. Between the Crati and Coscile rivers the town of Sybaris was built on a NS trending beach ridge, which was bordering a lagoon area. The Crati River slowly migrated northwards for nearly 3 km debouching temporarily into the Sybaris lagoon. Also because of changes towards cool-moist climatic conditions, the Crati River flooded considerably and repeatedly. Moreover, the strong fluvial activity allowed the progradation of the mouth for 2 km at least. Peopling concentrated mainly in the big Achaean metropolis. From a hydraulic viewpoint, the Crati plain became object of an impressive reorganisation work with land reclamation and river management. In 510 BC a war with Krotonians caused the destruction of the town and the end of main villages. The following sixty years are lacking in archaeological evidences of peopling in the plain. From 2400 to 1400 BP the landscape changed again. A period of climatic improvement leading to the warm Roman stage, might have reduced flood events caused a slow and small progradation of the Crati River mouth, and originated new and closer-drawn beach ridges. In 444 / 443 BC a new town (Thurii) was built, partly over the former Sybaris. This shows how, even though the climatic situation wasn’t turned favourable yet, that area covered by recent floods, and the whole Sybaris Plain were safe again. Peopling distributed in a centre and in a series of farms spread over the whole region, thanks to the Romanization process, started during the 2 nd century BC. This process also changed the town of Thurii into the colony of Copia. During the Punic wars all settlements of the Sybaris Plain suffered a backslash and the urban area underwent a narrowing. About 1800 BP the new climatic deterioration might have increased flood events favouring a gradual filling up of the lagoon already partly used as a harbour. At the end of this period the town gradually entered in the middle of a crisis. Government intervention decreased and about 1400 BP Copia was abandoned. Peopling consolidated on the easier-to-defend hills and terraced areas, and so the territorial control of the plain ceased. The climatic deterioration of the Early Middle Ages and mainly of the Renaissance brought the area <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>marshy</b> and inhabitable. The mouths of Crati and Coscile rivers underwent frequent changes, in turns dividing and joining again; this shows the high hydraulic disorder, which affected for a long while the region. Starting from the Early Middle Ages the plain didn’t had important centres; some evidence of few presence for agricultural purpose existed until the 12 th century but, coinciding with the Little Ice Age, this presence stopped. Still in the 19 th century the Sybaris Plain was described as a malarial land, marshy and subject to hydraulic disorder. The hydraulic land rehabilitation started in 1882 and developed after 1930. Today the northern wing of the Crati River shows several settlements, while these are very scarce along the southern one. The history of the Sybaris Plain shows how geomorphologic and peopling evolution are strictly correlated. Therefore it turns out how a very dynamic environment becomes habitable and controlled by man during epochs of relative political and economic stability. This occurs also when a central authority exists, able to co-ordinate efforts in sight of the realisation and following maintenance of infrastructures for reclamation and hydraulic control...|$|E

2500|$|The parish, {{which is}} {{generally}} fertile and well cultivated, comprises [...] of land, [...] of water and [...] of foreshore and lies predominantly on granite. It is more elevated at its northern part and slopes gently north to south-east towards the sea. Carn Brea, (50°09'N, 5°65W), often described as the first hill in Cornwall (from a westerly perspective), sits at its northernmost edge and rises [...] above sea level The hill {{is also an important}} historical site showing evidence of neolithic activity, as well as the remains of the chapel from which it is named. Toward the south is the village of St Buryan, which sits on a plateau and is centrally sited within the parish. Further to the south the terrain slopes down toward the sea, ending in several deep cut river valleys at Lamorna, Penberth and St Loy that are both sheltered and heavily forested. West of St Buryan, toward St Levan, the terrain again gently descends, causing the ground <b>to</b> <b>become</b> more <b>marshy</b> and waterlogged and less suitable for growing arable crops. East of the village the land also slopes away toward Drift, and its reservoir, past the wooded area at Pridden and the deep cut valley at Trelew (in which a steep embankment has been built to carry the B3283 road). Other settlements of note in the parish include Crows-an-Wra to the north, as well as Sparnon and Tregarnoe further south (see map, right). Since 1990 St Buryan and the surrounding region has been designated a conservation area by Penwith District Council; recognising the village's status as an area of special architectural and historic interest and preventing development that might alter the village's character.|$|R
50|$|Most rivers, {{lakes and}} swamps, {{except in the}} far south and south-west, are permanent. In addition, dambos (grasslands which <b>become</b> <b>marshy</b> in the rainy season) are {{prevalent}} {{in most of the}} country and water is usually available in them from springs or shallow wells. Dambos also release groundwater to streams and rivers {{towards the end of the}} dry season, keeping them flowing permanently. Small earth dams are often constructed in dambos as a source of water and as fishponds.|$|R
50|$|Mud rush, meadow barley, red fescue, {{marsh foxtail}} and the nationally rare bulbous foxtail {{flourish}} in the pasture. There is a variety of saltmarsh plants such as sea arrowgrass, sea milkwort, sea aster, greater sea-spurrey, and lesser sea-spurrey. The rare narrow-leaved marsh dandelions (Taraxacum palustre and T. anglicum) are also recorded. Where areas <b>become</b> <b>marshy</b> grassland other species are found. The drainage ditches support a separate range of plants. The brackish water-crowfoot (Ranunculus baudotii) may {{be found at the}} boundaries of some of the fields.|$|R
50|$|It {{started to}} decay in the 3rd century AD, and, {{as in the}} High Middle Age the area <b>became</b> <b>marshy,</b> its {{agricultural}} output fell drastically. In this period {{it was part of}} the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna and had its first Catholic bishop in the 5th century; over his sepulchre, outside the town, a Benedictine monastery was founded. In the 7th century Forlimpopoli was ravaged by the Lombard king Grimoald; in the following century it fell under Papal rule. Later the city started to grow again with the foundation of another burgh, the Civitas Nova, and with the communal autonomy.|$|R
50|$|The Lewitz was formed, {{like the}} whole of Mecklenburg, in the last ice age. When the glacier melted it filled the Lewitz and the Stör valley with meltwater which scoured out a basin, 12,000 {{hectares}} in area. A 16 metre deep lake was formed. Later it suddenly emptied southwards. The lake <b>became</b> <b>marshy</b> and turned into peat {{over the course of}} the following millennia. Shallow waterbodies and fens (Niedermoore). In the Middle Stone Age its island-like hills, small lakes and woods offered hunters, gatherers and fishers suitable places to settle. Likewise the dried out, sandy moorlands were suitable for the arable farmers and cattle breeders of the New Stone Age. During that time several Funnelbeaker culture earthworks were constructed.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the park}} lies in the Central Zambezian Miombo {{woodlands}} ecoregion characterised by savanna grasslands with Miombo tree species, growing thickly in some patches, with a few small dambos (grasslands which <b>become</b> <b>marshy</b> in the rainy season) interspersed among them. In the south there are stony hills and rocky outcrops where the sparser Zambezian and Mopane woodlands ecoregion takes over, and Mopane trees adapted to hotter drier conditions replace Miombo. A thin belt of evergreen forest lines {{the banks of the}} Kafue River, which has been controversially dammed just outside the park at Itezhi-Tezhi Dam, forming a reservoir within the park. Patches of Baikiaea (teak) and Cryptosepalum evergreen forest occur in the south and west.|$|R
50|$|Frederick II had {{a palace}} built in Foggia in 1223, {{in which he}} often sojourned. It was also seat of his court and a studium, {{including}} notable figures such as the mathematician and scholar Michael Scot, but little of it remains now. In 1447, King Alfonso V of Aragon built a Custom Palace to tax the local sheep farmers. This caused a decline of the local economy and the progressive ruin of the land, which again <b>became</b> <b>marshy.</b> In 1456, an earthquake struck Foggia, followed by others in 1534, 1627 and 1731, the last destroying {{one third of the}} city. The House of Bourbon promoted a certain economic growth by boosting the cereal agriculture of Capitanata and rebuilding much of the settlement.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{drainage}} {{measures were}} carried out {{at the behest of}} the Halberstadt Prince-Bishops, who held the territory around Osterwieck south of the Großes Bruch. The Hessendamm was laid out by the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg in order to reach their Hessen Castle outpost, which they had acquired from the comital House of Regenstein in 1343, from the northern side. Both rulers had the Großer Graben and Schiffgraben ditches laid out along the border of their Imperial State territories. The lands again <b>became</b> <b>marshy</b> in the Thirty Years' War, but were recultivated by the order of the [...] "Great Elector" [...] Frederick William of Brandenburg in his capacity as Prince of Halberstadt since 1648.

50|$|This {{artificial}} island was mainly {{visible in the}} summer months and lay about 75 yards from the southern bank of the loch. Despite its prominence during Robert Burns's time, he made no recorded reference to it. A wooden walkway ran to it from the south-east side of the loch. At least five dugout canoes were found, {{some distance from the}} crannog. The land had <b>become</b> <b>marshy</b> again by 1878 and the re-discovery at this time generated enough interest to spark an excavation; the site and Lochlea Farm were owned by the Duke of Portland and his Mr Turner, his factor, helped to organise the excavations, together with Mr. Cochrane-Patrick of Woodside, Beith. Much of the wood associated with the crannog was that of oak, hazel and birch, together with alder and poplar. Animals present included sheep, roe deer, red deer, reindeer, pig, and horse.|$|R
50|$|In north Germany {{there are}} {{numerous}} salt domes under the ground - relicts of the Zechstein Sea from the Permian period, which were later relocated and deformed tectonically. When rock salt comes into contact with ground water it leaches away; i.e. the salt is absorbed by the water and transported off. This {{can lead to the}} development of large underground caverns that finally cave in. Sometimes such an event at a depth of several hundred metres can result in the ground collapsing right up to the surface. This results in prominent, often steep-sided and deep hollows called sinkholes or dolines (although dolines can have other morphogenetic causes, particularly in karst regions). Many of these funnel-shaped hollows remain dry, in others water collects that can later <b>become</b> <b>marshy.</b> Sinkholes are geologically often very recent; {{it is not uncommon for}} them to be only a few thousand years old and many hollows only date back a few hundred years.|$|R

Eustacia went with her head thrown back fancifully, a certain glad and voluptuous air of triumph pervading her eyes at having won by her own unaided self {{a man who was}} her perfect complement in attainment, appearance, and age. On the young man's part, the paleness of face which he had brought with him from Paris, and the incipient marks of time and thought, were less perceptible than when he returned, the healthful and energetic sturdiness which was his by nature having partially recovered its original proportions.

40|$|Adolf Schulten {{suggested}} that Tartessos-Tarshish was {{the model for}} Plato’s Atlantis. I argued that its capital was situated {{in what is now}} the Marisma de Hinojos within {{the central part of the}} Andalucian Donana National Park in south-west Spain. This article reports about the preliminary results of an archaeological expedition to test this theory. The preliminary results of the expedition include evidence of either a tsunami or a storm flood during the third millenium BC and evidence of human settlements from the Neolithic Age to the Middle Ages. 1 Geological Situation and Literary Evidence According to previous geological investigations, the marismas of the Donana National Park have been submarine since the end of the last Ice Age. Because of sedimentation they <b>became</b> <b>marshy</b> islands within the Lacus Ligustinus either already during the Roman times [1] or as late as the Middle Ages [2]. As a consequence, no permanent human settlement has been possible in the marismas until recently. On the other hand, previous studies provided literary evidence of ancient cultures within the Donana National Park. These cultures include Tartessos, Tarshish, and Atlantis [3]. The capital of Tartessos was situated between the two mouths of the river Baetis (Strabon 3. 1. 9; 3. 2. 11; Pausanias 6. 19. 3). The Baetis was tidal and Iberia’s largest river (Pausanias 6. 19. 3). Baetica was the ancient Roman name of Andalucia (cf. Pliny 3. 6). Therefore it is reasonable to identify the Baetis with Andalucia’s largest river, the Guadalquivir, and to locate the capital of Tartessos close to its present opening, i. e. within the Donana National Park. Tarshish was mentioned in several books of the bible. It was mentioned either as a state or a landscape (Gen. 10. 4; 1 Chr. 1. 7; 2 Chr. 9. 21; 20. 36 - 37...|$|R
