5|$|Both Lasser and Hornig printed fiction {{translated}} from French and German writers, including Otfrid von Hanstein and Otto Willi Gail. With {{the rise of}} Adolf Hitler in Germany in the 1930s a few readers (including Donald Wollheim) wrote letters complaining about the inclusion of German stories. The editorial response was a strong defense of the translations; Gernsback argued that events in Germany were irrelevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of selecting fiction.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{constant}} attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business,</b> the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products {{proved to be}} insurmountable, {{making it impossible for}} Coffin to find a replacement to run the company so that he could return to Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding {{it would be impossible to}} maintain a profitable business.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Donaldson made a then-controversial move {{by hiring}} an African-American {{journalist}} James Albert Jackson {{to write a}} weekly column devoted to African-American performers. According <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Business</b> of Culture: Strategic Perspectives on Entertainment and Media, the column identified discrimination against black performers and helped validate their careers. Jackson {{was the first black}} critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race. Donaldson died in 1925.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Franklin D.

5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money supply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted {{the view that}} {{monetary}} policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, in 1990, Ted Turner's Goodwill Games {{were held}} in Seattle. News crews at the Pike Place Market {{discovered}} the fish market and its performances with customers, and they filmed them. Soon afterwards, the fish market appeared on Good Morning America, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> and its employees being filmed by various film crews, and being featured in numerous magazines. Now, during the summer tourist season, the fishmongers will perform now in front {{of as many as}} 10,000 visitors daily. The success of the business has been cited to its human resources and employee attitudes. The employees of the fish market will often speak to businesses, civic groups, and schools on ways to be successful, and has led to their being featured in motivational books.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005, the City of Marquette {{agreed to}} {{exchange}} jurisdiction {{over a number}} of roadways with MDOT. These transfers placed Bus. US41 and the unsigned M-554 under city jurisdiction; at the same time, the state would take over a section of McClellan Avenue to extend M-553 to its current northern terminus at the Marquette Bypass. Negotiations regarding the transfer centered on MDOT deferring to city zoning ordinances along McClellan Avenue regarding driveway and snowmobile access and the city's assumption of expenses and liabilities related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> loop. The transfers were made official on October 10, 2005, when MDOT and the city finalized the paperwork. As a result, Bus. US41 was decommissioned when the city took control over Washington and Front streets; signage was removed on November 9, 2005, to complete the process. Some local maps continue to label Bus. US41 through downtown Marquette, even years after the decommissioning of the designation, and some local businesses and organizations still use it in their advertising.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{took over}} command of No.75 Squadron after {{his brother was}} killed in action on 28April 1942, leading it in the Battle of Milne Bay later that year. Credited with a fifth aerial victory, he became the RAAF's first ace in the New Guinea campaign, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). By 1944, Jackson was wing leader of No.78 (Fighter) Wing in Western New Guinea, gaining {{promotion}} to wing commander in September that year. Awarded a bar to his DFC in March 1945, he served as chief flying instructor at No.8 Operational Training Unit in Australia, and saw out the war as commander of Air Defence Headquarters, Madang.

5|$|Lighting and {{its effect}} on characters' skin was of {{particular}} importance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Business</b> Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E
5|$|Mitt Romney {{wanted to}} pursue a {{business}} career, but his father advised him that a law degree would be valuable to his career even if he never practiced law. As a result, he enrolled in the recently created four-year joint Juris Doctor/Master of Business Administration program coordinated between Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. He readily adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> school's pragmatic, data-driven case study method of teaching. Living in a Belmont, Massachusetts house with Ann and their two children, his social experience differed from most of his classmates'. He was nonideological and did not involve himself in the political issues of the day. He graduated in 1975 cum laude from the law school, in the top third of that class, and was named a Baker Scholar for graduating {{in the top five}} percent of his business school class.|$|E

5|$|NY36 {{continues}} on, {{passing through}} the hamlet of Sonyea and serving the Groveland Correctional Facility on {{its way into the}} town of Mount Morris and the village of the same name, where it becomes Main Street in the latter.

In between Chapel and State streets, NY36 and NY408 overlap for one block along Main Street. Immediately north of Mount Morris, NY36 passes through the northern tip of Letchworth State Park and crosses the Genesee River, which separates the towns of Mount Morris and Leicester. As the route heads north into Leicester, it begins to leave the flats in favor of a more northwesterly alignment that leads it into the village of Leicester.|$|E
5|$|The papal entourage {{arrived in}} Trier on 30 November 1147, but shortly after arrival the pope {{decided to move}} the {{proceedings}} because of complaints from the residents of Trier, and announced in February 1148 that the council would move to Reims, but still on the date given before. A feature of the council was that the pope ordered the attendance of the various bishops and other officials. Although some requested attendees were excused, it was mostly due to ill health, not {{to the need to}} see <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of their offices. Those who did not attend were suspended from office. The Italian bishops, however, were mostly excused from attendance, as Eugene held a council at Cremona in July 1148 where the Reims decrees were announced.|$|E
5|$|The victor in {{the tale}} is the farmer's wife: she regains her errant duck and is {{rid of the}} predatory fox. Ostensibly, she confiscates Jemima's eggs believing Jemima will abandon them, but the eggs are not confiscated for the {{well-being}} of Jemima and her kin but {{for the well-being of}} the farmer's wife and her family: the eggs (or the ducks hatched from them) will end up on their dinner table. In this respect, the farmer's wife is a predator like the fox, but the fox is condemned for his predation. Human values are {{at the top of the}} tale's hierarchy. Potter argues for the well-ordered home and the practicalities of farm life over the fantasy lives of animals. It was the modus vivendi Potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts and hours <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of farming and less to tales of fantasy animals.|$|E

5|$|Wilkinson was {{a member}} of the {{freshman}} basketball team at Liberty High School. Using profits from his early business ventures, he purchased a business wardrobe that earned him the title of best dressed member of his senior class. He graduated from high school in 1959, but the poor curriculum there left him without the credits he needed to gain admission to the University of Kentucky's engineering program. He began selling livestock feed in Scottsville, Kentucky, and also worked at a venetian blind factory while taking classes at Campbellsville College to earn the credits he needed. In 1962, he moved to Lexington, Kentucky, and enrolled at the University of Kentucky. While in college, he worked at Kennedy Book Store in Lexington. Later, he and two friends borrowed money to open the Kentucky Paperback Gallery in Lexington; Wilkinson left school later that year to attend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> full-time. At the time, Kentucky high school students were required to purchase their own textbooks, but there was no marketplace for buying and selling used books; Wilkinson's business catered to this market and was highly successful.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, several {{changes were}} made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> routes in {{downtown}} Jackson. Eastbound BL I-94 traffic was shifted off Michigan Avenue along Blackstone Street to Washington Avenue, and from there it ran along Washington to Francis Street and back to Michigan Avenue. The westbound traffic was shifted north at Mechanic Street to Pearl Street, continuing until turning south at Blackstone back to Michigan Avenue. The eastern end was updated further in 1968 to use Louis Glick Highway to connect to the northern half of the loop around downtown to Michigan Avenue. A set of connector streets {{on the western side}} of the downtown loop opened in November 1969 to streamline the flow of traffic further resulting in the last changes to the BL I-94 routing in Jackson. Eastbound traffic was redirected to the connector on Michigan Avenue just east of Third Street. This connector curved south then east to Washington Avenue near First Street. Louis Glick Highway was extended west from Blackstone curving south to merge into Michigan. In 2012, the eastern terminus of the business route was shifted easterly to follow Ann Arbor and Sargent roads to exit145 on I-94; as a result, the former partial interchange between I-94 and Ann Arbor Road which formerly served as the business route's eastern terminus was obliterated.|$|E
