40|$|Pile {{foundations}} are slender {{structural elements}} used to transfer loads from super structure into deep hard strata below the ground level. However, single piles are rarely found in practice. It is quite complicated to analyze pile groups since pile soil interaction is complex. In this study, {{two dimensional analysis}} of pile group under vertical load is carried out using finite element software ANSYS. Pile group has 16 numbers of piles and it is located in c-ø soil, parameters like diameter (0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8 m), length (3, 4, 5, 6 m) and spacing of piles (2 D, 2. 5 D, 3 D, 3. 5 D, 4 D) and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 4 m) are varied to study the behavior of pile group. Results of influence of diameter, length and spacing of piles and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap are discussed. It can be observed that, as the diameter and spacing of piles and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap increase, the load carrying capacity of pile group increases.

Based on {{test method}} of {{numerical}} simulation, the bearing characteristics of large-diameter rock-socket pile with different super-thick pile caps have been analyzed, including the finite element model, Numeric Simulation of different heights of pile cap, Pile-soil load sharing, and stress flow analysis of thick pile caps.

With the increase of the thickness of cap, the pile side friction load sharing value of pile side friction decreases, while the load sharing value of pile tip load increase, and soil force under the pile cap does not change with the different <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap.

Firstly, assuming the surrounding soil of pile to be viscoelastic material and considering its vertical wave effect, the governing equations of soil-pile system subjected to arbitrary harmonic dynamic force are founded {{based on the}} Euler-Bernoulli rod theory. Secondly, the analytical solution of velocity response in frequency domain and its corresponding semianalytical solution of velocity response in time domain are derived by means of Laplace transform technique and separation of variables technique. Based on the obtained solutions, the influence of parameters of pile end soil on the dynamic response is studied in detail for different designing parameters of pile. Lastly, the fictitious soil-pile model and other pile end soil supporting models are compared. It is shown that the dynamic response obtained by the fictitious soil-pile model is among the dynamic responses obtained by other existing models if there are appropriate material parameters and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> end soil for the fictitious soil-pile model...|$|E

A local search operator by the fully stressed design (FSD) approach is incorporated into a genetic algorithm (GA) to tackle two major shortcomings of a GA, namely, large computation effort in searching the optimum design and poor local search capability.

In the literature, planar geometry was the only governing factor to estimate the group capacity, ignoring the contributions <b>of</b> the <b>pile</b> cap rigidity and sequence technique for driving the piles in a group. Accordingly the available theories failed to provide accurate prediction. A numerical model was developed to incorporate the above-mentioned ignored parameters. Furthermore, the distribution of the column load on the individual piles under the pile cap was examined.

30|$|Soil–structure {{interaction}} (SSI) {{analysis was}} carried out for tall reinforced concrete chimneys with piled raft foundation subjected to wind loads. To understand the significance of SSI, four types of soil were considered based on different material properties. Chimneys of different elevations and different ratios of height to base diameter of chimney were selected for the parametric study. The <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> raft <b>of</b> <b>piled</b> raft foundation was also varied based on different ratios of outer diameter to <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> raft. The chimneys were assumed to be located in open terrain and subjected to a maximum wind speed of 50  m/s. The along-wind and across-wind loads were computed according to IS: 4998 (Part 1)- 1992 and applied along {{the height of the}} chimney. The analysis {{was carried out}} using three-dimensional finite element technique based on the direct method of SSI. The linear elastic material behaviour was assumed for the integrated chimney–foundation–soil system. The radial and tangential moments, lateral deflection and base moment of chimney were evaluated through SSI analysis and compared with the response obtained from chimney with fixed base. The base moment of chimney considerably reduces due to the effect of SSI. It is found that the variation of different responses in chimney due to the effect of SSI depends significantly on the geometrical properties of chimney and foundations. The response variation at base for a distance of 1 / 40 th of the height of chimney should be considered for a safe design.|$|R

30|$|In the {{analytical}} model of cutting force, the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> shear zone {{is the key}} to study the deformation of cutting. For metal-cutting, the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> shear zone affects the shear strain rate γ̇ [20]. By the analysis of quick stop micrograph from cutting experiments in Ref. [20], the thickness is regarded as half of the cutting layer thickness. In the sand mould milling process, the cutting layer thickness is changed to a sinusoid (Sect.  2.4), and the cutting layer thickness varies from 0 to 1.4  mm per cutting tooth. According to the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> shear zone in the metal cutting, the average <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> shear zone can be approximated by 0.4  mm, meaning the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> shear zone is just the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> 3 <b>piled</b> sand granules with the average mesh granularity of 100. For the granular system, Oda et al. [12] suggested that the shear zone width of the granular system without binding is about 7 ‒ 8 granules, which was also reported by Vardoulakis [21]. Moreover, Oda et al. [12] pointed out that the thickness reduces if there is the rotational resistance at contacts according to the comparison between the simulation and laboratory tests. To the sand mould, there are some binding bridges among the sands, so its shear zone thickness must be smaller than that of the granular system without binding. Considering both the aspects <b>of</b> shear zone <b>thickness</b> in metal cutting and the bound granular system, the assumption that the shear zone <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> sand mould cutting is 3 D can be made, in which the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> wide zone is 2 D, that of narrow zone is D, as shown in Figure  2.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the reuse and the optimum design <b>of</b> <b>piled</b> raft foundations using numerical analysis. The solution proposed for reusing foundations is the design <b>of</b> a <b>piled</b> raft foundation capable of supporting successive buildings. A raft foundation, {{with a limited}} number <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> located strategically beneath the raft and utilising {{a high proportion of}} the ultimate load capacity, is considered the most efficient design when the raft foundation alone provides sufficient load capacity, {{but at the same time}} settlements are excessive. This is the case in high plasticity stiff clays such as London Clay. When building on old piles, these piles had to sustain a certain load from the previous structure over a period of time, during which the soil is subjected to the time-related processes of consolidation and creep. A time dependent constitutive model, capable of reproducing several aspects of the time dependent behaviour of soils including creep and isotach viscosity, is employed in the finite element analyses. The model parameters are calibrated with the results of laboratory tests on London Clay, whose time dependent behaviour in its natural state is characterised by isotach viscosity, rate dependent peak strength and rate independent critical state line. Preliminary analyses <b>of</b> single <b>piles</b> indicate that the consolidation processes in the ground result in little gain in capacity in the long term, whereas creep results in increased capacity. A back-analysis <b>of</b> documented <b>piled</b> load tests in London Clay is performed, where the effects <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> installation are quantified. Numerical model calibration is performed with the documented observations of a well instrumented piled raft foundation at Stonebridge Park, London. 3 D parametric analyses <b>of</b> <b>piled</b> raft foundations are then performed, in order to assess the appropriate location and dimensions <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> and raft <b>thickness.</b> The performance <b>of</b> <b>piled</b> raft foundations with time is assessed parametrically at different levels of preloading.

40|$|Liquefaction {{is one of}} {{the leading}} seismic actions to cause {{extensive}} damage to buildings and infrastructure during earthquakes. In many historic cases, plastic hinge formations in piles were observed at inexplicable locations. This project investigates the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>piled</b> foundations within soils susceptible to liquefaction using numerical analysis carried out in Abaqus in terms of plastic hinge development. Three different soil profiles were considered in this project by varying the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> both the liquefiable and non-liquefiable layers, pile length, free and fixed head pile conditions. Modelling a single pile as a beam-column element carrying both axial and El-Centro record earthquake loading produced results of the seismic behaviour <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> that could be assessed by Force-Based Seismic Design (FBSD) approaches. The displacements and deformations induced by dynamic loads were analysed for piles affected by liquefaction and the results used to demonstrate the pile capacity and discuss the damage patterns and location of plastic hinges. Parametric studies generally demonstrate that plastic hinge formation occurs at the boundaries of the liquefiable and non-liquefiable layers; however, the location can be affected by a variety of factors such as material properties, <b>pile</b> length and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> liquefying soil layer...|$|R

The dynamic response <b>of</b> the <b>pile</b> and soil caused by subgrade surface elastic modulus variation has a little effect with more obvious by the cushion effect. With the increase of elastic modulus and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> cushion, the dynamic interaction between pile and cushion is increased while the dynamic interaction between soil and cushion is weakened.
