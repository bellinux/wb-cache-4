25|$|There {{were not}} enough ships to carry all of the Noldor across the sea, so Fëanor and his sons led the first group. Upon {{arriving}} at Losgar, {{in the land of}} Lammoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where Morgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before, they decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin behind. However, Fëanor's son Amrod died at Losgar, having been accidentally burnt with the Telerin ships. The remaining Noldor saw the flames, and perceived that if they were to go to Middle-earth, they {{had no choice but to}} cross the Helcaraxë. Unwilling to return to Valinor, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> under the leadership of Fingolfin, and suffered great losses along the way, which greatly added to the animosity they had for Fëanor and his sons.|$|E

500|$|The Populist {{strategy}} for 1896 was to nominate the candidate most supportive of silver. Populist leaders correctly believed the Republicans unlikely to nominate a silver man. They hoped the Democrats either would not endorse silver in their platform or if <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> the Democratic candidate would {{be someone who}} could be painted as weak on silver. [...] Bryan's sterling record on the issue left the Populists with a stark choice: They could endorse Bryan, and risk losing their separate identity as a party, or nominate another candidate, thus dividing the pro-silver vote to McKinley's benefit. [...] According to Stanley Jones, [...] "the Democratic endorsement of silver and Bryan at Chicago precipitated the disintegration" [...] of the Populist Party; it was never again a force in national politics after 1896.|$|E

500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, what <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> {{was so great}} was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We {{knew we were going}} to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E
500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> <b>That</b> would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E

500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E

Furthermore, [...] "the State never {{announced that it was}} relying exclusively upon the burning."
