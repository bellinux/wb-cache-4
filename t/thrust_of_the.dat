40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this article}} is to point out the {{complicated}} internal structure <b>of</b> Paleoalpine <b>thrusts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Carpathians and the consequential ambiguous interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tectonic transport <b>of</b> these tectonic units. The example used here is that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Križná <b>thrust</b> system in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Demänová and II'anová Valleys in Nízke Tatry Mountains. The form that the Križná thrust takes is that <b>of</b> three individual <b>thrust</b> sheets. These overthrust each other along differently oriented <b>thrust</b> ramps. <b>The</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ramps influences <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual <b>thrust</b> sheets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Križná <b>thrust...</b>|$|R
5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|E
5|$|After a few days, {{the main}} <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{offensive}} was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather, and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking the frontline towards San Marino. On 17 September the 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked {{forces of the}} 278. Infanterie-Division holding two hills just across the Sammarinese border; after heavy fighting {{to gain control of}} the hills, the situation stabilised on the 19th, and Allied forces began to push into the city of San Marino itself. The city was captured by the afternoon of 20 September, and the 4th Indian Division left the country on the 21st, leaving it {{under the control of the}} local defence forces.|$|E
5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick upward <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E

5|$|On 24 February 1944, the Eighth Air Force {{attempted}} {{to repeat the}} success of 20 February. 1st and 2nd Divisions flew due east towards Germany and the 3rd Division east-northeast without escort. After crossing into Schleswig-Holstein they attacked targets along the Baltic sea coast. The 1st and 2nd Divisions {{were considered to be}} the main <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack and the 3rd Division went unmolested. The B-24 bombers of the 2nd Division were scheduled to bomb Gotha and JG 1 were directed to attack these B-24s. Due to strong tailwinds and flying at lower altitude, the bombers were separated from their escorting fighters and JG 1 reached Gotha before the bombers. Major Heinz Bär led II./JG 1 in a diving attack and claimed four B-24s while I./JG 1 attacked head-on and claimed five B-24s downed.|$|E
5|$|The Comet 4 was {{a further}} {{improvement}} on the stretched Comet 3 with even greater fuel capacity. The design had progressed {{significantly from the}} original Comet 1, growing by 18ft 6in (5.64m) and typically seating 74 to 81 passengers compared to the Comet 1's 36 to 44 (119 passengers could be accommodated in a special charter seating package in the later 4C series). The Comet 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher cruising speed and higher maximum takeoff weight. These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Comet 1's Ghosts. Deliveries to BOAC began on 30 September 1958 with two 48-seat aircraft, which were used to initiate the first scheduled transatlantic services.|$|E

5|$|According to Piers Jackson, the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{design was}} {{to produce a}} title that could {{showcase}} the full abilities of the PlayStation Portable, including its built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Jackson also asserted that Resurrection was an entirely different game from the original; whilst the studio had taken the basic story {{and some of the}} locations from the original game, all the code, graphics and voice actors were changed. New additions to Resurrection included an expanded plot, added mini-games, multiplayer facilities and a cloud save function. During late stages of development, the studio attempted to preserve ideas that they thought worked well in the original, though their uses were altered or repositioned to keep the game fresh even to those who had played the original. The addition of the 'Anubis Stone' sub-plot was to strengthen the story arc and the creation of Al-Zalam was to act as Dan's internal monologue as well as the player's guide.|$|E
5|$|During the 1991 Yugoslav {{campaign}} in Croatia, the 5th (Banja Luka) Corps of the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, or JNA) was tasked with advancing north through western Slavonia from Okučani to Daruvar and Virovitica {{and with a}} secondary drive from Okučani towards Kutina. This was essentially consistent with the line expected to be reached by the main <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> JNA, advancing from eastern Slavonia in about a week. The link was designed to facilitate a further advance west, to Zagreb and Varaždin. The corps had deployed a battlegroup of the 265th Mechanised Brigade near Okučani, supporting an advance which began on 21 September and reached the Papuk Mountains. The corps received one artillery and two motorised brigades as reinforcements during the advance, but the desertion and morale problems experienced by the JNA elsewhere also existed in the Banja Luka Corps.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Slavonia, the JNA {{responded to}} the ZNG siege of its {{garrison}} in Vukovar, and on 14 September 1991 it deployed troops to relieve the barracks. Independent of that effort, the main <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign against Croatia was initially planned to start on 21 September. The southern operational group of the thrust, spearheaded by the 1st Guards Mechanised Division, was expected to lift the ZNG siege of the JNA barracks in Vinkovci, and reach Našice and Slavonski Brod {{in two to three}} days. Over the next four to five days, the group was expected to reach the line OkučaniSuhopolje by advancing via the ĐakovoPožega road and the ZagrebBelgrade motorway, avoiding major population centres. The northern operational group, subordinated to the 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, was to advance from Osijek to Našice and then further west towards Bjelovar. The two operational groups were assigned approximately 57,000 troops and 5,000 supporting personnel. The 17th (Tuzla) Corps was probably tasked with crossing the Sava Rivermarking the border of Croatiaat Slavonski Brod and Slavonski Šamac to join the westward drive along the motorway, but the crossing never occurred.|$|E

40|$|In the Kraishte region, near <b>the</b> {{junction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Balkanides and Dinarides, late Early Cretaceous compression led to <b>the</b> <b>thrusting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Morava unit {{over the}} Struma unit. Structural investigations, combined with zircon fission-track and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar analyses, {{have been used}} to reconstruct <b>the</b> geological history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area and to clarify the original tectonic position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main units before Cenozoic extension. The results show that Early Cretaceous lower amphibolite-facies metamorphism and deformation in the Osogovo-Lisets Metamorphic Complex were related to top-to-the-NE directed nappe stacking, whereas <b>the</b> deeper parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allochthonous Morava unit experienced low-grade metamorphic overprint at temperatures < ~ 260 °C. The structurally intermediate Struma Diorites and their Mesozoic cover experienced temperatures between ~ 170 °– 300 °C. <b>Thrusting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Morava onto the Struma unit started probably in Valanginian times (140 – 136 Ma), soon after <b>the</b> cessation <b>of</b> pre- to syn-orogenic turbidite sedimentation on Struma.

5|$|Landscape was a {{secondary}} concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare {{and when they}} did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.|$|E
