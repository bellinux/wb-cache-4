40|$|Despite their obvious {{advantages}} over microstrips, coplanar waveguides (CPWs) {{have not been}} widely used as probes for wave coupling in <b>mixer</b> <b>circuits.</b> Microstrips are still the preferred option. One major reason is because CPWs are generally believed to exhibit higher attenuation than microstrip probes. Here, we present numerical analysis between the loss of waves in normal and superconducting CPWs and microstrips. The {{results show that the}} loss in microstrips is generally higher than that found in CPWs at dimensions larger than the wavelength. At dimensions comparable and smaller than the wavelength (i. e. q < 2. 2), however, the loss in a CPW appears to be significantly lower.
