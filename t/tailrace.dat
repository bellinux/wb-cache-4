40|$|Thermal {{layering}} in reservoirs {{upstream from}} hydroelectric dams can create temperature gradients in fishways used by upstream migrating adults. In the Snake River, Washington, federally-protected adult salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) often encounter relatively cool water in dam <b>tailraces</b> and lower ladder sections and warmer {{water in the}} upstream portions of ladders. Using radiotelemetry, we examined relationships between fish passage behavior and the temperature difference between {{the top and bottom}} of ladders (∆T) at four dams over four years. Some spring Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) experienced ∆T ≥ 0. 5 °C. Many summer and fall Chinook salmon and summer steelhead (O. mykiss) experienced ∆T ≥ 1. 0 °C, and some individuals encountered ΔT > 4. 0 °C. As ΔT increased, migrants were consistently more likely to move down fish ladders and exit into dam <b>tailraces,</b> resulting in upstream passage delays that ranged from hours to days. Fish body temperatures equilibrated to ladder temperatures and often exceeded 20 °C, indicating potential negative physiological and fitness effects. Collectively, the results suggest that gradients in fishway water temperatures present a migration obstacle to many anadromous migrants. Unfavorable temperature gradients may be common at reservoir-fed fish passage facilities, especially those with seasonal thermal layering or stratification.

40|$|For {{many fish}} species, powerplants are {{a barrier to}} their natural {{downstream}} migration. Numerical models are developed {{to better understand the}} complex flow field in hydropower forebays and <b>tailraces,</b> and thus reduce the fish stresses associated with the passage through dams. Free surface models can simulate flows including the shape and evolution of the free surface. Improvements in the computer power have recently made it possible to tackle free surface computations of complex geometries with highly 3 D flows. In the field of hydraulic engineering, the free surface models are not yet widely applied but steadily developed ([1], [3], [4], [5], [6]). This paper presents a CFD model developed using the commercial code FLUENT to predict the flow field in hydraulic structures. The model is based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, with a standard εκ − turbulence model. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is used to predict free surface elevations [2]. A proportional controller is implemented in the model to achieve a target flow rate at the exits. The resulting equation is implemented using User Defined Functions (UDFs). The model is used to predict the flow field inside a fish surface collector at Rocky Reach dam. The model includes two dewatering channels, with side wall fish screens for each channel, and a pump station. The comparison of the numerical model results with depth averaged velocity field data and free surface elevation shows very good agreement. The model was also used to study the forces on a removable spillway weir structure and possible reduction of the spillway capacity during probably maximum flood in Little Goose dam. Free surface computations were also carried out to estimate the spillway jet regime and the free surface shape in <b>tailraces.</b> The model has demonstrated to work very well for flow regime predictions in Wanapum, Little Goose and Wells dams...|$|R

These fisheries have been affected by the damming of many of the major water-ways for hydroelectric generation. To create fisheries in reservoirs that would be otherwise inaccessible, elvers have been transferred from the base of dams into habitats upstream. Operations in three catchments: the Patea River (Lake Rotorangi), Waikato River (eight reservoirs notably the two lowermost, lakes Karapiro and Arapuni), and Rangitaiki River (lakes Matahina and Aniwhenua) are discussed. In all reservoirs, the transfers have successfully established fishable populations within six years of the first transfers and, in Lake Arapuni eels have reached the marketable size of 220 g in less than four years. In comparison, it typically takes from 13 to 17 years before eel populations are fishable in the lower Waikato River where direct access to the sea is available. Telemetry and monitoring at the screens and <b>tailraces</b> of several power stations have been used to determine migration timing, triggers, and pathways of mature eels.

It is planned to construct a rockfill dam and underground powerhouses in the left bank. The underground cavities mainly include three large cavities, comprising a main powerhouse with size 418 × 29 × 77. 6 m, alternative cavity 345 × 19 × 22. 6 m and the three <b>tailraces</b> 84 × 20 × 83. 87 m. In the area of the left bank, the rock mass is mainly composed of Permian Period~Triassic Period granite. Triassic Period siltstones and mudstones are distributed above 690 - 810 m on the left bank and the rock mass has been more faulted. In addition, there also exists a lot of joints and the rock mass structure is complex. Based on the abundant field investigation and statistical data, different classification methods for rock mass quality were used, and are described in this paper, to evaluate the rock mass quality of the underground building. By contrasting and analyzing the results, a reasonable, scientific outcome was obtained.

40|$|Utility {{companies}} and regulatory agencies {{are interested in}} understanding juvenile salmon swimming patterns as they approach hydropower dams because it can allow them to assess fish bypass efficiency and conduct fish survival studies. A model capable of predicting juvenile salmon swim paths can assist {{in the design of}} fish bypasses and diversion structures. This thesis presents a mechanistic model tailored to simulate swimming patterns of juvenile salmon swimming in forebays, <b>tailraces,</b> and free-flowing rivers. The model integrates information on juvenile salmon behavior at both field and laboratory scale and literature on juvenile salmon swimming capabilities. Simulated fish swim paths are determined by solving Newton 2 ̆ 7 s Second Law. Most of the model parameters are represented by probability distributions. Behavioral responses are triggered for the most part by the flow acceleration and pressure. The model uses conditional probability distributions of thrust magnitude and direction, given flow acceleration. Simulated fish select a swimming direction referenced to the flow velocity vector. To consider juvenile salmon 2 ̆ 7 s tendency to coast with the flow, the model intersperses periods of active swimming and gliding. Chinook salmon measured swim paths were analyzed. The flow variables at the fish locations were obtained from CFD simulations. Juvenile salmon mean thrust was determined from solving Newton 2 ̆ 7 s Second Law at every measured location. Results show that as flow acceleration increases, the juvenile salmon average thrust increases and the probability of gliding decreases.

Overall, water conditions for the entire Columbia River were characterized by the Fish Passage Center as below normal levels. Spill occurred continuously at Lower Granite Dam (LGR), Little Goose Dam (LGO), and Lower Monumental Dam (LMO) from April 5, April 10, and April 4, respectively, to June 20, and encompassed the periods of migration of Imnaha River juvenile chinook salmon and steelhead, with a few exceptions.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} environmental issues facing the hydropower industry is the adverse impact of hydroelectric projects on downstream fish passage. Fish that migrate long distances as part of their life cycle include not only important diadromous species (such as salmon, shads, and eels) but also strictly freshwater species. The hydropower reservoirs that downstream-moving fish encounter differ greatly from free-flowing rivers. Many of the environmental changes that occur in a reservoir (altered water temperature and transparency, decreased flow velocities, increased predation) can reduce survival. Upon reaching the dam, downstream-migrating fish may suffer increased mortality as they pass through the turbines, spillways and other bypasses, or turbulent <b>tailraces.</b> Downstream from the dam, insufficient environmental flow releases may slow downstream fish passage rates or decrease survival. There is a need to refine our understanding of the relative importance of causative factors that contribute to turbine passage mortality (e. g., strike, pressure changes, turbulence) so that turbine design efforts can focus on mitigating the most damaging components. Further, present knowledge of the effectiveness of turbine improvements is based on studies of only a few species (mainly salmon and American shad). These data may not be representative of turbine passage effects for the hundreds of other fish species that are susceptible to downstream passage at hydroelectric projects. For example, there are over 900 species of fish in the United States. In Brazil there are an estimated 3, 000 freshwater fish species, of which 30 % are believed to be migratory (Viana et al. 2011). Worldwide, there are some 14, 000 freshwater fish species (Magurran 2009), of which significant numbers are susceptible to hydropower impacts. By comparison, in a compilation of fish entrainment and turbine survival studies from over 100 hydroelectric projects in the United States, Winchell et al. (2000) found useful turbine passage survival data for only 30 species. Tests of advanced hydropower turbines have been limited to seven species - Chinook and coho salmon, rainbow trout, alewife, eel, smallmouth bass, and white sturgeon. We are investigating possible approaches for extending experimental results from the few tested fish species to predict turbine passage survival of other, untested species (Cada and Richmond 2011). In this report, we define the causes of injury and mortality to fish tested in laboratory and field studies, based on fish body shape and size, internal and external morphology, and physiology. We have begun to group the large numbers of unstudied species into a small number of categories, e. g., based on phylogenetic relationships or ecological similarities (guilds), so that subsequent studies of a few representative species (potentially including species-specific Biological Index Testing) would yield useful information about the overall fish community. This initial effort focused on modifying approaches that are used in the environmental toxicology field to estimate the toxicity of substances to untested species. Such techniques as the development of species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) and Interspecies Correlation Estimation (ICE) models rely on a considerable amount of data to establish the species-toxicity relationships that can be extended to other organisms. There are far fewer studies of turbine passage stresses from which to derive the turbine passage equivalent of LC{sub 50 } values. Whereas the SSD and ICE approaches are useful analogues to predicting turbine passage injury and mortality, too few data are available to support their application without some form of modification or simplification. In this report we explore the potential application of a newer, related technique, the Traits-Based Assessment (TBA), to the prediction of downstream passage mortality at hydropower projects...|$|R

[...] This was of mixed success, and as far as many locals concerned only served to make the water at the public beach at the foot of Seton Lake colder than it already was.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{two months}} later, on June 6, Black Eagle Dam {{suffered}} damage {{in yet another}} flood. Almost [...] of rain fell in 24 hours, and the Missouri River rose by almost [...] in eight hours. The Missouri River rose [...] above flood stage (which itself was [...] above the median water level). Five {{people in the city}} drowned. The Boston and Montana smelter toppled four fully loaded railroad cars into the Missouri just north of Black Eagle Dam in an attempt to divert the floodwaters from the plant. The worst flood in the city's history at the time, several buildings in town were also washed away. They smashed against Black Eagle Dam, and some went over the dam to break up on the waterfalls below. The pedestrian suspension bridge over the dam also washed out. (A plaque was placed on the 6th Street underpass to mark the extent of the high water. It can be seen there today.) The dam itself suffered some damage as well. This damage was repaired, and the old wooden bridge to <b>Tailrace</b> Island replaced with a single-span steel Warren truss bridge capable of handling automobiles. The island now began to also serve as a parking lot for powerhouse and smelter workers.|$|E
2500|$|The dam's new {{powerhouse}} was concrete. The {{company had}} planned to build a brick powerhouse. But local bricklayers demanded that they be paid the salary offered by the city rather than the lower rate offered by Montana Power. The company refuse to hire the workers, and built the structure of concrete instead. Concrete and masonry retaining walls {{north and south of}} the powerhouse were also built to help prevent erosion of the riverbank into the forebay and <b>tailrace.</b> The new forebay was [...] long and [...] wide. The forebay was slightly extended downstream to the new powerhouse, and brick arches of the old powerhouse incorporated into the forebay's walls. The new powerhouse contained three vertical Kaplan turbines (supplied by the S. Morgan Smith Company) capable of generating 18 MW of power, which gave Black Eagle the smallest generating capacity of any of Montana Power's five dams in the Great Falls area. The Smith company also made the oil-pressure governors (which regulated each turbine's speed) and draft tubes (which slowed the water down as it left the turbine, allowing the faster-moving water above to keep imparting energy to the turbine's propellers). The scroll-shaped inlets and wicket gates around the turbines were cemented into the powerhouse's basement, and each turbine installed in its own pit. Each turbine connected through the first floor roof to an Allis-Chalmers generator rated at 7,000 kVA. DC generators acted as exciters for the Allis-Chalmers generators. Six 6,600/2,200 volt transformers stepped down the power for usage.|$|E
