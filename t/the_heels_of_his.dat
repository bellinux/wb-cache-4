5|$|As {{the wars}} in Gaul come to an end, Julius Caesar (Ciarán Hinds) is faced with both triumph and tribulation. On <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victory comes news of his daughter's death. Awarded with the {{adulation}} of the people, he also garners the enmity of politicians in Rome, including Pompey the Great (Kenneth Cranham). In Rome, Pompey must balance honor and politics as he is urged to betray his former friend. Meanwhile, Caesar's niece Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker) tries to steer her family on the dangerous path between the growing divisions of power. In the Gallic countryside, two unlikely allies (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson) journey to reclaim the stolen standard of the Roman legion.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Sebastianites Cricket and Athletic Club in 2005. He has also represented the Sri Lankan A squad. The closest {{he came to}} national recognition {{was when he was}} included in the 30-member provisional squad for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England, but he was left out of the final 15 squad. That call-up came close on <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> maiden first-class ton, 135 for Basnahira South against Ruhuna Royals in the SLC Inter-Provincial Tournament, a match in which he also claimed five wickets. In 2012, Milinda went over to England to become Bury CC's professional for the 2012 season but his stay was cut short as he was selected to play in the Sri Lanka Premier League.|$|E
500|$|On <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{feud with}} Edge, Cena {{was placed in}} an inter-brand angle to {{determine}} the [...] "Champion of Champions" [...] – or which was the most dominant champion in WWE's three brands. Cena, the World Heavyweight Champion King Booker, and the ECW World Champion Big Show engaged in a mini-feud leading to a triple threat match at Cyber Sunday, with the viewers voting on which of the three championships would {{be placed on the}} line. At the same time, Cena became involved in a storyline with non-wrestler Kevin Federline, when he began appearing on Raw with Johnny Nitro and Melina. After getting into a worked physical altercation with Federline on Raw, Federline appeared at Cyber Sunday to hit Cena with the World Heavyweight Championship during the match, helping King Booker retain his championship. 2006 ended with Cena beginning a feud with the undefeated Umaga over the WWE Championship, while 2007 began with the end of his storyline with Kevin Federline. On the first Raw of the new year, Cena was pinned by Federline with an assist from Umaga, although later in the night he was able to get his hands on Federline performing an FU on him. At the pay-per-view event, New Year's Revolution, Cena defeated Umaga to end his undefeated streak and retain the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble, Cena defeated Umaga in a Last Man Standing match and retained the title after Umaga was unable to get to his feet before the referee counted to ten.|$|E
