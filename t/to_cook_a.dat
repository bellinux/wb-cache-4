25|$|The Contestants {{were put}} through their paces in a Boot Camp cook-off. The wild card contestants, Bill and Jason, were {{designated}} team leaders {{and asked to}} split the finalists into 2 teams (red and blue). They proceeded through physical challenges that showcased their communication, teamwork and problem-solving skills. The final task would be a cook off with the ingredients determined {{at the end of}} each round. If they won a challenge they were able to have first pick of the ingredients including meat or vegetables. The final team challenge was to start a fire from scratch. The contestants (in their teams) then had <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>a</b> 4 course meal and damper on their camp-fires to impress the judges and feed the commandos who led them through the challenges. The winning team (blue) consisted of Fenton, Sophie, Bill and David. They defeated Ivan, Katie and Jason of the red team. The winning team was then put in the awkward position to choose one contestant from the losing team to eliminate and they had to name that person within 30 seconds. They chose to eliminate the strongest competitor.|$|E
25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down the barrel of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>a</b> meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} written {{reference to}} the Slavic hogweed soup {{can be found in}} [...] (Domestic Order), a 16th-century Russian compendium of moral rules and homemaking advice. It recommends growing the plant [...] "by the fence, around the whole garden, where the nettle grows", <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>a</b> soup of it in springtime and reminds the reader to, [...] "for the Lord's sake, share it with those in need". Simon Syrenius (...) , a 17th-century Polish botanist, described [...] "our Polish hogweed" [...] as a vegetable that was well known throughout Poland, Rus', Lithuania and Samogitia (that is, most of the northern part of Eastern Europe), typically used for cooking a [...] "tasty and graceful soup" [...] with capon stock, eggs, sour cream and millet. More interested in the plant's medicinal properties than its culinary use, he also recommended pickled hogweed juice as a cure for fever or hangover.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Swedish Chef" [...] – A cooking show parody. It {{consists}} of the Swedish Chef, who speaks mock Swedish, semi-comprehensible gibberish which parodies the characteristic vowel sounds and intonation of Swedish. He attempts <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>a</b> dish with great enthusiasm until the punchline hits. A hallmark of these sketches was the improvisation between Jim Henson (who performed the Chef's head and voice) and Frank Oz (who was his hands). One would often make something up on the spot, making the other puppeteer comply with the action. Famous gags include [...] "chickie in du baskie" [...] ("two points!"), Swedish meatballs that bounce, and smashing a cake {{with a baseball bat}} after it begins insulting the Chef in mock Japanese.

2500|$|Braising {{pans and}} {{roasting}} pans (also known as braisers and roasters) are large, wide and shallow, to provide space <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>a</b> roast (chicken, beef or pork). They typically have two loop or tab handles, {{and may have}} a cover. Roasters are usually made of heavy gauge metal {{so that they may}} be used safely on a cooktop following roasting in an oven. Unlike most other cooking vessels, roasters are usually rectangular or oval. There is no sharp boundary between braisers and roasters – the same pan, with or without a cover, can be used for both functions. In Europe, a clay roaster [...] is still popular because it allows roasting without adding grease or liquids. This helps preserve flavor and nutrients. Having to soak the pot in water for 15 minutes before use is a notable drawback.|$|E
2500|$|With The Wrong Box (1966) and Bedazzled (1967) Cook and Moore {{began to}} act in films together. Directed by Stanley Donen, the {{underlying}} story of Bedazzled is credited to Cook and Moore and its screenplay <b>to</b> <b>Cook.</b> <b>A</b> comic parody of Faust, it stars Cook as George Spigott (The Devil) who tempts Stanley Moon (Moore), a frustrated, short-order chef, {{with the promise of}} gaining his heart's desire – the unattainable beauty and waitress at his cafe, Margaret Spencer (Eleanor Bron) – in exchange for his soul, but repeatedly tricks him. The film features cameo appearances by Barry Humphries as Envy and Raquel Welch as Lust. Moore composed the soundtrack music and co-wrote (with Cook) the songs performed in the film. His jazz trio backed Cook on the theme, a parodic anti-love song, which Cook delivered in a monotonous deadpan voice and included his familiar put-down, [...] "you fill me with inertia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Demosthenes {{had already}} been {{planning}} an attack on Sphacteria, as {{the difficulty of the}} circumstances his men were in had led him to doubt the viability of a prolonged siege. [...] Moreover, a fire on the island, ignited by Athenian sailors sneaking across <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>a</b> meal away from the crowded confines of Pylos, had denuded the island of vegetation and allowed Demosthenes to examine both the contours of the island and the number and disposition of the defenders. Seeing that only thirty Spartans were detailed to guard {{the southern end of the}} island, away from Pylos, Demosthenes landed his 800 hoplites on both the seaward and landward sides of the island one night. [...] The Spartan garrison, thinking that the Athenian ships were only mooring in their usual nightly watch posts, was caught off guard and massacred. [...] At dawn, the remainder of the Athenian force streamed ashore; these included some 2,000 light troops (psiloi) and archers and some 8,000 rowers from the fleet, armed with whatever weapons could be found.|$|E

2500|$|Pizza / Mcpizza – McDonald's {{has also}} {{attempted}} pizza at various times, with an apple-pie–like McPizza and more conventional McDonald's Pizza. A line of personal-sized pizzas was first {{seen in the}} late 1970s in test-market stores near interstate highways around Milwaukee and Madison. In Canada (c. 1992–99), the pizza originally began as a family-sized pizza that was brought out to the table by an employee and placed on a raised rack in {{the centre of the}} table. Later it was scaled down to a personal-sized pizza. However, variations have found their way into some international markets such as India (the pie-like [...] "Pizza McPuff"). McDonald's also test marketed a 14-inch, round, traditional-style pizza in Evansville, Indiana, and nearby Owensboro, Kentucky, in 1989. By 1991, the McDonald's test markets for pizza had grown to over 500 McDonald's locations before the pizza test was placed on hold. Pizza was discontinued in most restaurants by 2000. The reason for eliminating the pizza from the menu was that the time <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>a</b> pizza took 11 minutes, and McDonald's wanted to keep its reputation for fast service. As of March 2017, two McDonald's locations, one in Pomeroy, Ohio, and the other in Spencer, West Virginia still offer the family style McPizza.|$|E
