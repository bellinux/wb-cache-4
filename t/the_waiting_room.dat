5|$|An {{interior}} rearrangement {{was completed}} around 1942. The women's {{room for the}} main waiting room was moved from the east side to the west side, with one bay added to the west wing. A new dining area was constructed, occupying one-third of <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> with its kitchen occupying the former bathroom space. The lunch cafe and staircases were also modified.|$|E
5|$|A new {{station was}} built in 1897, {{slightly}} to the southeast, behind the Lovell Block. In 1927, the Fitchburg Cutoff became freight-only between the Alewife area and Somerville Junction. Passenger trains from the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad were diverted to the Fitchburg mainline and began to stop at Cambridge station. In 1937, the Boston and Maine Railroad built a two-story brick depot by the bridge, with the ticket office at street level and <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> and platforms below.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, Giffnock had no church buildings, and {{religious}} meetings took place in <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> of Giffnock Railway Station and, later, in the clubhouse at Eastwood Golf Course. Orchardhill Parish Church, designed by HE Clifford and completed in 1899, was the first church built within Giffnock. Now a category B listed building, the Church is built in a Gothic revival style of architecture and is built mainly of locally quarried stone.|$|E
50|$|Panelling in {{the office}} {{consisted}} of North Carolina pine and ash, the latter also used to panel <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> {{at either end of}} the station. Hardwood floors were installed throughout <b>the</b> building. <b>The</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> were originally segregated, with a smoking room for men and a non-smoking room for women. These were later transformed for local and express trains.|$|R

5000|$|In 1851, Levett Ibbetson helped {{manage the}} Great Exhibition. At this event, public toilets were {{relatively}} novel, and Ibbetson {{was given the}} task of writing an 'Official Report On <b>The</b> <b>Waiting</b> <b>Rooms</b> and Washing Places in the Exhibition Building' - during which he recorded [...] "The largest receipt from <b>the</b> <b>Waiting</b> <b>Rooms</b> was on Wednesday, 8 October 1851 when 11,171 persons made use of them".|$|R
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> {{outside the}} morgue, the doctor tells Buffy that Joyce {{died of an}} {{aneurysm}} suddenly and painlessly. Left alone with Buffy, Tara tells her that her own mother {{died when she was}} 17 and she went through something similar. Dawn goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches out to touch her cheek.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{many of the}} 1970s repairs were {{beginning}} to wear down, and the city put aside its plans for the maritime museum. The New London Railroad Company, fronted by historian Barbara Timken and local businessman Todd O'Donnell, bought the station from the city as the New London Railroad Company in 2002. The pair organized a second full restoration of the station, including a new slate roof, restored brickwork, and restoration of <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> to its original configuration. The mezzanine level and basement atrium created in the 1976 renovation were removed. Additionally, mechanical systems were upgraded and various accessibility concerns addressed. The baggage room was restored for Greyhound use. Amtrak and Greyhound rent space from the company for offices and passenger waiting areas.|$|E
5|$|A free buffet for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free Buffet Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 {{hours a day for}} the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945. It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north-south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised Preston Passion of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).|$|E
50|$|In 1915, {{during the}} First World War, various offices were added. From the {{beginning}} of the 1920s onwards, there was growing criticism of the state of <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, plans were made to merge the Friemersheim and Rheinhausen stations as a single central passenger station. The redevelopment of <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> was continually postponed because of the latter proposal. However, the new central station did not eventuate.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the main floor consisted of <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> in <b>the</b> west wing, a dining room in the northeast corner tower, and a kitchen, lunch counter, and baggage areas in the south wing. <b>The</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> included a general <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> a ladies' <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> (with a private entrance and an entrance from <b>the</b> general <b>waiting</b> <b>room)</b> on <b>the</b> northwest corner, and a [...] "colored" [...] <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> on <b>the</b> southwest corner. <b>The</b> colored <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> a relic of segregation, had a separate entrance. The second story consisted of L&N offices, and the third story in the northeast tower {{was used as a}} drafting room by L&N engineers.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} late night trains that arrive at this station but <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> may be closed during that time. Please note that <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> for {{passengers}} are not open from 11pm to 5am {{and you may}} have to <b>wait</b> on <b>the</b> platforms which is especially difficult during winter. Also, you will not find any open restaurants/cafe/bar inside the station during this time. So, plan your travel accordingly. You can just use the self-service dispensers on the platforms.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{after its}} {{foundation}} the LNC used existing firms of London undertakers to arrange funerals, {{but over time}} took over {{all aspects of the}} arrangements from coffin-making to masonry. LNC funerals were intentionally kept as similar as possible to those of traditional undertakers, with the exception that a railway carriage was used in place of a hearse. On being commissioned to provide a funeral, invitations would be sent out either by the deceased's family or from the LNC offices. These letters specified <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> to be used, the time of the train to Brookwood, and the expected return time to London. If the funeral was to be held in London, a traditional hearse and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church for the service, and then on to the London railway terminus; if the funeral was to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood, the procession would come directly to the terminus.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{work began}} on a {{complete}} redevelopment {{of the station}} building. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers' journeys {{to and from the}} station, and a new multi-storey car park was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility. A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003. In 2006, construction started on a new platform face {{on the north side of}} platform 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new platform, platform 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister Tom Harris MP. As part of the reconstruction, <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> at the east end of platform 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended waiting area and customer help desk. Platform 1 was subsequently redesignated platform 3. The work cost £3,000,000, and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing £100,000 towards the new waiting room and help desk.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E
25|$|There are, in {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms,</b> several arbitration and consultation chambers together with robing rooms {{for members of the}} bar and solicitor advocates.|$|R
5000|$|The {{passenger}} area, in {{the southern}} half of the building, was originally divided into three sections: <b>the</b> colored <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> in <b>the</b> southeast corner (still enclosed), <b>the</b> general <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> in <b>the</b> southwest corner, and the ticket agent's office adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms.</b> A baggage area lay between the ticket office and the freight area. [...] The interior has exposed rafters and pendant lights. The original slate roof was replaced with a metal roof in the 1980s, which was in turn replaced in 2012. The roof has been painted gray to match {{the color of the}} original roof.|$|R

5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E

25|$|On 14 February 2008, Moss Airport, Rygge opened. To {{make the}} station an airport rail link, NSB {{introduced}} a free shuttle bus {{from the station}} to the airport in connection with all train services that call at Rygge Station. This increased the annual ridership at the station by 100,000. However, neighbors of the station had problems with strangers {{in the middle of}} the night asking for directions to the airport. In 2010, the National Rail Administration reopened the station building for waiting passengers, after <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> had been closed for 30 years.
