40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The study {{sought to}} {{determine}} dynamic changes and theoretical bases of a clinical diagnostic test, the <b>tear</b> clearance rate. METHODS [...] Thirty four healthy subjects {{ranging in age from}} 22 to 84 years underwent examination of <b>tear</b> clearance rate, the Schirmer test with anaesthesia, as well as fluorophotometric measurement of <b>tear</b> turnover, <b>tear</b> volume, and <b>tear</b> flow. By applying 0. 5 % fluorescein into the conjunctival sac and subsequently measuring colour fades on a Schirmer strip, the <b>tear</b> clearance rate for assessing <b>tear</b> drainage was divided into nine grades. The results of the <b>tear</b> clearance rate were compared with those of the basal <b>tear</b> turnover and <b>tear</b> flow obtained from fluorophotometry. RESULTS [...] Significant relations were found between the <b>tear</b> clearance rate and the basal <b>tear</b> turnover or <b>tear</b> flow (r = 0. 91 and 0. 79, respectively, p = 0. 0001). Considering the grades of progression from low to high, each grade of <b>tear</b> clearance rate showed a 12. 5 % increase in basal <b>tear</b> turnover (3. 59 %/min) and <b>tear</b> flow (0. 38 microliter/min). There was no significant correlation between age and the basal <b>tear</b> turnover, <b>tear</b> volume, <b>tear</b> flow, or the <b>tear</b> clearance rate. CONCLUSION [...] The <b>tear</b> clearance rate is proposed as a simple and useful way to estimate basal <b>tear</b> turnover and <b>tear</b> flow, and measure <b>tear</b> drainage indirectly...|$|R

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} theorized that {{degenerative}} rotator cuff <b>tears</b> most commonly involve the supraspinatus tendon, initiating at the anterior {{portion of the}} supraspinatus insertion and propagating posteriorly.

40|$|One {{approach}} to the noninvasive monitoring of blood glucose concentration is to monitor glucose concentrations in <b>tear</b> fluid. While several methods for sensing glucose in <b>tear</b> fluid have been proposed, controversy remains as to the precise concentrations of <b>tear</b> glucose in normal and diabetic subjects and as to whether <b>tear</b> fluid glucose concentrations correlate with blood glucose concentrations. This review covers the present undetstanding of the physiology of glucose transport in <b>tears,</b> the regulation of the aqueous <b>tear</b> fraction, and studies of <b>tear</b> glucose concentration over the last 80 years. The various <b>tear</b> collection methods employed greatly influence the measured <b>tear</b> glucose concentrations. Studies that involve mechanical irritation of the conjunctiva during sampling measure the highest <b>tear</b> glucose concentrations, while studies that avoid <b>tear</b> stimulation measure the lowest concentrations.

40|$|Clinically, a {{decrease}} in <b>tear</b> film stability {{has been associated with}} both dry eye and contact lens discontinuation. Rabbits are known to have a significantly longer inter-blink time compared to humans, perhaps due to their very stable <b>tear</b> film. The reason for this, however, has never been studied at a detailed biochemical level. This research project therefore sets out to examine the <b>tear</b> film biochemistry and molecular interactions in humans and rabbits and determine how these affect the <b>tear</b> stability. The research outcomes could lead to the development of novel ways to increase <b>tear</b> film stability and hence ocular comfort. Initially, <b>tear</b> break-up time (TBUT) of rabbit <b>tears</b> was measured with a slit-lamp biomicroscope and tearscope. The average TBUT of rabbit <b>tears</b> was 30 minutes, which is in line with their long inter-blink time reported in the literature. The <b>tear</b> osmolality and surfactant properties were measured using the vapour pressure osmometer, and the Langmuir trough, respectively. Compared to human <b>tears,</b> rabbit <b>tears</b> had a higher osmolality and demonstrated different <b>tear</b> surfactant properties, which indicates the different biochemical composition of <b>tears</b> from the two species. In this thesis, the concentrations of metal cations were tested using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). A higher concentration of divalent cations was found in rabbit <b>tears.</b> Their influence on the <b>tear</b> film stability was analysed in vitro by measuring surface tension using the Langmuir trough and in vivo by grading the <b>tear</b> break-up with a slit-lamp biomicroscope. In rabbit <b>tears,</b> reducing the divalent cations concentration significantly decreased the maximum surface pressure from 37 mN/m to 30 mN/m in vitro and resulted in more extensive <b>tear</b> disturbance in vivo. In humans however, changed concentrations of divalent cations did not show any change. <b>Tear</b> protein and lipid composition as well as protein-protein interactions were analysed using a range of proteomic and lipidomic techniques. A clear difference in composition was found between human and rabbit <b>tears.</b> The components present only or more abundantly in rabbit <b>tears,</b> along with divalent cations, were further assessed to determine their influence on human <b>tear</b> surfactant properties using the Langmuir trough. The predominant proteins in rabbits, lipophilins and prolactin inducible protein (PIP), exhibited very strong surface activity and bringing human <b>tear</b> surfactant properties closer to that of rabbit <b>tears.</b> Other components, including dihydrolanosterol, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which are more abundant in rabbit <b>tears,</b> demonstrated no change to human <b>tear</b> surfactant properties. This thesis demonstrated that the predominant proteins and divalent cations found in rabbit <b>tears</b> could be potentially used to improve human <b>tear</b> film stability. Ultimately, outcomes of this research may lead to the development of novel ways to increase <b>tear</b> film stability to provide lasting relief from debilitating dry eye symptoms and increase comfort during contact lens wear...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether <b>tear</b> collection by flushing the ocular surface with saline (flush <b>tears)</b> or collection by stimulation (reflex <b>tears)</b> {{can be used}} as an alternative to basal <b>tear</b> collection for the identification and quantification of lipids in the <b>tear</b> film. Methods: <b>Tear</b> samples were collected from 10 participants with no history of ocular surface disease or contact lens wear. Up to 10 µl of basal, reflex, and flush <b>tear</b> samples were collected from each eye using a microcapillary tube on three occasions with the order of methods randomized and allowing at least 24 hours between each collection method. Lipids were quantified from each <b>tear</b> sample using nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Total lipids significantly differed in their concentration (pmol/µl) and mole % with each collection technique. Cholesterol esters [mean % (SE) ] formed the major component of the total lipidome in basal [54. 8 % (3. 1) ], reflex [35. 7 % (6. 4) ], and flush [33. 0 % (3. 1) ] <b>tear</b> samples. However, the mole % of each lipid class substantially varied with each <b>tear</b> collection method. Nonpolar lipids, including cholesterol, wax esters, and triacylglycerols, dominated the <b>tear</b> lipidome in basal [92. 8 % (1. 9) ], reflex [71. 8 % (7. 9) ], and flush [83. 6 % (3. 8) ] <b>tear</b> samples. However, the mole % of phospholipids in reflex [27. 5 % (8. 1) ] and flush [15. 8 % (3. 8) ] <b>tear</b> samples was higher (p = 0. 005) than that in basal <b>tears</b> [5. 4 % (2. 0) ]. Conclusions: Flush or reflex <b>tears</b> did not have similar lipid profiles in either concentration or in mole % to basal <b>tears.</b> It is recommended that basal <b>tears</b> are used for <b>tear</b> lipid analysis as the reflex or flush <b>tears</b> contain very low levels of most lipid components...|$|R
40|$|Plasminogen {{activator}} activity (PAA) in <b>tears</b> {{of pregnant}} women was investigated at various gestation times to assess the availability of plasminogen activator for aiding potential corneal wound healing processes during pregnancy. PAA was measured by a spectrophotometric method. The analysis used 91 <b>tear</b> samples from pregnant and non-pregnant women, supplemented with 10 additional <b>tear</b> PAA measurements from non-pregnant women obtained in a previous study. <b>Tear</b> levels of PAA in pregnant women formed a bimodal distribution. Either the <b>tear</b> PAA level was zero or non-zero during pregnancy. When non-zero, the <b>tear</b> PAA level was dissociated from gestation time and not different than non-pregnant and post-pregnant levels. The frequency of occurrence of zero level <b>tear</b> PAA increased with gestation: 16 %, 17 % and 46 % had zero <b>tear</b> PAA in samples taken from women in the first, second and third trimester, respectively. Overall, of the <b>tear</b> samples taken from women during pregnancy, a total of 26 % were at zero <b>tear</b> PAA. The remaining <b>tear</b> samples had non-zero <b>tear</b> PAA values throughout gestation equivalent to non-pregnant <b>tear</b> PAA values, suggesting local control {{of the source of}} PAA in <b>tears.</b> Given the importance of the plasminogen activator system in <b>tears</b> to wound healing in the cornea, and the high occurrence of zero <b>tear</b> PAA in our sample {{of pregnant women}}, elective corneal surgery would be contraindicated. If corneal surgery is nevertheless necessary, the <b>tear</b> PAA level would be worth checking and patients with low level should be closely observed during the postoperative period...|$|R
40|$|Background: Rabbits have {{a longer}} inter-blink time (approximately 10 minutes) {{compared}} with humans (five to eight seconds), suggesting that rabbits {{have a much more}} stable <b>tear</b> film.
