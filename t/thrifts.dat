25|$|The United States banking {{industry}} {{is one of}} the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world, with multiple specialized and focused regulators. All banks with FDIC-insured deposits have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as a regulator. However, for soundness examinations (i.e., whether a bank is operating in a sound manner), the Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator for Fed-member state banks; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the primary federal regulator for national banks; and the Office of Thrift Supervision, or OTS, is the primary federal regulator for <b>thrifts.</b> State non-member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the FDIC. National banks have one primary regulator– the OCC.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these complex economic conditions, thrift managers resorted to several innovations, such as alternative mortgage instruments and interest-bearing checking accounts, {{as a way to}} retain funds and generate lending business. Such actions allowed the industry to continue to record steady asset growth and profitability during the 1970s even though the actual number of <b>thrifts</b> was falling. Despite such growth, there were still clear signs that the industry was chafing under the constraints of regulation. This was especially true with the large S in the western United States that yearned for additional lending powers to ensure continued growth. Despite several efforts to modernize these laws in the 1970s, few substantive changes were enacted.|$|E

2500|$|The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) {{had been}} created to insure {{deposits}} held by savings and loan institutions ("S", or [...] "thrifts").

[...] FSLIC was abolished in August 1989 and replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC).

The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA).

2500|$|An {{important}} trend involved raising rates paid on {{savings to}} lure deposits, {{a practice that}} resulted in periodic rate wars between <b>thrifts</b> and even commercial banks.

These conditions, which {{came to be known as}} stagflation, wreaked havoc with thrift finances for a variety of reasons. Because regulators controlled the rates that <b>thrifts</b> could pay on savings, when interest rates rose depositors often withdrew their funds and placed them in accounts that earned market rates, a process known as disintermediation.

2500|$|In early 2005, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) {{implemented}} {{new rules}} that – among other changes – allowed <b>thrifts</b> with over $1 {{billion in assets}} to tweak the long-standing 50-25-25 CRA ratings thresholds by continuing to meet 50 percent of their overall CRA rating through lending activity as always but the other 50 percent could be any combination of lending, investment, and services that the thrift wanted.
