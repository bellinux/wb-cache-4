25|$|As an {{organized}} movement, Humanism itself is quite recent – {{born at the}} University of Chicago in the 1920s, and made public in 1933 {{with the publication of}} the first Humanist Manifesto. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Humanist</b> Association was incorporated as an Illinois non-profit organization in 1943. The International Humanist and Ethical Union was founded in 1952, when a gathering of world Humanists met under the leadership of Sir Julian Huxley.

25|$|These Friends have views {{similar to}} other post-Christian non-theists in other churches such as the Sea of Faith within the Anglican church. They are {{predominantly}} atheists, agnostics, and humanists who nevertheless value membership in a religious organization. The first organisation for non-theist Friends was the Humanistic Society of Friends, founded in Los Angeles in 1939. This organisation remained small and was absorbed into <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Humanist</b> Association. More recently, interest in non-theism resurfaced, particularly led by British Friend David Boulton, who founded the 40 member Nontheist Friends Network in 2011. Non-theism is controversial, leading some Christian Quakers from within Britain Yearly Meeting to call for non-theists to be refused membership.|$|E
