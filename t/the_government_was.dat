5|$|In {{addition}} to the whiskey tax, westerners {{had a number of}} other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the perception that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier. The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> {{required}} to move an amendment in the Legislative Council (LegCo) {{to suspend the}} levy {{in accordance with the}} Executive Council decision. Faced with calls to abolish the levy, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> adamantly opposed; according to the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, the HK$5billion fund would only support the Employment Retraining Board for four or five years if the levy was permanently waived.|$|E
50|$|Government of Republika Srpska (Влада Републике Српске) is the {{executive}} authority of Republika Srpska, along with the President of Republika Srpska. The Prime Minister <b>is</b> head of <b>the</b> <b>Government,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> composed of his deputies and ministers. The powers of <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>are</b> determined by <b>the</b> Constitution of Republika Srpska. <b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> appointed by <b>the</b> National Assembly for a four-year term.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most complex}} special {{capacity}} of <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> when it functions, {{in one way}} or another, as the Subsidizer of the speech in question. As a general rule, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> can itself say whatever it wants to, even if this [...] "favors one viewpoint over another". But, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> may not impose conditions on how subsidy recipients spend money they get from other sources. If <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> using <b>the</b> speakers to express its own message, it is constitutional. But this analysis changes if <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> trying to encourage a [...] "diversity of private views indiscriminately". If it is indiscriminate, then under Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez (2001), <b>the</b> <b>government</b> must <b>be</b> acting in a viewpoint-neutral way. However, if <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> basing some judgment of [...] "quality" [...] on the views, then only [...] "invidious viewpoint discrimination" [...] is barred.|$|R

5|$|A CRA poll {{released}} in March 2010 showed {{public support for}} Williams' Progressive Conservative Party that had extended to a record 80 percent of decided voters, up from 77 percent from February. Satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> 93 percent voters. After controversies arose surrounding the accidental expropriation of the Grand Falls-Windsor paper mill and the province's readiness to react to a possible oil spill, the Williams led government {{as well as his}} personal popularity took a slight hit. A CRA poll conducted in May 2010, showed that satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> at 87 percent down from 93 percent in March, the party's support had fallen five percent to 75 percent and Williams own support fell to 79 percent down from 81 percent. Even with the slight loss in support Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{a stormy}} debate {{in which the}} {{survival}} of <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> called into question, a compromise was reached whereby Aberhart's government relinquished considerable power to a committee of backbenchers. This committee, dominated by insurgents, recruited two British social credit experts to come to Alberta and advise on the implementation of social credit. Among the experts' first moves was to require a loyalty pledge from Social Credit MLAs. Almost all signed, thus ending the crisis, {{though most of the}} legislation the experts proposed was ultimately disallowed or struck down as unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|After {{considering}} the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships. All the ships {{were to be}} permanently stationed in the NEI, and none would be used in European waters. The ships were larger than those proposed by the commission, however. Idenburg opposed this decision, and unsuccessfully argued {{for at least a}} fifth battleship to be built. In October 1913 it was rumored that <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>was</b> about to order the first ship, {{and that it would be}} paid for by a loan borne by NEI.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> also {{confirmed}} by the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA).

50|$|Critics such as Neil E. Harrison {{argue that}} <b>the</b> <b>government</b> would likely <b>be</b> {{resistant}} to sustainable {{changes for the}} current capitalist model. Since <b>the</b> capitalist <b>government</b> <b>was</b> built upon capitalist ideals and business interests, he argues, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> dependent on <b>the</b> system. Often, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> most focused on overt crises rather than long-term solutions to problems that are not readily apparent. His main argument is that beyond the current structure, authority {{is not enough to}} control the social and economic aspects enough to truly impact the environmental needs.|$|R
5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was the protective tariff. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> running a surplus.|$|E
5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> {{on the verge of}} resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{escalating}} violence <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> forced to appeal for international peacekeepers on 25 May. Peacekeepers began to arrive in Dili the next day and eventually restored order. A total of 37 people were killed in the fighting in April and May and 155,000 fled their homes. A United Nations inquiry found that the interior and defence ministers and the commander of the F-FDTL had illegally transferred weapons to civilians during the crisis and recommended that they be prosecuted.|$|E

5|$|Australian rules {{football}} is the main sport played at the stadium which has hosted Australian Football League (AFL) games since 2001, when the state government started paying interstate clubs to relocate their home games. Melbourne-based Hawthorn played one game in 2001 and two in 2002, and in 2003 were joined by another Melbourne team, St Kilda. In 2004, {{it was estimated that}} the cost to the government per game was between $300,000 and $500,000, but Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon stated that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> making a profit on its investment, estimating that each game injected between $1million and $1.5million into the Tasmanian economy.|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E
5|$|During these events, no gunshots were fired. The {{people did}} not react strongly, which {{according}} to the military, {{was a sign of}} approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E

McCarthy also began investigations into the numerous homosexuals working in the foreign policy bureaucracy, who were considered prime candidates for blackmail by the Soviets. These accusations received wide publicity, increased his approval rating, and gained him a powerful national following.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{shortfalls}} have constrained {{the development}} of the F-FDTL. The government has been forced to postpone plans to form an independent company stationed in the Oecussi enclave and two reserve infantry battalions. These units formed {{an important part of the}} King's College report's option3 force structure and their absence may have impacted on East Timor's defence policy. As of 2011 <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> yet to announce what, if any, reserve units would be formed, though provisions for such units had been included in legislation.|$|E
5|$|In 1513 James IV {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} England, attempting {{to take advantage of}} the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at Flodden Field; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, James V, was an infant, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, Mary I. Once again, a regency was established.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council {{discussed}} {{the feasibility of}} building a road bridge. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> unenthusiastic about the idea, as {{they did not believe}} it was financially viable and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which would be paid for in tolls. The scheme received Royal Assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company was accepted on 9 June.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Lim mooted {{the idea}} that the {{proportion}} of each Primary 1 cohort that would be seeking a university education should be increased beyond the 30% by 2015 that <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>was</b> planning. She noted that in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2006 about 37% of each age cohort received a degree-level education, and that a sizeable number of Singaporean students who failed to gain entry into local universities had done well in reputable universities overseas. She also suggested giving concessionary fares to disabled individuals who make up 2% of the adult population under 60 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{a country}} where surveys of the {{religious}} composition estimated the Buddhist majority to be between 70 and 90 percent, {{the policies of the}} staunchly Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm generated claims of religious bias.
