60|$|Meanwhile I see Hardwicke's Science Gossip for March {{gives an}} extract {{from a letter}} of M. O. de <b>Thoron,</b> communicated by him to the Academie des Sciences, December 1861, which {{confirms}} Mr. Joseph's story. He asserts that in the Bay of Pailon, in Esmeraldos, Ecuador, i.e. on the Pacific Coast, and also up {{more than one of}} the rivers, he has heard a similar sound, attributed by the natives to a fish which they call 'The Siren,' or 'Musico.' At first, he says, he thought it was produced by a fly, or hornet of extraordinary size; but afterwards, having advanced a little farther, he heard a multitude of different voices, which harmonised together, imitating a church organ to great perfection. The good people of Trinidad believe that the fish which makes this noise is the trumpet-fish, or Fistularia--a beast strange enough in shape to be credited with strange actions: but ichthyologists say positively no: that the noise (at least along the coast of the United States) is made by a Pogonias, a fish somewhat like a great bearded perch, and cousin of the Maigre of the Mediterranean, which is accused of making a similar purring or grunting noise, which can be heard from a depth of one hundred and twenty feet, and guides the fishermen to their whereabouts.|$|E

50|$|Stendhal (Scott McNeil) {{is a red}} dragon who was {{banished from}} Dragon World for {{committing}} treason. He was once friends with <b>Thoron</b> and often competed with each other, but when <b>Thoron</b> was crowned king of the dragons, Stendhal grew jealous and rebelled against him. He teamed up with Xenoz to kill the Dragon Queen so that Xenoz could take her Ice Crystal. As punishment Stendehl was imprisoned for 1000 years. After he was released, he immediately battled <b>Thoron</b> once again. During this battle, the Aurothon was activated and though Stendhal was defeated and imprisoned in a golden temple, <b>Thoron</b> was hurled into the human world. He was almost freed by a sorceress named Scylla, {{the leader of the}} Odaku, in return for teaching her how to conjure Shadow Dragons.|$|E
50|$|In {{the dragon}} world, King <b>Thoron</b> refuses to {{interfere}} in human affairs, {{which is why they}} left a second time.

50|$|<b>Thoron</b> (Richard Newman) is the King of Dragons. He wears a huge silver collar {{around his}} neck but it has no gemstone. This is because he split the bright green-colored Aurothon, his gemstone, in two shards and hid the shards inside Dev and Kyra which gave them their {{elemental}} abilities over air and fire. <b>Thoron</b> can pass between both the Human and Dragon World and activate magical locations no others can. His beloved queen, whose name is unknown, was assassinated by Stendhal, a rogue dragon that was once good friends with <b>Thoron.</b> He can breathe incredibly strong and powerful fire. His gemstone is the Aurathon, {{and he is the}} only one besides Qionous who can use it.|$|E

50|$|Back at the castle, Xenoz summons ice dragons {{to fight}} <b>Thoron.</b> Dev and Kyra break in and quickly {{dispatch}} the vorgan guards but are captured by Xenoz, {{who uses a}} mind-reading crystal to discover the Aurathon's hiding place within Dev and Kyra. He then proceeds to extract it from their bodies. <b>Thoron</b> crashes through and falls {{to the base of}} the castle, where he discovers the skeleton of his queen. With a new driving force, he heads off to fight Xenoz. After betraying Gortaz, the leader of the vorgans, Xenoz gets hit in the face by Kyra. A mask falls off to reveal that Xenoz's face is burned. The downside of Xenoz's immortality was that he could never heal himself and he wants revenge for this. He opens the portal to Dragon World but <b>Thoron</b> gets in the way. However, Xenoz traps him in ice then explains that Dev and Kyra are weak and cannot do anything. <b>Thoron</b> begs to differ, pointing out that Dev and Kyra were chosen by the dragons themselves. With this, Dev and Kyra use their elemental abilities to break free and put the Aurathon back on Thoron's necklace. <b>Thoron</b> sticks himself in front of Xenoz's ice shards, seemingly sacrificing himself. However, he stands back up and then drags Xenoz back to Dragon World. With Xenoz gone, the ice castle begins to fall apart, so the kings and their children escape on Targon and Aurora.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{names were}} {{suggested}} for these three gases: exradio, exthorio, and exactinio in 1904; radon, <b>thoron,</b> and akton in 1918; radeon, thoreon, and actineon in 1919, and eventually radon, <b>thoron,</b> and actinon in 1920.

50|$|Finally, Halk Kar recovers his memory, and {{explains}} that he is from the planet <b>Thoron,</b> {{which is in the}} same star system as Krypton. Years ago, while on a pioneer voyage into space, he landed on Krypton with his damaged rocketship.

50|$|Eight years later, Dev and Kyra {{are both}} sixteen-year-old {{teenagers}} with strange abilities and want {{the war to}} end, but their fathers object to their ideas on how it should. They both violate orders and continue with their ideas anyway, catching the eye of Xenoz in the process. The two royals fight until their fathers and armies show up {{to fight to the}} death once and for all. Just before the battle commences, an army of vorgans show up and capture the kings. Xenoz arrives just in time to save Dev and Kyra and takes them to his ice mountain home. Once there, Xenoz recommends that they retrieve the Aurathon from a rogue dragon in order to rescue their fathers. In the cave where the dragon resides, they fight him but are quickly overpowered. The dragon then reveals that they were sent there to try and trick him into giving the Aurathon's location so that Xenoz could take it for himself. They escape the following vorgan attack and go to the Ring of Oroborus. There, the Dragon reveals himself to be the Dragon King <b>Thoron.</b> The kings, meanwhile, have discovered Xenoz's treachery when they learn that he kept the bones of dragons he had slain. <b>Thoron</b> explains the truth behind everything that made him leave. When Xenoz was granted the ability to use dragon crystals, it was only to promote good things between the two worlds. However, Xenoz conspired to kill the Dragon Queen {{with the help of an}} evil and vengeful dragon named Stendahl and her ice crystal. When <b>Thoron</b> arrived, he flamed them in his fury, but it wasn't strong enough. He took Stendahl back to the dragon and imprisoned him. Stendahl broke free 1,000 years later and attacked <b>Thoron</b> again. During the battle, the Aurathon became activated. While Stendahl was stopped, he hurled <b>Thoron</b> through where he bumped into the royals eight years earlier. Knowing he didn't have any strength to fight Xenoz (who was still alive thanks to his gift of immortality), he absorbed the Aurathon into himself and placed it inside Dev and Kyra. Knowing now where their elemental abilities came from, Dev and Kyra begin practicing their powers over fire and air. Unfortunately, they tear a hole in the Ring of Oroborus, alerting Xenoz to their position. They escape the attack with Targon and Aurora's help and head for Xenoz's castle.|$|E

5000|$|In 1910, Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray {{isolated}} radon, determined its density, {{and determined}} {{that it was the}} heaviest known gas. They wrote that [...] "L'expression de l'émanation du radium est fort incommode", (the expression 'radium emanation' is very awkward) and suggested the new name niton (Nt) (from the Latin [...] "nitens" [...] meaning [...] "shining") to emphasize the radioluminescence property, and in 1912 it was accepted by the International Commission for Atomic Weights. In 1923, the International Committee for Chemical Elements and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) chose among the names radon (Rn), <b>thoron</b> (Tn), and actinon (An). Later, when isotopes were numbered instead of named, the element took the name of the most stable isotope, radon, while Tn was renamed 220Rn and An was renamed 219Rn, which caused some confusion in the literature regarding the element's discovery as while Dorn had discovered radon the isotope, he had not been the first to discover radon the element. As late as the 1960s, the element was also referred to simply as emanation. The first synthesized compound of radon, radon fluoride, was obtained in 1962. Even today, the word radon may refer to either the element or its isotope 222Rn, with <b>thoron</b> remaining in use as a short name for 220Rn to stem this ambiguity.|$|E
5000|$|From 1900 to 1903, he {{was joined}} at McGill by the young chemist Frederick Soddy (Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1921) for whom he set the problem of {{identifying}} the thorium emanations.

5000|$|Three other radon {{isotopes}} have a half-life of over an hour: 211Rn, 210Rn and 224Rn.

Similarly, 219Rn is derived from the most stable isotope of actinium (227Ac)—named [...] "actinon"—and is an alpha emitter with a half-life of 3.96 seconds. No radon isotopes occur significantly in the neptunium (237Np) decay series, though a trace amount of the (extremely unstable) isotope 217Rn is produced.|$|E

After Sulu claimed their navigational equipment had malfunctioned, Kang insisted upon escorting the Excelsior back to Federation space, to help them from getting lost again.

After this succeeded, they set course once more for Qo'noS, before being attacked again by three Klingon battlecruisers - an attack that killed Lieutenant Dimitri Valtane. As Tuvok watched Valtane die, the memory appeared once more, and in Sickbay, the neural engrams destabilize, preventing the meld from being broken.
