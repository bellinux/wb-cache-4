5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Ants have colonised {{almost every}} landmass on Earth. The only places lacking {{indigenous}} ants are Antarctica {{and a few}} remote or inhospitable islands.

5|$|The mammals {{represent}} the only living Synapsida, which {{together with the}} Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs, a group that produced the non-mammalian Dimetrodon. At {{the end of the}} Carboniferous period, this group diverged from the sauropsid line that led to today's reptiles and birds. The line following the stem group Sphenacodontia split-off several diverse groups of non-mammalian synapsids—sometimes referred to as mammal-like reptiles—before giving rise to the proto-mammals (Therapsida) in the early Mesozoic era. The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been among the dominant <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> groups from 66 million years ago to the present.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|Thyroxine is {{critical}} to the regulation of metabolism and growth throughout the animal kingdom. For example, Iodine and T4 trigger the change from a plant-eating water-dwelling tadpole into a meat-eating land-dwelling frog, with better neurological, visuospatial, smell and cognitive abilities for hunting, as seen in other predatory animals. A similar phenomenon happens in the neotenic amphibian salamanders, which, without introducing iodine, don't transform into land-dwelling adults, and live and reproduce in the larval form of aquatic axolotl. Among amphibians, administering a thyroid-blocking agent such as propylthiouracil (PTU) can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs; in contrast, administering thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis. In amphibian metamorphosis, thyroxine and iodine also exert a well-studied experimental model of apoptosis on the cells of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles. Iodine, via iodolipids, has favored the evolution of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> species and has likely {{played a crucial role in}} the evolution of the human brain.|$|E

25|$|The oncilla is a {{primarily}} <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal,</b> {{but is also}} an adept climber. Like all cats, the oncilla is an obligate carnivore, requiring {{meat for}} survival. This cat eats small mammals, lizards, birds, eggs, invertebrates, and the occasional tree frog. Occasionally, the cat will eat grasses. The oncilla stalks its prey from a distance, and once in range, it pounces to catch and kill the prey.|$|E
25|$|While most big cat {{species are}} individual, ambush predators, Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are pursuit predators. Widely {{known as the}} fastest <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal,</b> with speeds {{reaching}} 61–64 miles per hour, cheetahs {{take advantage of their}} speed during chases. However, their speed and acceleration also have disadvantages, as both can only be sustained for short periods of time. Studies show that cheetahs can maintain maximum speed for a distance of approximately 500 yards. Due to these limitations, cheetahs are often observed running at moderate speeds during chases. There are claims that the key to cheetahs' pursuit success may not be just their speed. Cheetahs are extremely agile, able to maneuver and change directions at very high speeds in very short amounts of time. This extensive maneuverability can make up for unsustainable high speed pursuit, as it allows cheetahs to quickly close the distance between prey without decreasing their speed when prey change direction.|$|E

500|$|During the spring, {{the wood}} turtle is active during the daytime (usually from about 7:00a.m. and 7:00p.m.) and will almost always be found within several hundred metres of a stream.

500|$|The {{position}} of scorpions is particularly controversial. Some early fossils {{such as the}} Late Silurian Proscorpius have been classified by paleontologists as scorpions, but described as wholly aquatic as they had gills rather than book lungs or tracheae. Their mouths are also completely under their heads and almost between the first pair of legs, as in the extinct eurypterids and living horseshoe crabs. This presents a difficult choice: classify Proscorpius and other aquatic fossils as something other than scorpions, despite the similarities; accept that [...] "scorpions" [...] are not monophyletic but consist of separate aquatic and terrestrial groups; or treat scorpions as {{more closely related to}} eurypterids and possibly horseshoe crabs than to spiders and other arachnids, so that either scorpions are not arachnids or [...] "arachnids" [...] are not monophyletic. Cladistic analyses have recovered Proscorpius within the scorpions, based on reinterpretation of the species' breathing apparatus. This is reflected also in the reinterpretation of Palaeoscorpius as a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|E

30|$|The marine {{reservoir}} {{effect in}} pottery {{should not be}} neglected, though. A special risk {{lies in the fact}} that partly marine food crusts can have the same δ 13 C values as the bone collagen of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals.</b> For example, δ 13 C values between - 22.0 and - 24.7 ‰ of food remains on pottery belonging to the Pitted Ware Culture were interpreted as reflecting terrestrial origin, although the radiocarbon dates were older than expected [83]. However, terrestrial plants and fat and flesh of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals</b> usually have more negative δ 13 C values, around ca. - 25 ‰, while the bone collagen of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals</b> is more enriched. Food crust values which are more enriched than - 25 ‰ indicate therefore the presence of marine resources. Similarly, the δ 13 C values of food crusts from Tybrind Vig, mean δ 13 C = - 23 ± 1 ‰, indicate a strong marine component [84], but were originally interpreted as being terrestrial [85].|$|R

500|$|Designers {{created the}} alien Mimics to look {{different}} from any <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal.</b> Davis and Liman favored an early model composed primarily of tentacles. SPI's Dan Kramer described its appearance as [...] "heavy black spaghetti" [...] and noted that the modelers faced a challenge creating the tentacled creatures. A technical animator created an Autodesk Maya plugin that made the movement of each tentacle independent. Since Liman {{did not want the}} Mimics to look [...] "too organic or terrestrial", Imageworks' artists devised the idea of making the aliens out of an obsidian-like material, [...] "basically a glass that could cut". Various debris was incorporated within the tentacles to give the creature a sense of weight and fast movement. The Alphas were given a definable head area to show their status as more sentient, while receiving a different color and a bigger size compared to the Mimic grunts. Cinesite created the mechanical Mimics used in the training areas, while MPC created the Omega in a digital environment into which the effects artists composited underwater footage filmed at Leavesden's water tank.|$|E
500|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{potential}} wildlife impact of the dam predate the National People's Congress's approval in 1992. This region {{has long been known}} for its rich biodiversity. It is home to 6,388 species of plants, which belong to 238 families and 1508 genera. Of these plant species, 57 percent are endangered. These rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines. Already, the percentage of forested area in the region surrounding the Three Gorges Dam has dropped from twenty percent in 1950 to less than ten percent as of 2002, negatively affecting all plant species in this locality. The region also provides habitats to hundreds of freshwater and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> species. Freshwater fish are especially affected by dams due to changes in the water temperature and flow regime. Many other fish are hurt in the turbine blades of the hydroelectric plants as well. This is particularly detrimental to the ecosystem of the region because the Yangtze River basin is home to 361 different fish species and accounts for twenty-seven percent of all endangered freshwater fish species in China. Other aquatic species have been endangered by the dam, particularly the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin, [...] now extinct. In fact, Government Chinese scholars even claim that the Three Gorges Dam directly caused the extinction of the baiji.|$|E
500|$|A 2012 {{study by}} {{scientists}} Karl Bates and Peter Falkingham {{suggested that the}} bite force of Tyrannosaurus {{could have been the}} strongest of any <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> that has ever lived.

Meers of the University of Tampa in 2003. In his study, Meers estimated a possible bite force of around 183,000 to 235,000 Newtons or [...] Research done by Greg Erikson and Paul Gignac et al and published in the journal Scientific Reports indicates that Tyrannosaurus could bite down with around 8,000 pounds of force when feeding, exerting a pressure of 431,000 pounds per square inch with their teeth. This allowed Tyrannosaurus to drive open cracks present in bone during repetitive, mammal-like biting and produce high-pressure fracture arcades, leading to a catastrophic explosion of some bones and allowing the theropod to fully exploit carcasses of other dinosaurs, giving it access to the mineral salts and marrow within bone that other carnivores in the same environment could not access. Research done by Stephan Lautenschlager et al. of the University of Bristol, also reveals Tyrannosaurus was also capable of a maximum jaw gape of around 63.5 degrees, a necessary adaptation {{for a wide range of}} jaw angles in order to power the creature's strong bite.|$|E

2500|$|American {{crocodiles}} are apex predators, and any aquatic or <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> {{they encounter}} in freshwater, riparian and coastal saltwater habitats is potential prey. Their only threat is the American alligator, which are seen killing and eating American crocodiles. For a long time, primary prey throughout their lifetime {{was thought to}} be fish; due to the relatively narrow snout as indicative of this piscivorous preference. However new studies shed light into the dietary preference of this species. The snout of the American crocodile is broader than some specialized fish-eating crocodilians (i.e. gharials (Gavialis gangeticus), freshwater crocodile (C. johnsoni), etc.), allowing it to supplement its diet with a wider variety of prey. In addition the snout gets even broader and bulkier as the animal matures, a sign for a shift in prey items. Prey species have ranged in size from the insects taken by young American crocodiles to full-grown cattle taken by large adults, and can include various birds, mammals, turtles, crabs, snails, frogs, and occasionally carrion. In Haiti, hatchling and juvenile American crocodiles lived primarily off of fiddler crabs (Uca ssp.), making up 33.8% and 62.3% of the diet by weight, respectively. Elsewhere, aquatic insects and their larvae and snails are {{near the top of the}} food list for American crocodiles at this very early age. Immature and subadult American crocodiles, per a study in Mexico, have a more diverse diet that can include insects, fish, frogs, small turtles, birds and small mammals. One specimen of [...] had a catfish, a mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) and a bare-tailed woolly opossum (Caluromys philander) in its stomach. In Florida, bass, tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) and especially mullet, large crabs, snakes, mammals that habit the riparian and coastal regions of the Everglades, such as opossums and raccoons appeared to be the primary prey of subadult and adult American crocodiles. In Haiti, adults appeared to live largely off of various birds (many of which are breeding large waders and other water birds such as heron, storks, flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber), pelicans (Pelecanus ssp.), grebes, coots (Fulica americana) and moorhens (Gallinula chloropus)), followed by concentrations of marine fish including Tilapia and Cichlasoma, at times being seen to capture turtles, dogs and goats. One [...] adult from Honduras had stomach contents consisting of a [...] crocodile of its own species, a turtle shell and peccary hooves. It was noted that historically in Mexico that, among several local farmers, the capturing of livestock by American crocodiles has been a source of some conflict between humans and American crocodiles and large adults occasionally can become habitual predators of goats, dogs, pigs and cattle. In Quintana Roo, Mexico, most prey that could be determined was fish for sub-adults and adults with sub-adults having a broader prey base than either younger or adult crocodiles. In Costa Rica, American crocodiles have been recorded hunting and killing adult female olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) when they come to nest around beaches. Reportedly, these American crocodiles hunt primarily in the first few hours after nightfall, especially on moonless nights, although they will feed at any time. It hunts in the typical way for most crocodilian, ambushing terrestrial prey when it comes to edge of the water or is sitting in shallows and dragging it down to be drowned or attempting to ambush aquatic prey from near the surface of the water.|$|E
