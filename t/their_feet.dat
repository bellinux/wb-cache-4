40|$|Abstract—Persons with a nontraumatic lower-limb amputa-tion are at {{high risk}} of losing their {{contralateral}} limb in the years postamputation. In this study, veterans with a unilateral lower-limb amputation participated in a survey about health beliefs and health practices known to affect risk of amputation (foot care and smoking). Most participants reported good foot-care practices (93 % checked the top of <b>their</b> <b>foot,</b> 73 % checked the bottom of <b>their</b> <b>foot,</b> 75 % checked between their toes, and 72 % washed <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> daily); however, a small percentage engaged in important foot-care practices less than once a week (2 % checked the top of <b>their</b> <b>foot,</b> 7 % checked the bottom of <b>their</b> <b>foot,</b> and 7 % checked between their toes less than once a week). In addition, nearly a third still smoked. The belief in one’s ability to engage in good foot care and the belief that good foot care reduces the risk of future foot problems wer...|$|R

50|$|Brontotheres retain four toes on <b>their</b> front <b>feet</b> {{and three}} toes on <b>their</b> hind <b>feet.</b> <b>Their</b> teeth are adapted to {{shearing}} (cutting) relatively nonabrasive vegetation. Their molars have a characteristic W-shaped ectoloph (outer shearing blade).|$|R
5|$|<b>Their</b> <b>feet</b> {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> Their fingers and toes are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside down from <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way}} that allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E

50|$|The user applies a {{standing}} wrist lock on their opponent, then places <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> on the opponent's face and falls backwards, forcing the opponent's face into <b>their</b> <b>foot.</b> This move {{is used as}} a finishing move by Gail Kim of TNA (called Eat Defeat), Chuck Taylor (called Sole Food) and Xavier Woods of WWE (called Lost In The Woods). Colt Cabana also uses it (called Eat The Feet) as his signature move.|$|R

50|$|This stunt {{starts out}} {{similar to the}} wallflip in {{the effect that the}} {{performer}} runs up to a vertical surface and places <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> on this surface. It differs, however, because after one places <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> on the vertical surface they must twist their upper body to do a half rotation while also pushing off to do the flip. This will result in the user landing facing away from the wall instead of towards the wall.|$|R

50|$|Similar to a backflip kick, {{this attack}} sees the wrestler either start by lying down or drops {{down on the}} mat while the {{opponent}} standing near their head.

Can {{be used as a}} counter to an attack from behind.
