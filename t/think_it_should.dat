Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{responded to}} a {{question}} during a 2006 interview concerning the Federal Marriage Amendment by calling for elected leaders not to politicize same-sex marriage, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> {{be used as a}} campaign tool, obviously. It requires a lot of sensitivity to just talk about the issue... a lot of sensitivity." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2008 Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, {{co-founder of}} the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain, {{publicly}} opposed {{the construction of the}} mosque, stating that [...] "We have too many mosques. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not be built. What we need first is more integration between the existing mosques and the wider community." [...] Siddiqui's opposition joins that of Craig, together with that of Irfan Al-Alawi, the director of the Center for Islamic Pluralism Europe, who expressed extreme concern about the spread of Tablighi Jamaat. Both Siddiqui and Al-Alawi have different and opposed Islamic viewpoints to that of the Tablighi.|$|E

500|$|The book {{received}} a hostile reception in some quarters, with critics charging {{that it was}} poorly researched and/or allowed others to exploit it for antisemitic purposes. The German historian Hans Mommsen disparaged the first edition as [...] "a most trivial book, which appeals to easily aroused anti-Semitic prejudices". Israeli Holocaust historian Israel Gutman called the book [...] "a lampoon", stating [...] "this is not research; it isn't even political literature... I don't even <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be reviewed or critiqued as a legitimate book." [...] The book was also harshly criticized by Brown University Professor Omer Bartov and University of Chicago Professor Peter Novick.|$|E
500|$|The family {{called it}} [...] "Nellie's little book" [...] and, {{when the book}} was {{published}} with twenty-six colour pictures, the dedication remained the same. 25,000 copies of The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse were released in July 1910 and available in a [...] small book format in either blue-grey or buff paper boards at 1/- or decorated cloth at 1/6. 10,000 copies were released in November 1910 and another 5,000 copies in November 1911. Potter {{was pleased with the}} bound copies she received. [...] "The buff is the prettiest colour, though it may not keep so clean", she wrote to Warnes, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> prove popular with little girls." [...] Her father wrote to the Warne children that his daughter's sense of humour was ever-fresh and never dull.|$|E
500|$|The {{model for}} the {{preliminary}} illustrations of Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was Potter's own pet hedgehog. [...] Potter wrote to Warne on 12 November, [...] "Mrs. Tiggy as a model is comical; so long as she can go to sleep on my knee she is delighted, but if she is propped up on end for half an hour, she first begins to yawn pathetically, and then she does bite! Nevertheless, she is a dear person; just like a very fat rather stupid little dog. I think the book will go all right when once started." [...] Three weeks later, she wrote, [...] "The hedgehog drawings are turning out very comical. I have dressed up a cottonwool dummy for convenience of drawing the clothes. It is such a figure of fun." [...] The dummy terrified her rabbit and her pet mouse pulled out the stuffing. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> make a good book," [...] she wrote, [...] "When I have learnt to draw the child." ...|$|E

500|$|Lord of Scoundrels is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} Regency romance novel, though its story {{is set in the}} post-Regency era of 1828. It features a strong female heroine, a characteristic that Chase has become known for including in her romances. The author explains that [...] "for most of history, and in too many cases today, women are considered (and too often consider themselves) lesser beings who do not matter. In my books, the women are not lesser, and they do matter. In other words, I make the world the way I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be". Romantic fiction scholars have identified Jessica Trent as a [...] "feminist heroine" [...] with whom the [...] "alpha male hero" [...] has met his match. Chase inverts many qualities typical of the archetypical romantic hero and heroine. Near the end of the story, Jessica is the one who initiates consummation of their marriage, by seducing Dain. Afterwards, Jessica promptly falls asleep, causing her husband to seethe [...] "that was what he was supposed to do".|$|E
500|$|After {{learning}} she {{had been}} cast, Reed hired a personal trainer and practiced a healthier diet to prepare herself for her revealing costumes in which she exposes her midriff as the character. In the musical, Jasmine resembles an even stronger, more spirited character than the film version, specifically {{the way in which}} she fights against marriage laws and men who wish to control her. Reed believes her character changed the most during workshops as the show traveled from Seattle to Toronto, and finally Broadway, including the replacement of an original musical number with [...] "These Palace Walls", which composer Alan Menken wrote specifically for Reed. Described by Reed as [...] "a really beautiful song" [...] that [...] "sets up her character", [...] "These Palace Walls" [...] narrates Jasmine's desire to explore the world beyond the confines of the palace, despite being grateful for everything her father has already provided her with. Reed originally found performing [...] "A Whole New World" [...] particularly daunting because, as the film's most famous song, [...] "everyone has these very specific ideas of what they <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> look like or sound like", in addition to feeling pressured to match Salonga's performance, of whom she is a fan.|$|E
500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E
500|$|Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "It's not an {{especially}} scary movie, but right from the start, you can tell that this Beauty and the Beast has a beauty of a bite." [...] John Hartl of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "It's exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they're mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects, yet the Disney animators, with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast, have pulled it off." [...] Gene Siskel, also of the Chicago Tribune, gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Beauty and the Beast is one of the year`s most entertaining films for both adults and children." [...] On their Beauty and the Beast edition of Siskel & Ebert, both Siskel and Roger Ebert proclaimed that the film is [...] "a legitimate contender for Oscar consideration as Best Picture of the Year." [...] Michael Sragow of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's got storytelling vigor and clarity, bright, eclectic animation, and a frisky musical wit." [...] Eric Smoodin writes in his book Animating Culture that the studio was trying to make up for earlier gender stereotypes with this film. Smoodin also states that, in the way it has been viewed as bringing together traditional fairy tales and feminism as well as computer and traditional animation, the film's [...] "greatness could be proved in terms of technology narrative or even politics". Animation legend Chuck Jones praised the film, in a 1992 guest appearance on Later with Bob Costas he claimed he [...] "Loved it. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have won ... I think the animation on the beast {{is one of the greatest}} pieces of animation I've seen." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 29, 1998, Mrs. King {{and her son}} Dexter {{met with}} Justice Department officials.

[...] "There are a lot of schools that offer it as a choice to students, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be a part of regular American history".|$|E
2500|$|However, on Sky News, The Sun Political Editor Tom Newton Dunn defended this decision, saying [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> all {{be about}} The Sun – {{it was not}} us who {{committed}} Hillsborough." [...] Trevor Kavanagh, the political editor {{at the time of}} the Hillsborough disaster, said that he was [...] "not sorry at all" [...] about the reporting and supported his former boss Kelvin MacKenzie, claiming that [...] "we were clearly misled about the events and the authorities, including the police, actively concealed the truth".|$|E
2500|$|Michael was keen {{to create}} music {{targeted}} {{at a more}} sophisticated adult market rather than the duo's primarily teenage audience and therefore, Michael and Ridgeley officially announced the breakup of Wham! {{in the spring of}} 1986. Before going their separate ways, a farewell single [...] "The Edge of Heaven", and a greatest hits album titled The Final would be forthcoming, along with a farewell concert entitled The Final. Announcing the breakup, Michael said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be the most amicable split in pop history." ...|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, [...] "Forster's {{novel is}} one of the {{literary}} landmarks of this century, and now David Lean has made it into one of the greatest screen adaptations I have ever seen [...] [...] [...] He is a meticulous craftsman, famous for going to any length to make every shot look just the way he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>should.</b> His actors here are encouraged to give sound, thoughtful, unflashy performances [...] [...] [...] and his screenplay is a model of clarity." ...|$|R

2500|$|Sprague also {{predicted}} that the lake would [...] "be visited by thousands hereafter." [...] Finally, he recommended that the lake not be named after its discoverer, saying: [...] "I do not know who first saw this lake, nor do I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be named after the discoverer." [...] Sprague suggested it be called [...] "Lake Majestic." [...] Today, it is known as Crater Lake.

2500|$|Although {{initially}} {{a supporter}} of Thatcherism, Hitchens has criticised the Conservative Party for its free-market economic policies, calling it a [...] "wild form of liberalism", rather than conservatism. He once clashed with Iain Duncan Smith on Question Time over the privatisation of railways. On this issue, Hitchens has written [...] "I have always believed that the electric power grid should be nationalised. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be renationalised {{as a prelude to}} an enormous programme of nuclear power station building, without which we face an appalling energy crisis within 20 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 December 2008, Angel Villar restated [...] "We need {{to present}} a strong, {{consistent}} and winning bid for the 2018 World Cup."

[...] Subsequently, {{in the aftermath of}} a RFEF meeting board, Spain and Portugal announced their intention to bid together. Spanish sports newspaper Marca advanced some details about the potential bid: Spain would lead a twelve-stadium project with eight of the venues, and the opening and final games would be held in Lisbon and Madrid, respectively.

50|$|The {{occurrence}} of a GPWS alert typically happens {{at a time}} of high workload and nearly always surprises the flight crew. Almost certainly, the aircraft is not where the pilot <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be, and the response to a GPWS warning can be late in these circumstances. Warning time can also be short if the aircraft is flying into steep terrain since the downward looking radio altimeter is the primary sensor used for the warning calculation. The EGPWS improves terrain awareness and warning times by introducing the Terrain Display and the Terrain Data Base Look Ahead protection.|$|R
