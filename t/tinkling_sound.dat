National varieties of English show creativity. American English uses [...] "to whiz". Australian English has coined [...] "I am off to take a Chinese singing lesson", derived from the <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound</b> of urination against the China porcelain of a toilet bowl. British English uses [...] "going to see my aunt", [...] "going {{to see a man}} about a dog", [...] "to piddle", [...] "to splash (one's) boots", as well as [...] "to have a slash", which originates from the Scottish term for a large splash of liquid. One of the most common, albeit old-fashioned, euphemisms in British English is [...] "to spend a penny", a reference to coin-operated pay toilets, which used (pre-decimalisation) to charge that sum.|$|E
60|$|Instantly every Clown stood {{upon his}} head and knocked his heels {{together}} in the air. As they wore silver bells around their ankles, this made a most delightful, <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound,</b> {{and the sight of}} so many topsy-turvy Clowns was so pretty that Dot and Tot both laughed and clapped their hands.|$|E
60|$|Puzzled and disconcerted, I {{was sitting}} {{by the side of}} my couch {{wondering}} whether the whole thing were a delusion, brought on by the nervous excitement of our skirmish, when a new marvel overtook me. From over my head there suddenly sounded a sharp, <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound,</b> like that produced by an empty glass when flipped by the nail, only louder and more intense.|$|E
50|$|The finale, in C-sharp major, {{contains}} an innocent cheerfulness. There is a slowing of pace {{and the return}} of the warm wind theme from the first movement, and the symphony ends with the same <b>tinkling</b> <b>sounds</b> from the tuned percussion as the first movement.|$|R
60|$|There was a bell {{beside the}} gate, and Dorothy {{pushed the button}} and heard a silvery <b>tinkle</b> <b>sound</b> within. Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they all passed through and found {{themselves}} in a high arched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tinkling</b> <b>sounds</b> on {{the second}} verse are a {{selection}} of mugs and glasses from Raezor's cupboards, filled with varying amounts of water and hit with drumsticks by Jamie after Jon suggested it would be funny if they had them glasses with water in them on the song. They are actually in tune.|$|R
60|$|Gradually the Thing sank {{lower and}} nearer {{to the ground}} until at length it came to rest within the {{beautiful}} gardens of Glinda, settling upon a velvety green lawn close by a fountain which sent sprays of flashing gems, instead of water, high into the air, whence they fell with a soft, <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound</b> into the carved marble basin placed to receive them.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} he fell back upon his pillow {{as if he}} had been shot, while the same look of horror came over his face which I had {{observed}} when I first entered the room. At the same instant there came, apparently from the air immediately above his bed, a sharp, ringing, <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound,</b> which I can only compare with the noise made by a bicycle alarm, though it differed from this in having a distinctly throbbing character. I have never, before or since, heard any sound which could be confounded with it.|$|E
60|$|So {{they set}} off toward the east, moving as swiftly as they could, {{and for a long}} time they could hear the yells and struggles of the imprisoned Giantess. The Green Monkey could run over the ground very swiftly, and he carried with him the bird-cage {{containing}} Polychrome the Rain-bow's Daughter. Also the Tin Owl could skip and fly along at a good rate of speed, his feathers rattling against one another with a <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound</b> as he moved. But the little Brown Bear, being stuffed with straw, was a clumsy traveler and the others had to wait for him to follow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Louisa, dear," [...] had set her {{biscuits}} {{down with}} a sharp thud, reckless of results. A sharp, metallic <b>tinkle</b> <b>sounded</b> at the closet where Sara had struck {{the edge of her}} tray against a shelf. The sound seemed to loosen the paralyzed tongues, and everybody began talking and exclaiming at once. Clear and shrill above the confusion rose Mrs. George Pye's voice.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} about it. He {{staggered}} to the door and, holding by the side, looked on to the deck. The steamer was rolling in a fresh sea and a sweet strong wind blew refreshingly into his face. Funnels, bridge, and masts swung with a rhythmical motion; loose gear rattled, {{and every now and}} then a distant <b>tinkle</b> <b>sounded</b> faintly from the steward's pantry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'T is {{thus the}} spirit of a single mind [...] Makes that of multitudes take one direction, [...] As roll the waters to the {{breathing}} wind, [...] Or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection; [...] Or as a little dog will lead the blind, [...] Or a bell-wether form the flock's connection [...] By <b>tinkling</b> <b>sounds,</b> when they go forth to victual; [...] Such is the sway of your great men o'er little.|$|R
60|$|During {{all this}} period of bloodshed and alarms, the missionary stuck to his post. The obstinacy of hatred was being {{gradually}} overcome by the superior pertinacity of zeal in a good cause, and the invariable practice--so incomprehensible to the savage mind--of returning good for evil; the result was, that the Sabbath bell still sent its <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound</b> over the verdant slopes above Sandy Cove, and the hymn of praise still arose, morning and evening, from the little church, which, composed partly of wood, partly of coral rock, had been erected under the eye, and, to a large extent, by {{the hands of the}} missionary.|$|E
60|$|Without {{answering}} him, {{and already}} anticipating {{the nature of}} the clothes he bade me don, I lifted one of the garments from the heap. It was a foliated jester's cap, with a bell hanging from every point, which gave out a <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound</b> as I picked it up. I let it fall again as though it had scorched me, the memory of what stood between Madonna Paola and me rising like a warning spectre in my mind. I would not again defile myself by the garb of folly; not again would I incur the shame of playing the Fool for the amusement of others.|$|E
60|$|From the {{workshop}} of the Golden Key, there issued forth a <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound,</b> so merry and good-humoured, that it suggested {{the idea of}} some one working blithely, and made quite pleasant music. No man who hammered on at a dull monotonous duty, could have brought such cheerful notes from steel and iron; none but a chirping, healthy, honest-hearted fellow, who made the best of everything, and felt kindly towards everybody, {{could have done it}} for an instant. He might have been a coppersmith, and still been musical. If he had sat in a jolting waggon, full of rods of iron, it seemed as if he would have brought some harmony out of it.|$|E
50|$|The chimta {{consists}} of a long, flat piece of steel or iron that is pointed at both ends, and folded over in the middle. A metal ring is attached near the fold, and there are jingles or rings attached along the sides at regular intervals. Sometimes there are seven pairs of jingles. The rings are plucked in a downward motion to produce <b>tinkling</b> <b>sounds.</b> Chimtas with large rings are used at rural festivals while ones with smaller rings are often used as an accompaniment to Bhangra dancers and singers of traditional Indian hymns.|$|R
5000|$|David Mora-Marin {{asserts that}} wearing these belts {{were based on}} [...] "symbolic (ideology and ritual) and {{objective}} (staple and wealth) sources of power." [...] The ancient Maya stimulated all senses of the human body, the natural world and the invisible world. The sounds of the plaques hitting together {{would have made a}} <b>tinkling</b> <b>sounds,</b> which would have been especially noticeable during dance rituals. Maya rulers were seen as divine through ancestry and closest to the gods, therefore, wearing these belts during rituals and death was a way of communicating and celebrating the gods and their ancestors.|$|R
50|$|Iallanis {{will accept}} any good-aligned true giant into her priesthood, {{treating}} every race as {{equal to the}} others. She would treat giant-kin such as firbolgs, fomorians, verbeegs, and voadkyn as equals as well, but this was forbidden by her father; thus, they are limited to places of lower status in her clerical hierarchy. Her clerics strive to bring the whole of giantkind into the ways of good, to show mercy to all, and to cooperate with other good creatures. Her clerics and shamans are expected to become happily married {{if they are to}} attain high rank. She sends omens to her priests in the form of floral scents, <b>tinkling</b> <b>sounds,</b> and similar gentle, pleasant events.|$|R
60|$|Rosina {{had emerged}} from the arbor, and was bending over him with the shadow of his anguish {{reflected}} in her countenance, yet so mingled with hope and unselfish love that all anguish seemed but an earthly shadow and a dream. She touched Roderick with her hand. A tremor shivered through his frame. At that moment, if report be trustworthy, the sculptor beheld a waving motion through the grass, and heard a <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound,</b> as if something had plunged into the fountain. Be the truth as it might, {{it is certain that}} Roderick Elliston sat up like a man renewed, restored to his right mind, and rescued from the fiend which had so miserably overcome him in the battle-field of his own breast.|$|E
60|$|The {{lower half}} of the garden, {{farthest}} from the road, was the most snug and sheltered part of this snug and sheltered enclosure, and it was well watered as the land of Lot. Three small brooks, about a yard wide, ran with a <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound</b> from side to side between the plots, crossing the path under wood slabs laid as bridges, and passing out of the garden through little tunnels in the hedge. The brooks were so far overhung at their brinks by grass and garden produce that, {{had it not been for}} their perpetual babbling, few would have noticed that they were there. This was where Anne liked best to linger when her excursions became restricted to her own premises; and in a spot of the garden not far removed the trumpet-major loved to linger also.|$|E
6000|$|The {{view from}} the top is very {{extensive}} to the northward, but not elsewhere: it commands the Assam valley and the Himalaya, and the billowy range of undulating grassy Khasia mountains. Few houses were visible, but the curling smoke from the valleys betrayed their lurking-places, whilst the <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound</b> of the hammers from the distant forges on all sides was singularly musical and pleasing; they fell on the ear like [...] "bells upon the wind," [...] each ring being exquisitely melodious, and chiming harmoniously with the others. The solitude and beauty of the scenery, and the emotions excited by the music of chimes, tended to tranquillise our minds, wearied by the fatigues of travel, and the excitement of pursuits that required unremitting attention; and we rested for some time, our imaginations wandering to far-distant scenes, brought vividly to our minds by these familiar sounds.|$|E

5000|$|A tintinnabulum {{was hung}} {{outdoors}} in locations such as gardens, porticoes, houses, and shops, {{where the wind}} would cause them to <b>tinkle.</b> The <b>sounds</b> of bells were believed to keep away evil spirits; compare the apotropaic role of the bell in the [...] "bell, book, and candle" [...] ritual of the earlier Catholic Church.|$|R

60|$|At a {{cool and}} early hour on a {{pleasant}} morning in July, my companion and I passed rapidly through Acton and Stow, stopping {{to rest and}} refresh us {{on the bank of}} a small stream, a tributary of the Assabet, in the latter town. As we traversed the cool woods of Acton, with stout staves in our hands, we were cheered by the song of the red-eye, the thrushes, the phoebe, and the cuckoo; and as we passed through the open country, we inhaled the fresh scent of every field, and all nature lay passive, to be viewed and travelled. Every rail, every farm-house, seen dimly in the twilight, every <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound</b> told of peace and purity, and we moved happily along the dank roads, enjoying not such privacy as the day leaves when it withdraws, but such as it has not profaned. It was solitude with light; which is better than darkness. But anon, the sound of the mower's rifle was heard in the fields, and this, too, mingled with the lowing kine.|$|E
6000|$|Soon the sleigh {{appeared}} in sight, {{coming up the}} river at full speed, and a loud [...] "hurrah!" [...] from {{the men at the}} gate, told the visitor that he was a welcome guest. It was a dog-sleigh--a sort of conveyance much used by the fur-traders in winter travelling. In form, it was as like as possible to a tin slipper bath. It might also be compared to a shoe. If the reader will try to conceive of a shoe large enough to hold a man, sitting with his legs out before him, that will give him a good idea of the shape of a dog cariole. There is sometimes an ornamental curve in front. It is made of two thin hardwood planks curled up in front, with a light frame-work of wood, covered over with deer or buffalo skin, and painted in a very gay manner. Four dogs are usually harnessed to it, and these are quite sufficient to drag a man on a journey of many days, over every sort of country, where there is no road whatever. Dogs are much used for hauling little sledges in that country in winter. The traveller sits wrapped up so completely in furs, that nothing but his head is visible. He is attended by a driver on snow-shoes, who is armed with a large whip. No reins are used. If the snow is hard, as is usually the case on the surface of a lake or river, the driver walks behind and holds on to a tail-line, to prevent the dogs from running away. If the traveller's way lies through the woods, the snow is so soft and deep that the poor dogs are neither willing nor able to run away. It is {{as much as they can}} do to walk; so the driver goes before them, in this case, and beats down the snow with his snow-shoes--"beats the track," [...] as it is called. The harness of the dogs is usually very gay, and covered with little bells which give forth a cheerful <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
50|$|Made out of {{stained glass}} and built to harmoize with a structure's decor {{so that their}} {{presence}} is not obvious, these are flat, two-dimensional replicas of living beings. When they move, they produce a <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound</b> like that made by delicate crystal.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the centre}} of the court, under the blue Italian sky, and with the hundred windows of the vast palace gazing down upon it from four sides, appears a fountain. It brims over from one stone basin to another, or gushes from a Naiad's urn, or spurts its many little jets from the mouths of nameless monsters, which were merely {{grotesque}} and artificial when Bernini, or whoever was their unnatural father, first produced them; but now the patches of moss, the tufts of grass, the trailing maiden-hair, and all sorts of verdant weeds that thrive in the cracks and crevices of moist marble, tell us that Nature takes the fountain back into her great heart, and cherishes it as kindly {{as if it were a}} woodland spring. And hark, the pleasant murmur, the gurgle, the plash! You might hear just those <b>tinkling</b> <b>sounds</b> from any tiny waterfall in the forest, though here they gain a delicious pathos from the stately echoes that reverberate their natural language. So the fountain is not altogether glad, after all its three centuries at play! ...|$|R
5000|$|Mark {{trees are}} often mistakenly called wind chimes, {{but they are}} {{different}} instruments, though with a basic similar structure consisting of tubes of differing lengths that are meant to produce a <b>tinkling</b> or chiming <b>sound.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Zimbelstern (Meaning [...] "Cymbal Star" [...] in German, also spelled Cymbelstern, Zymbelstern, or Cimbalstern) is a [...] "toy" [...] {{organ stop}} {{consisting}} of a metal or wooden star or wheel on which several small bells are mounted. When engaged, the star rotates, producing a continuous <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound.</b> It was common in northern Europe, Germany in particular, throughout the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. After about 1700, the bells were tuned to particular notes.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} {{to watch out for}} signs of dehydration, such as orthostatic hypotension and loss of skin turgor. Auscultation of the abdomen can produce several clues to the cause of nausea and vomiting. A high-pitched <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound</b> indicates possible bowel obstruction, while a splashing [...] "succussion" [...] sound is more indicative of gastric outlet obstruction. Eliciting pain on the abdominal exam when pressing on the patient may indicate an inflammatory process. Signs such as papilledema, visual field losses, or focal neurological deficits are red flag signs for elevated intracranial pressure.|$|E
50|$|It {{is more of}} a sport than a {{dance for}} young girls. Two girls stands face to face close to each other and hold their hands {{crossing}} arms with their bodies inclined back; in this position their arms are stretched to the maximum and hands interlock firmly. Then they wheel round fast continuously with their dupattas floating in the air and anklets making <b>tinkling</b> <b>sound.</b> The other ladies encourages them to go faster and faster by singing songs with clapping. Sometimes it is done by four girls. The folk song related to the dance has much variety.|$|E
50|$|Fans {{used in the}} Maronite, Oriental (e.g., Coptic, Armenian, Ethiopian), and Assyrian {{traditions are}} distinctive, having little hoops of metal or bells all around the {{circumference}} of the disks. At particularly solemn points of the liturgy, these are shaken gently to produce a <b>tinkling</b> and jingling <b>sound,</b> akin {{to the sound of}} multiple altar bells.|$|R
60|$|As I {{was leaving}} the Irishman's roof after the rain, bending my steps again to the pond, my haste to catch pickerel, wading in retired meadows, in sloughs and bog-holes, in forlorn and savage places, {{appeared}} for an instant trivial to me who {{had been sent to}} school and college; but as I ran down the hill toward the reddening west, with the rainbow over my shoulder, and some faint <b>tinkling</b> <b>sounds</b> borne to my ear through the cleansed air, from I know not what quarter, my Good Genius seemed to say--Go fish and hunt far and wide day by day--farther and wider--and rest thee by many brooks and hearth-sides without misgiving. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth. Rise free from care before the dawn, and seek adventures. Let the noon find thee by other lakes, and the night overtake thee everywhere at home. There are no larger fields than these, no worthier games than may here be played. Grow wild according to thy nature, like these sedges and brakes, which will never become English bay. Let the thunder rumble; what if it threaten ruin to farmers' crops? That is not its errand to thee. Take shelter under the cloud, while they flee to carts and sheds. Let not to get a living be thy trade, but thy sport. Enjoy the land, but own it not. Through want of enterprise and faith men are where they are, buying and selling, and spending their lives like serfs.|$|R
5000|$|In the book, Tinker Bell {{has her own}} [...] "fairy {{language}}", which humans {{only hear}} like the sounds of ringing bells (Disney's Tinker Bell Movies). Likewise, she doesn't speak in most other versions, but makes <b>tinkling</b> or other <b>sounds,</b> which Peter can understands (Disney's Peter Pan, Peter Pan (2003), Peter Pan Burbank or Peter Pan Live!). In this version and some others, she can speak the human language (The Adventures of Peter Pan, Hook or The New Adventures of Peter Pan).|$|R
