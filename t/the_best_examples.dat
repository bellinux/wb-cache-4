5|$|Georgian {{architecture}} {{followed in}} a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the Royal Crescent at Bath is one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of this. With the emergence of romanticism during Victorian period, a Gothic Revival was launched—in addition to this {{around the same time}} the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as The Crystal Palace. Since the 1930s various modernist forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centuries}} {{following}} Rome's excursions into Scottish territory Orkney was, {{at least for}} a time, part of the Pictish kingdom. Very {{little is known about the}} Pictish Orcadians, the main archaeological relics being symbol stones. One of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> is located on the Brough of Birsay; it shows 3 warriors with spears and sword scabbards combined with traditional Pictish symbols. This small tidal island has a long history of settlement that continued into the Norse period.|$|E
5|$|Khajuraho {{was once}} {{the capital of the}} Chandela dynasty. The Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of temples {{preserved}} from the medieval period in India, is the largest of the western group of temples in the Khajuraho complex which was built by the Chandela rulers. Shiva is the chief deity in the temple deified in the sanctum sanctorium.|$|E

5|$|These two styles do not exhaust all of {{the musical}} {{influences}} found in the British metal music of the early 1980s, because many bands were also inspired by progressive rock (Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, Demon, Saracen, Shiva, Witchfynde), boogie rock (Saxon, Vardis, Spider, Le Griffe) and glam rock (Girl, Wrathchild). Doom metal bands Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General were {{also part of the}} NWOBHM and their albums are considered among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of that already established subgenre.|$|E
5|$|Early Classic ceramic finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de San José {{and those that}} have been found were a minor {{component}} in mixed fill deposits. This suggests that Motul de San José was largely abandoned in the Early Classic. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de San José itself, with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during the construction of a modern language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at Wakutal.|$|E

He acknowledged the difficulty, even on easy, but praised {{the game as}} one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of the niche shooting gallery genre. Mat Allen of Nintendo Life found the game to be {{an excellent example of}} what the Virtual Console is for: providing gamers chances to experience quality games that were overlooked in their time. He highlighted the release as providing a cheap option to play a game which has become an expensive collector's item.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the more}} modern buildings, {{including}} Senate House and the newer parts of the HH Wills Physics Laboratory, were designed by Ralph Brentnall after funds from the University Grants Committee. He is also responsible for the extension to the Wills Memorial Building library which was completed to such standard that few now realise that is an extension to the original building. Brentnall oversaw the rebuilding of the Great Hall of the Wills Memorial Building after it was partly destroyed during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. The buildings of St Michael's Hill were rebuilt using hundreds of old photographs to recreate the original houses. The flats at Goldney Hall were designed by Michael Grice and received an award from the Civic Trust for their design. Bristol University owns some of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of Georgian architecture in the city, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> being Royal Fort House, Clifton Hill House and Goldney Hall despite some additions. The Victoria Rooms which house the Music Department were designed by Charles Dyer and {{is seen as a}} good example of a Greek revival movement in British architecture. The tympanum of the building depicts a scene from The Advent of Morning designed by Jabez Tyley. Its major feature was a large organ which has since been destroyed by fire.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a part of}} the Chola kingdom, Tiruchirappalli has {{a number}} of exquisitely sculpted temples and fortresses. Most of the temples, {{including}} the Rockfort temples, the Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam, the Jambukeswarar Temple at Thiruvanaikkaval, the Samayapuram Mariamman Temple, the Erumbeeswarar Temple, Ukrakaliamman temple in Tennur and the temples in Urayur, are built in the Dravidian style of architecture; the Ranganathaswamy Temple and Jambukeswarar Temple are often counted among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of this style. The rock-cut cave temples of the Rockfort, along with the gateway and the Erumbeeswarar Temple, are listed as monuments of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent erosion lasting 300million years {{stripped}} much of {{the exposed}} sediments and the mountains away. This reduced the very high mountains to small hills a few tens to hundreds of feet (tens of meters) high. Geologist John Wesley Powell called this major gap in the geologic record, which is also seen {{in other parts of}} the world, the Great Unconformity. Other sediments may have been added but, if they ever existed, were completely removed by erosion. Such gaps in the geologic record are called unconformities by geologists. The Great Unconformity is one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of an exposed nonconformity, which is a type of unconformity that has bedded rock units above igneous or metamorphic rocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{occupation}} and activity in the Motul de San José area is not well understood for the Postclassic Period. It is known {{that there was a}} moderate occupation of the area during the Early Postclassic period, between AD 1000 and AD 1250. Early Postclassic construction and ceramics have been identified at Motul de San José and all of its satellite sites, but construction was small scale and distribution of pottery was limited. La Trinidad de Nosotros was apparently a small village at this time and has produced some of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of Early Postclassic ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Though the Maya Sita motif {{was found}} {{earlier in the}} Kurma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) where Sita's purity is safeguarded, it is the Adhyatma Ramayana (a part of the Brahmanda Purana, c. 14th century), where Maya Sita plays a much greater role in the plot. The concept of maya (illusion) is an {{integral}} part of the narrative; <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> being Maya Sita and Maya mriga (illusory deer). Though Adhyatma Ramayana originated in Varanasi in North India, it influenced Malayam (South India) and Oriya (East India) renditions of the Ramayana, but most importantly influenced the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas (c.1532–1623).|$|E

5|$|At Kelmscott Press the {{perfection}} of book-making was under his constant supervision and practical assistance. It was his ambition to produce a perfect work to restore all the beauty of illuminated lettering, richness of gilding and grace of binding that {{used to make a}} volume the treasure of a king. His efforts were constantly directed towards giving the world at least one book that exceeded anything that had ever appeared. Morris designed his type after <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of early printers, what he called his “golden type” which he copied after Jenson, Parautz, Coburger and others. With this in mind, Morris took equal care on the choice of his paper which he adapted to his subject with the same care that governed his selection of material for binding. As a result, few but only the wealthy could purchase his lavish works, mainly due to how intrinsic his work was. However, he realized that creating works in the manner of the middle ages was difficult in a profit-grinding society.|$|E
5|$|Built for the {{protection}} of a small stupa, the structure has two stone platforms decorated with elaborate stone carvings. The lower platform is entered through a single entrance facing the north, while the second platform can be accessed through four doorways facing the four cardinal points. The upper platform, surrounded by a brick wall, contains the stupa. Four Buddha statues are seated around it, each facing one of the entrances. Three concentric rows of stone columns had also been positioned here, presumably to support a wooden roof. The entire structure is decorated with stone carvings. Some of the carvings at the Polonnaruwa Vatadage, such as its sandakada pahanas, are considered to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of such architectural features. Although some archaeologists have suggested that it also had a wooden roof, this theory is disputed by others.|$|E
5|$|Casa Álvarez-Buiza, {{a private}} house and {{commercial}} complex, {{was built in}} the San Juan district by Adel Franco Pinna between 1918–2. The building located on the Plaza de La Soledad once housed the offices of the Bank of Spain. Artistic elements include the use of lime, brick and colorful ceramics with an Andalusian influence. Casa del Cordón is a private house, built in the late Gothic style of the early 16th century, and has mullioned windows. It currently houses the Archdiocese. Casa Puebla, built in 1921, is one of the other designs of Pinna, who designed numerous buildings around Badajoz. It is one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>examples</b> of regional architecture in Andalusian style and the property has two facades, the main one featuring neo-Renaissance elements.|$|E
