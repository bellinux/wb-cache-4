5|$|The {{video is}} {{split into two}} {{sections}} and switches between them throughout. The first has band members Homme, Nick Oliveri and Mark Lanegan driving a truck at night, whereupon they hit a deer. When <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> to inspect, the deer proceeds to attack them before going on a rampage in their International Harvester Scout. The second section of the video is of Homme, Oliveri, Troy Van Leeuwen and Dave Grohl performing the song against a black background.|$|E
25|$|A team {{composed}} of good passers and mobile players with good positioning skills may more often {{try to avoid}} clearing, as their skills {{make it easier to}} make shorter passes and thus retaining possession until <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of a difficult situation.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, a player's {{batting average}} {{is the total}} number of runs they have scored divided by the number of times they have been out. Since the number of runs a player scores and how often <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> are {{primarily}} measures of their own playing ability, and largely independent of their teammates, batting average is a good metric for an individual player's skill as a batsman. The number is also simple to interpret intuitively. If all the batsman's innings were completed (i.e. they were out every innings), this is the average number of runs they score per innings. If they did not complete all their innings (i.e. some innings they finished not out), this number is an estimate of the unknown average number of runs they score per innings. Batting average has been used to gauge cricket players' relative skills since the 18th century.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is in this}} manner: First <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> a knife stone (obsidian core) {{which is}} black like jet and 20 cm or {{slightly}} less in length, and they make it cylindrical and as thick as the calf of the leg, and they place the stone between the feet, and with a stick apply force {{to the edges of}} the stone, and at every push they give a little knife springs off with its edges like those of a razor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brigham Young, Smith's {{successor}} in the LDS Church, initially held {{views on}} capital punishment {{similar to those}} of Smith. On January 27, 1845, he spoke approvingly of Smith's toleration of [...] "corrupt men" [...] in Nauvoo who were guilty of murder and robbery, on the chance that they might repent and be baptized. On the other hand, on February 25, 1846, after the Saints had left Nauvoo, Young threatened adherents who had stolen wagon cover strings and rail timber with having their throats cut [...] "when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the settlements where his orders could be executed." [...] Later that year, Young gave orders that [...] "when a man is found to be a thief,...cut his throat & thro' him in the River." [...] Young also stated that decapitation of repeated sinners [...] "is the law of God and it shall be executed." [...] There are no documented instances, however, of such a sentence being carried out on the Mormon Trail.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} [...] "pillars" [...] of the UK pension system, which aim to ensure dignity {{and a fair}} income in retirement. The first pillar is the state pension, {{administered}} by the government, and funded by National Insurance contributions. The third pillar is private, or [...] "personal pensions", which individuals buy themselves. The second pillar, and deriving from the contract of employment, is occupational pensions. Traditionally, these came from a collective agreement, or from an employer setting one up. The Pensions Act 2008 gives every [...] "jobholder" [...] (defined as a worker, age 16 to 75, with wages between £5,035 and £33,540) {{the right to be}} automatically enrolled by the employer in an occupational pension, unless the jobholder chooses to opt out. This is a simple [...] "defined contribution" [...] scheme: whatever the jobholder contributes, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> Although collectively invested, benefits are individualised, meaning the risk of living longer and running out of money grows. To reduce administration costs, a non-departmental trust fund called the National Employment Savings Trust was established as a [...] "public option" [...] competing with private asset managers. Employers set aside an agreed percentage of jobholders' wages, and negotiate how much they will contribute. This is particularly important for people who do not created a union and collective bargained for an occupational pension. Collectively bargained pensions are often better, and historically had [...] "defined benefits": on retirement, people receive money based either on their final salary, or a career average of earnings {{for the rest of their}} lives. Living longer does not become an individual risk, but is collectivised among all contributors. In principle, the rules for pension trusts differ from ordinary law of trusts as pensions are not gifts and people pay for their benefits through their work. Pensions operating through contracts also engender mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship. An employer is under a duty to inform their staff about how to make the best of their pension rights. Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements. The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the pension beneficiaries, so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or [...] "member nominated trustees". The Secretary of State has the power by regulation, as yet unused, to increase the minimum up to one half. Trustees are charged with the duty to manage the fund in the best interests of the beneficiaries, in a way that reflects their preferences, by investing the savings in company shares, bonds, real estate or other financial products.|$|E

50|$|From the circle, {{the first}} player of the first team on bat hits the kimbomba, then, the player leaves the stick inside the square and runs to the third base.

If one opponent catches the kimbomba in the air, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> one <b>out.</b> If the kimbomba hits the ground once, the opposite team can take the kimbomba and throw it to the square inside the base. If the kimbomba hits the other stick, then, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> one <b>out.</b>|$|R
