5|$|With {{the arrival}} of the year 2012, Nostradamus's prophecies started to be co-opted (especially by the History Channel) as {{evidence}} suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world was imminent, notwithstanding the fact that his book never mentions the end of the world, let alone the year 2012.|$|E
5|$|Ewbank {{learned of}} the {{television}} problems {{in the locker room}} when he received a telephone call from his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory – Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result. She was not the only Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father picked him up at Philadelphia International Airport, he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the veneration of icons in March 843, the Byzantine Empire's government, headed by the Empress-regent Theodora and the logothetes Theoktistos, embarked on a sustained assault on the Byzantines' main political and ideological foe, the Abbasid Caliphate and its dependencies. This aggressive stance was on the one hand facilitated by the internal stability <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iconoclasm controversy brought, and on the other encouraged by a desire to vindicate the new policy through military victories against the Muslims.|$|E

5|$|Higham theorises that Gregory {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{world was}} imminent, {{and that he}} was destined to be a major part of God's plan for the apocalypse. His belief was rooted in the idea that the world would go through six ages, {{and that he was}} living {{at the end of the}} sixth age, a notion that may have played a part in Gregory's decision to dispatch the mission. Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work together for the conversion of non-Christians within their territories. He urged the conversion of the heretical Arians in Italy and elsewhere, as well as the conversion of Jews. Also pagans in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica were the subject of letters to officials, urging their conversion.|$|E
5|$|The {{term was}} first used in a {{scientific}} context by Charles Lyell in the third edition (1851) of his book Elements of Geology in relation to missing parts of the geological column, but it was popularized in its present meaning by its appearance on page xi of his book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man of 1863. By {{that time it was}} generally thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last glacial period marked the first appearance of humanity, but Lyell drew on new findings in his Antiquity of Man to put the origin of human beings much further back in the deep geological past. Lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how the huge gulf between man and beast could be bridged. Lyell's vivid writing fired the public imagination, inspiring Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and Louis Figuier's 1867 second edition of La Terre avant le déluge ("Earth before the Flood"), which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women wearing animal skins and wielding stone axes, in place of the Garden of Eden shown in the 1863 edition.|$|E

25|$|In 1925, the Czech esotericist Franz Sättler {{founded a}} pagan {{religion}} known as Adonism, {{devoted to the}} ancient Greek god Adonis, whom Sättler equated with the Christian Satan, and which purported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world would come in the year 2000.

25|$|In 1006-1007, Basil II {{penetrated}} {{deep into}} the Bulgarian-ruled lands and in 1009 Samuel's forces were defeated at Kreta, east of Thessaloniki. During the next years, Basil launched annual campaigns into Bulgarian territory, devastating everything on his way. Although {{there was still no}} decisive battle, it was clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian resistance was drawing nearer; the evidence was the fierceness of the military engagements and the constant campaigns of both sides which devastated the Bulgarian and Byzantine realms.|$|E

25|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{international}} politics, it has been argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War contributed to the break up of Yugoslavia because Yugoslavia lost its strategic international political importance as an intermediary between the Eastern and Western blocs. As a consequence, Yugoslavia lost the economic and political support provided by the West, and increased pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reform its institutions made it impossible for the Yugoslav reformist elite to respond to rising social disorder. The collapse of communism throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union undermined the country's ideological basis and encouraged anti-communist and nationalist forces in the Western-oriented republics of Croatia and Slovenia to increase their demands.|$|E
25|$|After a {{reign of}} 45 years, Amenemhet III was succeeded by Amenemhet IV, whose nine-year reign is poorly attested. Clearly by this time, dynastic power began to weaken, for which several {{explanations}} have been proposed. Contemporary {{records of the}} Nile flood levels indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reign of Amenemhet III was dry, and crop failures may have helped to destabilize the dynasty. Further, Amenemhet III had an inordinately long reign, which tends to create succession problems. The latter argument perhaps explains why Amenemhet IV was succeeded by Sobekneferu, the first historically attested female king of Egypt. Sobekneferu ruled {{no more than four}} years, and as she apparently had no heirs, when she died the Twelfth Dynasty came to a sudden end as did the Golden Age of the Middle Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|McKenna {{suspected}} that notable events in history {{could be identified}} that would help him locate the time wave's end date and attempted to find the best-fit placement when matching the graph to the data field of human history. The last harmonic of the wave has a duration of 67.29 years. Population growth, peak oil, and pollution statistics {{were some of the}} factors that pointed him to an early twenty-first century end date and when looking for an extremely novel event in human history as a signal that the final phase had begun McKenna picked the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. This worked out to the graph reaching zero in mid-November 2012. When he later discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 13th baktun in the Maya calendar had been correlated by Western Maya scholars as December 21, 2012, he adopted their end date instead.|$|E

25|$|Łojek {{notes that}} historiography {{of the fall}} of the Triple Alliance is sparse, as it was overshadowed by the {{interest}} in issues related to the French Revolution; as he notes, a war that never started is much less interesting than the revolution that changed the world. He notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alliance was a triumph of the Russian diplomacy, and failure of the British one, as well as a personal failure of Pitt, who since this defeat removed himself from the British foreign policy. From the Polish perspective, he notes that the failure of the Polish diplomacy to pursue an alliance with the Triple Alliance was another major factor which resulted in its weakening, and by correspondingly strengthening Russia, this Polish inactivity contributed to the fall of Poland. He notes that although some Poles, like Antoni Augustyn Deboli, argued for an alliance with Great Britain, king Stanisław August Poniatowski, who controlled most of Polish diplomacy, refused to stand in opposition to Russia, which in hindsight was a major blow for Poland.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} the group travels to the Burj al Arab tower and call a meeting of nations. The {{surviving}} team members from Seven Ancient Wonders return, {{with the exception of}} Fuzzy from Jamaica. At the meeting, Jack informs them <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world is nigh, due to a zero-point field (the 'Dark Sun') entering our solar system, which could destroy the entire world. However, in order to save the world, the 'Machine' must be rebuilt by placing six oblong diamond pillars in their respective locations around the globe. However, almost nothing is known about the Machine, but the knowledge can be found using the Six Sacred Stones - the Philosopher's Stone, the Altar Stone at Stonehenge, The Twin Tablets of Thutmosis, The Seeing Stone of Delphi, the Killing Stone of the Maya, and the Basin of Ramses II. Then Fuzzy's severed head arrives in a hatbox, and an aeroplane is sighted heading to crash into the tower. Everyone escapes the crash one way or another and the team splits at the airfield.|$|E
25|$|In June 1944, {{after the}} capture of the Japanese fighter base at Myitkyina and {{at the behest of}} Brig. Gen. William H. Tunner, Col. Andrew B. Cannon was {{assigned}} to command the Assam Wing when it was activated the next month. Tunner, slated to become airlift commander following Hardin, anticipated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighter threat would see a massive influx of C-54s into the India-China operation. Like Haynes, Alexander, and Tunner, Cannon had been a pioneer in the Air Transport Command, where as a protege of Tunner's he was base commander of Long Beach Army Air Field, where Tunner made his headquarters as commander of ATC's Ferry Division, and commanding officer of the 6th Ferrying Group. On 1 July, ATC reorganized its nine wings worldwide into air divisions, and sectors into wings. The ICW-ATC became the India China Division ATC (ICD-ATC), while the Eastern Sector, carrying out the India-China airlift, was re-designated the Assam Wing, and the Western Sector support organization became the India Wing. The India China Division also had an operational training unit at Gaya and used the service depots of the China-Burma-India Air Service Command at Panagarh, Agra, and Bangalore.|$|E
