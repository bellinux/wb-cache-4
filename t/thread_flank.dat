5000|$|Knuckle threads {{with a flat}} 30 degree flank {{thread angle}} are {{standardized}} in DIN 405 for inch pitches and diameters ranging from 8mm to 200mm. [...] A more recent standard DIN 20400 uses metric thread pitch and lists diameters from 10mm to 300mm. [...] As DIN is a German organization, many instances of the DIN thread charts write numbers with a comma as the decimal point. For a thread pitch p, the crest and root rounding radius is slightly less than p/4, and approximately the middle third of each <b>thread</b> <b>flank</b> is flat.|$|E
5000|$|Development of the Thury thread {{began in}} 1876, when the Horological Section of Geneva Society of Arts {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} look into the requirements for a uniform thread standard for use in Horological arts in Switzerland. Professor Thury began his studies by collecting and measuring samples of screws made by nine independent screw and screw tackle manufacturers in Switzerland. The Thury thread form was developed in 1878, thirty-seven years after the British Standard Whitworth thread form was designed in England and fourteen years after the United States Standard thread was presented in the United States. However, unlike these two predecessors, the Thury thread was designed for small-diameter screws which were then produced with screw plates. This production technique mandated that the Thury thread form have rounded crests and roots. Thread forms with rounded or [...] "radiused" [...] crests and roots like the Thury and Whitworth thread generate smaller stress risers than those forms like the American National or ISO metric which have truncated roots and crests; in modern engineering this is particularly important factor when tapping holes in acrylic plastic, where a larger stress riser can lead to an earlier onset of crack formation. The Thury thread is unusual in having a comparatively small 47.5° <b>thread</b> <b>flank</b> angle, which was chosen to make fabrication easier and to achieve greater holding capacity than screws with larger flank angles. Screws in the Thury thread system are given nominal sizes, with the base size [...] "0" [...] being six millimeters in diameter and having a thread pitch of one millimeter. Sizes are proportional, so a size [...] "1" [...] is ten percent smaller in diameter that a size [...] "0", while a size -1 is ten percent larger than a size [...] "0". The Thury thread was {{believed to be the first}} thread form to solve the problem of creating a single system of screw dimensions applicable to all sizes. The relationship between the pitch P of a Thury screw and its diameter D is expressed by the equation D=6P5/6. Another variable Thury standardized is the thread depth, which had until then been variable when cutting threads in different materials. The proliferation of the Thury standard was hindered when in 1882, the British Science Association produced a committee report on the consideration of a standard screw gauge, where they declined to accept the Thury thread but instead chose to use the Whitworth thread standard previously designed by committee member Joseph Whitworth, in part because the Whitworth form was historically successful and because the committee did not believe England was prepared to use a metric thread as its standard. However, the committee recognized the validity of many of the design aspects of the Thury thread, and a mere two years later published their specifications for the British Association (BA) thread. The BA committee made only slight modifications to the rounding radii of Thury thread and gave specifications rounded to the nearest mil.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Previous rabbit studies {{demonstrated}} higher {{affinity for}} bone formation at implant threads with furrows to threads without furrows. The present animal study was undertaken {{to study the}} bone tissue response and stability of oxidized titanium implants with 80, 110 and 160 μm wide furrows added on one <b>thread</b> <b>flank.</b> Materials and methods: Ninety-six (96) threaded titanium implants, 3. 75 mm in diameter and 7 mm long (TiUnite™, MKIII, Nobel Biocare AB, Gothenburg, Sweden), were manufactured with 70 μm deep and either 80 (S 0), 110 (S 1) or 160 (S 2) μm wide furrows or no furrows (controls). The implants were installed in the distal femoral condyle and the tibial methaphysis of 12 rabbits. Six weeks later the implants were subjected to resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and removal torque (RTQ) tests, after ground sections were manufactured for light microscopy.

5000|$|A {{general-purpose}} micrometer (flat anvil and spindle) is used over a set {{of three}} wires that rest on the <b>thread</b> <b>flanks,</b> and a known constant is subtracted from the reading. (The wires are truly gauge pins, being ground to precise size, although [...] "wires" [...] is their common name.) This method is called the 3-wire method.

5000|$|The pitch {{diameter}} (PD, or D2) {{of a particular}} thread, internal or external, is the diameter of a cylindrical surface, axially concentric to the thread, which intersects the <b>thread</b> <b>flanks</b> at equidistant points, when viewed {{in a cross-sectional plane}} containing the axis of the thread, the distance between these points being exactly one half the pitch distance. Equivalently, a line running parallel to the axis and a distance D2 away from it, the [...] "PD line," [...] slices the sharp-V form of the <b>thread,</b> having <b>flanks</b> coincident with the <b>flanks</b> of the <b>thread</b> under test, at exactly 50% of its height. We have assumed that the flanks have the proper shape, angle, and pitch for the specified thread standard. It is generally unrelated to the major (D) and minor (D1) diameters, especially if the crest and root truncations of the sharp-V form at these diameters are unknown. Everything else being ideal, D2, D, & D1, together, would fully describe the thread form. Knowledge of PD determines the position of the sharp-V thread form, the sides of which coincide with the straight sides of the thread flanks: e.g., the crest of the external thread would truncate these sides a radial displacement D - D2 away from the position of the PD line.|$|R
40|$|Threaded {{connections}} in an aluminium valve body under high internal swelling pressure are investigated. A static straining process called autofrettage {{leads to an}} improved fatigue behaviour of the aluminium component, while normally the threaded connections are unloaded during this autofrettage. But by unloading the thread during autofrettage the first loaded <b>thread</b> <b>flank</b> became the weakest point of this valve component. This effect is analyzed with non-linear finite element simulations, FKM guideline for fatigue assessment and by experimental testing. The analytical and experimental parts match very well {{and it can be}} shown that a well-designed autofrettage without unloading the threaded connection is helpful for the aluminium thread and extends its fatigue lifetime, as compressive residual stresses and an equalized stress distribution over the thread flanks can be generated. Finally different materials were chosen for the plug or screw and this effect for cyclic loading is shortly analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Nondimensional stress {{intensity}} factor (K) solutions for continuous circumferential cracks in threaded fasteners were calculated using finite element methods that determined the energy release rate during virtual crack extension. Assumed loading conditions included both remote tension and nut loading, whereby the effects of applying the load to the <b>thread</b> <b>flank</b> were considered. In addition, K solutions were developed for axisymmetric surface cracks in notched and smooth round bars. Results showed that the stress concentration of a thread causes a considerable increase in K for shallow cracks, but has much less effect for longer cracks. In the latter case, values of K can be accurately estimated from K solutions for axisymmetric cracks in smooth round bars. Nut loading increased K by about 50 % for shallow cracks, but this effect became negligible at crack depth-to-minor diameter ratios (a/d) greater than 0. 2. An evaluation of thread root acuity effects showed that root radius {{has no effect on}} K when the crack depth exceeds 2 % of the minor diameter. Closed-form K solutions were developed for both remote-loading and nut-loading conditions and {{for a wide range of}} thread root radii. The K solutions obtained in this study were compared with available literature solutions for threaded fasteners as well as notched and smooth round bars...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in developing appropriate vascular substitutes is to produce a graft that adapts to the biological and mechanical conditions at the application or implantation site. One approach {{is the use of}} tissue engineered electrospun grafts pre-seeded with autologous cells. However, bending stresses during in vivo applications could lead to kinking of the graft which may result in life-threatening stenosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an electrospun vascular graft consisting of biodegradable polymers which can reduce or prevent kinking, due to their higher flexibility. In order to improve the bendability of the grafts, various electrospinning collectors were designed using six different patterns. Subsequently, the grafts were examined for scaffold morphology, mechanical strength and bendability. Scaffolds spun on a collector structured with a v-shaped <b>thread</b> (<b>flank</b> angle of 120 °) showed a homogenous and reproducible fiber deposition as compared to the unstructured reference sample. The results of the tensile tests were comparable to the unstructured reference sample, supporting the first observation. Studies on bendability were performed using a custom made flow-bending test setup. It was shown that the flow through the v-shaped grafts was reduced to less than 45 % of the reference value even after bending the graft to an angle of 140 °. In contrast, the flow through an unstructured graft was reduced to more than 50 % after bending to an angle of 55 °. The presented data demonstrate the need for optimizing the bendability of the commonly used electrospun vascular grafts. Using of macroscopic v-shaped collectors is a promising solution to overcome the issue of graft kinking...|$|E
2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) Acme threads (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external radial loads and both the nut and bolt are, ideally, independently supported, the nut by a linear guide and the screw by shaft bearings. This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] of the <b>thread</b> <b>flanks</b> when subjected to radial loads, which would contribute substantially to friction forces and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and crests of opposing threads are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under radial loads. This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of nut and bolt be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (axial clearance, due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing Acme thread.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to create an acid etched implant surface that results in a surface similar to that gained by using sandblasting combined with acid etching and to compare it with surfaces of commercially available screw-type implants. Titanium grade V discs were machined in preparation for acid etching. Tests were carried out using different acids and their combinations with variable time exposures. All etched surfaces were scanned with electron microscope (JEOL JSM- 5600, Japan) and digital images were made for visual evaluation and description of the surfaces. The etched surfaces were evaluated for surface morphology (combination of micro roughness and waviness) and were best attained by a combina-tion of sulphuric and hydrochloric acids. The etched titanium discs were fixed in resin (two were cut and polished and two – scored and fractured) and the surface profile was examined in. The second part of the investigation used screw-shaped titanium implants. Twenty-eight screw-shaped implants that were manufactured from commercially available titanium grade V, were se-lected and divided into two groups: 3 implants as controls (machined surface) and 25 implants processed using the etching methods used {{in the first part of}} the investigation.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} fatigue lifetime acceptance test criterion by which studs having rolled threads, larger than 1. 0 inches in diameter, {{can be assured}} to meet minimum quality attributes associated with a controlled rolling process. This criterion is derived from a stress dependent, room temperature air fatigue database for test studs having a 0. 625 inch diameter threads of Alloys X- 750 HTH and direct aged 625. Anticipated fatigue lives of larger threads are based on thread root elastic stress concentration factors which increase with increasing thread diameters. Over the thread size range of interest, a 30 % increase in notch stress is equivalent to a factor of five (5 X) reduction in fatigue life. The resulting diameter dependent fatigue acceptance criterion is normalized to the aerospace rolled thread acceptance standards for a 1. 0 inch diameter, 0. 125 inch pitch, Unified National thread with a controlled Root radius (UNR). Testing was conducted at a stress of 50 % of the minimum specified material ultimate strength, 80 Ksi, and at a stress ratio (R) of 0. 10. Limited test data for fastener diameters of 1. 00 to 2. 25 inches are compared to the acceptance criterion. Sensitivity of fatigue life of threads to test nut geometry variables was also shown {{to be dependent on}} notch stress conditions. Bearing surface concavity of the compression nuts and <b>thread</b> <b>flank</b> contact mismatch conditions can significantly affect the fastener fatigue life. Without improved controls these conditions could potentially provide misleading acceptance data. Alternate test nut geometry features are described and implemented in the rolled thread stud specification, MIL-DTL- 24789 (SH), to mitigate the potential effects on fatigue acceptance data...|$|E
40|$|Background: Osseointegrated {{titanium}} implants {{are routinely}} used in clinical denstistry as anchorage units for dental prostheses. Although the overall clinical results are good, there are clinical situations when an optimized implant healing is desirable, {{for instance in}} order to shorten healing periods and to allow immediate loading. Aims: The present work was undertaken to study the influence of some micro- and macroscopical surface modifications on the integration and stability of titanium implants in bone. In addition, the aim was also to study {{the influence of a}} bone growth factor and autogenous bone grafts on implant healing in bone defects. Materials & Methods: The thesis is based on five experimental studies using a total of 12 mongrel dogs and 39 New Zealand White rabbits. In total, 327 screw-shaped implants were evaluated with histology and biomechanical tests. The implants had either a turned surface or had been treated with anodic oxidation to create a porous surface structure (microscopic modification). A groove with various sizes was added to one <b>thread</b> <b>flank</b> of oxidized implants (macroscopic modification) for comparison with implants without a groove. Ground sections of the intact bone-titanium interface were prepared for light microscopy and quantitative morphometry. A micro-CT technique was used for 3 D visualisation of the bone in relation to the implant surface. Implant stability was measured with removal torque (RTQ) tests and resonance frequency analysis (RFA) measurements. Results: Turned and oxidized implants were placed in the dog mandible with circumferential defects which were filled with dog BMP+ carrier, carrier alone, autogenous bone chips or nothing. No differences in histological response and implant stability were seen between the different materials and controls after 4 and 12 weeks of healing. However, oxidized implants shower a stronger bone tissue response and were significantly more stable than turned implants after 4 weeks. A rabbit study demonstrated direct bone formation at the surface of oxidized but not turned implants after 7, 14 and 28 days. A darkly stained layer became populated with osteoblasts which produced osteoid towards the implant surface whilst turned implants seemed to be integrated by approximation of bone from the surrounding bone and marrow tissues. In paper III, an increased resistance to RTQ was seen for oxidized implants with a 110 μm wide and 70 μm deep groove as compared with control implants without a groove after 6 weeks of healing. This was not observed for 200 μm wide grooves. Histology showed an affinity of bone formation to the grooves. Paper IV evaluated the influence of three different groove sizes on implant stability as measured with RTQ and RFA. The results confirmed that 110 μm grooves resulted in better stability than implants with 80 μm or 160 μm wide or no grooves. Histology of RTQ specimens revealed an increased incidence of bone fracture at the entrance of the groove as opposed to a separation at the bone-implant interface with decreased groove width. Bone formation had an affinity to the grooves which increased with decreased groove width. In paper V, bone formation was seen to occur more frequently in grooves than on opposing flank surfaces after 7, 14 and 28 days of healing in implant sites with small bone volumes. Conclusions: The present thesis shows that both micro- and macroscopical surface modifications have positive influences on the bone tissue response and stability of titanium implants. It is suggested that this is due to a combination of (i) contact osteogenesis as stimulated by the microtopography and (ii) guided bone formation as stimulated by the macrotopography, which resulted in an improved mechanical interlocking between bone and implant surface...|$|E

METHODS: Images of the active tips of the mini-implants were obtained with a Zeiss optical microscope, Stemi 200 -C with magnification of 1. 6 X. The images of the surface were viewed with the Axio Vision program (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to calculate linear and angular measures. Mini-implant morphology and the details of tips and threads were also evaluated through Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) (JEOL, model JSM 5800 LV - JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) with magnifications of 90 X and 70 X, respectively. The evaluation of the mini-implant taper shape was assessed using to the formula: (b - a) / (2 x D).

50|$|The {{three main}} {{elements}} of a typical planetary roller screw are the screw shaft, nut and planetary roller. The screw, a shaft with a multi-start V-shaped thread, provides a helical raceway for multiple rollers radially arrayed around the screw and encapsulated by a threaded nut. The thread of the screw is typically identical to the internal thread of the nut. The rollers spin in contact with, and serve as low-friction transmission elements between screw and nut. The rollers typically have a single-start <b>thread</b> with convex <b>flanks</b> that limit friction at the rollers' contacts with screw and nut. The rollers typically orbit the screw as they spin (in the manner of planet gears to sun gear), and are thus known as planetary, or satellite, rollers. As with a lead screw or ball screw, rotation of the nut results in screw travel, and rotation of the screw results in nut travel.|$|R
40|$|Planetary roller drives (PRD) with axial {{backlash}} {{have the highest}} load capacity amongst the prospective roller drives. PRD consists of a screw and a nut, between which thread rolls are installed in separators, force calculation of which is sufficient to assess the PRD force loading. For several reasons, the load is unevenly distributed between the roll turns operating with the screw and nut turns. These include rollers size variation by the average diameter of their thread, PRD parts' thread manufacturing errors, primarily thread pitch errors, and other reasons. The article discusses one of them – a special feature of thread roll loading. If we neglect the circumferential forces due to their smallness, then the roll's turns mating with the nut along one of the roll's generatrices and the roll turns mating with the screw along the opposite generatrix will be loaded with axial and radial forces. Since the PRD parts <b>thread</b> turn <b>flank</b> angle is symmetrical and equal to 90 °, then the radial force {{is equal to the}} axial one on each turn. If we sum the axial forces on the mating roll turns along one of the generatrices, then from the equation of equilibrium one gets that the sum vector value is equal to the sum vector value along the other roll generatrix. Here the sum vectors will have the opposite direction, and the arm between them equals to the average roll thread diameter. Multiplying the sum vector modulus by that arm, one gets the roll overturning moment that does not depend on the distribution of the axial forces along the roll axis. This moment is the cause of uneven load distribution between the roll turns mating with the nut and the screw. The overturning moment can be balanced on the two forming roll generatrices only by radial forces, distribution of which along the roll axis will be uneven. The PRD parts thread turns load distribution irregularity factor is introduced as the ratio of the maximum force acting on the most loaded roll turn to a nominal force. It is determined in the example that the value of this factor is equal to 1. 454 or 45. 4 %, i. e. the influence of the PRD roll loading characteristics on the drive threaded parts turns loading irregularity is strong...|$|R
