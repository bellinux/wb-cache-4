40|$|This study {{proposes a}} test for weak form {{efficiency}} based on the practitioner's approach to technical analysis. Previous studies typically make inferences on weak form efficiency based on the empirical results of testing only one class of technical rules-trend indicators. The practitioner's approach, on the other hand, typically involves the simultaneous use of <b>trend</b> <b>indicators</b> and other confirming <b>indicators</b> because <b>trend</b> <b>indicators</b> do not sufficiently capture the information content in past prices. By combining <b>trend</b> <b>indicators</b> with confirming indicators that are also based on the detection of trends in past prices, {{it is possible to}} construct a superior technical trading strategy that captures a more comprehensive aspect of predictability in past prices. Applying the technical trading rules to data on five Asian-Pacific stock markets, the evidence suggests that {{a test for}} weak form efficiency based solely on <b>trend</b> <b>indicators</b> is noisy and that the alternative test proposed in this study is significantly more effective in capturing the information content in past prices. An examination of weak form efficiency based on this alternative test suggests that weak form efficiency is determined by factors other than technological progress. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Clinicians informally assess {{changes in}} patients' status {{over time to}} prognosticate their outcomes. The {{incorporation}} of trends in patient status into regression models could improve their ability to predict outcomes. In this study, we used a unique approach to measure trends in patient hospital death risk and determined whether the incorporation of these trend measures into a survival model improved the accuracy of its risk predictions. Methods We included all adult inpatient hospitalizations between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2009 at our institution. We used the daily mortality risk scores from an existing time-dependent survival model to create five trend indicators: absolute and relative percent change in the risk score from the previous day; absolute and relative percent change in the risk score {{from the start of}} the trend; and number of days with a trend in the risk score. In the derivation set, we determined which <b>trend</b> <b>indicators</b> were associated with time to death in hospital, independent of the existing covariates. In the validation set, we compared the predictive performance of the existing model with and without the <b>trend</b> <b>indicators.</b> Results Three <b>trend</b> <b>indicators</b> were independently associated with time to hospital mortality: the absolute change in the risk score from the previous day; the absolute change in the risk score {{from the start of the}} trend; and the number of consecutive days with a trend in the risk score. However, adding these <b>trend</b> <b>indicators</b> to the existing model resulted in only small improvements in model discrimination and calibration. Conclusions We produced several <b>indicators</b> of <b>trend</b> in patient risk that were significantly associated with time to hospital death independent of the model used to create them. In other survival models, our approach of incorporating risk trends could be explored to improve their performance without the collection of additional data. </p...|$|R

50|$|In France, {{the main}} French stock index {{is called the}} CAC 40. Daily price limits are {{implemented}} in cash and derivative markets. Securities traded on the markets are divided into three categories according to the number and volume of daily transactions. Price limits for each security vary by category. For instance, for the more liquid category, when the price movement of a security from the previous day's closing price exceeds 10%, the quotation is suspended for 15 minutes, and transactions are then resumed. If the price then goes up or down by more than 5%, transactions are again suspended for 15 minutes. The 5% threshold may apply once more before transactions are halted {{for the rest of}} the day. When such a suspension occurs, transactions on options based on the underlying security are also suspended. Further, when more than 35% of the capitalization of the CAC40 Index cannot be quoted, the calculation of the CAC40 Index is suspended and the index is replaced by a <b>trend</b> <b>indicator.</b> When less than 25% of the capitalization of the CAC40 Index can be quoted, quotations on the derivative markets are suspended for half an hour or one hour, and additional margin deposits are requested.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{microstructural}} {{theories of}} asset pricing emphasize {{the role of}} volume as a <b>trend</b> <b>indicator.</b> With the availability of large transaction data sets, one has started recently to incorporate more information of the trades, such as the time between trades, to describe the multivariate dynamics of transactions. Without knowing a priori {{the relation between the}} observed components of a trade - price, duration between trades, and volume - one may follow the principle of `letting the data speak for themselves'. The goal {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the informational content of both volume and durations to predict transaction returns using explorative nonparametric methods. The empirical results for transaction data of IBM stock prices confirm the role of volume as a <b>trend</b> <b>indicator</b> and suggest that the bid-ask bounce is smaller in highly active than in less active trading periods. That is, after a sell (buy) expected returns are decreasing (increasing) with volume and increasing (decreasing) with durations. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: As Twitter {{has become}} a global microblogging site, it s influ-ence {{in the stock market}} has become noticeable. This makes tweets an interest-ing medium for {{gathering}} sentiment. A sentiment that might influence trendsin the stock market. Motivation: If Twitter can be used to predict future prices in the stock mar-ket the casual investor would gain an advantage over the day-trader and themodern trading algorithms. Another interesting aspect is the role of Twitter in sentiment analysis. Andhow Twitters role as a data source influences trends in the stock market. Data and Experiments: Twitter is used as the data source. It provides easyaccess, lots of data, and many possibilities to use available metadata. To findthe sentiment of a tweet we use two methods, counting positive and negativewords(bag of words), and classifiers (SVM and Naive Bayes). We use movingaverage(MA) and average directional index(ADX) as <b>trend</b> <b>indicators.</b> We cal-culate MA and ADX with data from Oslo stock exchange, and we created ourown indicators, based on MA and ADX, using data from Twitter. Then wecompare the graphs. Findings: We explore the usage of lists of words, dictionaries, in sentimentanalysis. And we look at data retrieval from Twitter and the trend we cancreate from it. To a varying degree we get positive results with the dictionaries,while the trend aggregation lacks the finesse and results we hoped for. Conclusion: Sentiment classification of tweets worked with both bag of words,and trained classifiers. We also managed to aggregate a trend based on senti-ment, but we found no correlation between the financial <b>trend</b> <b>indicators</b> andthe sentiment indicators...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a moving average reliability growth model {{to describe the}} evolution of component-based software. In this model, the reliability of a system {{is a function of}} the reliabilities of its constituent components. The moving average provides a <b>trend</b> <b>indicator</b> to depict reliability growth movement within the evolution of a series of component enhancements. The moving average can reduce the effects of bias or measurement error of certain components by rendering a smoothed trend of system reliability growth. The input parameters are the components ’ configurations and individual reliability growths. The output is a vector of moving averaged system reliability growths indicating increasing component enhancement. The application of this model can facilitate cost/performance evaluation and support decision making for future software maintenance. More importantly, without introducing excessive computation, the model can be combined with many existing component-based reliability models to compute overall reliability growth...|$|E

Starting from closely spaced core descriptions, and using interpolation methods, a 3 D optimum and robust facies distribution model was obtained for a thick, heterogeneous coal zone deposited in the non-marine As Pontes basin (Oligocene-Early Miocene, NW Spain). Several grid layering styles, interpolation methods (truncated inverse squared distance weighting, truncated kriging, truncated kriging with an areal <b>trend,</b> <b>indicator</b> inverse squared distance weighting, indicator kriging, and indicator kriging with an areal trend) and searching conditions were compared. Facies interpolation strategies were evaluated using visual comparison and cross validation. Moreover, robustness of the resultant facies distribution with respect to variations in interpolation method input parameters was verified by taking into account several scenarios of uncertainty. The resultant 3 D facies reconstruction improves {{the understanding of the}} distribution and geometry of the coal facies. Furthermore, since some coal quality properties (e. g. calorific value or sulphur percentage) display a good statistical correspondence with facies, predicting the distribution of these properties using the reconstructed facies distribution as a template proved to be a powerful approach, yielding more accurate and realistic reconstructions of these properties in the coal zone...|$|E
