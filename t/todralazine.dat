40|$|Abstract: We {{assessed}} four antimutagenic compoundsµinfluences on DNA repair {{in human}} lymphocytes exposed in vitro to hydrogen peroxide (20 óM, 5 min, at 4 o C). DNA damage and repair were estimated {{by means of}} alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). It was noticed that the enhancement of DNA repair was relatively strongest when fluphenazine was present in the cell culture medium. In the cases of anthocyanins and alkylresorcinols, the effects were almost 6 - 9 times weaker than that of FPh. The effect of <b>todralazine</b> on DNA repair was relatively weakest. Further study should be done on fluphenazine as a potential DNA repair-enhancing compound...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{sensitivity}} of the available methods of apoptosis detection in lymphocyte cultures was tested. Cells were preincubated with genotoxic agents: hydrogen peroxide (0. 2 mM; 20 min.) and benzo[a]pyrene (40 µM; 90 min.), and then cultured for 36 h {{in the presence of}} a lectin (PHA-M; 1 %v/v) and one of the following potentially antimutagenic agents: alkylresorcinols, anthocyanins, <b>todralazine</b> and fluphenazine. It was established that staining with a mixture of fluorochromes (ethidium bromide and acridine orange) provided the highest amount of detected apoptotic cells, and the best repeatability of the results in subsequent experiments. Calculation of the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients proved that there was a high correlation between the results obtained by the ethidium bromide/acridine orange method and those obtained by identifying genomic DNA fragmentation by means of FIGE-electrophoresis. Therefore, these two methods were chosen for further studies of the tested antimutagens ’ impact on apoptosis in genotoxically-damaged lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Four {{compounds}} {{previously described}} as antimutagenic for human lymphocytes in vitro were tested on their immunomodulatory activity in lymphocyte cultures. The standard immunocytochemical methods were applied for microscopic {{examination of the}} percentual representation of the main lymphocyte subpopulation. The results imply {{that all of the}} tested compounds exhibited significant immunomodulatory effect, with that of fluphenazine being the strongest, whereas that of <b>todralazine</b> is the weakest. Two of the tested compounds: anthocyanins from Aronia melanocarpa fruit, and alkylresorcinols from cereal grains, also exhibited a distinct immunomodulatory activity, and it deserves adequate attention as an activity exerted by natural products, commonly present in regular human diet. The analysis of the proliferating cell fraction, and the estimation of the cell proliferation rate suggest that the effect of the tested compounds might depend on {{an increase in the number}} of lymphocytes which expressed their differentiation antigens on the cell membranes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{antimutagenic}} {{activity of}} fluphenazine, <b>todralazine,</b> anthocyanins and alkylresorcinols {{was established in}} a battery of short-term cytogenetic tests. One of the possible mechanisms of their antimutagenic action could {{be an increase in}} apoptotic elimination of heavily-damaged cells from a culture. In this paper we provide data on quantitative estimation of the antimutagensµ impact on apoptosis in lymphocyte cultures exposed in the G 0 -phase to genotoxic agents: hydrogen peroxide (0. 2 mM, 20 min.) or benzo[a]pyrene (40 óM, 90 min.), and then cultured for 36 hrs {{in the presence of a}} lectin (PHA-M, 1 % v/v) and each of the tested antimutagens. Apoptosis was estimated by means of microscopic examination of cell smears stained with a mixture of fluorochromes (ethidium bromide/acridine orange) as well as of the results of DNA separation with the field inversion gel electrophoresis. By microscopic examination we assessed that the frequencies of cells exhibiting morphological features of apoptosis considerably increased in the cultures containing the antimutagens. The FIGE separation of DNA from those cultures proved that the DNA content in the 30 - 50 kb domain was markedly elevated, as compared with the control cultures that did not contain antimutagens. It was established in the regression analysis that the apoptosis-enhancing effect significantly depended on the concentration of each tested antimutagen in a culture medium. However, marked differences of apoptosis-enhancig potency were noticed among the four antimutagens. The multicriterial analysis proved that the apoptosis-enhancin...|$|E
