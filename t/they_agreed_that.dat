5|$|The fire on Yorktown {{from the}} allies was heavier than ever as new {{artillery}} pieces joined the line. Cornwallis talked with his officers {{that day and}} <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> their situation was hopeless.|$|E
5|$|The Young {{brothers}} {{decided to}} abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band The Skyhooks and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this end <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group. Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.|$|E
5|$|After more arguing {{between the}} senior officers, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, {{until a new}} {{civilian}} government could be formed. However, because of their disunity, the trio did little. Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiêm and Minh. The US military commander in Vietnam William Westmoreland deplored the concessions Khánh made to political opponents and lobbied Washington for permission to attack North Vietnam, saying that Khánh could not survive without it.|$|E

5|$|During the night, Washington {{called a}} council {{of war and}} asked his {{officers}} whether they should stand and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, or take the backroads to attack Princeton. Although the idea had already occurred to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan to attack Princeton was indeed possible. Two intelligence collection efforts, both of which came to fruition {{at the end of}} December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with his officers, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the best option was to attack Princeton.|$|E
5|$|In June 1776, American Patriot {{officers}} Henry Knox, Nathanael Greene, William Heath, and Israel Putnam {{examined the}} terrain on which Fort Washington would be located; <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> if the fort was properly fortified, {{it would be}} practically impossible to take. Later in June, the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, George Washington, inspected the location and determined that the area {{was the key to}} defense of the lower Hudson. Shortly after Washington's survey, troops from Pennsylvania began construction on the fort under the supervision of Rufus Putnam.|$|E
5|$|In November, {{the three}} {{principal}} Bundy investigators—Jerry Thompson from Utah, Robert Keppel from Washington, and Michael Fisher from Colorado—met and exchanged information with 30 detectives and prosecutors from five states in Aspen, Colorado. While officials left the meeting (later {{known as the}} Aspen Summit) convinced that Bundy was the murderer they sought, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> more hard evidence would be needed before he could be charged {{with any of the}} murders.|$|E
50|$|Accounts of {{his death}} vary, though <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> {{it was during the}} persecutions of Ptolemy VIII of Egypt. One account has him, having {{contracted}} an incurable dropsy, starving himself to death while in exile on Cyprus.|$|R
30|$|Negative {{correlations}} between Valence and prints, cleavage shape, embroidery and color were detected. Results suggest that, the more excited users feel wearing the chosen bra, the less <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the listed aesthetic attributes are {{reasons for the}} choice.|$|R

5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E
5|$|Gates McFadden {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Doctor Beverly Crusher in the third season, the character had been written out for season two and replaced with Diana Muldaur playing Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Roddenberry had ensured that Crusher was not written out permanently to allow for her return in the future. Keith DeCandido blamed her departure on Maurice Hurley. After he left the series, McFadden returned. Fans started a letter-writing campaign to reinstate McFadden throughout the second season. Both Roddenberry and Berman decided {{that it would be better}} to bring back McFadden than to look for a third doctor in three years as <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the Pulaski character was not working.|$|E
5|$|In 33 BC Antony met his {{coalition}} {{partner on}} the river Araxes; <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> Antony should support Artavasdes I against Parthia and that the Median King should help Antony against Octavian. They interchanged parts of their troops. The domain of Artavasdes I was enlarged with parts of Armenia. Antony had returned a standard that the Median king had taken from Oppius Statianus in 36 BC, and also took Iotapa along with him. With {{the help of the}} Roman reinforcements Artavasdes I was initially able to repulse the Parthian attack. Before the Battle of Actium, Antony called back his Roman troops without sending back the Median reinforcements. This time Phraates IV defeated Artavasdes I who was captured in 30 BC.|$|E

5|$|Joss Whedon {{had wanted}} to make a musical episode {{since the start of the}} series. This was {{heightened}} during the fifth season when he hosted a Shakespeare reading at his house, to which the cast was invited. They began drinking and singing, demonstrating to Whedon that certain cast members had musical talents. Whedon knew he would have to write an entire score, which would take weeks or months. During the first three seasons of Buffy, he was unable to take more than two weeks off at a time, and the constraints of writing and directing the show precluded him from putting forth the effort of preparing a musical. Whedon spoke to the show's producer, Gareth Davies, about his idea; <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> a musical episode would be written.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{decided to}} move to the {{continent}} for a better chance at success, and contacted French brothers Robert and Yvon Murphy, whom he met while racing. <b>They</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> he could stay with them in the Breton fishing port of Saint-Brieuc. His final event in Britain was at Herne Hill, riding motor-paced races. Simpson won the event and was invited to Germany to train for the 1959 motor-paced world championships, but declined the opportunity in favour of a career on the road. Bicycle manufacturer Elswick Hopper invited him to join their British-based team, but Benny Foster advised him to continue with his plans to move to France.|$|E
5|$|The Convention {{agreed on}} several principles. Most importantly, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely {{to amend the}} Articles of Confederation, and instead should produce a new {{constitution}} outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, the Articles of Confederation were closer to a treaty between sovereign states than they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal problems were limited. Another principle they agreed on was that the new government would have all {{the powers of the}} Confederation Congress, plus additional powers over the states. Once agreeing on these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and signaled their approval for it. Once this was done, they began modifying it.|$|E
50|$|As Hacker watches {{television}} in his office, a news report confirms Sir Frederick's misgivings.

30|$|The Cartagena Protocol and Codex share a precautionary {{approach}} to GM crops and foods, in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> genetic engineering differs from conventional breeding and that safety assessments {{should be required}} before GM organisms are used in food or released into the environment.|$|R
5000|$|In a May 2016 Gallup poll, 69% of Americans said <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> “when {{a person}} has a disease that cannot be cured...doctors should be allowed by law to end the patient’s life by some painless means if the patient and their family request it.” ...|$|R
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, Pohl, along with Georg von Müller, the Chief of the Imperial Naval Cabinet, and Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{the commander of the}} High Seas Fleet, believed that since the war would be over quickly, the fleet should be preserved intact. Together, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the fleet should be restrained to provide local defense of the German coast, rather than seek a decisive battle against the numerically superior British Grand Fleet. Pohl argued that U-boats should be used to attack British merchant shipping. He pushed for fewer restrictions on the conduct of the commerce war beginning in late 1914; he further advocated abandoning the cruiser rules that handicapped the German effort, in favor of unrestricted submarine warfare. He presented his first plans for an unlimited commerce war in November 1914, but these were rejected by the Kaiser and Bethmann-Hollweg so as not to antagonize neutral nations, in particular the United States.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the screen, with the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} scroll in either direction.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{after the}} December 1920 hearing {{requested}} by the ANA, {{the chairman of the}} U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore, became aware of the proposed congressional action, and decided to investigate. Moore, together with Commission member and Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, met with Mint Director Baker on May 26, 1921, and <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> it would be appropriate to hold a design competition for the proposed dollar, {{under the auspices of the}} Commission. This was formalized on July 26 with the Commission's written recommendation to the Mint that a competition, open only to invited sculptors, be used to select designs. The winner of the competition was to receive $1,500 prize money, while all other participants would be given $100. On July 28, President Harding issued Executive Order 3524, requiring that coin designs be submitted to the Commission before approval by the Treasury Secretary. In early September, following the failure of the bill, Baker contacted Moore, putting the matter aside pending congressional action.|$|E
50|$|A {{few days}} later, Robin comes to Marjorie, {{to say goodbye}} before setting out for Rheims. <b>They</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> he must always {{remember}} that he {{is to be a}} priest, and that if he comes to her house, it must just be as to any Catholic neighbour.|$|R
50|$|Turpio (or Turpion; died 4 October 863) was a Count of Angoulême in the Frankish empire. The {{sources are}} {{contradictory}} concerning {{the date of}} his appointment as count and his allegiance, but <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> he died trying to fend off a raid by the Vikings.|$|R
30|$|As {{explained}} in the previous sections, the assessment criteria {{have been shown to}} students in the learning activities. This fact is highly rated by the students (Mean: 4.45, SD: 0.822) because <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> it helps them to understand the learning activities and what the teacher expects from them.|$|R
5|$|The {{first trial}} series {{consisted}} of three shots. All bombs were dropped and detonated over Malden Island, and exploded high in the atmosphere, rather than being detonated on the ground, {{in order to reduce}} the production of nuclear fallout. British scientists were aware that the Americans had been able to reduce fallout by obtaining most of the bomb yield from fusion instead of fission, but they did not yet know how to do this. Amid growing public concern about the dangers of fallout, particularly from strontium-90 entering the food chain, a committee chaired by Sir Harold Himsworth was asked to look into the matter. Another, in the United States chaired by Detlev Bronk, also investigated. They reported simultaneously on 12 June 1956. While differing on many points, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> levels of strontium-90 were not yet sufficiently high to be of concern.|$|E
5|$|The parties {{reached a}} {{compromise}} which {{was recorded in}} the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. <b>They</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the tithe would be reduced by half. The payment of the rents, taxes and other levies due to the landowners and the royal treasury was suspended until the tithe was collected. The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required {{to pay the rent}} to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was fixed at 10 dinars, much lower than the rent from before the uprising. The noblemen also acknowledged the peasants' right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to the landowner. To keep the execution of the agreement under surveillance, the peasants were authorized to hold an annual assembly at Mount Bábolna. Their assembly was entitled to punish noblemen who had broken the compromise.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the debate}} that {{immediately}} followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on {{the similarities and differences}} between humans and modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order from any of the other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. <b>They</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for all the differences between humans and apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.|$|E
