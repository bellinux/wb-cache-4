40|$|Shallow injection, <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> {{and band}} {{spreading}} machines were evaluated, {{in terms of}} their potential for reducing ammonia (NH) emission, by making measurements after application and in direct comparison with 3 surface broadcast applied cattle slurry (pig slurry on one occasion). Several sets of comparative measurements were made with each type of machine on both grassland and arable land (mostly cereal stubbles), covering a range of soil, crop and weather conditions. Measurements of NH 3 emissions were made for 5 – 7 days following application using a micrometeorological mass balance technique. Mean reductions in NH 3 emission achieved from grassland, in comparison with surface broadcast application, were 73, 57 and 26 % for shallow injection, <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> and band spreading, respectively, the latter not being significant (probability P> 005). Mean cumulative emissions, expressed as % total ammoniacal N applied in the slurry, were 13, 12 and 35 % for shallow injection, <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> and band spreading, respectively. There was a trend (probability P= 0029) for decreasing emissions with increasing sward height (between 10 and 20 cm) following <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> applications. Abatement was generally less effective when these techniques were used on arable land, with mean reductions of 23, 38 and 27 % achieved for shallow injection, <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> and band spreading, respectively, with none achieving statistical significance (probability P> 005). There was considerable variation in the efficiency of shallow injection, with reductions achieved in individual experiments ranging from 0 to 90 %.

50|$|The twin-leading-shoe brake (2LS) {{is a type}} of {{drum brake}} that has two leading shoes, rather than the single leading shoe and a single <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> of a single-leading shoe (SLS) drum brake. A leading shoe has a self-servo effect, so an {{advantage}} of a 2LS is that it provides the maximum retardation in its intended direction of travel, i.e. forwards. 2LS brakes are fitted on the front axle of automobiles, or the front wheel of a motorcycle. A 2LS brake is more powerful than an SLS design.|$|R
50|$|One wheel {{cylinder}} operates the brake on each wheel. Two pistons operate the shoes, one {{at each end}} of the {{wheel cylinder}}. The leading shoe (closest to the front of the vehicle) is known as the primary <b>shoe.</b> The <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> is known as the secondary shoe. Hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder acts on the piston cup, pushing the pistons toward the shoes, forcing them against the drum. When the driver releases the brakes, the brake shoe springs restore the shoes to their original (disengaged) position. The parts of the wheel cylinder are shown to the right.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that the <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> application technique reduces phosphorus (P) in the runoff postslurry application {{when compared to the}} traditional splash-plate application technique. However, the effectiveness of the trailing-shoe technique as a means of reducing P losses has not been evaluated when slurry is applied during periods of high soil moisture levels and lower herbage covers. To address this issue, three treatments were examined in a 3 × 4 factorial design split-plot experiment, with treatments comprising three slurry treatments: control (no slurry), splashplate and trailing-shoe, and four slurry application dates: 7 December, 18 January, 1 March and 10 April. Dairy cow slurry was applied at a rate of 20 m 3 /ha, while simulated runoff was generated 2, 9 and 16 days later and analysed for a range of P fractions. Dissolved reactive P concentrations in runoff at day two was 41 % lower when slurry was applied using the trailing-shoe technique, compared to the splash-plate technique (P < 0. 05). In addition, P concentrations in runoff were higher (P < 0. 05) from slurry applied in December and March compared to slurry applied in January or April, coinciding with periods of higher soil moisture contents. While the latter highlights that ‘calendar’-based non-spreading periods might not always achieve the desired consequences, the study demonstrated that further field-scale investigations into the <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> as a mitigation measure to reduced P loss from agricultural soils is warranted. peer-reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the vehicle}} is moving in reverse, {{or if it is}} {{stationary}} but facing uphill, the role of the leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>shoes</b> is reversed. A twin-leading design thus becomes twin-trailing, with the rotation of the drum working against the brake shoes, trying to throw them off the drum. The exact opposite of the self-applying effect. [...] A 2LS brake is virtually useless when working in the opposite direction. For this reason, it is more usual to have a leading/trailing drum brake design on the rear of the vehicle, so that there is sufficient braking when travelling in reverse or when parked on a slope.|$|R

50|$|The {{braking system}} was also typical; the front brakes were disc brakes, using a solid iron disc and a single-piston sliding caliper. The rears were drum brakes (a {{technological}} backwards step from the 124, which used discs all round), utilising leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> design {{operated by a}} dual piston fixed slave cylinder. They were operated hydraulically, with a tandem master cylinder assisted by a vacuum servo using two separate circuits. A rear-mounted load sensing valve varied the bias of effort applied to the rear brakes, dependent on the load being carried (and also the pitch dynamics caused by braking effort and road levels). A centrally located floor mounted handbrake operated on the rear axle using bowden cables.|$|R

40|$|Ammonia {{is easily}} lost after land {{spreading}} of livestock slurries. Low-emission techniques entailing injection and <b>trailing</b> <b>shoes</b> have therefore become compulsory in the Netherlands on grassland. There {{is an argument}} that the emission of ammonia after surface application is overestimated and that the emission of various other nitrogen (N) compounds, following the prescribed low-emission techniques, is underestimated. Opponents also claim that injection in particular decreases grassland yields due to its negative effect on soil quality and biodiversity. They state that a similar reduction in ammonia emissions could be realized via low-protein dairy cow diets and slurry spreading under favourable weather conditions. This study evaluates these claims and concludes that low-emission techniques reduce the loss of ammonia effectively and increase the availability of N to grassland. There are no indications that low-emission techniques per se have negative effects on soil quality, the productivity of crops and biodiversity. It has also been demonstrated that the efficacy of proposed alternatives is limited. </p...|$|R

5000|$|This type of shoe {{generally}} has a soft outsole (as {{compared with a}} road shoe) and a molded internal midsole. They are shaped more like a street or <b>trail</b> <b>shoe</b> with a less exaggerated [...] "rocker" [...] allowing a more normal gait. The outsole usually has a lugged pattern which is like a day hiking boot and is a compromise between an aggressive off shoe and an old-style touring shoe. These shoes have a molded midsole which protects the rider's foot from the pedal and transfers energy more evenly without a pressure point at the exact shoe/pedal contact points. It also allows for the attachment of a clipless pedal cleat and can {{be more or less}} walked in normally. There is almost always a rectangular cutout in the outsole where a piece of the outsole material is removed by the purchaser or bicycle store, under which is the midsole and two oval slots where the cleats are bolted on. Most of these cleats follow Shimano's [...] "SPD" [...] system. Other two-bolt cleat and pedal systems for use with casual cycling and MTB shoes are produced by Crank Brothers, Speedplay and Ritchey, to name a few. Casual cycling shoes normally have a US retail price of under $100. Sizes range from 35 to 50 in European sizing.|$|R
40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} {{from animal}} manure contributes to {{air pollution and}} ecosystem degradation, {{and the loss of}} reactive nitrogen (N) from agricultural systems. Estimates of NH 3 emission are necessary for national inventories and nutrient management, and NH 3 emission from field-applied manure has been measured in many studies over the past few decades. In this work, we facilitate the use of these data by collecting and organizing them in the ALFAM 2 database. In this paper we describe the development of the database and summarise its contents, quantify effects of application methods and other variables on emission using a data subset, and discuss challenges for data analysis and model development. The database contains measurements of emission, manure and soil properties, weather, application technique, and other variables for 1895 plots from 22 research institutes in 12 countries. Data on five manure types (cattle, pig, mink, poultry, mixed, as well as sludge and "other") applied to three types of crops (grass, small grains, maize, as well as stubble and bare soil) are included. Application methods represented in the database include broadcast, <b>trailing</b> hose, <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> (narrow band application), and open slot injection. Cattle manure application to grassland was the most common combination, and analysis of this subset (with dry matter (DM) limited to < 15 %) was carried out using mixed- and fixed-effects models in order to quantify effects of management and environment on ammonia emission, and to highlight challenges for use of the database. Measured emission in this subset ranged from < 1 % to 130 % of applied ammonia after 48 h. Results showed clear, albeit variable, reductions in NH 3 emission due to <b>trailing</b> hose, <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe,</b> and open slot injection of slurry compared to broadcast application. There was evidence of positive effects of air temperature and wind speed on NH 3 emission, and limited evidence of effects of slurry DM. However, random-effects coefficients for differences among research institutes were among the largest model coefficients, and showed a deviation from the mean response by more than 100 % in some cases. The source of these institute differences could not be determined with certainty, but {{there is some evidence that}} they are related to differences in soils, or differences in application or measurement methods. The ALFAM 2 database should be useful for development and evaluation of both emission factors and emission models, but users need to recognize the limitations caused by confounding variables, imbalance in the dataset, and dependence among observations from the same institute. Variation among measurements and in reported variables highlights the importance of international agreement on how NH 3 emission should be measured, along with necessary types of supporting data and standard protocols for their measurement. Both are needed in order to produce more accurate and useful ammonia emission measurements. Expansion of the ALFAM 2 database will continue, and readers are invited to contact the corresponding author for information on data submission.

40|$|Field data on ammonia {{emission}} after liquid cattle manure (‘slurry’) application to grassland were statistically analysed {{to reveal the}} effect of manure and field characteristics and of weather conditions in eight consecutive periods after manure application. Logistic regression models, modelling the emission expressed {{as a percentage of}} the ammonia still present at the start of each period as the response variable, were developed separately for broadcast spreading, narrow band application (<b>trailing</b> <b>shoe)</b> and shallow injection. Wind speed, temperature, soil type, total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) content and dry matter content of the manure, application rate and grass height were selected as significant explanatory variables. Their effects differed for each application method and among periods. Temperature and wind speed were generally the most important drivers for emission. The fitted regression models were used to reveal seasonal trends in NH 3 emission employing historical meteorological data for the years 1991 – 2014. The overall average emission was higher in early and midsummer than in early spring and late summer. This seasonal trend was most pronounced for broadcast spreading followed by narrow band application, and was almost absent for shallow injection. However, due to the large variation in weather conditions, emission on a particular day in early spring can be higher than on a particular day in summer. The analysis further revealed that, in a specific scenario and depending on the application technique, emission could be reduced with 20 – 30 % by restricting manure application to favourable days, i. e. with weather conditions with minimal emission levels...|$|R

40|$|RONO: 2490 5234 RONO: 2490 4066 Ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} {{following the}} application of livestock slurry to agricultural land is {{a significant source of}} atmospheric NH 3, and not only poses a risk to the environment through eutrophication and acidification of sensitive ecosystems, but may also result in a loss of plant-available nitrogen (N). The band-spread slurry application technologies of trailing hose and <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> have been shown to reduce NH 3 emissions and consequently to increase plant uptake of slurry-applied N. There is a need to improve the precision in calculating the reduction in NH 3 emission nationally and at farm level, and this may be achieved through the development of algorithms that more accurately estimate NH 3 emission and also support the assessment of fertilizer efficiency of slurry that is band-applied to crops. Therefore, this study reviewed studies of NH 3 emission from slurry band applied with a <b>trailing</b> hose or <b>shoe</b> with the objective of developing an algorithm for calculating the reduction efficiency of the band application technique in relation to crop height. The developed algorithm predicted that for slurry applications to cereal crops, the reduction efficiency would increase by slightly less than 1 % for every 1 cm increase in crop height. For slurry application to grassland, the reduction efficiency was predicted to increase by approximately 5 % for every 1 cm increase in sward height. The developed algorithm was used in combination with the ALFAM model, which predicts NH 3 emission from slurry applications to bare soil, to provide monthly coefficients for estimating NH 3 emission from slurry applied to bare soil, cereal crops and grassland for Denmark and Southern England. Inclusion of the crop height algorithm in the emission factor derivation predicted, for example, a decrease in the emission factor for cattle slurry application by trailing hose to winter wheat from c. 25 % to c. 15 % of applied ammoniacal N for applications in January and May, respectively. While the algorithm developed in this study would benefit from wider validation, should more published data become available, the present paper demonstrates its potential value as an educational tool for farmers and advisers in developing more sustainable manure management strategies and for inclusion in emission factor calculations for national inventories to both improve the temporal distribution of emissions from slurry application and to better reflect improved management practices of farmers.
