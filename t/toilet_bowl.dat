5|$|Artificial trees made of goose {{feathers}} were {{in use in}} American homes {{since the}} 1880s. In the 1930s, however, The Addis Brush Company, an American <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl</b> brush manufacturer, began making artificial trees of green-dyed bristles and then supplied the British (who suffered a dearth of wild trees) with thousands of artificial trees in the post-War years. Americans took {{little interest in the}} Addis artificial trees and remained loyal to real trees.|$|E
5|$|Metallica {{began by}} playing shows in local clubs in Los Angeles. They {{recorded}} several demos to gain attention from club owners, and eventually relocated to San Francisco {{to secure the}} services of bassist Cliff Burton. The group's No Life 'til Leather demo (1982) was noticed by Megaforce label head Jon Zazula, who signed them and provided a small budget of $15,000 for recording. The album was recorded in May with producer Paul Curcio at the Music America Studios in Rochester, New York. It was originally intended to be titled Metal Up Your Ass, with cover art featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl.</b> The band was asked to change the name because distributors feared that releasing an album with such an offensive title and artwork would diminish its chances of commercial success. Metallica promoted the album on the two-month co-headlining Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven in the U.S. Although the initial shipment was 15,000 copies in the U.S., the album sold 60,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} Metallica's Seven Dates of Hell European tour in 1984.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl,</b> hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

5000|$|Forming {{is making}} the mixed {{material}} into shapes, ranging from <b>toilet</b> <b>bowls</b> to spark plug insulators. Forming can involve: (1) Extrusion, such as extruding [...] "slugs" [...] to make bricks, (2) Pressing to make shaped parts, (3) Slip casting, as in making <b>toilet</b> <b>bowls,</b> wash basins and ornamentals like ceramic statues. Forming produces a [...] "green" [...] part, ready for drying. Green parts are soft, pliable, and over time will lose shape. Handling the green product will change its shape.

25|$|The double trap siphonic toilet is a {{less common}} type that is {{exceptionally}} quiet when flushed. There is a device known as an aspirator which uses {{the flow of water}} on a flush to suck air from the cavity between the two traps, reducing the air pressure there to create the siphon which sucks water and waste from the <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl.</b> Towards the end of the flush the aspirator ceases being covered in water, thus allowing air into the cavity between traps to break the siphon without the noise while the final flush water fills the pan.|$|E
25|$|In {{many parts}} of Asia, people {{traditionally}} use the toilet in a squatting position. This applies to defecation and urination by males and females. Therefore, homes and public washrooms have squat toilets, with the <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl</b> installed in the floor. This has the advantages of not needing an additional toilet seat and also being more convenient for cultures where people use water to wash their genitals instead of toilet paper. However, Western-style toilets that are mounted at sitting height and which have a plastic seat have become popular as well. Many public washrooms have both squatting and sitting toilets.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{household}} products that contain or can contain H3PO4 are: cleaners for toilet bowls, grout, tile, automobile rims, some general-purpose cleaners/degreasers. Some hair/beauty products and some toothpastes and mouth rinses may contain phosphoric acid. These examples, while {{the amount of}} H3PO4 may be small, still present potential health hazards and should always be handled safely. Additionally, never mix chemicals at home unless {{fully aware of the}} occurring chemical reaction, hazards, and safe-handling precautions necessary to remain safe. In example, the mixing {{of household}} bleach and phosphoric acid from a <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl</b> cleaner can cause the release of highly toxic chlorine gas.|$|E

25|$|Some {{flushometer}} models {{require the}} user to either depress a lever or press a button, which in turn opens a flush valve allowing mains-pressure water to flow directly into the <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl</b> or urinal. Other flushometer models are electronically triggered, using an infrared sensor to initiate the flushing process. Typically, on electronically triggered models, an override button is provided in case the user wishes to manually trigger flushing earlier. Some electronically triggered models also incorporate a true mechanical manual override {{which can be used}} in the event of the failure of the electronic system. In retrofit installations, a self-contained battery-powered or hard-wired unit can be added to an existing manual flushometer to flush automatically when a user departs.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{commonly}} held misconception that when flushed, {{the water in}} a <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl</b> swirls one way if the toilet is north of the equator and the other way if south of the equator, due to the Coriolis effect – usually, counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. In reality, the direction that the water takes is much more determined by the direction that the bowl's rim jets are pointed, and it can be made to flush in either direction in either hemisphere by simply redirecting the rim jets during manufacture. On the scale of bathtubs and toilets, the Coriolis effect is too weak to be observed except under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.|$|E
25|$|In America, the chain-pull indoor toilet was {{introduced}} in the homes of the wealthy and in hotels, soon after its invention in England in the 1880s. Flush toilets were introduced in the 1890s. William Elvis Sloan invented the Flushometer in 1906, which used pressurized water directly from the supply line for faster recycle time between flushes. The Flushometer is still in use today in public restrooms worldwide. The vortex-flushing <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl,</b> which creates a self-cleansing effect, was invented by Thomas MacAvity Stewart of Saint John, New Brunswick in 1907. Philip Haas of Dayton, Ohio, made some significant developments, including the flush rim toilet with multiple jets of water from a ring and the water closet flushing and recycling mechanism similar to those in use today.|$|E
50|$|Another example {{might be}} a water rate - {{possibly}} a flat fee per rating unit that is connected to a central water service, and/or possibly a fee per cubic metre of water provided. A related rate would be a sewage disposal rate, often calculated {{on the basis of}} the number of <b>toilet</b> <b>bowls</b> or urinals present in each rating unit.|$|R
50|$|A {{sitz bath}} may be created simply by filling a bathtub with some water {{and sitting in}} {{it for a few}} minutes. Alternatively, a large basin can be used. There are also special devices that fit into <b>toilet</b> <b>bowls.</b> Sitz baths may either be warm or cool, or {{alternating}} between the two. Substances such as salt, baking soda, or vinegar may be added to the water.|$|R
50|$|Alternative toilet blocks may release {{pleasant}} odor, {{but also}} support {{cleaning and disinfecting}} of <b>toilet</b> <b>bowls</b> and urinals, in contrast to para-dichlorobenzene, which does not have cleaning properties. The block's functionality is enhanced by saturating it with a scenting compound and quaternary ammonium compounds. They {{come in a variety}} of shapes and sizes, and weigh from about 20 grams up to about 100 grams when new.|$|R
25|$|This slip {{is poured}} into the space between plaster of Paris molds. The <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl,</b> rim, tank and tank lid require {{separate}} molds. The molds are assembled and set up for filling and the slip-filled molds sit {{for about an hour}} after filling. This allows the plaster molds to absorb moisture from the slip, which makes it semisolid next to the mold surfaces but lets it remain liquid further {{from the surface of the}} molds. Then, the workers remove plugs to allow any excess liquid slip to drain from the cavities of the mold (this excess slip is recycled for later use). The drained-out slip leaves hollow voids inside the fixture, using less material to keep it both lighter and easier to fire in a kiln. This molding process allows the formation of intricate internal waste lines in the fixture; the drain's hollow cavities are poured out as slip.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl</b> is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the toilet}} parts without their molds look like and {{are about as}} strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which {{includes}} a place to mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Valve holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached {{on top of the}} bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the <b>toilet</b> <b>bowl</b> is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later, {{all the rest of the}} mold pieces are removed. As the clay body dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called greenware.|$|E
50|$|Oxford Services {{was also}} {{pioneering}} {{in its use}} of Blackwater (waste) (Water reclamation) recycling utilising lagoons to treat waste water to a water quality level sufficient for re-use in flushing toilets. However, nitrate levels in the treated water gave it a yellow hue which was deemed undesirable in the facility's <b>toilet</b> <b>bowls</b> and the recycling connection was stopped and the toilets switched to mains water supply.|$|R
50|$|Warm baths are {{recommended}} {{for reducing the}} itching, pain and discomfort associated with conditions such as hemorrhoids and genital problems. An ordinary bathtub can be filled with 3 to 4 in of hot water (about 110 F), and sat in for 15-20 {{minutes or until the}} water cools down. Alternatively, a large basin can be used, and there are specially built devices that fit into <b>toilet</b> <b>bowls.</b>|$|R
