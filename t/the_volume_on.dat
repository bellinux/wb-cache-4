25|$|During {{the late}} twentieth century Assab would become Ethiopia's main port, but it was long overshadowed by nearby Djibouti, whose railway (completed to DireDawa in 1902) {{permitted}} it to quickly supplant traditional caravan-based routes to Assab and Zeila.

Under the direction of co-producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, the Edge pursued more ambient guitar playing, Clayton turned up <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>on</b> his bass, and Mullen experimented with an electronically enhanced drum kit.
