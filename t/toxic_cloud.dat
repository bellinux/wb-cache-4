2500|$|Late in August 1915, Livens left Chatham to join one of {{the newly}} formed Royal Engineer Special Gas Companies where {{he was one of}} very few {{officers}} to have a background in engineering rather than chemistry. At the time, gas warfare was very primitive: heavy cylinders of poison gas were manhandled to the front trenches and their contents simply vented out through metal pipes relying on a breeze to carry the <b>toxic</b> <b>cloud</b> over the enemy trenches. But the wind could be fickle and change in its direction: the first British gas attack at Loos was a disaster.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is the {{determination}} of the consequences produced by an hypothetical accident in the chemical industry over the municipality of Tarragona. At the beginning, it has been chosen some enterprises that may potentially have the most serious accidents on the sector. The enterprises have been chosen according to the recommendation of “Serveis Territorials de Tarragona”. All the basic data used along this work has been taken from “Serveis Territorials de Tarragona”. The first data treatment has been about {{the determination of the}} extension occupied by the <b>toxic</b> <b>clouds</b> made of gas escapement. This labor has been done by means of a software called ALOHA®, which uses Gaussian models to determinate the different propagations of the gases. These models provide information about the concentration and the situation of the displaced clouds. Same software fix thresholds of concentration that are based on clinical studies realized by EPA (environmental protection agency), these studies make us know about the effects of gases over the population Health. These thresholds are called AEGL. Once the dispersion behavior is known, the harmful effects to population are determined using the proxy and probit equations. The proxy equation calculates the concentration inside buildings depending on the external concentration. Second equation is called probit and is used to calculate probabilistic results about the affected population. To determinate the effects over the humans, and according to Serveis Territorials de Tarragona, AEGL thresholds were taken as the average concentration. Thanks to those equations it is checked that there are no victims. The report concludes that there are no victims but the population has been affected. For this reason the last objective is the organization of the urban cores of the municipality. This action pretends to motivate actually and future people to move to zones less dangerous and far away from the <b>toxic</b> <b>clouds</b> ranges. To reach this objective a study about dangerous zones of the municipality has to be done. That analysis has considered the danger of the different zones depending on the number of accidents involved per zones, the number of habitants and the influence of most common winds of the municipality. The sum of all of these factors delineates the safest zones. These zones have been finally consulted on the POUM (municipal urban planning) of Tarragona in order to determinate its viability to guide the urban growth over the safest zone...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, water {{curtains}} {{are often}} employed in industry to contain flammable or <b>toxic</b> <b>clouds</b> due to accidental releases of process fluids (Deaves, 1983; St-Georges et al., 1992). The action of water curtains consists, essentially, in diluting vapour clouds down to safety level from both toxic effect threshold and lower flammability limit (Mc Quaid et al., 1983). The extent of dilution {{depends on the}} effectiveness of the mechanism involved: dispersion enhancement, owing to the air entrainment and the mixing of entrained air with the vapour released; physical absorption of the released gas, eventually joined to chemical reaction; heating of gas clouds (if gas behaving like heavy ones, due to low temperature, are concerned, e. g. cryogenically liquefied LNG or ammonia gas). Recently it has been observed that the effect of mitigation could be increased by the use of a chemical solution giving a non-reversible reaction with the released substance (Griolet et al., 1995). This research programme aims to design and realize the experimental equipment allowing experimenta 1 simulation of water spray curtain interaction with gas plume; to carry out a complete fluidynamic analysis; to evaluate the effect of physical absorption; to evaluate the effect of combined chemical and physical absorption and, finally, to develop a theoretical model, validated by experimental results and useful in scale-up operation...|$|R

5000|$|With the new Overlord {{comes the}} {{familiar}} gaggle of minions, grouped into four different sects that have different abilities and strengths: Browns; Reds; Greens; Blues. The Browns {{are the first}} sect that the Overlord has at his disposal, and frequently the most useful in any direct combat; they are more robust and can take much more damage than any other minion group, though they are susceptible to fire and poison and they drown in water higher than the Overlord's knee. Reds are the ranged attackers, hurling fireballs at enemies, combustibles and explosives; they have the added ability to remove flame from obstacles and can traverse through fiery obstacles without harm. The Greens are stealth attackers that become invisible if they are stationary, and while close to useless in a direct confrontation (without Browns), they are devastating if planted along a patrols path or if directed to attack an enemy from behind; they are also regarded as the least hygienic group, which somehow makes them immune to poison, allowing them to remove toxic obstacles and walk through <b>toxic</b> <b>clouds.</b> The Blues are medics, virtually non-combative entities that cannot participate in a melee situation alone without sustaining severe casualties, but their ability to resurrect fallen minions makes them valuable; their additional abilities include [...] "blinking," [...] removing magical ooze, swimming and an immunity to magic attacks.|$|R

50|$|Aplysia {{species were}} {{once thought to}} use ink to escape from predators, much like the octopus. Instead, recent {{research}} {{has made it clear}} that these sea slugs are able to produce and secrete toxic “substances such as ammonia” in self-defense. The ability of the Aplysia species to hold toxins within their bodies without poisoning itself is a result of the unique way that the toxin is stored within the slug. Different molecules essential to the creation of the toxin are accumulated in separate parts of the body of the slug, rendering them benign, as only the mixing of all the molecules can result in a <b>toxic</b> chemical <b>cloud.</b> When the sea hare feels threatened it immediately begins the process of defending itself by mixing the distinct molecules in an additional part of the body used specifically for that purpose.
