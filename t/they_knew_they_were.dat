5|$|While {{producing}} {{their second}} DVD Disasterpieces in 2002, {{the band members}} of Slipknot were inspired to produce a live album after noticing how well they performed when <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being recorded. Two years later, in 2004, Slipknot promoted Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) during a world tour which included 233 concerts across 34 countries in 28 months; music for the live album was recorded during the tour. The tracks on 9.0: Live were compiled from performances in Singapore, Tokyo, Osaka, Las Vegas, Phoenix, New York City, and Dallas.|$|E

During a number of simulated raids on the United States carried out by Strategic Air Command during the period 1947–1949, defending F-51 Mustangs and F-47 Thunderbolts, being used as interceptors, repeatedly failed to find the incoming bombers, even when <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> on their way, and seldom got themselves into position to shoot them down. Furthermore, when they did so, the bombers (usually B-29 Superfortresses) had already made their runs over the intended targets of New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago and St. Louis.|$|E
500|$|The crew {{issued a}} casting {{call for the}} main roles in the series, with both Keating and Billingsley making {{immediate}} impressions on the casting director and staff. Braga said that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> right for those roles [...] "right off the bat". Keating had previously auditioned for a role on Voyager two years prior, but Berman wanted to keep him for a future main role, saying that when he auditioned for Reed that the actor [...] "nailed it", although there were discussions about the accent he should be using with Keating suggesting one from the North of England but the producers mistook it for Scottish. In the end, they chose to go with Keating's natural voice. He also praised the casting processes involving Trinneer, Park and Billingsley, calling the latter [...] "perfect" [...] {{in his role as}} Doctor Phlox. Park wasn't required to audition, but instead was hired on the basis of her performance in a scene she appeared in The WB series Popular alongside Anthony Montgomery – despite that the character was intended to be older until Park was cast. Montgomery had previously auditioned to play Tuvok's son in Voyager, and after being chosen for the part of Travis Mayweather, he elected to take the part instead of a role in a low budget movie he had been offered.|$|E

2500|$|Nearly {{thirty years}} {{after the release of}} Blaze of Glory, Harvard {{professor}} Stephen Burt described it as [...] "true to the wordy awkwardness... of the nerd stereotype, and yet true to the visceral power, the sexual charge, in guitar-based Anglo-American pop. The songs, and the people depicted in the songs, attempted to have fun, to act on instinct, but <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> too cerebral to make it so, except with like-minded small circles of puzzle-solvers." ...|$|E
2500|$|One round {{passed between}} Kemp's {{shoulder}} and head upon which Kemp stated he wet himself although {{on another occasion}} he later claimed {{this may have been}} due to a split water pouch. Kemp [...] "went straight down, cutting my face as I hit the ground." [...] The crew were pinned down by accurate fire from AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), with five to seven RPGs flying over their heads by just a metre and bullets passing inches from their heads and hitting the ground either side of them. It was speculated that a sniper had targeted Kemp possibly because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> journalists, or because their blue protective clothing looked unusual, and the camera may have looked like a weapon. The crew were pinned down for [...] "about seven to ten minutes" [...] with return fire commencing after [...] "three or four minutes" [...] after the soldiers had got into cover. Only after fierce return fire and a delay of three or four minutes could the crew be extracted.|$|E

2500|$|The Kanins {{rented a}} house in Malibu for their honeymoon, and after buying an A. J. Liebling New Yorker short story about a {{boarding}} house for boxers, they spent [...] {{the next six months}} writing the adaptation, Sunday Punch (1942). <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> on the track to a partnership when MGM bought the screenplay. [...] "We would make a story outline together with rather detailed descriptions of the scenes. Then we divided up the writing, each taking the scenes we felt strongly about. Then [...] {{one or the other of}} us would put it all together into a single draft. We did find a common voice, though we had different strengths. As an artist, Michael brought a great visual sense to the process. I was a people person who loved the characters and the dialogue. Through the collaboration, we learned a lot from each other and about each other. But the time came when I felt as if we were together 48 hours a day. Writing with someone else always requires some degree of compromise, as does marriage. When it came down to the question of which would survive, the marriage or the writing partnership, it was a pretty easy decision. But I [...] remember that it was a challenge convincing the powers that be that we had been successful writers individually and would be again. We were hyphenated in people's minds: Fay-and-Michael Kanin. To again become Fay Kanin and Michael Kanin took some doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{dispersion}} of power, though seen by many, then and later, {{as a major}} weakness of the Republic, was actually the foundation stone of De Witt's political system, that he called de Ware Vrijheid (the [...] "True Freedom"). We have already seen that De Witt primarily defended Oldenbarnevelt's and Grotius' claim to supremacy of (Holland's) provincial sovereignty over {{the sovereignty of the}} Generality under this moniker. But the doctrine went further. [...] "True Freedom" [...] implied the rejection of an [...] "eminent head", not only of the federal state (where it would have conflicted with provincial sovereignty), but also of the provincial political system. De Witt considered Princes and Potentates as such, as detrimental to the public good, because of their inherent tendency to waste tax payer's money on military adventures in search of glory and useless territorial aggrandizement. As the province of Holland only abutted friendly territory, the Holland regents had no territorial designs themselves, and they looked askance at such designs by the other provinces, because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> likely to have to foot the bill anyway. The Republic therefore from time to time threw its weight around in the German principalities to the East, but always to protect strategic interests, not for territorial gain. Likewise, after the dispute over the Overmaas territory (which still had been left over from the Munster treaty) was settled with the partition treaty of 1661 with Spain, there were no further territorial claims in the Southern Netherlands, till after the War of Spanish Succession fundamentally changed the strategic situation.|$|E
