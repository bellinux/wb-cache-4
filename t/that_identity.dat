As the first black-Native sculptor of either sex to achieve international recognition within a western sculptural tradition, Lewis was a symbolic and social anomaly within a dominantly white bourgeois and aristocratic community.|$|E
25|$|According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006):...the {{development}} of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised {{in a community of}} similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support <b>that</b> <b>identity.</b> Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|As {{with any}} other ethnic {{identity}}, Jewish identity is, to some degree, a matter of either claiming <b>that</b> <b>identity</b> or being perceived by others (both {{inside and outside the}} ethnic group) as belonging to that group, or both. Returning again to the example of Madeleine Albright– during her Catholic childhood, her being in some sense Jewish was presumably irrelevant. It was only after she was nominated to be Secretary of State that she, and the public, discovered her Jewish ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Turkey {{does not}} appear to be the scene of {{large-scale}} or overt expressions of racism against individuals in the strictest sense of term. However, one of the main challenges facing Turkey in the field of ECRI's (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) concerns would appear to be the need to reconcile the strong sense of national identity and the wish to preserve the unity and integrity of the State with the right of different minority groups within Turkey to express their own sense of ethnic identity, for example through the maintenance and development of linguistic and cultural aspects of <b>that</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Akha {{are often}} {{classified}} by the Chinese government {{as part of}} the Hani, an official national minority. The Akha are closely related to the Hani, but consider themselves a distinct group and often resist being subsumed under <b>that</b> <b>identity.</b> In Thailand, they are classified as one of the six hill tribes, a term used for all of the various tribal peoples who migrated from China and Tibet over the past few centuries and who now inhabit the dense forests on the borders between Thailand, Laos, and Burma. Few Akha in Thailand are citizens and most are registered as aliens. There is an oft cited lack of political or state infrastructure to address Akha, or any other indigenous issues in Thailand.|$|E

50|$|In {{a similar}} vein, Gilles Deleuze's Difference and Repetition (1968) {{was an attempt}} to think {{difference}} as having an ontological privilege over identity, inverting the traditional relationship between those two concepts and implying <b>that</b> <b>identities</b> are only produced through processes of differentiation.|$|R
40|$|Some {{theories}} contend <b>that</b> national <b>identity</b> {{is dependent}} and contingent on having others. However, other theories suggest <b>that</b> national <b>identity</b> {{is based on}} traits that {{all members of the}} group share. These two competing ideas, called relational and unifying characters respectively, are explored using the two border cites of Niagara Falls, Canada and Niagara Falls, the United States. I argue <b>that</b> each national <b>identity</b> present, the Canadian and American, represent the two characters and <b>that</b> national <b>identity</b> {{can be viewed as a}} spectrum.

25|$|Working through {{abandonment}} {{depression is}} a complicated, lengthy and conflicted {{process that can}} be an enormously painful experience {{in terms of what}} is remembered and what must be felt. It involves mourning and grieving for the loss of the illusion that the patient had adequate support for the emergence of the real self. There is also a mourning for the loss of an identity, the false self, which the person constructed and with which he or she has negotiated much of his or her life. The dismantling of the false self requires relinquishing the only way that the patient has ever known of how to interact with others. This interaction was better than not to have a stable, organized experience of the self, no matter how false, defensive, or destructive <b>that</b> <b>identity</b> may be.|$|E
25|$|There {{were rumors}} that Dmitry was an illegitimate {{son of the}} Polish king, Stefan Batory, who had reigned from 1575 to 1586; {{according}} to a later tale, Dmitry blurted out <b>that</b> <b>identity</b> when once slapped by a violent master. Dmitry's own story was that the Tsar Ivan's widow his mother, anticipating Boris Godunov's assassination attempt, had given the young tsarevich into {{the care of a}} doctor, who placed him in various Russian monasteries through the years. After the doctor's death, Dmitry had then fled to Poland, working there as a teacher for a brief time, before being accepted into the service of the Wisniowieckis. Several of those who had known Ivan IV claimed later that Dmitry did indeed resemble the young tsarevich; further, the young man also displayed aristocratic tendencies, such as horsemanship and literacy, and was fluent in Russian, Polish, and French.|$|E
25|$|Members of the {{hedgehog}} family {{play key}} roles {{in a wide}} variety of developmental processes. One of the best studied examples is the action of Sonic hedgehog during development of the vertebrate limb. The classic experiments of Saunders and Gasseling in 1968 on the development of the chick limb bud formed the basis of the morphogen concept. They showed <b>that</b> <b>identity</b> of the digits in the chick limb was determined by a diffusible factor produced by the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), a small region of tissue at the posterior margin of the limb. Mammalian development appeared to follow the same pattern. This diffusible factor was later shown to be Sonic hedgehog. However, precisely how SHH determines digit identity remained elusive until recently. The current model, proposed by Harfe et al., states that both the concentration and the time of exposure to SHH determines which digit the tissue will develop into in the mouse embryo (figure 6).|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, even granted the above, {{it does not}} follow <b>that</b> <b>identity</b> {{theories}} of all types must be abandoned. According to token identity theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state. The type–token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example: the word [...] "green" [...] contains four types of letters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter e along with one each of the others.|$|E
500|$|Boys Don't Cry {{has been}} widely {{discussed}} and analyzed by scholars and others. Roger Ebert described the film as a [...] "romantic tragedy" [...] embedded in a working class American setting, calling it [...] "Romeo and Juliet set in a Nebraska trailer park". Philosopher Rebecca Hanrahan argued {{that the question of}} identity—particularly Brandon's—is alluded to frequently in Boys Don't Cry and that Peirce poses the nature of identification and self as the film's main question. Journalist Janet Maslin said the film is about accepting identity, which in turn means accepting the fate predisposed for <b>that</b> <b>identity.</b> Paula Nechak called the film a [...] "bold cautionary tale"; she regarded the film as a negative, dismal depiction of Midwestern America, writing that [...] " [...] captured the mystique and eerie loneliness" [...] and [...] "isolation of the Midwest, with its dusty desolation and nowhere-to-go frustration that propels people to violence and despair".|$|E

500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated <b>that</b> <b>identity</b> in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E
