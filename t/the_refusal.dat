40|$|The Existence of Social Distance in Refusals Delivered by Children Characters in the Novel Entitled “The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas” (A Pragmatics Study) Putu Antalis Denita 1 Prof. Dr. Djatmika, M. A 2 ABSTRACT This {{research}} {{was presented to}} encounter refusal expressions conveyed by children characters in the novel entitled The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas in which those are influenced by social distance. It explained <b>the</b> types of <b>refusal</b> expression, analyzed <b>the</b> way of social distance affects <b>the</b> <b>refusals,</b> and examined <b>the</b> reason of social distance influences <b>the</b> <b>refusals</b> uttered by children to refuse an action. The research applied pragmatics study. It was a descriptive qualitative research which took purposive sampling technique. The data of the research were the dialogues in the novel The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas which contained refusal expressions influenced by social distance. They were categorized in Takahashi and Weltz’s theory of refusal expressions and Thomas’s theory of indirectness factor, namely social distance. The research found out three findings. First, particular types and strategies of refusal are affected by social distance. The speakers tend to use a direct refusal completed with a direct command, the expression of thanking, {{and the use of}} reasoning to express <b>the</b> <b>refusals</b> when they have close relationship. Meanwhile, the speakers tend to employ an indirect <b>refusal</b> in uttering <b>the</b> <b>refusals</b> in order to show positive face of the interlocutor combined with a reason, telling, questioning, stating a tag question, giving an opinion, and asking permission in uttering <b>the</b> <b>refusals</b> when they have distance relationship. Social distance strongly influences <b>the</b> choice of <b>refusal,</b> but there are also other factors, namely power and solidarity. The second finding shows that there are three types of refusal expression used by the characters to perform refusal, namely direct refusal, indirect refusal, adjunct to refusal. Direct refusal contains non performative statement and mitigated willingness; indirect refusal consists of repetition of part of request, excuse/reason/explanation, topic switch, criticize the request/requester, and adjunct to refusal includes in pause fillers. The third finding describes that the use of certain types and strategies of refusal influenced by social distance have several reasons. The reasons are to show an easy conversation, to perform respect, and to express politeness. 1 Student of English Department/ NIM C 1312015 2 Thesis Superviso...|$|R

Adherents to this claim believed that South Vietnam could have been saved by another U.S. bombing campaign. The conflict between the executive and legislative branches of the American government, already severe before the onset of the Operation Linebacker II in 1972, was only more exasperating during 1975, when a new campaign would probably only have provoked even more Congressional outrage.|$|E

Troops were assembled at Constance, but an attack did not occur. Until July, nothing of significance happened along the whole front.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. <b>The</b> <b>refusal</b> of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met.

Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm the resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms.|$|E

He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of Gough Whitlam, which took power in 1972.
