5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, the most compelling reason against its adoption arguably being <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing {{of public and private}} interests, and political and social interests.|$|E

As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> include intensive rehabilitation training programs for the disadvantaged persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.|$|E
5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} crime was committed. Some courts have held that it does. Others have held <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E

5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha {{spent his}} days near the hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, he spent his time scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} the sage Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha waited in that forest for Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the tale to be a later interpolation arguing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear in all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E

Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E

5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> damage cells {{and can be}} safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) {{but the use of}} the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
