40|$|This paper {{provides}} an outlook for <b>the</b> Indian <b>economy</b> in <b>the</b> {{light of the}} extraordinary global financial crisis, that started in the US, but which has now transformed into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. <b>The</b> Indian <b>economy</b> was slowing down even {{before the onset of}} global crisis and so the timing of this external shock could not have been worse. The analysis undertaken for this paper shows that the global crisis is likely to bring the Indian GDP growth rate down considerably. This will pose a big challenge requiring urgent and sustained policy attention to prevent this downturn from becoming unnecessarily prolonged. There is real downside risk that the growth rate could plummet to the pre- 1980 s levels if appropriate countercyclical measures are not taken immediately and are not urgently followed by necessary structural reforms. The paper provides a short-term forecast for GDP growth based on a model of leading economic indicators. We present three scenarios in the paper assuming differentiated impact of the external crisis.

40|$|The {{problem of}} this study is “what are the reasons {{underlying}} pre-mature marriage practices of Jane in Lady Jane viewed from sociological approach” and the aim {{of this study}} is to analyze the movie based on its structural elements. The research is conducted by using qualitative method. In this method, the research uses two data sources, namely primary and secondary data sources. The primary data is Lady Jane movie directed by Trevor Nunn and David Edgar and Chris Bryant as the screen writer. The secondary data sources are books and internet website, which are related to the analysis. Technique of the data collection is library research. Based on the analysis, the writer draws some conclusions as follows: Trevor Nunn criticizes social structure of English society that is dominated by the upper class and also creates the character of Jane to symbolize the attitude of the upper class that there are practices of pre-mature marriage in the England Kingdom. The reasons underlying premature marriage practices of Jane are: In the social aspects, that the parents of Jane and Guilford want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> high social status to give Jane marriage with Guilford.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Business Science in Financial Economics at Strathmore UniversityThis paper examines the impact of quantitative easing (QE) by the Federal Reserve (Fed) which started in November 2008 on Kenya's bond market. In {{the wake of the}} global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve used several rounds of QE <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> back on track. In this, the Fed started growing its balance sheet by purchasing government bonds and mortgage-backed securities using central bank money with the aim of injecting money into the economy and boost nominal spending. Over the period from November 2008, the Fed purchased 3. 5 trillion dollars of assets, significantly increasing its balance sheet. This paper attempts {{to assess the impact of}} these large scale asset purchases (LSAPs) on Kenya's treasury bills yields. This is motivated by empirical evidence indicating that QE purchases reduced long-term US government bond yields. This paper therefore undertakes to find the impact on developing countries' bond markets, specifically Kenya. US money supply and Kenya 182 day treasury bills are the variables of choice for this study. Increase in US money supply is taken to indicate the Fed's LSAPs. Using time series analysis, we conduct vector auto regression and co-integration tests to establish the presence of a relationship and therefore assess the impact. The results indicated the presence of a long term relationship between Federal Reserve's LSAPS and Kenya treasury bills...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} fiscal {{consolidation}} and sustainability {{is one of}} the key macroeconomic issues confronting Indian economy. This paper attempts to understand India's current fiscal situation, its likely future development, and its impact on <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> in <b>the</b> context of a weak global recovery from the current crisis. The impact of the global crisis has been transmitted to <b>the</b> Indian <b>economy</b> through three distinct channels, namely: the financial sector, exports, and exchange rates. The other significant channel of impact is the slump in business and consumer confidence leading to decrease in investment and consumption demand. The Indian government, to boost the demand, has announced several stimulus packages. However, there is not much room for further fiscal policy action as the consolidated fiscal deficit of the central and state governments in 2009 - 2010 is already about 11 % of the gross domestic product (GDP). Any further increase in the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio could invite a sharp downgrading of India's credit rating and a loss of business confidence. The paper reviews the existing theories on the relationship between fiscal deficit and growth. It also analyzes the past trends and policy measures to understand the possible implications for economic recovery and long run growth in the Indian context. It also provides a long-term forecast of the fiscal deficit and public debt burden based on the past trends. Finally, the paper suggests a set of policy measures <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>economy</b> back on <b>the</b> path of sustained rapid and inclusive growth. indian public finance; global financial crisis; deficit forecasts; fiscal policies...|$|R

The Territory is struggling to overcome a triple crisis: the end of French nuclear experimentations in the mid- 1990 s and of all the large subsidies that it conveyed; the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) that hit tourism hard and which is estimated to provide around three-quarters of all self-generated revenues and, ten years of political turmoil with as many governments in as many years or so. The political rise of the Tavini Huiraatira (Polynesian Liberation Front) to the Presidency in 2004 and the repudiation of the Bolliet report which was to condition French subsidies to budget stringency in the early 2010 did not help either, convincing the French to maintain full-fledged financial support, leaving Polynesia with no choice but to appeal for foreign direct investments (FDIs) <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> back on track.

40|$|The {{subprime}} mortgage {{crisis has}} become somewhat a synonymous terminology with the mainstream media what with the economic debacle it had caused the world over. Vastly regarded as the catalyst to the plummeting United States economy at its lowest ebb in 2007, the calamity soon escalated to other global capital markets {{around the world and}} gradually depleting the regional economy considerably. What was preliminarily perceived as an innocuous setback to the U. S mortgage market had then escalated with a sizeable magnitude as the world faces the worst economic recession since the great depression in the 1930 s when the stock market crashed in October 1929. The money market was severely impaired and many countries experienced considerable decline in their trading performances. Tantamount to that, the unemployment rate also peaks at its highest since 1983 while the global real Gross Domestic Products (GDP) and personal income show constant decline as the deteriorating state of economy persisted. Several perplexing questions and problems in relation to the subprime crisis will be assessed and substantiated to uncover the underlying issues. The weak regulatory structures and oversight as well as the financial governance faux pas are believed to be the root cause of the calamity. Whatever the bane of the crisis is, the main concern is whether the authority has done enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> back on track.

Meanwhile, reforms have been deeper and more enduring in Japan as strong political leadership eventually emerged to overcome political and bureaucratic resistance. ^ To explain the very different picture a decade after crisis, this dissertation analyzes divergent reform outcomes in Korea and Japan by taking seriously political leadership and its relationship with other key political variables. In particular, the short presidential cycle in Korea due to five-year single-term presidency, combined with a strong bureaucracy, leads to a cyclical process of presidential reform initiatives followed by their reliance on bureaucratic ideas and capacities to manage challenges in the implementation phase. This pattern of bargaining between political leadership and bureaucrats shows how initial success in recovering from the crisis lost its momentum for deeper reforms. Japan 2 ̆ 7 s belated response to a crisis with weak political leadership and a strong bureaucracy made people skeptical about the prospect of successful reforms. The very delayed response, however, with the bureaucracy tainted with a series of scandals paradoxically laid the ground for the strong leadership of Koizumi that transformed the old regime more successfully than anyone had anticipated. The paradox of political leadership shows the perils of strong presidency for deeper reform. ...|$|E
5000|$|The actual {{gameplay}} {{is quite}} simple. Players need {{to finish in}} the top ten positions in each race {{to qualify for the}} next one. There is a map that shows the course layout, the position of the players, and the position of the car in first place. The player is given 6 [...] "nitro boosts" [...] at the start which dramatically increase the car's speed {{for a short period of}} time. On certain courses, there are pickups along the road ranging from a [...] "$" [...] which is $1,000 cash, a [...] "N" [...] which is an extra [...] "nitro boost", and a [...] "S" [...] which is an automatic nitro administered right when picked up and returns each lap. The other pickups can only be collected once per race. Players must take care to avoid too much damage to any area of the armor. If a section of armor is destroyed and the player takes damage in the area that the destroyed section of the armor used to protect, the car will spin out. Racers will be disqualified if they run out of fuel and coast to a stop before finishing the race. Since there are no pits for cars to refuel in unlike the first game, upgrading the transmission becomes mandatory in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> fuel <b>economy</b> needed <b>to</b> survive the longer races in the later portions of the game. Since the Genesis port of this game does not implement a fuel gauge, fuel economy is not a problem in that port.|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} 1970 - 1989 the {{phenomenon}} of long-term unemployment in Sweden is almost non-existent. In connection with the economic crisis in the 1990 s the unemployment rate raised to a record. The unemployment rate fell slightly during the following decade but has since gone back to former low levels. In the TCO study Raiders of super labor force from 2009 participated 1885 workplaces in the country from both {{the private and public}} sectors. The statistics speak for themselves when it revealed that almost half of managers were fairly or very negative disposed towards recruit long-term unemployed persons. At the same time the changes in unemployment benefits is in form of deterioration for those who are furthest away from jobs, which means that these persons are deteriorating In Margaret Bolinder dissertation The importance of space for negotiating for unemployed persons experiences, strategies, for action and chances for obtaining a job from 2006 it becomes clear that these changes have no impact on the unemployed workers expectations of finding a job, job opportunities, search behavior or interest rates and that they would make the unemployed more quickly get a work. Behind each number and percentage, there is a person and it is them I wanted to let be heard in this study. The purpose of my study was to examine how the four long-term unemployed women experience their situation in society today. The data were obtained through interviews where I have had access to women's experiences of their situation as long-term unemployed. The results in my study showed {{that the vast majority of}} the women felt that control over their own life was low, resulting in a feeling of powerlessness. In the meetings with non-unemployed people experienced respondents often that these persons looked down on them because of their unemployment, and that they lacked understanding of their situation or could not be bothered <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved. <b>The</b> bad <b>economy</b> was one of the main reasons that women wanted a job and it heard to the women's daily lives have to refrain from things such as dentist visits.
