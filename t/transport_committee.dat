It said if the station could not be adapted, the government needed to look for alternative solutions.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, {{the debate}} about the ferry arose again. The bridge would {{necessarily}} terminate the car ferry service, but many locals wanted to keep a passenger ferry, which would provide faster service between Bergen and Kleppestø than the buses could. A public meeting held on 1 November 1977 established the Information Panel For the Askøy Bridge which demanded that the bridge not yet be built and the ferry service remain. Within a week they presented a report to the county municipality's <b>transport</b> <b>committee,</b> but were not able to convince the committee to instruct the toll company to work to retain a passenger ferry service. Protests were also made by parents at Lyderhorn School and Nybø School in Bergen, which were both located along the roads which were proposed used to connect to the bridge. The issue was discussed in the county council on 14 December. The council voted principally in favor of a bridge, but did not give any grants. It also did not prioritize between the Askøy Bridge and the planned Nordhordland Bridge.|$|E
25|$|The PS2 {{followed}} the PD2 Titan in having the 125bhp 9.8-litre O600 engine {{and a new}} synchromesh gearbox. With changes to rules on width and length there were numerous {{different versions of the}} home market PS2 based on permutations of width and length, whether built with or without a rear dropped frame and whether reconstructed from short-wheelbase chassis or built new to the longer wheelbase. PS2/1, 3, 5 and 7 had a 17ft 6in wheelbase for 27ft 6in bodywork. PS2/10, 11, 12, 12A, 13, 13A, 14 and 15 had a longer wheelbase of 18ft 9in for 30ft long coachwork (but see later about the six-wheel PS2/10 and /11). The entire home market Tiger range was vacuum-braked and PS2s for the UK had the synchromesh gearbox only, whilst the Titan PD2 had a number of options including constant-mesh, AEC preselector and Pneumocyclic. The last new PS2 coaches entered service in 1953 with West Riding Automobile Company, and the last home-market customer for the Tiger PS2 bus was the Burnley, Colne and Nelson Joint <b>Transport</b> <b>Committee,</b> their last arrived in 1955 and put in 20 years and more of work, thus being the last half-cab single deckers on normal service in the UK.|$|E

500|$|A {{task force}} {{was set up}} in July 2013 by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson to look at {{improvements}} to the London road network, including the South Circular and North Circular. The plans included putting the road in a series of tunnels. [...] This would free up space on the surface, providing public space and extensive cycle routes and improving the linkage of existing communities currently severed by the busy road. Caroline Pidgeon, deputy chair of the London Assembly's <b>Transport</b> <b>Committee,</b> responded, [...] "It doesn't make sense and it won't add up – [...] £30bn estimate, but I'm sure it'll cost at least double that, and the reality is we'll lose homes around these roads and so on." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1955 the Passenger group, that is {{the section}} {{representing}} those working in Passenger Transport, of the local branch of the Transport and General Workers Union had passed a resolution that [...] "coloured workers should not be employed as bus crews" [...] by the Bristol Omnibus Company. The Bristol Evening Post ran {{a series of articles}} in 1961 exposing this colour bar. The union publicly denied the bar, but the company general manager, Ian Petey, did admit it.
