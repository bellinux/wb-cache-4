Among other notable MPs who failed to hold on <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> were former Minister for Agriculture Juha Korkeaoja of the Centre Party, the vice-chairman of the Centre Party Timo Kaunisto and Marja Tiura of the NCP, who had been elected with {{the highest number of}} votes for a female candidate in the 2007 election.|$|E
5|$|Of the 234 {{members of}} the House, Breckinridge was among the 80 that were {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> for the Thirty-third Congress. Due to his increased seniority, {{he was assigned to}} the more prestigious Ways and Means Committee, but he was not given a committee chairmanship as many had expected. Although he supported Pierce's pro-slavery agenda on the principle of states' rights and believed that secession was legal, he opposed secession as a remedy to the country's immediate problems. This, coupled with his earlier support of manumission and African colonization, balanced his support for slavery; most still considered him a moderate legislator.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} was conducted using the {{single transferable vote}} applied to six-seat constituencies, each of which corresponds to a UK parliamentary seat. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister were chosen by the largest parties from the two different political designations.

25|$|When {{dining out}} in a restaurant, the {{customers}} are guided <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> by the host. The honored or eldest guest will usually be seated {{at the center of}} the table farthest from the entrance. In the home, the most important guest is also seated farthest away from the entrance. If there is a tokonoma, or alcove, in the room, the guest is seated in front of it. The host sits next to or closest to the entrance.|$|E
25|$|Students are {{not allowed}} to {{critique}} others, talk during the arrangement process, or stand and walk around the room. Participants must follow the sensei after each arrangement inspection. If there are questions, students must raise a hand, though {{it is not uncommon for}} only an assistant to have permission to interrupt the sensei. The sensei will end class when everyone has been critiqued. At this time, students will report back <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> and assist with cleaning the space.|$|E
25|$|Communion {{practices}} and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice {{is to have}} small cups of juice and plates of broken bread distributed to the seated congregation. In other congregations, communicants may proceed to the altar to receive the elements, then return <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats.</b> A widely accepted practice is for all to receive and hold the elements until everyone is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, music is performed and Scripture is read during the receiving of the elements.|$|E

25|$|Ten {{seats on}} the Northern Ireland Executive were filled by the new Assembly on 16 May {{according}} to party strength under the d'Hondt method of proportional representation.

The inquest heard that a flight attendant was found alive by a farmer's wife, but died before her discoverer could summon help.

25|$|After the {{downfall}} of Marcos, all local government unit executives in the Philippines were ordered by President Corazon Aquino to vacate their posts. Some local executives were ordered to return <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> {{as in the case}} of Mayor Ludovico Espinosa of Dasol, where he claims he joined the UNIDO, Mrs. Aquino's party during the height of the EDSA Revolution. Fidel Ramos was appointed as AFP Chief of Staff and later as Defense Secretary replacing Juan Ponce Enrile. Oscar Orbos, a congressman from Bani, Pangasinan, was appointed by Aquino as head of the Department of Transportation and Communications and later as Executive Secretary.|$|E
5000|$|A {{protracted}} political trial {{before the}} Assembly Committee on the Judiciary followed {{to determine the}} fitness of the five Socialists <b>to</b> take <b>their</b> <b>seats,</b> which ran throughout the winter and spring. The so-called [...] "trial" [...] began on January 20, 1920. Morris Hillquit and Seymour Stedman were the lead attorneys in handling {{the case for the}} Socialist defendants.

If the Minority Leader's party takes control of the House, and the party officers are all re-elected <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats,</b> the Minority Leader is usually the party's top choice for Speaker for the next Congress, while the Minority Whip is typically in line to become Majority Leader. The Minority Leader usually meets with the Majority Leader and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial issues.|$|E
25|$|Canopies {{for each}} cardinal-elector were once used during conclaves—a sign of equal dignity. After the new Pope accepts his election, {{he would give}} his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug on a rope {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> to lower their canopies. Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. Paul VI abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, {{the population of the}} College of Cardinals had increased so much {{to the point that they}} would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals in the back row.|$|E
25|$|At {{the state}} level, West Virginia's {{politics}} were largely {{dominated by the}} Democratic Party from the Great Depression through the 2000s. This was a legacy of West Virginia's very strong tradition of union membership. Since 2000, state elections have become more competitive at {{both the state and}} federal levels. After the 2014 midterm elections, Democrats controlled the governorship, the majority of statewide offices, and one U.S. Senate seat, while Republicans held one U.S. Senate seat, all three of the state's U.S. House seats, and a majority in both houses of the West Virginia Legislature. In the 2016 elections, the Republicans held on <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> and made gains in the State Senate and gained three statewide offices.|$|E

25|$|Three escapees giddily {{reach the}} outside, but Arden catches Shelley, who had distracted a patrolling {{attendant}} by performing oral sex on him. Grace, Kit, and Lana discuss {{heading for the}} main road where Lana is told she will be on her own at that point. In the dayroom, Thredson notices and reports the empty chairs. The Raspers, who are revealed to be humanoid, force the three escapees to return inside the asylum tunnel, where they stumble upon the dead Mexican and other corpses. Mary Eunice fetches a sobering Jude to tell her of the escape. Jude shuts the movie, and any other future group events, down, telling the group they can thank the missing sexual deviant, the Mexican, and Pepper (Naomi Grossman) for the disruption. Lana, Grace, and Kit, although shivering and wet, have returned <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
25|$|At 6:35 a.m., the {{helicopters}} approached {{the area where}} O'Grady's signal beacon had been traced. The pilots saw bright yellow smoke coming from trees near a rocky pasture where O'Grady had set off a flare. The first Stallion, commanded by Major William Tarbutton, touched down and 20 Marines jumped off the aircraft {{and set up a}} defensive perimeter. As the second Sea Stallion landed, a figure with a pistol {{who turned out to be}} the missing pilot appeared running towards the Marines and immediately went to the Sea Stallion. As the side door opened, he was pulled in before the second 20 Marines poised to leave by the rear ramp could even move. They were called back <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats,</b> and those who had formed the defensive perimeter reboarded the other helicopter. After a quick head count, the Stallions took off. They had been on the ground no more than seven minutes.|$|E
25|$|Williams also {{reached the}} semifinals of the Tier I Tennis Masters Series tournament in Indian Wells, California, where she {{controversially}} defaulted her match with sister Serena {{just before the}} match started. Venus had been suffering from knee tendinitis throughout the tournament and eventually this prevented her from playing. The following day, Venus and her father Richard were booed {{as they made their}} way <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> to watch the final. Serena was subsequently booed during the final with Kim Clijsters and during the trophy presentation. Due to this, neither Williams sister entered the tournament for 14 years, with Serena entering in 2015 after appeals for forgiveness from the event and the WTA Tour. Venus rebounded from the Indian Wells 'boycott' controversy to win the next tournament on the tour calendar, the Tier I Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne, Florida. She defeated Hingis in the semifinals and World No. 4 Jennifer Capriati in the final, after saving eight championship points. Because of this victory, her ranking rose to a career high of World No. 2.|$|E

25|$|The church conducts regular worship services, one {{during the}} week, and one during the weekend, {{conducted}} in the local languages (providing sign language interpreters and translators in some congregations). It consists of singing of hymns, prayers, studies of the bible, collection of voluntary offerings, and benediction. Both God the Father and Jesus are worshiped. The ministers of every congregation in a given worship service use the same sermon outline prepared by the executive minister. Deacons and Deaconesses guide worshipers <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> and collect voluntary offerings. The singing of hymns {{is led by the}} locale's choir. The first hymnbook, termed as Ang Himnario ng Iglesia Ni Cristo, which consists about 300+ songs, was published in 1937. Children worship services (Tagalog: Pagsamba ng Kabataan or PNK) are held every weekend. They use similar lessons as the standard worship services taught using the Socratic method (question and answer). The church teaches that willfully forsaking the worship service is a grievous sin, thus members are expected to attend the congregational worship services twice a week without fail.|$|E

The Democrats {{countered by}} nominating outgoing Governor Beckham. Though the Democrats had a majority in the General Assembly, seven Democratic legislators refused to vote for Beckham because he favored Prohibition. Instead, they voted for other candidates, leaving no one with a majority. As balloting continued over the course of two months with no winner, some Democrats urged Beckham to withdraw in favor of a more palatable candidate. He refused, and after twenty-nine ballots, four Democrats who favored Bradley's [...] "wet" [...] position defied allegiance to their party, electing him by a 64–60 margin. None of the four were re-elected <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> in the legislature, though one eventually became Bradley's private secretary.|$|E
