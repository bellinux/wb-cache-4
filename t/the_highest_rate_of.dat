5|$|The Holderness {{coastline}} suffers <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> {{coastal erosion}} in Europe: 2 metres {{a year on}} average or 2million tonnes of material a year. Some of this is transported by longshore drift with about 3% of material being deposited at Spurn Head spit, to the south. The coastline has retreated noticeably in the last 2,000 years, with many former settlements now flooded, particularly Ravenser Odd and Ravenspurn, which was a major port until its destruction in the 14th century. Erosion is an ongoing concern in the area. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council has been carrying out cliff erosion defences between Sewerby and Kilnsea since 1951. The Holderness area drains mostly into the Humber and the eponymous River Hull drains the area north of Hull.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan.

5|$|Population {{studies from}} {{numerous}} {{areas in the}} world have shown that HHT occurs at roughly the same rate in almost all populations: somewhere around 1 in 5000. In some areas, it is much more common; for instance, in the French region of Haut Jura the rate is 1:2351 - twice as common as in other populations. This has been attributed to a founder effect, in which a population descending from a small number of ancestors has a high rate of a particular genetic trait because one of these ancestors harbored this trait. In Haut Jura, this {{has been shown to be}} the result of a particular ACVRL1 mutation (named c.1112dupG or c.1112_1113insG). <b>The</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> HHT is 1:1331, reported in Bonaire and Curaçao, two islands in the Caribbean belonging to the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E

5|$|B.cuneata is {{very unusual}} in {{apparently}} suffering no seed loss due to granivory. In nearly all other species, burrowing insect larvae eat {{a large proportion}} of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to B.cuneata. Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen. As a result, this species has <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> seed viability recorded for a Banksia species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and senescence sets in. Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in ‎children and adolescents in five provinces of Iran: Tehran, Shiraz, Isfahan, Tabriz and Mashhad. ‎ Method: In the present study, we selected 9, 636 children and adolescents aged 6 - 18 years through ‎multistage cluster random sampling method from Tehran, Shiraz, Isfahan, Tabriz and Mashhad. ‎We instructed the clinical psychologists to complete the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ‎‎(SDQ) for the participants, and those who received a high score on SDQ, completed the Persian ‎version of Kiddie-SADS-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL). We used descriptive ‎analysis and 95 % confidence interval to investigate the relationship between scores of the K-‎SADS questionnaire and demographic factors‏. ‏We used one-way ANOVA to test the significant ‎differences among the disorders according to sex, age and province of residence. ‎‎ Results: Based on the results, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (4. 45 %) had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> prevalence of psychiatric ‎disorders in the five provinces and substance abuse and alcohol abuse (0 %) had the lowest ‎prevalence. In addition, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) had the most ‎prevalence in boys (5. 03 %) and ODD had the most prevalence in ‎girls (4. 05 %). Among the three age groups, 6 to 9 year olds had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> ADHD ‎‎(5. 69 %); 10 to 14 and 15 to 18 year olds had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> ODD (4. 32 % and 4. 37 % ‎respectively). Among the five provinces, Tehran and Mashhad allocated <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> ODD; Isfahan and Shiraz had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> ADHD; and Tabriz had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> social phobia. ‎ Conclusion : The current study revealed that the overall frequency of psychiatric disorders based on Kiddie-‎SADS-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) was higher than a similar study. Moreover, in ‎this study, among the five provinces, Tehran and Mashhad allocated <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> ODD; Isfahan and Shiraz had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> ADHD; and Tabriz had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> social phobia.
