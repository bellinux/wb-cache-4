John Berge from Norwegian music website [...] gave the album five out of seven stars, praising the album's harmonies and saying it was guaranteed to be a hit with young people. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B-, favourably comparing the uptempo tracks to Hanson though stating M2M's vocal range could not handle the album's ballads.|$|E

A comprehensive study on {{some aspects of the}} biology of G. rhomboidalis has been carried out. The full life cycle of the beetle (from copulation and oviposition through the various immature stages to the emergence of adult beetles) was investigated. It took on the average 40 days for the adult beetle to emerge from the day of oviposition. Studies on the feeding habit of the beetles revealed that the beetles fed heavily on the leaves and can inflict an enormous destruction on the host plant over a short period of time. Generally; the studies have been able to confirm that the larva and adult beetles are the most potent destroyers of the host plant. While the adult beetle fed heavily on <b>the</b> leaves and <b>tender</b> plant stem, <b>the</b> larva when hatched in the plant stem, destroyed the host plant (particularly duri ng <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> between 2 - 3 weeks) with its boring activities causing the plant to wilt and die...|$|R

Although so early sent to college, I did not actually graduate until I was nineteen, the troubled times requiring nearly twice as long a servitude to make a Bachelor of Arts of me as would have been necessary in the more halcyon days of peace.

Without giving any unnecessary alarm, a measure that would have produced less effect on an enemy without, than the imposing stillness which now reigned within the defences, he ordered two or three more of the stoutest of his dependants to be summoned to the palisadoes. A keen scrutiny was made into the state of all the different outlets of the place; muskets were carefully examined; charges were given to be watchful, and regular sentinels were stationed within the shadows of the buildings, at points where, unseen themselves, they could look out in safety upon the fields.|$|E

6000|$|Mr Frederic Harrison, however, {{thinks that}} neither [...] "the {{theology}} nor {{the philosophy of}} In Memoriam are new, original, with an independent force and depth of their own." [...] "They are exquisitely graceful re- statements of {{the theology of the}} Broad Churchman of the school of F. D.

[...] The piety of Maurice may be as illogical as that of Positivism is logical, and the philosophy of the Master of Balliol may be whatever Mr Harrison pleases to call it. But as Jowett's earliest work (except an essay on Etruscan religion) is of 1855, one does not see how it could influence Tennyson before 1844. And what had the Duke of Argyll written on these themes some years before 1844? The late Duke, to whom Mr Harrison refers in this connection, was born in 1823. His philosophic ideas, if they were to influence Tennyson's In Memoriam, must have been set forth by him at <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> seventeen, or thereabouts. Mr Harrison's sentence is, [...] "But does In Memoriam teach anything, or transfigure any idea which was not about that time" [...] (the time of writing was mainly 1833-1840) [...] "common form with F.

60|$|Escaping all {{physical}} dangers, in the end, Doctor Yardley went {{immediately to}} Philadelphia, and brought his daughter home. Both Mark and Bridget now {{felt that they}} had offended against one of the simplest commands of God. They had not honoured their father and their mother, and even thus early came the consciousness of their offence. It was in Mark's power, however, to go and claim his wife, and remove her to his father's house, notwithstanding his minority and that of Bridget. In this last respect, the law offered no obstacle; but the discretion of Doctor Woolston did. This gentleman, through the agency of a common friend, had an interview with his competitor, and they talked the matter over in a tolerably composed and reasonable temper. Both the parents, as medical men, agreed {{that it would be better}} that the young couple should not live together for two or three years, <b>the</b> very <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> Bridget, in particular, rendering this humane, as well as discreet. Nothing was said of the fortune, which mollified Doctor Yardley a good deal, since he would be left to manage it, or at least to receive the income so long as no legal claimant interfered with his control. Elderly gentlemen submit very easily to this sort of influence. Then, Doctor Woolston was exceedingly polite, and spoke to his rival of a difficult case in his own practice, as if indirectly to ask an opinion of his competitor. All this contributed to render the interview more amicable than had been hoped, and the parties separated, if not friends, at least with an understanding on the subject of future proceedings.|$|R
60|$|His greatness {{was not of}} his own making. It {{was largely}} the {{creation}} of his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian I (1459-1519). Some families have fought, others have intrigued their way to world power; the Habsburgs married their way. Maximilian began his career with Austria, Styria, part of Alsace and other districts, the original Habsburg patrimony; he married--the lady's name scarcely matters to us--the Netherlands and Burgundy. Most of Burgundy slipped from him after his first wife's death, but the Netherlands he held. Then he tried unsuccessfully to marry Brittany. He became Emperor in succession to his father, Frederick III, in 1493, and married the duchy of Milan. Finally he married his son to the weak-minded daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Ferdinand and Isabella of Columbus, who not only reigned over a freshly united Spain and over Sardinia and {{the kingdom of the}} two Sicilies, but over all America west of Brazil. So it was that this Charles V, his grandson, inherited most of the American continent and between a third and a half of what the Turks had left of Europe. He succeeded to the Netherlands in 1506. When his grandfather Ferdinand died in 1516, he became practically king of the Spanish dominions, his mother being imbecile; and his grandfather Maximilian dying in 1519, he was in 1520 elected Emperor at <b>the</b> still comparatively <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> twenty.|$|R

It was plain that Sir Kasimir had well and generously done his best to protect the helpless twins, and he sent respectful but cordial greetings to their mother. These however were far less heeded by her than the coldness of her uncle's letter. She had drifted beyond the reckoning of her kindred, and they were sending her her property and bridal linen, as if they had done with her, and had lost their child in the robber- baron's wife.

I was told there were far greater evils than those I had assailed--that I had left untouched much worse things. It was in vain to reply that no one could grapple with the whole at once; my opponents on the ten hour bill sent me to the collieries; when I invaded the collieries I was referred to the print works; from the print works I know not to what I shall be sent; for what can be worse? Sir, it has been said to me, more than once, 'Where will you stop?' I reply, Nowhere, so long as any portion of this mighty evil remains to be removed. I confess that my desire and ambition are to bring all the laboring children of this empire within the reach and opportunities of education, within the sphere of useful and happy citizens. I am ready, so far as my services are of any value, to devote what little I have of energy, and all the remainder of my life, to the accomplishment of this end. The labor would be great, and the anxieties very heavy; but I fear neither one nor the other. I fear nothing but defeat." ...|$|E
60|$|You will be eager, I know, to hear {{something}} further of Frederica, and perhaps may think me negligent for not writing before. She arrived with her uncle last Thursday fortnight, when, of course, I lost no time in demanding the cause of her behaviour; and soon found myself to have been perfectly right in attributing it to my own letter. The prospect of it frightened her so thoroughly, that, {{with a mixture of}} true girlish perverseness and folly, she resolved on getting {{out of the house and}} proceeding directly by the stage to her friends, the Clarkes; and had really got as far as the length of two streets in her journey when she was fortunately missed, pursued, and overtaken. Such was the first distinguished exploit of Miss Frederica Vernon; and, if we consider that it was achieved at <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> sixteen, we shall have room for the most flattering prognostics of her future renown. I am excessively provoked, however, at the parade of propriety which prevented Miss Summers from keeping the girl; and it seems so extraordinary a piece of nicety, considering my daughter's family connections, that I can only suppose the lady to be governed by the fear of never getting her money. Be that as it may, however, Frederica is returned on my hands; and, having nothing else to employ her, is busy in pursuing the plan of romance begun at Langford. She is actually falling in love with Reginald De Courcy! To disobey her mother by refusing an unexceptionable offer is not enough; her affections must also be given without her mother's approbation. I never saw a girl of her age bid fairer to be the sport of mankind. Her feelings are tolerably acute, and she is so charmingly artless in their display as to afford the most reasonable hope of her being ridiculous, and despised by every man who sees her.|$|E
