5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did {{not call}} another general {{convention}} in the twentieth century. Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s {{that might have been}} passed by the General Assembly and sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{unlimited}} Convention of 1901–02, {{twentieth century}} constitutional activity {{turned to a}} mixture of Governor-appointed constitutional commissions in 1927 and 1968, and limited constitutional conventions called by the General Assembly for very specific purpose. After the century's earliest convention disenfranchising voters in a constitution that was proclaimed, each modification of the Virginia Constitution has been sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> for referendum approval. Virginia's women suffrage movement was unsuccessful until the national ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, and the General Assembly did not ratify until 1952, but women could vote beginning in 1920.|$|E
5|$|General Bell {{had been}} the manager {{of one of the}} coal mines in Cripple Creek where the strike was taking place. It wasn't any {{surprise}} to Haywood that soldiers seemed to be working {{in the interests of the}} employers; he had seen that situation before. But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters,</b> and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E

5|$|Obama, at age 38, was a {{lecturer}} at the University of Chicago and a two-term state Senator. Though friends, including Terry Link, his colleague in the Illinois Senate, warned Obama against challenging Rush, {{as there was}} no obvious reason to displace him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters,</b> Obama ran anyway because of his frustration with what he claimed was Republican obstructionism in the Illinois Legislature and the feeling Rush was representing the district less well as he could. Also challenging Rush were Donne Trotter, a state senator, and George Roby, a police officer. Raymond Wardingly, a perennial candidate {{who worked as a}} clown, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{spent much}} of early 1953 in enacting the remainder of its legislative program. St. Laurent {{did not wish to}} call an election until after Queen Elizabeth's Coronation on 2 June and eventually scheduled it for 10 August. Drew made large numbers of promises <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters,</b> and attempted to exploit a Defence Ministry scandal which had broken earlier in the year (at the Petawawa, Ontario army base, an investigation had found frauds which included placing horses on the payroll), but the Liberals were not seriously challenged. The Liberals lost 20 seats from their 1949 high-water mark, but still constituted almost two-thirds of the House of Commons, and no minister was defeated. Howe was again easily elected for Port Arthur.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Tennessee {{state constitution}} was not submitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> for approval, {{but it was}} approved by US Congress, {{in conjunction with the}} resolution admitting Tennessee as a state. It went into effect on June 1, 1796, when Tennessee entered the Union.|$|E

40|$|Brief Description: Hart InterCivic's eSlate is a {{multilingual}} voter-activated {{electronic voting}} system where <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> turns a Select Wheel and pushes a button to indicate his/her preference. The eSlate is connected via cable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Judge's Booth Controller (JBC; image above) which provides vote activation and vote storage {{for up to}} twelve eSlates. A poll worker issues a four digit, randomly generated Access Code <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> using <b>the</b> JBC. <b>The</b> <b>voter</b> enters <b>the</b> Access Code on the eSlate and votes using the select Wheel and Buttons. Once the ballot is cast, the votes are stored in redundant and physically separate areas of the eSlate System, including the eSlate, JBC and flash memory. The votes are transmitted via a cable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> JBC, and are stored on the JBC and on a flash memory card (Mobile Ballot Box or MBB) inside the JBC. Then the MBB is physically transported to election headquarters for tabulation. Detailed Voting Process: When <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> enters <b>the</b> precinct, poll workers first confirm that <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> is properly registered. Then, a poll worker using the Judge's Booth Controller (JBC) prints {{out a piece of}} paper with a four digit, randomly generated Access Code. This number does not tie <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter's</b> identity but ties <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter's</b> precinct s...|$|R
25|$|July 1898, saw the Bill put to {{a series}} of referenda in four colonies, but New South Wales {{rejected}} the proposal. In 1899, a second referendum put an amended Bill <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> of the four colonies and Queensland and the Bill was endorsed.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{championed the}} Peripheral Canal project to {{transport}} water from near Sacramento around the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the Central Valley Project, and export it to southern California. It was submitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> for approval as a ballot proposition in 1982, but was turned down.|$|E
25|$|Ballot Measure 47 was an {{initiative}} in the U.S. state of Oregon that passed in 1996, affecting {{the assessment of}} property taxes and instituting a double majority provision for tax legislation. Measure 50 was a revised version of the law, which also passed, after being referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> by the 1997 state legislature.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} process, Elections Canada mails out {{letters to}} 18-year-old {{citizens}} explaining how to register for inclusion on <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> list. <b>The</b> letters have been mistaken by some recipients as confirmation {{that they have been}} added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> list.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is one of}} the {{preferential}} voting systems most used by {{countries and}} states. It is used for electing multi-member constituencies. Any candidates that achieve the number of votes required for election (the [...] "quota") are elected and their surplus votes are redistributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter's</b> next choice candidate. Once this is done, if not all places have been filled then the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated, and their votes are also redistributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter's</b> next choice. This whole process is repeated until all seats are filled. This method is also called the Hare-Clark system.|$|R
30|$|Hybrid adjudicators: A hybrid adjudicator {{generally}} {{incorporates a}} combination of AT and voter characteristics. For example, variant results are evaluated by an AT, and only accepted results are sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> (Laprie et al. [1990]).|$|R
25|$|Measure 50 {{was sent}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> by the Oregon Legislature in 1997. Once {{passed by the}} voters, the measure {{replaced}} Measure 47. The problems with Measure 47 that Measure 50 aimed to address included a lack of precision about the assessment of property taxes, unintended consequences, and vulnerability to legal challenges.|$|E
25|$|Wilsonville sent a bond measure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> in September 1995 for $3.9 {{million to}} be used to expand the library building, which at that time held 35,000 books. Voters {{rejected}} the measure, along with a measure to improve Memorial Park. In 1998, the library started offering passes to cultural institutions in the Portland metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|The Pan-Blue coalition, after {{receiving}} the news, demanded to call for another recall motion unless Chen resigned immediately. Another small party that backed Chen previously, Taiwan Solidarity Union, said Friday they would likely to support the upcoming recall measure. If the recall passed, it would be up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> to decide Chen's fate in an island-wide referendum.|$|E
50|$|The Constitutional Council {{confirmed}} {{the results of}} the election, with slight changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> turn-out rate and number of seats won by some parties, on May 21. It rejected appeals regarding the election on May 30.|$|R
50|$|Electronic voting {{machines}} {{are able to}} provide immediate feedback <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> detecting such possible problems as undervoting and overvoting which {{may result in a}} spoiled ballot. This immediate feedback can be helpful in successfully determining voter intent.|$|R
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{successful}} efforts led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> approved Washington Death with Dignity Act in 2008, the first-ever death with dignity law {{passed through a}} State legislature, in Vermont., and the California End of Life Option Act in 2015.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Civil War {{the idea of}} uniting all {{of the town of}} Hudson County in one {{municipality}} of Jersey City began to gain favor. In 1868 a bill for submitting the question of consolidation of all of Hudson County <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> was presented to the board of chosen freeholders. The bill did not include the western towns of Harrison and Kearny but included all towns east of the Hackensack River.|$|E
25|$|The voters, in {{a special}} {{election}} held March 7, 1978, solely to ratify the amendments proposed by the convention, voted to remove the archaic provisions and the usury cap and to accept the changes regarding the governor's terms and metropolitan government, but they narrowly turned down the judicial amendment, marking {{the first time that}} an amendment put <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> by a convention had been defeated. Of the 13 proposed amendments, only that one was rejected by the voters.|$|E
25|$|During this election, {{political}} parties used technology in {{innovative ways to}} reach out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters.</b> Although SMS had been used during prior elections, {{political parties}} had realised that the rural and illiterate voters which form a majority couldn't read. Young and technology savvy politicians quickly realised that voice {{was the way to}} reach out to the rural community as they could speak their language. This turned out to be very interesting as two voice companies from India, TringMe and VoiceHawk played the pivotal role in reaching out to the billion people of India.|$|E
50|$|When {{arriving}} at a voting station, voters hand in their card or pass <b>to</b> one of <b>the</b> three attendants of the voting station, who checks the card, cancels it, issues ballot papers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter,</b> and directs him or her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> polling-booth.|$|R
50|$|A {{single vote}} is cast for both offices; {{no other option}} is {{available}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter.</b> Therefore, a voter may not choose a single candidate for governor from one political party and a single candidate for lieutenant governor from a competing party.|$|R
50|$|In {{a postal}} vote, the ballot papers are posted out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> - usually only on request - who must then fill {{them out and}} return them, often with some form of {{certification}} by a witness and their signature to prove their identity.|$|R
25|$|To that end, Mayor Raymond Tucker {{obtained}} {{grants to}} fund a study of consolidation, which found that most county and city residents would not support full consolidation but would support partial consolidation of certain agencies, such as mass transit, zoning, and property assessment. The Board of Freeholders that met to discuss consolidation selected the study's recommendations to present <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters,</b> opting out of a full city-county merger. Although most major business groups, unions, and Cervantes supported the proposal, Mayor Tucker refused to endorse it, claiming it was inadequate. Anti-tax arguments against {{the creation of a}} new government district also were effective, and both city and county voters rejected it overwhelmingly.|$|E
25|$|A staunch {{supporter}} of Stevens throughout his Premiership, Mair became his successor as Premier in August 1939 following Stevens' defeat in a no-confidence motion moved by renegade Minister, Eric Spooner. Becoming Premier at {{a difficult time}} for the government, Mair's leadership was marked by his unification of his formerly fractious party, the reining-in of government expenditure and increased taxes to reduce debt, and new labor laws to reduce unemployment. When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, Mair mobilised the state towards the war effort but {{found it difficult to}} communicate his message <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters.</b> He served as Premier until losing the May 1941 election to the Labor Party under William McKell, losing 20 seats.|$|E
25|$|Some {{candidates}} ran in duos {{because they}} wanted to combine family life with politics. Brouwer, Rosenmöller and Sipkes already were MPs for GreenLeft, whilst Rabbae was new – he had been chair of the Dutch Centre for Foreigners. In the first round, the duos ended up ahead of the others, but neither had an absolute majority. A second round was needed, in which Brouwer and Rabbae won with 51%. Brouwer became the first candidate and Rabbae second, the second duo Rosenmöller and Sipkes occupied the following place followed by Marijke Vos, former chair of the party. The idea of a dual top candidacy did not communicate well <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters.</b> GreenLeft lost one seat, leaving only five. Yet in the same election, the centre-left Labour Party also lost a lot of seats.|$|E
50|$|Since the two-round system {{requires}} more information from each voter {{than a single}} ordinal ballot provides, one can't fit the criteria that are formulated expressly for voters with ordinal preferences without making a generalization as <b>to</b> how <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> will behave. <b>The</b> same problem exists in Approval voting, where one has to make assumptions as <b>to</b> how <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> will place their approval cutoffs.|$|R
50|$|The early {{votes are}} transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter's</b> polling station in double envelopes. On {{election}} day, a voter can vote at the polling station. Before the early vote is counted, officials check if <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> has voted at the polling station. If {{that is the}} case, the vote is destroyed, with the inner envelope unopened. Early votes that do not reach the polling station in time are transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> County Administrative Board and counted if <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> has not already voted.|$|R
50|$|After leaving {{private law}} {{practice}} in the early 1960s, Jordan became directly involved in activism in the field, serving as the Georgia field director for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. From the NAACP, he moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southern Regional Council and then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Voter</b> Education Project.|$|R
