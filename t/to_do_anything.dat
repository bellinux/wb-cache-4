5|$|District constable was {{powerless}} {{to stop the}} violence. In the 1840s, most suburban districts of Philadelphia were policed by elected constables and part-time watchmen. When violence erupted in a district, the time-consuming process involved the constable summoning the county sheriff, who would organize a posse. During the May 6 violence, the posse arrived armed only with clubs and was powerless <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E

He also tried marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly's famed sensory deprivation tanks, {{as a way}} of studying consciousness.

5|$|Although the BBC has {{invested}} in the reconstruction of episodes using animation, it has never attempted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> {{in the way of}} complete re-staging of missing episodes; the closest that it has come to this was the recreation of parts of various serials, including the completely missing Marco Polo, in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time produced for the 50th anniversary in 2013. However, in 2012 a reimagined version of The Power of the Daleks, written by, directed by, and starring Nick Scovell, was released on YouTube in three parts before it was shown complete at the Power:Reimagined convention in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that Iâ€™d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
5|$|His {{appointment}} in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was deeply {{suspicious of the}} UN, and was loath <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that would benefit the country's Shia Muslims. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz {{for the establishment of}} a UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Margaery Tyrell {{is brought}} to meet the High Sparrow, who warns her {{to stay away from}} her life of riches and sin, and recounts his past of how, as a proud cobbler, he learned his wealth-guided pursuits were lies and that the shoeless poor were closer to the truth than anyone. He then takes Margaery to see Loras, who is {{breaking}} under the Sparrows' torture, and is willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to make it stop. Margaery realises that the High Sparrow is trying to use Loras to break her, and tells him to remain strong.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} record (read by Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, during an assembly of lords and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September), Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the Traison et Mort Chronicle suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release from the Tower, called his cousin a traitor, demanded to see his wife and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while the duke refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> without parliamentary approval.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E

5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Hornsby {{was again}} hired {{to manage the}} St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, Bill Veeck, {{was the son of}} former Cubs {{president}} and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. On June9, he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when {{it was already too late}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> about it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.|$|E
5|$|In {{writing the}} book that would become Washington: A Life, Chernow made {{extensive}} use of the archival evidence left by Washington's meticulous record-keeping. These documents included recently discovered written correspondence, maps, and images from the Papers of George Washington, made available by a University of Virginia research project, which began in 1968. Washington: A Life took six years to complete, {{the first four years}} of which were spent purely on research. In June 2009, {{near the end of his}} work on the book, Chernow slipped on a stair and broke his ankle in the three places. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> but read for the following months, and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to the book with a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jaime {{talks with}} Edmure Tully, {{trying to win}} his {{cooperation}} by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom he has never seen, and offering to send {{him and his family}} to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he wants to take Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he is willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.|$|E
5|$|On June 18, 860, at sunset, a {{fleet of}} about 200 Rus' vessels sailed into the Bosporus and started pillaging the suburbs of Constantinople (Old East Slavic: Tsarigrad, Old Norse: MiklagarÃ°r). The attackers were setting homes on fire and {{drowning}} and stabbing the residents. Unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to repel the invaders, Patriarch Photius urged his flock to implore the Theotokos to save the city. Having devastated the suburbs, the Rus' passed into the Sea of Marmora and fell upon the Isles of the Princes, where the former Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople was in exile at the time. The Rus' plundered the dwellings and the monasteries, slaughtering the captives. They took twenty-two of the patriarch's servants aboard ship and cut them into pieces with axes.|$|E
5|$|Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 â€“ 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why we should put ourselves out of our way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.|$|E
