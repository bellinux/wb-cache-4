5|$|The Touchet {{beds are}} one element {{in a chain}} of {{evidence}} which helped identify and define the progression of the Missoula Floods, which occurred around 16,450 to 13,750 yearsBCE. During the floods, flow through the Wallula Gap was slow enough such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis. Lake Lewis back-flooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River Valleys. In these relatively calm arms of the lake, <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> waters deposited the suspended materials eroded from the scabland regions north of Lake Lewis, and redeposited them in pronounced layers before receding.|$|E
5|$|With Ore {{still not}} fully {{recovered}} from his injury and two inexperienced {{players on the}} Georgia side, {{it appeared that the}} teams' passing offenses would have to take up <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> Virginia Tech's Eddie Royal, with 452receivingyards, led both teams in receiving yardage coming into the game. Georgia's receiving corps was led by wide receiver Mohammed Massaquoi and tight end Martrez Milner. Massaquoi caught 28passes for 348yards and two touchdowns coming into the game, while Milner had 27receptions for 376yards and twotouchdowns.|$|E
5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or bedding in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E
50|$|Young dunes {{are called}} yellow dunes and dunes which have high humus content are called grey dunes. Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into <b>the</b> <b>slacks,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>slacks</b> {{may be much}} more {{developed}} than the exposed tops of the dunes. It is usually in <b>the</b> <b>slacks</b> that more rare species are developed {{and there is a}} tendency for <b>the</b> dune <b>slacks</b> soil to be waterlogged and where only marsh plants can survive. These plants would include: creeping willow, cotton grass, yellow iris, reeds, and rushes. As for the species, there is a tendency for natterjack toads to breed here.|$|R

5|$|Pritchard {{was also}} music {{director}} of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Sussex, and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne's resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> summer months. The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and {{ceased to be a}} major factor in the orchestra's finances. During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared, including Danny Kaye, Duke Ellington and Tony Bennett. Its regular complement at the end of the decade was 88 players.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E

5|$|The tugs {{took the}} hulk of the Temeraire in tow at 7:30 am on 5 September 1838, taking {{advantage}} of the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> water. They had reached Greenhithe by 1:30 pm at the , where they anchored overnight. They resumed the journey at 8:30 am the following day, passing Woolwich and then Greenwich at noon. They reached Limehouse Reach shortly afterwards and brought her safely to Beatson's Wharf at 2 pm. The Temeraire was hauled up onto the mud, where she lay as she was slowly broken up. The final voyage was announced in a number of papers, and thousands of spectators came to see her towed up the Thames or laid up at Beatson's yard. The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, rudder pintles and gudgeons, copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{hampered}} the wing's {{activities in}} January 1945. No.1 Squadron was withdrawn to Queensland to re-equip with Mosquitos, with No.13 Squadron, flying Venturas, taking up <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> on anti-shipping missions. The squadron accounted for around {{half of the}} thirty-eight enemy vessels sunk by No.79 Wing in February, and a similar ratio to the twenty sunk the following month. Wing operations were cut back in March, as preparations were made to transfer the Mitchells to Jacquinot Bay in New Britain. On 6April, all twenty available aircraft of Nos.2 and 18 Squadrons were ordered to join B-24 Liberators of No.82 Wing in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser Isuzu. The Liberators were late for their rendezvous with the Mitchells off Sumba so the latter, at the very limit of their range, attacked the convoy regardless. They claimed two direct hits without loss, despite anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, and frontal attacks by enemy fighters. Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the next day.|$|E
