5|$|In 1902, Maryland Agricultural paid $300 for {{its first}} {{professional}} football coach, John Markey.

The following year, in the game against Columbian (now <b>The</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>University),</b> their opponents complained that Markey was a professional. Maryland Agricultural responded with the same accusation against Columbian fullback Granville Church, and the teams came to an agreement to let both play.
