5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines <b>this</b> <b>dilemma</b> in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
5|$|Compounding {{these issues}} was the one-year {{rotation}} policy {{adopted by the}} Pentagon in Southeast Asia. Although the first aircrews arriving in-theater were highly experienced, the rapidly growing tempo and ever-expanding length of the operation demanded more personnel. This exacerbated a growing lack of experienced aircrews. <b>This</b> <b>dilemma</b> was further compounded by an Air Force policy which dictated universal pilot training while proscribing involuntary second combat tours, which combined, {{had the effect of}} rotating personnel to different aircraft. Conversely, the Navy tended to maintain its aircrews within the same community for the duration of their careers, thereby retaining their expertise, but also incurring greater losses among experienced crews undergoing multiple combat tours.|$|E

5|$|The {{solution}} to <b>this</b> <b>dilemma</b> was simple but nonetheless ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested {{the use of}} small, light, gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts to blast through the sand barrier by hydraulic mining. The suggestion proved worthwhile, and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British-made pumps. Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1,500 cubic metres of sand in three hours. In 1972 another 150 more powerful German-made pumps were purchased. A combination of three British-made and two German-made pumps {{made it possible to}} clear a passage in two hours.|$|E
5|$|Oil spills {{present a}} {{localized}} threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if {{the enforcement of}} water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. <b>This</b> <b>dilemma</b> prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may be victims of canine distemper, rabies, respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).|$|E
5|$|Charles X of Sweden had {{concluded}} the earlier war with Denmark with a stunning victory by succeeding in the bold March across the Belts. Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} into a humiliating peace in the Treaty of Roskilde in which Denmark had to cede Scania, Halland and Blekinge on the Scandinavian Peninsula and the island of Bornholm, and Norway lost the provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag. Europe {{was stunned by the}} quick victory, and Charles proudly publicized his accomplishments. However, peace meant new problems. In the peace treaty of Roskilde, Denmark was obliged to supply the Swedish army with provisions until May 1658, but soon thereafter the army would need to be moved. The Swedish king knew that the army {{would not be able to}} be supplied in Sweden for long, and disbanding it was not desirable with the Poles eager to revenge the 1655 invasion of Poland. Sweden was not in want of enemies to attack: campaigns in Livonia and Estonia were considered, but were rejected due to supply problems. The Swedish King maintained that his main goal was to invade Royal Prussia, but he also wanted to punish Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia. The many enemies in continental Europe, among them Poland and a hostile Dutch would make this a difficult endeavor however. A new attack on Prussia would also see little international support, France was already urging peace. The surprising Swedish solution to <b>this</b> <b>dilemma</b> would be to return to Denmark in an attempt to finish the job.|$|E

25|$|To {{sort out}} <b>this</b> <b>dilemma</b> became the sole {{responsibility}} of the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU) South West Pacific Area. In addition to developing a common means of identifying these aircraft by type, it was essential that the new unit obtain information to develop drawings and models, as well as acquiring photographs. The unit's responsibility was to discover construction techniques, weaknesses, strengths, and latest camouflage techniques. Gathering performance information in comparison to Allied aircraft was essential for developing combat tactics with which to counter the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|The growing use of strikebreakers {{under the}} Mackay ruling {{may also have}} contributed to the {{development}} by unions of extra-legal organizing and collective bargaining tools. Allowing employers the permanent replacement of striking workers leads to union capitulation, not to bargaining or industrial peace, many legal scholars note.

25|$|In medieval England, {{the penalty}} for {{a vast number of}} serious crimes, {{including}} murder, was death. This rule traveled with the colonists to America, and was the law in all states at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791. By then, however, a problem with the common-law mandatory death penalty had crept into the legal system. If the jury has only two options—convicting a defendant of murder, where the penalty is death, or acquitting the defendant outright—it has no vehicle to express the sentiment that the defendant should be punished somehow, but not executed. Faced with <b>this</b> <b>dilemma,</b> some juries would acquit the defendant in order to spare his life. Of course, this meant that an obviously guilty person would go free.|$|E

25|$|The {{stationary}} aether theory, however, {{would give}} positive results when the experiments are precise enough to measure magnitudes of second order in v/c. Albert A. Michelson conducted the first experiment {{of this kind}} in 1881, followed by the more sophisticated Michelson–Morley experiment in 1887. Two rays of light, traveling for some time in different directions were brought to interfere, so that different orientations relative to the aether wind should lead to a displacement of the interference fringes. But the result was negative again. The way out of <b>this</b> <b>dilemma</b> was the proposal by George Francis FitzGerald (1889) and Lorentz (1892) that matter is contracted {{in the line of}} motion with respect to the aether (length contraction). That is, the older hypothesis of a contraction of electrostatic fields was extended to intermolecular forces. However, since there was no theoretical reason for that, the contraction hypothesis was considered ad hoc.|$|E
25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses <b>this</b> <b>dilemma</b> to cause emotions to rise. As his characters try to figure out what to do about the Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E
25|$|The {{human need}} for art, on this view, {{stems from the}} need for {{cognitive}} economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for {{a large number of}} concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers a way out of <b>this</b> <b>dilemma</b> by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions, including one's metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal. Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's sense of life (which is preconceptual and largely emotional).|$|E

Humbert then contemplates murdering Charlotte to remain close to Dolores but stops before carrying it out. A few days later, Charlotte finds Humbert's diary and furiously confronts him, telling him he will never see Dolores again. Charlotte then runs out of the house to mail letters she's written to friends about Humbert's obsession with Dolores but is killed by a passing car.

25|$|Long poem authors {{sometimes}} find {{great difficulty}} {{in making the}} entire poem coherent and/or deciding on a way to end it or wrap it up. Fear of failure is also a common concern, that perhaps the poem will not have as great an impact as intended. Since many long poems take the author's lifetime to complete, this concern is especially troubling to anyone who attempts the long poem. Ezra Pound {{is an example of}} <b>this</b> <b>dilemma,</b> with his poem The Cantos. As the long poem's roots lie in the epic, authors of the long poem often feel an intense pressure to make their long poems the defining literature of the national identity or the shared identity of a large group of people. The American long poem is under pressure from its European predecessors, revealing a special variety of this anxiety. Walt Whitman tried to achieve this idea of characterizing the American identity in Song of Myself. Thus, when the author feels that their work fails to reach such a caliber or catalyze a change within the intended audience, they might consider the poem a failure as a whole.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} HMOs—no matter {{whether a person}} is on Medicare or not—persons who enroll in a Medicare Advantage HMO cannot use certain {{specialist}} physicians or out-of-network providers without prior authorization from the HMO, except in emergencies. In almost all Medicare Advantage plans—HMO or otherwise—the beneficiary must choose a primary care physician (PCP) who will provide the referrals and the beneficiary must confirm that the plan authorizes the visit to which the beneficiary was referred by the PCP. As with all HMOs, {{this can be a}} problem {{for people who want to}} use out of network specialists or who are hospitalized and are forced to use out-of-network doctors while in the hospital. Enrolling in a Medicare Advantage PPO, if available, can help solve <b>this</b> <b>dilemma,</b> because many Medicare Advantage PPO plans permit a subscriber to use any physician or hospital without prior authorization, but at a somewhat higher expense. By law, however, if a patient's in-network physician orders tests or procedures or refers a patient to a specialist that are not available or provided by any in-network facility or specialist's office, the Medicare Advantage plan will pay for the patient's procedures or services at an out-of-network location and charge in-network cost-sharing to the patient, so long as the necessary services are normally covered by the plan (the beneficiary should still make sure he or she has authorization however).|$|E
