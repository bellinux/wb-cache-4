5|$|According to the Hittite inscriptions, {{it appears}} that the Ahhiya were a {{powerful}} empire, at the same scale as contemporary Egypt, Assyria and the Hittite Empire. Moreover, {{based on the fact that}} Attarsiya launched a military campaign in Anatolia and fielded one hundred chariots, in addition to infantry, Dutch researcher Jorrit Kelder suggested that Ahhiya must have had the military capacity of at least <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos, based on the information recorded on the Linear B tablets unearthed from the specific palace. Based on this view, the Achaeans under Attarsiya may have formed some kind of alliance which included several Mycenaean kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|From there, {{the story}} becomes more complex. Apparently, the {{skeleton}} was {{scattered throughout the}} quarry, with the remains being recovered from September 1879 to September 1880. Marsh elected to place some of the material in a new species, C. agilis, {{on the strength of}} a pair of fused pubic bones he thought belonged to an animal <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of C. fragilis. He returned to the genus in 1888 to add C". gracilis, based on unknown remains only represented today by a single claw bone pertaining to a small theropod from the Early Cretaceous Arundel Formation of Maryland. This species is not currently accepted as representing Coelurus in reviews of the genus, but has not been given its own genus.|$|E
5|$|In {{its third}} year in London, the 2015 show had 15,000 visitors.

The 2016 fair featured 130 artists, including the fair's first artists representing Egypt, Ethiopia, and Ghana. Koyo Kouoh's forum series returned to the event as well. Of the 40 exhibitors from 18 countries, 40 percent were from Africa and 17 galleries debuted at the show. The fair's founder viewed these expansions as a sign of progress for the African art market.

5|$|The {{attack was}} part of the Provisional IRA's {{campaign}} since 1970 aimed at forcing the British government to withdraw from Northern Ireland. Although Manchester had been the target of IRA bombs before 1996, it had not been subjected to an attack on this scale. In February 1996, the IRA had ended its seventeen-month ceasefire with a large truck bomb attack on London's Canary Wharf financial district, though the 3,300-pound bomb of Manchester was <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of Canary Wharf. The Manchester bombing was condemned by the British and Irish governments and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Five days after the blast, the IRA issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, the {{technology}} of cotton-spinning machinery improved, and the need for larger buildings to house bigger, better and more efficient equipment became apparent. The profitability of cotton spinning meant that open land that had been used for farming since antiquity, was utilised for purpose-built weavers' cottages. Larger buildings were still desired, and construction of two water powered cotton factories (two or <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of a cottage) can be traced to 1782. The construction of more mills followed—ten by 1789—facilitating a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the region; the population moved away from farming, adopting employment in the factory system. The introduction of the factory system led to an increase of the township's population; from 872 in 1714 to 3,500 in 1801, mostly as a result of an influx of people from Yorkshire and Lancashire looking for employment in the cotton mills.|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean {{palatial}} states, or centrally organized palace-operating polities, {{are recorded}} in ancient Greek literature and mythology (e.g., Iliad, Catalogue of Ships) and confirmed by discoveries made by modern archaeologists such as Heinrich Schliemann. Each Mycenaean kingdom was governed from the palace, which exercised control over most, if not all, industries within its realm. The palatial territory {{was divided into}} several sub-regions, each headed by its provincial center. Each province was further divided in smaller districts, the da-mo. A number of palaces and fortifications appear {{to be part of}} a wider kingdom. For instance, Gla, located in the region of Boeotia, belonged to the state of nearby Orchomenos. Moreover, the palace of Mycenae appeared to have ruled over a territory two to <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the other palatial states in Bronze Age Greece. Its territory would have also included adjacent centers, including Tiryns and Nauplion, which could plausibly be ruled by a member of Mycenae's ruling dynasty.|$|E

5|$|The Prague culture {{developed}} over {{the western part of}} the Slavic expansion within the basins of the middle Dnieper River, Pripyat River and upper Dniester up to the Carpathian Mountains and in southeastern Poland, i.e., the upper and middle Vistula basin. This culture was responsible for most of the growth in 6th and 7th centuries, by which time it also encompassed the middle Danube and middle Elbe basins. The Prague culture very likely corresponds to the Sclaveni referred to by Jordanes, whose area he described as extending west to the Vistula sources. The Penkovka culture people inhabited the southeastern part, from Seversky Donets to the lower Danube (including the region where the Antes would be), and the Kolochin culture was located north of the more eastern area of the Penkovka culture (the upper Dnieper and Desna basins). The Korchak type designates the eastern part of the Prague-Korchak culture, which was somewhat less directly dependent on the mother Kiev culture than its two sister cultures because of its western expansion. The early 6th-century Slavic settlements covered an area <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the Kiev culture region some hundred years earlier.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} maximum population in the millions. The great auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its down feathers from at least the eighth century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives may be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America, as well as from early fifth century Labrador, where the bird seems to have occurred only as stragglers. Early explorers, including Jacques Cartier, and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island were not provisioned with food for the journey home, and therefore, used this vulnerable species as both a convenient food source and bait for fishing. Reportedly, some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony and ran out planks to the land. The sailors then herded hundreds of these great auks onto the ships, where they were slaughtered. Some authors have questioned the reports of this hunting method and whether it was successful. Great auk eggs were also a valued food source, as the eggs were <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of a murre's and had a large yolk. These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands, that preyed upon nests.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Selection of appropriately-sized central teeth has an {{important}} role in esthetics of dentures. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare proportion of mesiodistal width of central incisors in the maxilla to those in the mandible in students and products of Idealmako Company. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, 93 students of Isfahan Faculty of Dentistry in the age range of 20 - 30 were selected randomly. Mesiodistal widths of left and right upper and lower centrals were recorded by two methods: directly, using an intraoral caliper, and indirectly, using subjects’ casts and a caliper with an accuracy of 0. 01 mm at height of counter of <b>the</b> teeth <b>three</b> <b>times.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> of Idealmako products were measured by the same caliper. Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, t-test and post hoc Scheffé’s test using SPSS software (α = 0. 05). Results: Proportion of upper-to-lower mesiodistal width of centrals was 1. 55 ± 0. 13 in students and 1. 68 ± 0. 17 in Idealmako products. Conclusion: Mean proportion of mesiodistal width of upper centrals to lower centrals in natural teeth is less than that in artificial teeth. A similarity between the width of upper centrals in the natural and artificial teeth (the numerator of the fraction) accounts for this significant difference between the proportion of the two groups, leading to <b>the</b> very small <b>size</b> of lower centrals (denominator of the fraction) in Idealmako artificial teeth.
