5|$|In 1911 another Royal Commission {{investigation}} into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was {{ignored by the}} state government, which was more concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools than the plight of its prisoners. However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with {{the appointment of a}} superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and the election of a Labor government with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The {{dispute between}} the {{counties}} was resolved {{once and for all}} in 1848 when the Windsor Improvement Act 1848 decreed <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Divided Bridge and the building of two new road bridges, Victoria Bridge slightly upstream, and Albert Bridge slightly downstream. Both new bridges opened in 1851. Once the Divided Bridge was demolished the old Windsor to Datchet road was rerouted over Victoria Bridge and the Berkshire side became part of the private grounds of Windsor Castle. This is the only case on the entire Thames where a main bridge crossing has completely disappeared.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the thirteenth}} century, the islands once ruled by Magnús and his fellow members of the Crovan dynasty before him, were {{incorporated}} into the Scottish realm. In 1293, the parliament of John, King of Scots (died 1314) established three new sheriffdoms within his kingdom. One of these three, the Sheriffdom of Skye, was granted to William I, Earl of Ross (died 1323). This sheriffdom included the seaboard north of Ardnamurchan (Wester Ross and Kintail), and the islands of Skye, Lewis, Uist, Barra, Eigg, and Rum. It is possible that parts of the sheriffdom may have been taken over earlier, sometime after <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{eight years}} after their last {{official}} series, South Africa hosted New Zealand in a one-off test match. The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apartheid system, and was only done with permission of the African National Congress. With their return to test rugby, South Africa were selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup. After upsetting Australia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the tournament until they met New Zealand in the final. After a tense final that went into extra time, South Africa emerged 15–12 winners, with then President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey, presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, Francois Pienaar.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} speed <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third-class forts, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) that {{the guns and}} {{ammunition}} removed from the dismantled forts {{should be kept in}} storage. Fort Corcoran was chosen as one of the storage locations and thus avoided the immediate demise of the other third-class fortifications. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Corcoran stored the cannon of the dismantled forts located south of the Potomac River.|$|E

5|$|Although {{his primary}} reason for {{military}} action in Zaire was <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> refugee camps, Kagame also began planning a war to remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame supported the newly created Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The ADFL, helped by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, took control of North and South Kivu provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. By May 1997, they controlled almost the whole of Zaire except for the capital Kinshasa; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting. The country was renamed as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Kabila became the new president. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the ADFL were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War, {{with as many as}} 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing.|$|E
5|$|Poland's {{communist}} government attempted {{to destroy the}} union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, {{but in the end}} was forced into negotiation. The Roundtable Talks {{between the government and the}} Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{communist government}}al system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's early survival represented a break in the hard-line stance of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the People's Republic of Poland—a satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party communist regime—but for the whole of the Eastern bloc. Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the Eastern Bloc, weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrest of}} Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Hamza in June 2012 {{provided}} further clarity {{on how the}} plot was hatched. According to Abu Hamza, the attacks were previously scheduled for 2006, using Indian youth for the job. However, a huge cache of AK-47's and RDX, which were {{to be used for}} the attacks, was recovered from Aurangabad in 2006, thus leading to <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original plot. Subsequently, Abu Hamza fled to Pakistan and along with Lashkar commanders, scouted for Pakistani youth to be used for the attacks. In September 2007, 10 people were selected for the mission. In September 2008, these people tried sailing to Mumbai from Karachi, but couldn't complete their mission due to choppy waters. These men made a second attempt in November 2008, and successfully managed to execute the final attacks. David Headley's disclosures, that three Pakistani army officers were associated with the planning and execution of the attack were substantiated by Ansari's revelations during his interrogation.|$|E

25|$|In 1782, Emperor Joseph II ordered <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> most fortifications in <b>the</b> Low Countries, {{including}} those <b>of</b> Brussels. <b>The</b> <b>dismantling</b> work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exterior defences began in <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.

5|$|The {{current line}} scheme of the R1 started {{operating}} on , after <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former {{route of the}} Barcelona–Mataró–Maçanet-Massanes railway through the Barcelona neighborhood of Poblenou. Earlier, all the commuter rail services coming from Mataró used the route through Poblenou, terminating at Estació de les Rodalies, a terminus station that was located adjacent to the still existing Estació de França. All services coming from Mataró were then rerouted through the Sagrera rail complex and the Meridiana Tunnel to access Barcelona, terminating at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat or Barcelona–El Prat Airport stations, depending on the station of origin. The services coming from Mataró terminated at the airport, whilst the services coming from north of Mataró terminated at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat. Since the new through line scheme offered more stops within Barcelona and better connections with the city's metro system, the line's ridership doubled. Throughout 1989, this new line scheme was incorporated as part of line 1 of Rodalies Barcelona (predecessor of the R1), the Cercanías commuter rail system for the Barcelona area, created in the same year.|$|E
5|$|The sixth William {{was briefly}} succeeded {{by his son}} Peter, who was {{followed}} by his son William. William the seventh's son was the eighth William Davenport, and an inventory of his property made shortly {{after his death in}} 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact. His two eldest sons each inherited the estate but both died young and heirless, so the estate passed to their younger brother Warren Davenport. Warren became part of the clergy, and during his tenure at Bramall set up a school close to the entrance of the estate. The tenth and final William Davenport succeeded his father, Warren at the age of four. Many changes were made to the house during his tenure, including <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery, the latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe. William had no sons, so the estate passed to Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, the husband of his illegitimate daughter Maria.|$|E
5|$|In 1838-9 an {{agreement}} was signed between the Sakalava king and Seyyid Said, King of Zanzibar, to give Said {{control over the}} Sakalava and Antankarana kingdoms; this agreement never {{came to the attention}} of Tsimiaro and resulted in no changes in governance on the ground. While in exile on Nosy Mitsio, Tsimiaro traveled to Ile Bourbon to conclude a treaty with the French on 5 April 1841 that guaranteed French protection for the Antankarana in exchange for rights to the islands of Nosy Mitsio, Nosy Faly, Nosy Be and Nosy Komba. The French intercession eventually repelled the Merina, allowing the king to reestablish the capital at Ambatoharaña, but more than 40 years passed before the entire Antankarana had permanently returned to the mainland. Upon his death, Tsimiaro was buried at his request in the Ankarana cave where he had taken refuge from the Merina. Other nobles are mainly entombed in the Islamic cemetery near Ambatoharaña. When the French agreed to recognize Malagasy sovereignty in 1862, they retained their claimed right to the Antankarana and Sakalava protectorates they had established. Tsimiaro was succeeded by his son, Tsialana II, (1883–1924) who was born on Nosy Mitsio in 1843. He collaborated with the French actively during their first expedition against the Merina (1883–85), and again during the successful expedition of 1895 that ended in French colonization of the island and <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Merina monarchy. His son Abdourahaman would go on to fight on the side of the French during World War I. Tsialana II was succeeded by Lamboeny II (1925–1938), Tsialana III (1948–1959) and Tsimiharo II (1959–1982).|$|E
