5|$|Metro finally ordered new rail cars, but {{the first}} of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> not due to be {{delivered}} until February 2001.|$|E
5|$|The six two-car {{sets were}} {{delivered}} between 2November and 22December 1994. The first official public presentation {{was made on}} 8December, but the units did not enter regular service until April 1995. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> numbered 2001–2012.|$|E
5|$|Troop kitchens, rolling galleys, {{also joined}} the trains to provide meal service en route (the troops took their meals {{in their seats}} or bunks). As the cooking was {{performed}} by regular U.S. Army cooks, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> outfitted with two Army-standard coal ranges. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> also equipped {{with a pair of}} 200-gallon cold water tanks and a 40-gallon hot water tank; supplies were stocked on open shelves with marine-type railings, a bread locker, a large refrigerator, and a series of built-in cabinets and drawers. The cars served approximately 250 men each, and were typically placed {{in the middle of the}} train so that food could be served from both ends.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> {{connected}} {{to one another}} by a mechanical type H tightlock knuckle coupler. All trainlined electrical connections between <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> made through six trainline jumper cables. Air connections between <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> made through two air hoses, brake pipe and main reservoir.|$|R
50|$|Before its {{production}} start, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> in development for seven years. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> designed by Canadian racing driver Antoine Bessette.|$|R
50|$|A {{reference}} to <b>the</b> <b>Car</b> <b>was</b> made by Reed's {{teacher in the}} 2015 reboot film Fantastic Four. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> axed from <b>the</b> film's script.|$|R
5|$|After closure {{the tunnel}} was sealed, {{although}} it remains structurally intact inside. The {{site of the}} lower terminus was cleared and is now an empty site surrounded with construction hoarding. There is a small roundabout directly outside the south tunnel portal. Hereson Road station is now a used car dealership. Four of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> sold to the Hollycombe Steam Collection and remain in use, while the remaining three {{were given to the}} Hampshire Narrow Gauge Railway Society. Most of the rails and sleepers were sold to the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.|$|E
5|$|B. From the 2000 season, races stopped {{after two}} laps but before three-quarters race {{distance}} {{had been completed}} would be restarted with the cars lining up on the grid in the order {{they were at the}} end of the penultimate lap before the lap during which the red flag was shown. Only the race order and number of laps completed was taken into account for the new race, time differences between <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> voided. The distance of the new race was the number of laps remaining from the original races, less three laps.|$|E
5|$|The fan car and {{hydropneumatic}} suspension exploited loopholes in the sporting regulations. In the early 1980s, Brabham {{was accused of}} going further and breaking the regulations. During 1981, Piquet's first championship year, rumours circulated of illegal underweight Brabham chassis. Driver Jacques Laffite was among those to claim that <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> fitted with heavily ballasted bodywork before being weighed at scrutineering. The accusation was denied by Brabham's management. No formal protest was made against the team and no action was taken against them by the sporting authorities.|$|E
50|$|In 1992 <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{entered by}} Del Bello Racing in the 1992 24 Hours of Le Mans with drivers Noël del Bello and sports car veteran Thierry Lecerf. For <b>the</b> {{occasion}} <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fitted with an Alfa Romeo V6 engine. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> initial entry list but never attended the race.|$|R
50|$|In autumn 1957 <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{shipped to}} <b>the</b> Four Wheel Drive Company Museum in Clintonville, Wisconsin. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> still there in 2010 (see photograph).|$|R
50|$|A Mistral {{body was}} fitted to the Frazer Nash Le Mans Replica. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> raced in 1955 by Ken Wharton. Wharton crashed and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{virtually}} destroyed.|$|R
5|$|The {{upper level}} {{contains}} {{a mix of}} seating options. At one end are eight tables, four to each side, each seating four passengers. In the center is a lounge area with a wet bar and several groups of seats. The stairs to the lower level are located here as well. At the other end are swivel chairs. The lower level contains a bathroom, additional tables, and a snack bar. As built, the lounges had seating for 73. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> built with an electric piano in the lower level, which has since been removed.|$|E
5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance to do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} with an original 104 horsepower, 2000cc four cylinder motor. Following {{a number of}} engine iterations, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> now powered by a 572ci Twin Turbo Chevrolet V8.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{unveiled}} at a test in Valencia on 23 January 2008, a {{week before}} <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> official launch, driven by Rubens Barrichello. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> officially unveiled at the team's operational headquarters in Brackley, England.|$|R
50|$|Stolen <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> sold {{in foreign}} {{countries}} for several reasons. In underdeveloped countries, there are often fewer rules and less enforcement of laws pertaining to plates and title paperwork, so <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{less likely to be}} noticed. Criminals are also hopeful that there is little incentive {{on the part of the}} victim to search in other countries, as even if <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> found, recovery may cost more (in detective, legal, and transportation fees) than <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> actually worth. This is especially true if <b>the</b> stolen <b>car</b> <b>is</b> of low value.|$|R
5|$|On February 1, 1968, the PRR {{merged with}} New York Central Railroad to become Penn Central. The {{remainder}} of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> delivered with Penn Central logos, but retained the PRR-specified livery of gray paint with red pinstripes. On March 2, the first GE-powered Metroliners arrived for testing. The pantographs on the Westinghouse-powered cars would bounce on the aging catenary wires, then draw high currents due to improperly designed transformers. The GE-powered cars proved {{to have a}} superior pantograph design, but were still not fit for service. On March 12, entry into revenue service was delayed indefinitely. Testing was suspended entirely between June 24 and mid-July; tests with 6-car trains in July had severe issues with electrical arcing. The first combined test train of GE and Westinghouse cars ran on August 8.|$|E
5|$|The 50-seat coaches {{featured}} 2x2 seating, with baggage racks in {{the vestibule}} end and separate men's and women's restrooms in the other. The dining-cocktail lounge had half its space devoted to a kitchen and bar area; two seating areas in the other end seated 12 and 24, respectively. Two of the sleeping cars contained 12 open sections, with daytime seating for 24; the third contained eight enclosed sections, two double bedrooms, and a compartment, giving the car a maximum occupancy of 22. The sleeper-lounge-observation car included a compartment, five more double bedrooms, and a rear observation area which seated 22. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> air-conditioned throughout.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the majority}} of the company's workers appeared for duty, but many were absent. The 65 crews of workmen were able to operate half of the normal routes, and were dispatched to continue operations. The strikers, supported by thousands of other pro-union men, continued their campaign. They blocked streetcar tracks, harassed workers, and demanded that the union be recognized by the company. Dozens of streetcars were vandalized, some were completely destroyed, the overhead electric cables that powered <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> cut, and passengers were threatened to not to ride the cars. Some company employees were forcibly taken multiple times to Labor Hall to repeat their oaths of loyalty to the union before they were convinced or intimidated to join the strike.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> unveiled, and {{was known}} as Enviate v1.0. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} created using first generation Honda NSX components, and had an LS-based 4.8-liter dry-sump-lubricated V8 with Garrett twin-turbochargers, which produced approximately [...] <b>The</b> <b>car's</b> body <b>was</b> built with NSX components and lightweight material. No other information <b>is</b> known about <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} entered for the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps, but <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{not ready}} in time. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> actually competed {{for the first}} time at the German Grand Prix at the beginning of August.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{also won}} as a prize for {{completing}} the Supercar Nostalgia Cup in Gran Turismo 5 for the PlayStation 3, and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{carried over into}} Gran Turismo 6.|$|R
5|$|The team took a brief hiatus after Brands Hatch, {{returning}} for Imola {{once again}} {{but they were}} unable to repeat their previous performance, both cars crashing out. Lancia once again skipped Fuji in Japan, returning for the South African round at Kyalami where Patrese and Nannini led home a 1-2 finish. Although the LC2 earned its second win, none of the leading Porsche teams attended the event in protest of the countries Apartheid laws. Unable to challenge further for the Constructors or Drivers Championships, the team did not attend the final round of the year at Sandown Park in Melbourne, Australia. Although <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> fast, over the year Autocourse concluded that the team had had so many different problems that poor preparation must be the cause.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. Upon dispatching from the loading dock, the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E
5|$|When Amtrak began {{returning}} rented Jersey Arrows to New Jersey Transit in late 1980, {{other equipment}} {{was needed to}} cover Silverliner Service trains on the Harrisburg corridor. Test runs of Metroliners on the corridor began in January 1981, and revenue service began in February, despite warnings a decade before that <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> not suitable for the service. The last non-rebuilt Metroliners in regular use on Metroliner Service trains were removed on April 1, 1981, followed by the GG1s in May. The last Metroliner Service trains using Metroliners ran on October 23, 1981. With all Metroliner Service trains covered by AEM-7/Amfleet sets, all Keystone Service trains to Harrisburg then used Metroliners, rebranded as Capitoliners.|$|E
5000|$|... == Model == According to Jeep, The Jeep Renegade is {{made from}} minimal components, the chassis and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{interior}} <b>are</b> made from {{a single piece of}} aluminum. The floor of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> designed in such a fashion that any water is immediately discharged outside. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> reportedly fully recyclable.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] K-1 Attack Roadster <b>is</b> {{a sports}} <b>car</b> built by <b>the</b> Slovak <b>car</b> company K-1 Engineering. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> {{manufactured}} by hand in Bratislava. Attack was officially launched in May 2002, but was in development since 1999. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> originally made for racing, developed by Engineer Dick Kvetnansky and designed by Juraj Mitra and {{was completed in}} 2000. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> built initially as a race <b>car,</b> upon seeing <b>the</b> demand as a road <b>car</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> made available as a kit <b>car</b> using <b>the</b> 90-93 Honda Accord as <b>the</b> donor <b>car.</b> Small modifications {{could be made to}} accommodate the H22 engine from the Honda Prelude as well.|$|R
50|$|For the 2001 Grand American Road Racing Championship season Crawford {{designed}} and built the Crawford SSC2K. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> designed by Andy Scriven who joined Crawford in April 1999 after leaving Lola. <b>The</b> GTP sports <b>car</b> <b>was</b> powered by a Judd V10 engine. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> built for Kevin Doran's racing team, Doran Racing. During the two years <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> contested <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fitted with various different front end designs. The blunt nose suffered similar issues as experienced by the Reynard 2KQ, the airflow towards the rear end was disrupted. By 2002 the Crawford followed Lola B2K/10's example {{with regard to the}} aerodynamic design. In <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> second season <b>the</b> <b>car</b> scored its first win. At Virginia International Raceway Andy Wallace and Chris Dyson won the 500 km race.|$|R
5|$|A pre-Le Mans testing day {{was held}} at the circuit on 31 May, {{involving}} all 56 entries as well as the KCMG Oreca-Nissan, Ibañez Oreca-Nissan, Gulf Racing Porsche, and Formula Racing Ferrari reserve entries. Two LMP3 class Ginetta vehicles and two additional AF Corse Ferrari cars also participated. The two four-hour sessions were held under mixed weather conditions as rain swept through the area several times. Neel Jani set the fastest time in the early session with a three minutes and 21.945 seconds for the No. 18 Porsche, but Hartley improved to a three minutes and 21.061 seconds in the sister No. 17 Porsche. Audi's best time was a three minutes and 22.307 seconds for Marco Bonanomi in the No. 9 car, while Toyota could only muster a three minutes and 25.321 seconds lap. Laurens Vanthoor was the fastest LMP2 driver in the No. 34 OAK Ligier-Honda. Darren Turner's No. 97 Aston Martin was quickest in LMGTE Pro while Pedro Lamy helped Aston Martin also lead in LMGTE Am. The session served as the first appearance for the trio of Nissan GT-R LM Nismo amongst its World Endurance Championship competitors, although <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> not on pace with the LMP1 field.|$|E
5|$|Although Hamilton became {{concerned}} about his Mercedes' brakes, {{he was told that}} it was a relatively minor sensor problem. He and Vergne reported that conditions had improved, but Vettel and Massa said that visibility remained poor. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of the}} ninth lap, and <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> allowed to overtake. Button immediately made a pit stop to fit intermediate tyres. Hamilton attempted to pass Rosberg heading into the first corner, but could not overtake him. Rosberg began to pull away from him; Vettel tried to pass Magnussen going into the hairpin, but was unable to complete the manoeuvre. He ran wide at the Spoon Curve, remaining on the track by running onto the kerb. Pérez overtook Kvyat to claim ninth position on the lap. At the end of the first racing lap, Rosberg led Hamilton by 1.3 seconds; Hamilton was followed by Bottas, Massa, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vettel, Räikkönen, Pérez and Kvyat.|$|E
5|$|Although March {{considered}} quitting Formula One {{on several}} occasions, money was always found to support {{at least one}} car. Motorsport historian Mike Lawrence credits Mosley with pressing for a six-wheeled March to be built as a draw for sponsors, having seen the popularity with fans of Tyrrell's six-wheeled P34. The resulting March 2-4-0 never competed in Formula One, but generated the required publicity and a Scalextric slotcar model was profitable. Mosley {{spent much of his}} time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling Marches to other Formula One teams, such as Williams and Penske. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> rarely frontrunners, although the works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976. By the end of 1977, Mosley was fed up with the struggle to compete in Formula One with no resources and left to work for FOCA full-time, selling his shares in the company to Herd but remaining as a director. March's involvement in Formula One ended the same year.|$|E
50|$|Note <b>the</b> #4 <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{excluded}} because <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> not {{in compliance}} with the technical regulations. Results are still provisional.|$|R
50|$|Bill Rutan started {{building}} his own hillclimb racer in 1955. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> featured a 1945 Volkswagen front hood, longitudinals and center tube. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> modified countless times as Rutan tried different body styles, engine positions, etc. In 1958 <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{fitted with a}} Porsche 356 Carrera engine. The frame, rollcage, rear suspension and cooling system were designed by Rutan himself. He called <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>the</b> Bathtub. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> later known as the Porsche Special or the Bill Rutan Special.|$|R
50|$|Birney-type <b>car</b> 400 <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{ordered in}} 1921 by the British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) from <b>the</b> Preston <b>Car</b> Company. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> manufactured in Preston, Ontario, and shipped in parts to the BCER for final assembly at their yards in Vancouver before entering service in Victoria, British Columbia in March 1922. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> retired from service in 1948, then {{sold to the}} Mayo Lumber Company in Cowichan Lake {{to be used as}} a bunkhouse. Purchased in 1970 by the provincial museum, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> restored in 1973 for static display. Purchased by the society in 1990, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> restored to operating condition. By 1999, this work was nearly completed, and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> expected to be placed into service in 2000, but various issues subsequently delayed <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> entry into passenger service until 2005 or later.
