5|$|At {{first light}} Air America {{helicopters}} hovered over Lima Site 85 {{to start the}} evacuation, which was covered by USAF A-1 Skyraiders. Immediately, Hmong soldiers and their CIA commanders rushed the <b>TACAN</b> site and shouted to the U.S. technicians that help was coming. In response, the North Vietnamese Special Forces organized a defense around the <b>TACAN</b> site, and hid their dead and wounded comrades under the large rocks which dotted Phou Pha Thi. While U.S. fighter-bombers strafed the <b>TACAN</b> site, the Air America helicopter landed on the airstrip and they picked up two CIA officers, one forward air-controller, and five technicians who hid during the firefight. Later in the day, Air America was able to recover or account for eight of the dead U.S. personnel on Lima Site 85, along {{with a number of}} wounded Hmong soldiers. By midday, Lima Site 85 was fully controlled by the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion, and they held the facility until 14March when they withdrew from the area.|$|E
5|$|Raven Forward Air Controllers at Lima Site 20A, {{being the}} nearest {{available}} American support, were {{awakened by a}} radio call about 04:00. They flew in the dark to Lima Strip 36 at Na Khang to position themselves at the airstrip closest to LS85. The Ravens took up station over LS85 at dawn. At 05:15 Sullivan, from the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane, decided to evacuate Lima Site 85 and he gave a signal to U.S. pilots at Udorn to begin the operation, which was due to start at 07:15. However, Sullivan {{did not realize that}} U.S. technicians were no longer in control of their TSQ-81 equipment. Starting around 06:00, Pao's Hmong soldiers launched a counterattack against North Vietnamese positions at the communication center, which was guarded by Cells 1 and 2, but their attacks were repelled and the North Vietnamese held their positions. With the final Hmong counterattack on the communication site was defeated at 06:25, Cell 2 was ordered to support Cells 3 and 5 in their fight at the main <b>TACAN</b> installation. By 06:35, the North Vietnamese fully controlled the <b>TACAN</b> site. At the airstrip, Cell 4 was encircled by an estimated two Hmong platoons, but Chom and his unit were able to fight their way out by taking full advantage of rough terrain which favored them. Later, Cell 4 linked up with other units at the <b>TACAN</b> site.|$|E
5|$|During the 1967–1969 refit, {{thirteen}} Bofors were removed, leaving four twin {{and four}} single mountings. The three 277Q radars were replaced with updated American and Dutch designs: a LW-02 air search set and a SPN-35 landing aid radar. A <b>TACAN</b> aerial and electronic countermeasures pods were also installed during this refit. The four Bofors twin mountings were removed in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Electronic {{tactical}} {{air navigation}} (<b>TACAN)</b> became an absolute necessity in Laos, where mountain peaks and unexpected inclement weather made flying extremely hazardous, especially for older aircraft. This problem was solved by establishing unmanned Air Force stations that broadcast continuous radio transmissions, allowing aerial navigation from fixed geographic reference points. The Air Force also emplaced TSQ-81 radar {{sites in the}} north and northeast to direct Rolling Thunder missions over North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The AW101's {{navigation}} system includes a GPS receiver and inertial {{navigation system}}, VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR), {{instrument landing system}} (ILS), <b>TACAN,</b> and automatic direction finding. The Mk1 and Mk3 are equipped with a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS {{as part of the}} autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{moved out}} to take the Plain of Jars again in 1967. Laotian {{victories}} were {{few and far between}} {{and by the end of}} the year the situation had become critical, even with the support provided by the American and Laotian Air Forces. PAVN, having a complete understanding of the American military system, began to attack <b>TACAN</b> facilities. U.S. intelligence indicated that between December 1967 and August 1968, the combined strength of PAVN and Pathet Lao forces increased from about 51,000 to over 110,000. The PAVN contingent comprised an estimated 34,000 combat troops, 6,000 advisors, and 18,000 support troops. On 6 December Lima Site 44 was overrun and on the 25th PAVN forces captured Lima Site 61, the site of a mobile facility. All of these attacks were part of a coordinated effort to reduce the ability of the Americans to strike the communist logistical system during the Tet Offensive.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} noise of explosions, the on-duty U.S. {{technicians}} rushed {{out the front door}} of their operations building where they were met by North Vietnamese gunfire. Blanton, the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other U.S. technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to {{the west side of the}} mountain, where they hid on the edge of the cliff. From their hideout, the U.S. technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M-16 rifles and hand grenades. At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the U.S. technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the <b>TACAN</b> installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting. Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.|$|E
25|$|A {{multi-mission}} {{avionics system}} includes a heads-up display (HUD), advanced radar, AN/ASN-109 {{inertial guidance system}} (INS), flight instruments, ultra high frequency (UHF) communications, and tactical air navigation system (<b>TACAN)</b> and instrument landing system (ILS) receivers. It also has an internally mounted, tactical electronic warfare system, Identification friend or foe (IFF) system, electronic countermeasures suite and a central digital computer.|$|E
25|$|At 0100 on 24 March, Dac Cong {{managed to}} disable the <b>TACAN</b> beacon at Skyline One; the <b>TACAN</b> was crucial for {{directing}} U.S. Air Force air strikes. To retake it, the makeshift guerrilla battalion from MR 1 was enticed by $1 per day combat pay to reclaim Skyline Ridge. Given gunship support and issued new M16 rifles, the guerrillas stormed the hill. Vang Pao ordered their continued advance northward toward Sam Thong. By 26 March, having advanced with steadily increasing {{tactical air support}} as weather cleared, they were perched on hilltops south of Sam Thong. Unknown to them, the communist defenders scattered from Sam Thong into the nearby jungle. CIA case agent Tony Poe, who had scraped together the various smaller units he had amalgamated into an ad hoc MR 1 battalion to be shipped to MR 2, had followed them into action. He flew into Sam Thong on 27 March and contacted his troops. They {{came down from the}} hills, and by 1500 hours on 27 March 1970, Sam Thong was reoccupied by Royalists.|$|E
25|$|With SAI {{contracted}} as {{the main}} contractor for the upgrading project and a non-afterburning General Electric F404-GE-100D turbofan engine selected as the new engine, the upgrading project would later be extended to cover the entire fleet of newer A-4S-1s as well as taking the opportunity to completely modernise the avionics package (newly installed equipment now included a Pave Penny laser seeker mounted in the nose, an Inertial navigation system (INS), a Tactical Air Navigation (<b>TACAN)</b> system, fore & aft Radar warning receivers (RWR) and chaff/flare countermeasures) of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|On 5 November 1997, Atlantis again {{arrived at}} Palmdale for OMDP-2 which was {{completed}} on 24 September 1998. The 130 {{modifications carried out}} during OMDP-2 included glass cockpit displays, replacement of <b>TACAN</b> navigation with GPS and ISS airlock and docking installation. Several weight reduction modifications were also performed on the orbiter including replacement of Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI) insulation blankets on upper surfaces with FRSI. Lightweight crew seats were installed and the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) package installed on OMDP-1 was removed to lighten Atlantis to better serve its prime mission of servicing the ISS.|$|E
25|$|A {{key area}} of {{advancement}} on the Mirage F1 over its predecessors {{was in its}} onboard avionics. The Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV monopulse radar system, developed from the Cyrano II unit installed on the Mirage IIIE, serves as the main sensor; it operates in three different modes: air-target acquisition and tracking, ground mapping, and terrain avoidance. The later Cyrano IV-1 model also provided for a limited look-down capability. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the Cyrano IV radar was capable of detecting aerial targets at double the range of earlier models. The standard production Mirage F1 was furnished with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), radar altimeter, UHF/VHF radio sets, Tactical Air Navigation system (<b>TACAN)</b> and aground data link. Other avionics include an autopilot and yaw damper.|$|E
25|$|The careful {{methods of}} PAVN forces are {{illustrated}} in the successful attack against the US Air Force's <b>TACAN</b> radar navigation facility in Laos (Lima Site 85), in March 1968. Situated on a mountain peak that was considered too tough to assault, the facilities were manned by a small force of USAF technicians on top, and about 1,000 Hmong and Thai irregulars deployed further down the slopes. NVA commandos however successfully climbed the mountain, killing or dispersing most of the guards and US airmen at the peak, while a larger follow-on echelon of NVA and Pathet Lao assaulted {{the rest of the}} mountain slopes below. The outgunned and outnumbered Hmong and Thai irregulars were defeated, and Communist forces held the site despite several days under counterattack by US aircraft.|$|E
25|$|By 5 January 1972, about 600 {{rounds of}} 130mm {{explosives}} had hit Long Tieng. Radio intercepts of PAVN messages revealed 24 PAVN battalions were poised {{to attack the}} Royalists. On the Royalist side, both GM 21 and GM 23 had been mauled into uselessness. Eight of the Royalist infantry battalions had been relieved for refitting. Given {{the gravity of the}} PAVN threat to the Long Tieng base, its aviation operations were dispersed away from Communist reach. The <b>TACAN</b> air navigation system on Skyline Ridge was moved 20 kilometers further south to another mountaintop. Flight operationswhether RLAF, Air America, or Continental Air Services, Incfollowed the refugee relief effort, which had been transferred from Sam Thong to nearby Ban Son. In Vang Pao's absence, discipline slipped; there was some looting by both Thais and Hmong.|$|E
25|$|In early 1970, enemy action {{declined}} so {{much that}} more mission were directed to border areas with more interdiction targets. The gunships conducted nighttime armed reconnaissance in specific strike zones known as Shadow boxes, flying a <b>TACAN</b> radial to a location in the box, then dropping position markers and locating targets. Between 1 April and 22 May, the 17 SOS provided nighttime cover for the besieged CIDG camps at Dak Seang and Dak Pek. With the assistance of AC-119K Stingers from the 18th Special Operations Squadron, the Shadows flew one to two sorties a night. During the siege of the camps, the squadrons flew 147 sorties and expended 2,380,161 7.62mm rounds and 21,796 20mm rounds. They also illuminated drop zones for C-7A Caribous resupplying the camps. From 3 April to 31 May, the AC-119Gs based at Tan Son Nhut tested a portable UHF receiver for signals transmitted by ground sensors. On 18 April, Shadow 77 picked up signals in a sensor field, firing nearly 6,000 7.62mm rounds that night and 28,500 rounds on the next night after again detecting movement, as well as assisting an airstrike in the area. 150 enemy bodies were discovered and 17 prisoners captured along with nine crew-served weapons and 67 individual weapons in a subsequent ground sweep. After {{the conclusion of the}} testing period, the final assessment recommended that the receivers be permanently placed in the AC-119.|$|E
500|$|About 03:00 Cell 1 {{moved to}} within [...] of their objective, with Cell 5 {{positioned}} behind them. At the same time, {{the commander of}} Cell 4 decided to maneuver his unit to {{the west side of}} the airstrip instead of the east side as originally planned, because the terrain on the east side was higher and was covered by buildings. Precisely at 03:45, Cell 1 moved to within [...] of the communications center, when they bumped into a Hmong outpost. Both sides exchanged fire, and the outpost was destroyed by a grenade while the Hmong soldier guarding the post retreated. Shortly afterwards, a soldier from Cell 1 fired an RPG-7 grenade which destroyed the <b>TACAN</b> antenna. Within 15 minutes, Cells 1 and 2 had secured the communications site. Signaled by the explosion of Cell 1’s RPG-7 round, Cell 3 immediately attacked the <b>TACAN</b> installation by firing one of their own RPG-7s, which destroyed the electrical generators.|$|E
500|$|The {{navigation}} and bombing system (NBS) comprised an H2S Mk9 radar and a navigation bombing computer (NBC) Mk1. Other navigation aids included a Marconi radio compass (ADF), GEE Mk3, Green Satin Doppler radar {{to determine the}} groundspeed and drift angle, radio and radar altimeters, and an instrument landing system. <b>TACAN</b> replaced GEE in the B.1A and B.2 in 1964 [...] Decca Doppler 72 replaced Green Satin in the B.2 around 1969 [...] A continuous display of the aircraft's position was maintained by a ground position indicator (GPI).|$|E
500|$|The V-22 is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit, which incorporates four Multi-function displays (MFDs, compatible with night-vision goggles) and one shared Central Display Unit (CDU), to display various images including: digimaps, imagery from the Turreted Forward Looking Infrared System primary flight instruments, navigation (<b>TACAN,</b> VOR, ILS, GPS, INS), and system status. The flight director panel of the Cockpit Management System (CMS) allows for fully coupled (autopilot) functions that take the aircraft from forward flight into a [...] hover with no pilot interaction other than programming the system. The glass cockpit of the canceled CH-46X was derived from the V-22. The fuselage is not pressurized, and personnel must wear on-board oxygen masks above 10,000 feet.|$|E
500|$|Personnel {{working at}} the <b>TACAN</b> site were {{supplied}} by weekly flights of the 20th Special Operations Squadron, based at Udorn RTAFB in northeastern Thailand operating under the code name Operation Pony Express, using Lima Site 85, the [...] airstrip constructed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the valley below. Hmong General Vang Pao, who spearheaded the allied war effort against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces in Military Region 2, was entrusted {{with the task of}} guarding the facility using the Hmong Clandestine Army alongside CIA-funded Thai Border Patrol Police forces. Though substantial resources were invested to maintain the facility, the USAF command doubted Vang Pao's ability to defend the installation. Accordingly, all equipment had explosives attached so that if the site was overrun, it could be quickly destroyed. By late 1967, Lima Site 85's radar directed 55 per cent of all bombing operations against North Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|During the Vietnam War and the Laotian Civil War, Phou Pha Thi {{mountain}} was {{an important}} strategic outpost which had served both sides at various stages of the conflict. In 1966, the United States Ambassador to Laos approved a plan by the United States Air Force (USAF) to construct a <b>TACAN</b> site on top of Phou Pha Thi, as {{at the time they}} lacked a navigation site with sufficient range to guide U.S. bombers towards their targets in North Vietnam. In 1967 the site was upgraded with the air-transportable all-weather AN/TSQ-81 radar bombing control system. This enabled American aircraft to bomb North Vietnam and Laos at night and in all types of weather, an operation code-named Commando Club. Despite U.S. efforts to maintain the secrecy of the installation, which included the [...] "sheep-dipping" [...] of the airmen involved, U.S. operations at the facility did not escape the attention of the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces.|$|E
500|$|In August 1966, the USAF {{installed}} a <b>TACAN</b> System, an autonomous radio transmitter that provided pilots with distance and bearing {{relative to the}} station on Phou Pha Thi. In 1967, under the code name Heavy Green, the facility was upgraded with the TSQ-81, which could direct and control attacking jet fighters and bombers to their targets and provide them with precise bomb release points. It began operating in late November 1967 as Operation Commando Club. To operate the equipment within the limitations imposed by the Laotian Prime Minister, USAF personnel assigned {{to work at the}} installation had to sign paperwork that temporarily released them from military service, and to work in the guise of civilian technicians from Lockheed Martin— the process is euphemistically called [...] "sheep-dipping". In reality, they operated as members of the USAF Circuit Rider teams from the 1st Mobile Communications Group based at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base who rotated to the site every seven days.|$|E
500|$|To {{maintain}} {{the elements of}} secrecy and surprise, Muc was ordered to avoid contact with local civilians and opposing military forces. In the event they were engaged by opposing forces, the North Vietnamese would deploy a small force {{to deal with the}} situation while the main formation would continue moving to their objective on Phou Pha Thi. Once the North Vietnamese formation had arrived at their assembly area, they were to be divided into two assault groups. The first assault group, under Muc's direct command, was divided into five [...] "cells" [...] to attack key targets at Lima Site 85. Cells 1 and 2 were given the mission of capturing the communications center, with the latter given the secondary role of supporting Cell 3, which was given the main mission of seizing the <b>TACAN</b> site and eliminating all U.S. personnel. Cell 4 was to capture the airstrip, and Cell 5 was placed in reserve. Second Lieutenant Nguyen Viet Hung was given responsibility to lead the second assault group with the mission of neutralizing the Thai positions. The attack would commence during the early hours of 9or10March.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tactical}} {{air navigation}} system (<b>TACAN)</b> equipment for Channel 97 at LS-85 was emplaced after Vietnam War Combat Skyspot sites {{had been created}} in March 1966 and several <b>TACAN</b> sites, including those at Lima Sites, had similarly been established for military aircraft navigation/guidance. The planned LS-85 <b>TACAN</b> site was surveyed in July 1966 (the Hmong natives flattened the summit and created a helicopter landing zone at lower elevation). [...] The [...] "First Mobile Communications Group Team 72-66" [...] deployed the 60Hz diesel-powered MB5 Generator Set and 1 kilowatt ITT AN/TRN-17 Beacon-Transponder Set from Clark AFB to Udorn RTAFB in August 1966 via a C-123 cargo aircraft—then to the Sam Thong runway (LS-20) for transfer to [...] "Army CH46 Chinooks" [...] which refueled later at Na Khang (LS-36) to complete the airlift to LS-85.|$|E
2500|$|Captain Leslie Simpson, {{the pilot}} of a flight on 14 November and also present at the 9 November briefing, {{compared}} the coordinates of the McMurdo <b>TACAN</b> navigation beacon (approximately 5 kilometres [...] east of McMurdo NDB), and the McMurdo waypoint that the flight crew had entered into the INS, {{and was surprised to}} find a large distance between the two. After this flight, Captain Simpson advised Air New Zealand's Navigation section of the difference in positions. For reasons that were disputed, this triggered Air New Zealand's Navigation section to subsequently resolve to update the McMurdo waypoint coordinates stored in the ground computer to correspond with the coordinates of the McMurdo <b>TACAN</b> beacon, despite this also not corresponding with the approved route.|$|E
2500|$|The LS-85 <b>TACAN</b> {{area with}} the AN/TRN-17, generator, diesel supply, and [...] "Comm and Relay Center" [...] was {{operating}} on September 24, 1966; and the portion of LS-85 serviced by the landing zone was supported (supplies, etc.) by Continental Air Services using PONY EXPRESS Sikorsky CH-3 helicopters (the USAF museum displays one used for LS-85.) [...] Fuel drums for the MB5 were landed directly at the mountaintop.|$|E
2500|$|The LS-85 {{military}} installation {{began in}} August 1966 with <b>TACAN</b> radar installation at a supply site and command post for [...] "Hmong officers and CIA paramilitary advisers [...] harassing operations against the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese". LS-85 was supplied via an [...] "Air America STOL airstrip … {{two-thirds of the}} way down the mountain" [...] and the command bunker was down the hill from the summit [...] (identified by the North Vietnamese as the [...] "communications center".) The airstrip was also used for refueling USAF rescue helicopters.|$|E
2500|$|NKP {{initially}} housed USAF {{search and}} rescue forces and maintained a communications capability in support of U.S. Air Force objectives in Southeast Asia. NKP was the location of <b>TACAN</b> station [...] "Channel 89" [...] and was referenced by that identifier in voice communications during air missions. The 634th Combat Support Group was inactivated and the 56th Air Commando Wing was formed on 8 April 1967. The [...] formed the operational backbone of the new wing, and the 56th Combat Support Group took over the major support functions. Nearly one year later the 56th ACW designation was changed to 56th Special Operations Wing, 1 August 1968.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{assessment}} by the site's 7th AF coordinator was that after radar operations began LS-85 would be attacked within 6 months, which a February 25 CIA report accurately predicted would be after March 10. [...] Summit structures at LS-85 {{had originally been}} outfitted with demolition charges (later removed by the technicians), and the personnel eventually had small arms (e.g., M16 rifles) for defense. [...] <b>TACAN</b> and AN/TSQ-81 personnel {{were included in the}} February plan to evacuate when the site's risk became too high, and defense training had been provided. [...] An enemy patrol was dispersed {{from the base of the}} mountain on January 10, a January 12 airstrike bombed LS-85, and a mortar attack was on January 30. [...] On February 18 near the head of the road an NVA survey party was defeated (the NVA map with planned artillery positions was captured.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Lima Site 85 (LS-85 {{alphanumeric}} {{code of the}} phonetic 1st letter used to conceal this covert operation) was a clandestine, military installation located in the Royal Kingdom of Laos guarded by the Hmong [...] "Secret Army", the Central Intelligence Agency, and the United States Air Force used for Vietnam War covert operations against communist targets in ostensibly neutral Laos under attack by the Vietnam People's Army. [...] Initially created for a CIA command post to support a local stronghold, the site was expanded with a 1966 <b>TACAN</b> area excavated on the mountaintop where a 1967 command guidance radar was added for Commando Club bombing of northern areas of North Vietnam. [...] The site ended operations with the Battle of Lima Site 85 {{when most of the}} U.S. technicians on the mountaintop were killed, including CMSgt Richard Etchberger. For his heroism and sacrifice, Etchberger received the Air Force Cross posthumously. The operation remained classified, however, and the existence of the award was not publicly acknowledged until 1998. After the declassification of LS 85 and a reevaluation of his actions, Etchberger was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The first F-101A was {{delivered}} on 2 May 1957 to the 27th Strategic Fighter Wing, which transferred to TAC in July that year, replacing their F-84F Thunderstreak. The F-101A was powered by two Pratt & Whitney J57-P-13 turbojets, allowing good acceleration, climb-performance, ease in penetrating the sound barrier in level flight, {{and a maximum}} performance of Mach1.52. The F-101's large internal fuel capacity allowed a range of approximately [...] nonstop. The aircraft was fitted with an MA-7 fire-control radar for both air-to-air and air-to-ground use, augmented by a Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS) system for delivering nuclear weapons, and was designed to carry a Mk 28 nuclear bomb. The original intended payload for the F-101A was the McDonnell Model 96 store, a large fuel/weapons pod similar in concept {{to that of the}} Convair B-58 Hustler, but was cancelled in March 1956 before the F-101 entered service. Other operational nuclear payloads included the Mk 7, Mk 43, and Mk 57 weapons. While theoretically capable of carrying conventional bombs, rockets, or Falcon air-to-air missiles, the Voodoo never used such weapons operationally. It was fitted with four 20mm M39 cannon, with one cannon often removed in service to make room for a <b>TACAN</b> beacon-receiver.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy Green was the {{military}} operation to emplace a Reeves AN/TSQ-81 Bomb Directing Central on the LS-85 summit {{adjacent to the}} <b>TACAN</b> area particularly for monsoon season bombing of northern North Vietnam. [...] The site's Initial inspection regarding suitability for ground-directed bombing was by its eventual 7th AF coordinator, and geodetic surveying was by a 1st Combat Evaluation Group team manned from existing Combat Skyspot operating locations. The site was developed under USAF Major Richard Secord (assisted by Tom Clines) by first [...] "clearing additional space on the white karst limestone mountaintop" [...] with blasting by a [...] "Navy Seabee demolitions expert".

This is a station composed of a VOR for civil bearing information and a <b>TACAN</b> for military bearing information and military/civil distance measuring information. The <b>TACAN</b> transponder performs the function of a DME without the need for a separate, co-located DME. Because the rotation of the antenna creates a large portion of the azimuth (bearing) signal, if the antenna fails, the azimuth component is no longer available and the <b>TACAN</b> downgrades to a DME only mode.|$|E
