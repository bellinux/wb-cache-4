40|$|A {{theoretical}} generalisation of the Fokker/Planck equation for atomic {{and molecular}} diffusion is {{compared with the}} results of a molecular dynamics simulation of a triatomic molecule of C_ 2 v symmetry. The molecular dynamics results are non-Markhovian and non-Gaussian in nature, markedly so {{in the case of the}} centre of mass linear velocity V. This may be ascertained by simulating the long-time limit of the three dimensional kinetic energy autocorrelation function /, which falls well below the <b>theoretical</b> <b>Gaussian</b> <b>value</b> of 3 / 5. By expressing the Mori continued fraction as a multidimensional Markhovian chain of differential equations and expressing this in turn as a non-Gaussian probability-diffusion equation of the Kramers/Moyal type it is possible to account for the simulation results in a qualitative fashion...|$|E

40|$|The present {{approaches}} on predicting {{stability of}} Delta-Sigma (Δ-Σ) modulators are mostly confined to DC inputs. This poses limitations as practical applications of Δ-Σ modulators involve {{a wide range}} of signals other than DC. In this paper, a quasi-linear model for Δ-Σ modulators with nonlinear feedback control analysis is presented that accurately predicts the stability of higher-order single-loop 1 -bit Δ-Σ modulators for various types of input signals such as single-sinusoids, dual-sinusoids, multiple-sinusoids and <b>Gaussian.</b> <b>Theoretical</b> <b>values</b> are shown to match closely with simulation results. The results of this paper would significantly speed up the design and evaluation of higher-order single-loop 1 -bit Δ-Σ modulators for various applications including those that may require multiple-sinusoidal inputs or any general input composed of a finite number of sinusoidal components, circumventing the need to perform detailed time-consuming simulations to quantify stability limits. By using the proposed method, the difference between the predicted and the actual stable amplitude limits results in an error of less than 1 dB in the in-band Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for 3 rd- and higher-order Δ-Σ modulators for single-sinusoidal inputs. For single-, dual-, multiple-sinusoidal and Gaussian inputs the error is less than 2 dB for the 5 th-order and reduces to less than 1 dB for 6 th- and higher-order Δ-Σ modulators...|$|R

40|$|Superresolution imaging {{techniques}} {{based on the}} precise localization of single molecules, such as photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), achieve high resolution by fitting images of single fluorescent molecules with a <b>theoretical</b> <b>Gaussian</b> to localize them with a precision {{on the order of}} tens of nanometers. PALM/STORM rely on photoactivated proteins or photoswitching dyes, respectively, which makes them technically challenging. We present a simple and practical way of producing point localization-based superresolution images that does not require photoactivatable or photoswitching probes. Called bleaching/blinking assisted localization microscopy (BaLM), the technique relies on the intrinsic bleaching and blinking behaviors characteristic of all commonly used fluorescent probes. To detect single fluorophores, we simply acquire a stream of fluorescence images. Fluorophore bleach or blink-off events are detected by subtracting from each image of the series the subsequent image. Similarly, blink-on events are detected by subtracting from each frame the previous one. After image subtractions, fluorescence emission signals from single fluorophores are identified and the localizations are determined by fitting the fluorescence intensity distribution with a <b>theoretical</b> <b>Gaussian.</b> We also show that BaLM works with a spectrum of fluorescent molecules in the same sample. Thus, BaLM extends single molecule-based superresolution localization to samples labeled with multiple conventional fluorescent probes...|$|R

50|$|The Gaussian filter is non-causal {{which means}} the filter window is {{symmetric}} about the origin in the time-domain. This makes the Gaussian filter physically unrealizable. This is usually of no consequence for applications where the filter bandwidth is {{much larger than the}} signal. In real-time systems, a delay is incurred because incoming samples need to fill the filter window before the filter {{can be applied to the}} signal. While no amount of delay can make a <b>theoretical</b> <b>Gaussian</b> filter causal (because the Gaussian function is non-zero everywhere), the Gaussian function converges to zero so rapidly that a causal approximation can achieve any required tolerance with a modest delay, even to the accuracy of floating point representation.|$|R

The <b>theoretical</b> <b>Gaussian</b> solution only applies to far-field plume dispersion where σz ∝ x 1 / 2 so a notable discrepancy should {{be observed in}} the near field where σz ∝ x. The streamwise location closest to the ground-level line source in the current wind tunnel experiments is at x[*]=[*] 22.5 h. Nonetheless, both results of wind-tunnel experiments and LES follow well the theoretical (far-field) Gaussian-concentration profiles. It is noteworthy that surface roughness indeed shortens the near-field extent (Ng and Liu 2013). It in turn favors {{the applicability of the}} parameterization newly developed in this paper.|$|R

The eigenfrequency spacing distribution varies according to the degree of ray chaos in the RC related to its geometry. The eigenmode distributions are also analyzed and compared to the <b>theoretical</b> <b>Gaussian</b> distribution: close to the lower useable frequency, the modes of the studied chaotic RC fairly respect this asymptotic property.

40|$|Abstract- Oscillator {{phase noise}} (PN) in {{orthogonal}} frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems can cause severe performance degradation.

Hence we have compared the accuracy of a <b>theoretical</b> <b>Gaussian</b> symbol error rate (SER) analysis to that of the simulated SER in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), frequency flat and frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels. In multipath channels the SER is evaluated jointly considering the fading effects on the OFDM signal and ICI.

However in fading channels, the difference between the simulated and the theoretical results is marginal. I...|$|R

From field data, near-field effects are noted to at most half a wavelength and lateral discontinuities identified by marked changes in wavenumber with offset.
