Colt tried alternate materials such as rubber cement, but settled on a thin type of tinfoil. In 1841 he made samples of these cartridges for the army. During tests of the foil cartridges, 25 rounds were fired from a musket without cleaning. When the breech plug was removed from the barrel no fouling from the <b>tin</b> <b>foil</b> was evident.

50|$|A foil is a {{very thin}} sheet of metal, usually made by {{hammering}} or rolling.

For example, aluminium foil is usually about 1/1000 inch (0.03 mm), whereas gold (more malleable than aluminium) can be made into foil only a few atoms thick, called gold leaf. Extremely thin foil is called metal leaf. Leaf tears very easily and must be picked up with special brushes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hot foil}} trick is a magic trick {{in which the}} magician places {{a small piece of}} <b>tin</b> or {{aluminium}} <b>foil</b> in a volunteer's hand, and the foil begins to rapidly increase in temperature until the volunteer has to drop it to avoid scalding their hand, and the foil is reduced to ashes on the ground.

This trick can be very dangerous, since many of the chemicals used it to perform it are highly toxic; mercury(II) chloride was at one point commonly sold in magic stores in the United States, but as of 2009 most such shops had stopped stocking it due to its toxic nature.|$|R
40|$|The long-standing archaeological {{research}} of the Serbian Vinča culture sites of Belovode and Plocnik has been strengthened with the joint collaborative work with the UCL Institute of Archaeology in the past 6 years. This collaboration yielded scientific demonstration of the world’s earliest copper smelting amongst the excavated materials, c. 7000 years old. In the six years since the first publication of this finding in 2010, a number of detailed analytical studies followed, together with another breakthrough discovery of the world’s earliest tin bronze artefact. This artefact was excavated in a secure context within a Vinča culture settlement feature {{at the site of}} Pločnik, which was radiocarbon dated to c. 4650 BC. On the basis of the early metallurgical results from Belovode, the UK Government funded a large international collaborative project from 2012 - 2015. This included Serbian, British and German teams all of whom brought substantial experience and cutting-edge technology {{to the study of the}} evolution of the earliest known metal-making in its 5 th millennium BC Balkan cultural context. This project’s forthcoming publications, including a major monograph published by UCL Press, which will be free to download, promise to shed new light on the life of the first metal-making communities in Eurasia, and also outline integrated methodological approaches that will serve as a model for similar projects worldwide. The open, balanced and respectful research atmosphere within our core project team is currently being challenged by an unsubstantiated controversy. This controversy arises from accusations against the project team members by Duško Šljivar, a once an extremely supportive and prominent member of our team. Each of these accusations by Duško Šljivar is completely contradictory to his own previous documented work, and have therefore easily been refuted. The work by Duško Šljivar in question encompasses: two decades of excavations at the sites of Belovode and Pločnik; including single-authored and joint publications prior to 2012, including those with Miljana Radivojević and Julka Kuzmanović-Cvetković; and official field documentation, either signed off solely by him, or together with his co-excavator at the site of Pločnik, Julka Kuzmanović-Cvetković. The first accusation, published in 2014, saw Duško Šljivar deny, together with another colleague, the veracity of his original field journal notes on the context of the previously mentioned <b>tin</b> bronze <b>foil,</b> for which he received an immediate and successful rebuttal. In the second accusation, published in Starinar LXV/ 2015, Duško Šljivar continued with the same practice of denying his own official field journals and publications which he (co-) authored with a series of false accusations relating to the manipulation of the original data from the excavations of the sites of Belovode and Pločnik by Radivojević and Kuzmanović-Cvetković. In the third accusation, Šljivar argues that his copyright was infringed, and that field journals were used without permission. This is despite the fact that these accusations are legally and formally unsupported, and that he shared his data and materials during the course of a long collaboration and co-authorship on a number of articles with both Radivojević and Kuzmanović- Cvetković over the course of the last two decades. In other words, in order to validate his accusations and to seek to damage our untainted academic standings, Duško Šljivar has denied all his professional and academic achievements, research articles, field diaries and formal documents that he ever (co-) wrote and/or signed on the topic. He even goes as far as to exclude a landmark joint publication in an international peer-reviewed scientific journal (Radivojević et al. 2010) from his citation list in order to support his claim that a formal agreement on the joint publishing of Belovode metallurgy results has never been fulfilled. Šljivar also omitted the published rebuttal (Radivojević et al. 2014) to unsubstantiated claims on alleged manipulation of contextual data of the <b>tin</b> bronze <b>foil</b> from the Vinča culture site of Pločnik put forward in a joint article by him and another colleague (Šljivar and Borić 2014). In order to end this malicious debate, we present our rebuttal from 2014 and further elaborate upon it by showing the original quotes from the Pločnik field diary on the day that the <b>tin</b> bronze <b>foil</b> in question was found, and from the concluding remarks of the diary in question. We again clearly demonstrate that there has never been any doubt regarding the secure context of the <b>tin</b> bronze <b>foil</b> within the Vinča culture material, that the Vinča horizon is the only cultural occupation at the site of Pločnik and that no intrusion has ever been observed in the context of this find, not on the day of the discovery, not in the conclusions or the excavation field diary, and not in the first publication of the said find by Duško Šljivar. We have presented a detailed account of this particular case in order to show Šljivar’s contradictory and inconsistent account of the official fieldwork documentation that he co-authored. It would appear that either Šljivar made a false field diary entry regarding the context of the <b>tin</b> bronze <b>foil</b> on the day of its discovery in 2008, or he presented incorrect information in the later joint commentary. The former hypothesis that Šljivar made a false entry in the field diary in 2008 in order to potentially mislead later scholarship does not seem plausible, especially as the object of dispute was not identified as tin-bronze on the day of discovery, but merely as another copper object from Pločnik and therefore not nearly as important to early metallurgical scholarship. To underline further the absurdity of the situation in which we found ourselves with Šljivar, we should also mention Šljivar’s initial agreement to co-author the paper we published in Starinar XLIV/ 2014, from which he withdrew without offering any constructive comments, only to publicly publish his views as well as professional and personal insults directed towards us in Starinar XLV/ 2015. The situation where Šljivar had the opportunity to act in his best professional interest was while our article was still in preparation and he chose not to do it; this leads us to assume that professional interests were not his priority on this matter. Finally, Šljivar’s deceitful and erroneous claims were executed in a spiteful language that is unfit for a scholarly journal, and damages both his reputation and the decision of this journal to publish them. We further elaborate on these developments in the broader context of Serbian archaeology, quoting the legislation on the intellectual copyright of excavation directors over the archaeological materials that they have excavated. The current law on Cultural Monuments recognizes the exclusive rights of excavation directors to publish their research for the period of 12 months after the excavations ended. After this period, other interested parties in the field can access the materials and any related field documentation. This demonstrates, alongside previously mentioned scientific arguments, that we have worked with the Belovode and Pločnik materials in accordance with the valid legal regulations. We conclude that there is no formal support for the exclusive interpretation of lives of communities in the sites of Belovode and Pločnik c. 7000 years ago, and emphasise the value of our original scientific contribution as illuminating a particular economic activity of the inhabitants of these two prehistoric villages. Finally, we call for the reinforcement of existing procedures in Serbia so that our profession can prevent any future misconduct such as that exemplified in the attempt by Duško Šljivar...|$|R
500|$|The {{science of}} conserving fossil remains {{was in its}} infancy, and new {{techniques}} had to be improvised {{to deal with what}} soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease". Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate, accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural chemical conversion began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with hide glue, finishing with a final layer of <b>tin</b> <b>foil.</b> Damage was repaired with papier-mâché. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol, arsenic, and 390 kilograms of shellac. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.|$|E

Besides aluminum or tin, organic material such as leaves (of tree, [...] "Nelumbo nucifera" [...] lotus, [...] "Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro" [...] bamboo aka Bambusa oldhamii (麻竹葉), phragmites, plantain, taro, etc.), husks (of corn, [...] "Phyllostachys makinoi" [...] bamboo (桂竹籜), etc.), and skins of fruit (citrus, etc.) are also frequently employed. Tree leaves such as those from the banana tree do not burn/ignite as they contain enough oil to resist {{the heat from the}} flames (at least until the frying is complete). The way to adapt recipes where food is wrapped in foil is to use a barrier such as baking or silicone paper between the food and the foil; the overall technique is similar to the en papillote technique developed in French cuisine, but uses a more robust container.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} theoretical {{study of the}} stability of the gas-phase diatomic dications SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + using ab initio computer calculations. The ground states of SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + are thermodynamically stable, respectively, with dissociation energies of 0. 45, 0. 30, and 0. 42 eV. Whereas SnF 2 + dissociates into Sn 2 + + F, the long range behaviour of the potential energy curves of SnCl 2 + and SnO 2 + is repulsive and wide barrier heights due to avoided crossing act as a kind of effective dissociation energy. Their equilibrium internuclear distances are 4. 855, 5. 201, and 4. 852 a(0), respectively. The double ionisation energies (T-e) to form SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + from their respective neutral parents are 25. 87, 23. 71, and 25. 97 eV. We combine our theoretical work with the experimental results of a search for these doubly positively charged diatomic molecules in the gas phase. SnO 2 + and SnF 2 + have been observed for prolonged oxygen (O- 16 (-)) ion beam sputtering of a <b>tin</b> metal <b>foil</b> and of <b>tin</b> (II) fluoride (SnF 2) powder, respectively, for ion flight times of about 10 (- 5) s through a magnetic-sector mass spectrometer. In addition, SnCl 2 + has been detected for O- 16 (-) ion surface bombardment of stannous (tin (II)) chloride (SnCl 2) powder. To our knowledge, SnF 2 + is a novel gas-phase molecule, whereas SnCl 2 + had been detected previously by electron-impact ionization mass spectrometry, and SnO 2 + had been observed before by spark source mass spectrometry as well as by atom probe mass spectrometry. We are not aware of any previous theoretical studies of these molecular systems. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

2500|$|The gold-leaf {{electroscope}} {{was one of}} the [...] instruments used {{to indicate}} electric charge. It is still used for science demonstrations but has been superseded in most applications by electronic measuring instruments. The instrument consists of two thin leaves of gold foil suspended from an electrode. [...] When the electrode is charged by induction or by contact, the leaves acquire similar electric charges and repel each other due to the Coulomb force. Their separation is a direct indication of the net charge stored on them. On the glass opposite the leaves, pieces of <b>tin</b> <b>foil</b> may be pasted, so that when the leaves diverge fully they may discharge into the ground. [...] The leaves may be enclosed in a glass envelope to protect them from drafts, and the envelope may be evacuated to minimize charge leakage. A further cause of charge leakage is ionizing radiation, so to prevent this, the electrometer must be surrounded by lead shielding. [...] This principle has been used to detect ionizing radiation, as seen in the quartz fibre electrometer and Kearny fallout meter.|$|E
