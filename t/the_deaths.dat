The majority of fatalities, from both {{the war and the}} epidemic, were among young adults. <b>The</b> <b>deaths</b> caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the war or as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the flu may not have had a great, separate, psychological impact, or may have seemed a mere extension of the war's tragedies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Death</b> Guardian: <b>The</b> <b>death</b> {{guardian}} has {{an ominous}} appearance, {{that of a}} black creature with large horns, long hoof-like legs, thin spider-like arms, and extra-long three fingered hands. In the beginning of <b>the</b> game, <b>the</b> <b>death</b> guardian is seen taking possession of Balthazar after finding <b>the</b> <b>death</b> disc, and promising him more power. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> guardian would later appear in the game in only a short movie, but still {{be in control of}} Balthazar. This is evident with the added mechanical appendages and other materials seen on Balthazar's body. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> guardian appears again when Azurik finds his way into <b>the</b> <b>death</b> realm and finds <b>the</b> <b>death</b> disc. It is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> guardian only possessed Balthazar in order to restore balance to the elements and Perathia. Azurik doesn't engage in a fight with <b>the</b> <b>death</b> guardian, for he handed <b>the</b> <b>death</b> disc over to be put in its proper place. This is short lived when Balthazar destroys the guardian and takes up his position as the controller of life and <b>death</b> in Perathia. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> guardian's final appearance {{is at the end of}} the game, when Azurik defeated Balthazar and left him in <b>the</b> <b>death</b> realm. Balthazar is laying on a lab table when <b>the</b> <b>death</b> realm minions come and restrain him. Balthazar is then greeted by <b>the</b> <b>death</b> guardian's disembodied head as it merges with his. This seems to mean that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> guardian has found a new host body.|$|R

5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been responsible for <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not responsible for <b>the</b> <b>deaths,</b> resolutely continuing to blame the Việt Cộng.

40|$|With the {{increased}} fervor surrounding <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty, many religious sects have re-examined {{their position on}} this issue.

In this Essay, Professor Thomas C.

Part I of the Essay documents how Roman Catholics and evangelical Protestants traditionally approach <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty. In this section, Professor Berg concludes that critics of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty can use theological arguments, as well as practical concerns about <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty, to persuade both groups to oppose <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty.
