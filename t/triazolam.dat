5|$|Short-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 1–12 hours. They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, rebound insomnia may occur upon discontinuation, {{and they might}} cause daytime withdrawal symptoms such as next day rebound anxiety with prolonged usage. Examples are brotizolam, midazolam, and <b>triazolam.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like <b>triazolam</b> that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or <b>triazolam.</b> Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and <b>triazolam</b> and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{effects of}} <b>triazolam</b> {{are similar to}} those of most other benzodiazepines. <b>Triazolam</b> does not generate active metabolites. <b>Triazolam</b> is a short acting benzodiazepine, is lipophilic, and is metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. The main pharmacological effects of <b>triazolam</b> are the enhancement of the neurotransmitter GABA at the GABAA receptor. The half-life of <b>triazolam</b> is only 2 hours making it a very short acting benzodiazepine drug. <b>Triazolam</b> has anticonvulsant effects on brain function.|$|E
25|$|A 1985 {{study found}} that {{temazepam}} and <b>triazolam</b> maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, <b>triazolam,</b> diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and <b>triazolam</b> over {{all the rest of the}} benzodiazepines included in the study.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triazolam</b> {{is usually}} used for {{short-term}} treatment of acute insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including jet lag. It {{is an ideal}} benzodiazepine for this use because its fast onset of action and short half-life. It puts a person to sleep for not more than 1.5 hours (approximately 1–2 hours), allowing its user to avoid morning drowsiness. <b>Triazolam</b> is also sometimes used as an adjuvant in medical procedures requiring anesthesia or to reduce anxiety during brief events like MRI scans and non-surgical dental procedures. <b>Triazolam</b> is ineffective in maintaining sleep however, due to its short half-life with quazepam showing superiority.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triazolam</b> was {{initially}} patented in 1970 {{and went on}} sale in the United States in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Death {{can occur}} from <b>triazolam</b> {{overdose}} but {{is more likely}} to occur in combination with other depressant drugs such as opioids, alcohol, or tricyclic antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triazolam</b> is a {{drug that}} is used non-medically: {{recreational}} use wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high or continued long-term dosing against medical advice.|$|E
25|$|In {{tests in}} {{pentobarbital}} trained rhesus monkeys benzodiazepines produced effects similar to barbiturates. In a 1991 study, <b>triazolam</b> {{had the highest}} self-administration rate in cocaine trained baboons, among the five benzodiazepines examined: alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, <b>triazolam.</b> A 1985 study found that <b>triazolam</b> and temazepam maintained higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. A 1991 study indicated that diazepam, in particular, had a greater abuse liability among people who were drug abusers than did many of the other benzodiazepines. Some of the available data also suggested that lorazepam and alprazolam are more diazepam-like in having relatively high abuse liability, while oxazepam, halazepam, and possibly chlordiazepoxide, are relatively low in this regard. A 1991–1993 British study found that the hypnotics flurazepam and temazepam were more toxic than average benzodiazepines in overdose. A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Clinically {{significant}} {{drug interactions}} with the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline, the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide, the CYP2D6 substrate desipramine, and the CYP3A4 substrate <b>triazolam</b> have all been demonstrated with cimetidine, and interactions with other substrates of these enzymes are likely as well.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to its}} slow rate of {{absorption}} and its {{slow onset}} of action, oxazepam has a relatively low potential for abuse compared to some other benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, flunitrazepam, or <b>triazolam,</b> which have a high potential for abuse similar to barbiturates.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines all bind unselectively to the GABAA receptor. Some theorize {{that certain}} benzodiazepines (hypnotic benzodiazepines) have {{significantly}} higher {{activity at the}} α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor compared to other benzodiazepines (for example, <b>triazolam</b> and temazepam have significantly higher activity at the α1 subunit compared to alprazolam and diazepam, making them superior sedative-hypnotics– alprazolam and diazepam, in turn, have higher activity at the α2 subunit compared to <b>triazolam</b> and temazepam, making them superior anxiolytic agents). Modulation of the α1 subunit is associated with sedation, motor impairment, respiratory depression, amnesia, ataxia, and reinforcing behavior (drug-seeking behavior). Modulation of the α2 subunit is associated with anxiolytic activity and disinhibition. For this reason, certain benzodiazepines may be better suited to treat insomnia than others.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcoholics, or other drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. <b>Triazolam</b> belongs to the Pregnancy Category X of the FDA. This means that it {{is known to have}} the potential to cause birth defects.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{are one of}} {{the largest}} classes of abused drugs; they are classed as {{schedule}} IV controlled drugs because of their recognized medical uses. Across the world the most frequently diverted and abused benzodiazepines include temazepam, diazepam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, <b>triazolam,</b> flunitrazepam, midazolam, and in the United States alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam.|$|E
25|$|In Hong Kong {{abuse of}} {{prescription}} medicinal preparations continued in 2006 and seizures of midazolam (120,611 tablets), nimetazepam/nitrazepam (17,457 tablets), <b>triazolam</b> (1,071 tablets), diazepam (48,923 tablets) and chlordiazepoxide (5,853 tablets) were made. Heroin addicts used such tablets (crushed and mixed with heroin) {{to prolong the}} effect of the narcotic and ease withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triazolam,</b> {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes {{impairments}} in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. There can be daytime withdrawal effects.|$|E
25|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults {{of all ages and}} that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including <b>triazolam,</b> the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. One study found no evidence of sustained hypnotic efficacy throughout the 9 weeks of treatment for <b>triazolam.</b>|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} {{sometimes}} used for drug facilitated sexual assaults and robbery, however, alcohol {{remains the most}} common drug involved in drug facilitated assaults. The muscle relaxant, disinhibiting and amnesia producing effects of benzodiazepines are the pharmacological properties which make these drugs effective in drug-facilitated crimes. Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer admitted to using <b>triazolam</b> (Halcion), and occasionally temazepam (Restoril), in order to sedate his victims prior to murdering them.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance {{may occur}} to {{quazepam}} but {{more slowly than}} seen with other benzodiazepines such as <b>triazolam.</b> However, quazepam causes significantly less drug tolerance and less withdrawal symptoms including less rebound insomnia upon discontinuation compared to other benzodiazepines. Quazepam may cause less rebound effects than other type1 benzodiazepine receptor selective nonbenzodiazepine drugs due to its longer half-life. Short-acting hypnotics often cause next day rebound anxiety. Quazepam due to its pharmacological profile does not cause next day rebound withdrawal effects during treatment.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam {{interacts with}} the {{antibiotic}} erythromycin which is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, which affects concentration peak time. This interaction is not believed to be clinically important. However, anxiety, tremor, and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and <b>triazolam.</b> Following administration of erythromycin to the patient, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had acute pneumonia and renal failure. Coadministration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other significant physical complications.|$|E
25|$|Quazepam is {{selective}} for type I benzodiazepine receptors containing the α1 subunit, {{similar to other}} drugs such as zaleplon and zolpidem. As a result, quazepam {{has little or no}} muscle relaxant properties. Most other benzodiazepines are unselective and bind to type1 GABAA receptors and type2 GABAA receptors. Type1 GABAA receptors include the α1 subunit containing GABAA receptors which are responsible for hypnotic properties of the drug. Type 2 receptors include the α2, α3 and α5 subunits which are responsible for anxiolytic action, amnesia and muscle relaxant properties. Thus quazepam may have less side effects than other benzodiazepines but, it has a very long half-life of 25 hours which reduces its benefits as a hypnotic due to likely next day sedation. It also has two active metabolites with half-lives of 28 and 79 hours. Quazepam may also cause less drug tolerance than other benzodiazepines such as temazepam and <b>triazolam</b> perhaps due to its subtype selectivity. The longer half-life of quazepam may have the advantage however, of causing less rebound insomnia than shorter acting subtype selective nonbenzodiazepines. However, one of the major metabolites of quazepam, the N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam (aka N-desalkylflurazepam), binds unselectively to both type1 and type2 GABAA receptors. The N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam metabolite also has a very long half-life and likely contributes to the pharmacological effects of quazepam.|$|E
500|$|In East Asia and Southeast Asia, {{temazepam}} and nimetazepam {{are often}} heavily controlled and restricted. In certain countries, <b>triazolam,</b> flunitrazepam, flutoprazepam and midazolam are also restricted or controlled to certain degrees. [...] In Hong Kong, all benzodiazepines are regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Previously only brotizolam, flunitrazepam and <b>triazolam</b> were classed as dangerous drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Ketoconazole and Itraconazole have a {{profound}} effect on the pharmacokinetics of <b>triazolam,</b> leading to greatly enhanced effects. Anxiety, tremor and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and <b>triazolam.</b> Following administration of erythromycin, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had, however, acute pneumonia and renal failure. Co-administration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other physical complications. Caffeine reduces the effectiveness of <b>triazolam.</b> Other important interactions include cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin, [...] fluconazole, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, [...] rifampicin, ritonavir, and troleandomycin. <b>Triazolam</b> should not be administered to patients on Atripla.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Triazolam</b> (original {{brand name}} Halcion) {{is a central}} nervous system (CNS) {{depressant}} in the benzodiazepine class. It possesses pharmacological properties {{similar to those of}} other benzodiazepines, but it is generally only used as a sedative to treat severe insomnia. In addition to the hypnotic properties <b>triazolam</b> possesses, amnesic, anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties are pronounced [...] as well. Due to its short half-life, <b>triazolam</b> is not effective for patients who suffer from frequent awakenings or early wakening.|$|E
2500|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} the use of <b>triazolam</b> include: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Triazolam,</b> {{although}} a short-acting benzodiazepine, may cause residual impairment {{into the next}} day, especially the next morning. A meta-analysis demonstrated that residual [...] "hangover" [...] effects after nighttime administration of <b>triazolam</b> such as sleepiness, psychomotor impairment, and diminished cognitive functions may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures. Confusion and amnesia have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Triazolam</b> is a Schedule IV drug {{under the}} Convention on Psychotropic Substances [...] and the US Controlled Substances Act.|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} found that long-term use of benzodiazepines, including <b>triazolam,</b> is associated with drug tolerance, drug dependence, rebound insomnia, and CNS related adverse effects. It recommended that benzodiazepine hypnotics are used at their lowest possible dose and {{for a short period of}} time. Non-pharmacological treatment options were found to yield sustained improvements in sleep quality. [...] A worsening of insomnia (rebound insomnia) compared to baseline may occur after discontinuation of <b>triazolam,</b> even following short-term single-nightly-dose therapy.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Triazolam</b> is {{frequently}} prescribed as a sleep aid for passengers travelling on {{short to medium}} duration flights. [...] If this use is contemplated, {{it is especially important}} the user avoids the consumption of alcoholic beverages, and tries a ground based [...] "rehearsal" [...] of the medication to ensure that the side effects and potency of this medication are understood by the user prior to using it in a relatively more public environment (as disinhibition can be a common side effect, with potentially severe consequences).|$|E
2500|$|In late 1992, the Radiccio EP barely {{reached the}} UK top 40, but it {{included}} {{one of their}} most popular songs, [...] "Halcyon". The track featured a sample of Kirsty Hawkshaw from [...] "It's a Fine Day" [...] (a chart hit for Opus III earlier that year). The B-side [...] "The Naked and the Dead" [...] was similarly based on a line from Scott Walker's rendition of Jacques Brel's song [...] "Next". [...] "Halcyon" [...] was dedicated to the Hartnolls' mother, who was addicted to the tranquiliser Halcion (<b>Triazolam)</b> for many years.|$|E
2500|$|This {{disorder}} is usually acquired {{in one of}} four ways: One cause is benzodiazepine drugs such as; midazolam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, [...] nitrazepam, <b>triazolam,</b> clonazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, and nimetazepam; {{all of which are}} known to have powerful amnesic effects. This has also been recorded in non-benzodiazapine sedatives or [...] "z-drugs" [...] which act on the same set of receptors; such as zolpidem (also known as Ambien), eszopiclone (also known as [...] Lunesta), and zopiclone (also known by brand names Imovane and Zimovane). A second cause is a traumatic brain injury in which damage is usually done to the hippocampus or surrounding cortices. It may also be caused by a shocking event or an emotional disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Daytime reemergence and rebound {{withdrawal}} symptoms, {{sometimes called}} interdose withdrawal, may occur once dependence has set in. Reemergence is {{the return of}} symptoms for which the drug was initially prescribed, in contrast, rebound symptoms are a return of the symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was initially taken for, but at a more intense level than before. Withdrawal symptoms, on the other hand, may appear {{for the first time}} during dose reduction, and include insomnia, anxiety, distress, weight loss, panic, depression, derealization, and paranoia, and are more commonly associated with short-acting benzodiazepines discontinuation, like <b>triazolam.</b> [...] Daytime symptoms can occur after a few days to a few weeks of administration of nightly benzodiazepine use or z-drugs such as zopiclone; withdrawal-related insomnia rebounds worse than baseline even when benzodiazepines are used intermittently.|$|E
2500|$|In France, Pascal Kintz and {{his colleagues}} were able to {{demonstrate}} the use of entomotoxicology to detect toxins that were not discovered during the analysis of body tissues and fluids of a body found roughly two months after death. [...] A liquid chromatography analysis on organ tissue and Calliphoridae larvae found at the scene revealed the existence of five prescription medications. [...] <b>Triazolam,</b> however, was only detected {{in the analysis of}} maggots and not in organ tissue samples. [...] Comparative research showed increased sensitivity of toxicological analysis of Diptera samples over decomposed body tissues. [...] A similar case involved the discovery of the remains of a 29-year-old known to abuse drugs, last seen alive five months prior. [...] Through the use of GC and GC-MS techniques, Nolte and his partners discovered the presence of cocaine in decomposed muscle tissue and in maggots found on the body. [...] However, due to the severity of decomposition of the muscle tissue, more suitable drug samples (devoid of decomposition byproducts) were reared from the maggots.|$|E
