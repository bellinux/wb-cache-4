5|$|As the {{fighting}} was seemingly coming to an end, Carmelo Anthony confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground.

Collins also ran down the court to get at Anthony but was blocked by Nenê and Smith.

5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but <b>tripped</b> <b>over</b> the barricade. André picked him up out of the crowd and put him back behind the barricade. When Henry was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|Knopf {{decided to}} produce The Big Pond in New York and {{appointed}} Hepburn the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired {{and replaced with}} Hepburn, which gave her a starring role only four weeks into her theatre career. On opening night, she turned up late, mixed her lines, <b>tripped</b> <b>over</b> her feet, and spoke too quickly to be comprehensible. She was immediately fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted {{the role of a}} schoolgirl in These Days. Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights. Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry's play Holiday. In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, a college acquaintance. She planned to leave the theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months.|$|E

25|$|A rare lunchtime {{kick-off}} was {{the scene}} of Napoli's visit to the Tardini, just the second home game the Crociati had had in a run of seven. Napoli had won four in a row before this game, but they were dominated by an impressive Parma performance. Gianluca Musacci, however, appear to have tripped Edison Cavani in the penalty area late on in the second half, although replays suggested that Cavani <b>tripped</b> <b>over</b> his feet. He picked himself up to take the penalty, had it saved by Mirante, but was quickest to react to poke it home to give Napoli the lead. The parallels with last week's penalty against Genoa were strong: the referee's decision was questionable and Mirante saved, but could only push it into the taker's path. Parma continued to dominate in the second half and should have had a penalty for an Andrea Dossena handball, but eventually scored through Cristian Zaccardo's tap-in with not long left to go. As Parma pressed for the winner, Napoli broke and Ezequiel Lavezzi scored, although replays suggest he was offside.|$|E

25|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, San Diego drove to the Bengals 38-yard line, only to lose their fourth {{turnover}} {{of the day when}} Reggie Williams stripped the ball from Chuck Muncie and Cincinnati lineman Ross Browner recovered it. Then Anderson went to work, rushing three times for 31 yards and completing a 19-yard pass to Ross on a drive that moved the ball inside the San Diego 10-yard line. Following three incompletions and a touchdown called back by a holding penalty, Breech's 38-yard field goal made the score 20–7. On their next drive, Anderson's five completions moved the ball deep into Chargers territory, but defensive back Willie Buchanon put an end to it when he recovered a fumble from Ross that had been forced by Woodrow Lowe. The Chargers then drove to the Bengals 20-yard line, but on third down, Fouts <b>tripped</b> <b>over</b> the foot of guard Doug Wilkerson and was downed for an 11-yard loss. Then Benirschke missed a 50-yard field goal try on the next play.|$|E
25|$|On to the Adelaide Oval, {{or rather}} {{not as the}} SACA ringed off the famously long curves, much to the {{disappointment}} of those who liked seeing all-run fives when batsmen hit a straight-drive. South Australia had not won the Sheffield Shield for ten years, but were to do so again in 1963-64 {{with the help of}} their multi-talented import Gary Sobers. They were captained by the old favourite Les Favell and had a 19-year-old Ian Chappell in the team, but their Chinaman bowler David Sincock was unable to play because of his exams. The Melbourne Cup was due to be played during the match, so Ted Dexter and the Duke were off to the races and Colin Cowdrey was in charge. Favell won the toss, batted, and saw his side make steady progress to 324/7 {{by the end of the}} day. Favell was first out for 7 and his fellow-opener John Causby was run out by Ken Barrington and wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 16, but John Lill (87) and Gary Sobers (42) stroked their way to a third-wicket stand of 113 before they were both out on 154, along with Neil Dansie for a duck and South Australia were 154/4. Ian McLachlan (53) and Ian Chappell (36) added 66 before the youngster <b>tripped</b> <b>over</b> himself while hooking Brian Statham and hit the wicket with his bat. Statham (4/58) cleared up the tail with 3 wickets for 11 runs and South Australia were out for 335. Fred Titmus (1/80) and Ray Illingworth (0/43) failed to turn the ball on the notoriously flat wicket and Cowdrey set up defensive fields which rather relied on the batsmen getting themselves out, still the runs flowed enough and the crowd enjoyed themselves. Cowdrey was out for this third consecutive duck when acting as opener, but everybody else had a fine time; Geoff Pullar (21) added 55 for the second-wicket with Ken Barrington (102), who added another 168 with the stylish Tom Graveney (99), beating the third-wicket record for the MCC vs South Australia set by Plum Warner and George Gunn in 1911-12. Graveney was the more polished of the two, but Barrington hit Neil Hawke (6/130) for 4 boundaries in five balls. They and Peter Parfitt (15) were all out by 257/5, but the depth of the MCC batting was shown by Fred Titmus who hit a solid 137 not out, his highest first class century, adding 108 runs with Barry Knight (55) and 121 with wicket-keeper Alan Smith (another 55) and Cowdrey declared on 508/9. South Australia knocked off the 173 run deficit the same day, making 174/5 by stumps, with Sobers (99) run out by Statham going for his 100th run and everybody else chipping in. A shower of rain allowed everybody to get off the field to watch the Melbourne Cup and Favell declared on 283/7 to leave the MCC 67 minutes to make 111 runs. They made 95/1, thanks to some quick hitting by Pullar (56), but after playing into more rain they gave up 16 runs short in an affable, but farcical end. On a flat wicket with indifferent bowling the teams made 1,221 runs in four days despite the rain.|$|E

The bunkers contained thousands of cases of weapons and ammunition, all of which were turned over to the Cambodian army.

Breaking forward with the ball from the half-way line, Matthews combined with his team-mate Ernie Taylor, which culminated in Stan Mortensen getting the better of his marker and shooting past Kelsey.|$|E
