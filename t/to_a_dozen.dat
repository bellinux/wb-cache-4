5|$|Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), {{the score}} for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and {{incidental}} music <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> plays between 1850 and 1916. Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier.|$|E
5|$|Vivekananda {{spent nearly}} two years lecturing in the eastern and central United States, {{primarily}} in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, and New York. He founded the Vedanta Society of New York in 1894. By spring 1895 his busy, tiring schedule had affected his health. He ended his lecture tours and began giving free, private classes in Vedanta and yoga. Beginning in June 1895, Vivekananda gave private lectures <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> of his disciples at Thousand Island Park in New York for two months.|$|E
5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 300 to 500 mercenaries, Katanga had approximately 14,000 to 17,000 gendarmes in its service, of whom around 7,000 had not received military training. Through reconnaissance, the UN had learned that these forces were concentrated on defending the southern tier of the province (much of the north was already under central government control), with about 5,150 troops {{in and around the}} towns of Jadotville, Kolwezi, and Bunkeya. Another 2,000 garrisoned Élisabethville. The UN also estimated that the Katangese Air Force possessed a number of Harvards, Magisters, and de Havilland Vampires, amounting <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> combat aircraft, as well as some other transport aircraft and small planes. However, they believed that many Katangese aircraft were unserviceable. ONUC intelligence observed limited stockpiles of ammunition, petroleum, oil, and lubricants at a few airfields.|$|E
5|$|Using Iraqi passports, Oan {{and three}} {{other members of the}} DRFLA arrived in London on 31 March 1980 and rented a flat in Earls Court. They claimed they had met by chance on the flight. The men {{typically}} returned to the flat drunk, late at night, and sometimes accompanied by prostitutes. Within a week, the housekeeper asked them to leave. They soon found another flat, where they told their new landlord they were moving because they had been joined by other men and required larger accommodation. Over the following days, the group swelled, with up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> men in the flat on one occasion.|$|E
5|$|Many Wielbark graves were flat, but kurgans {{are also}} {{characteristic}} and common. In {{the case of}} kurgans the grave was covered with stones, which were surrounded by a circle made of larger stones. More earth material was piled to cover all that, with a solitary stone, or stela often put on top. Such a kurgan could include one or several individual burials, have a diameter of up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or so meters and be up to one meter high. On some burial grounds large stone circles are found. These consist of massive boulders or rock pieces, up to 1.7 meters high, separated by several meters wide spaces, sometimes connected by smaller stones, the whole structure having a 10 to 40 meter diameter. In {{the middle of the}} circles one to four stelae were placed, and sometimes a single grave. The stone circles are believed to be the locations of meetings of Scandinavian (see below) tings - assemblies or courts. The single graves inside the circles are probably of people sacrificed and buried there - human offerings to the gods, to assure their support for the deliberations. A stone kurgans cemetery was found in Węsiory, Kartuzy County; another burial site with ten large stone circles was discovered in Odry, Chojnice County, both dated 2nd century AD.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} newcomers {{represented the}} Linear Pottery culture. Their uniform culture survived in Poland {{in its original}} form until about 4600 BCE. Despite the big impact they made, the first waves came in small numbers - hundreds, or at most a few thousand people, judging by the sizes of the known settlements. They populated mainly fertile soils of southern highlands and river valleys further north, {{all the way to}} the Baltic Sea. They lived alongside the more numerous native people who were still pursuing the Mesolithic lifestyle, but during the Linear Pottery culture times there wasn't much interaction, as the two groups inhabited different environments. Their villages consisted of several, but sometimes up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or so rectangular communal long-houses, some over 30 meters long, supported by wooden posts, the oldest of which come from the Lower Silesia region. One such location from about 5000 BCE was also unearthed at Olszanica, which is now at the west end of Kraków just within the city limits.|$|E

This style was kept until the 1970s and 1980s, by which time the units had twenty seats plus cramped room for many standing passengers.|$|E
25|$|Customarily, woven {{patterns}} and dyed repeat patterns are considered informal. Formal kimonos have free-style designs dyed {{over the whole}} surface or along the hem. During the Heian period, kimonos were worn with up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or more colorful contrasting layers, with each combination of colors being a named pattern. Today, the kimono is normally worn with {{a single layer on}} top of one or more undergarments.|$|E

25|$|In the west, {{around the}} end of the 19th century, the game was played by boys up to about twelve years of age. Hoops would at times have pairs of tin squares nailed {{to the inside of the}} circle, to jingle as the hoop was rolled. Up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> such pairs of rattles might be placed around the rim of the hoop. Some {{preferred}} the ashen hoops, round on the outside and flat on the inside, to the ones made of iron, as the latter could break windows and hurt the legs of the passers by and horses.|$|E

Kerr would only acquiesce <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen.</b> The book, The Double-Cross System in the War of 193945, was finally published in February 1972, with a foreword by Pearson, who guardedly did not refer to his work in the Committee. Masterman himself wrote the book without revealing anything about Ultra, still highly secret, that greatly aided the double-cross system. The ban on Ultra would be lifted in 1974.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{the company}} Global Horizons was indicted {{on charges of}} {{trafficking}} over 200 Thai workers. With the program, bonded labor, it was guaranteed that the workers were going to receive a visa, {{that would allow them}} to live and work in the United States. Upon arrival, the company made a false statement to lure the workers and having a higher recruitment. The fees that were imposed to the farm workers were so high, that the debt was impossible to pay with the employment they were given.

25|$|A {{generally}} applicable strategic planning approach. This third method {{does not require}} students to analyze hundreds of cases. A strategic planning model is provided and students are instructed to apply {{the steps of the}} model to six – and up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> cases – during a semester. This is sufficient to develop their ability to analyze a complex situation, generate a variety of possible strategies and to select the best ones. In effect, students learn a {{generally applicable}} approach to analyze cases studies and real situations. This approach does not make any extraordinary demands on the artistic and dramatic talents of the teacher. Consequently, most professors are capable of supervising application of this method.|$|E
25|$|The {{ships were}} used on an {{eastbound}} route from Bordeaux to Singapore (then in Japanese, thus Axis, hands) with cargoes of mercury, steel and aluminum bars, welding steel, bomb prototypes, 20 mm guns, blueprints for tanks and bombsights, and up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> passengers. Return trip loadings were 110-155 tons of rubber, 44-70 tons of zinc, five tons of tungsten, two tons of quinine, two tons of opium, bamboo, rattan, and passengers. Comandante Cappellini, Reginaldo Giuliani, and Enrico Tazzoli departed Bordeaux in May 1943.
