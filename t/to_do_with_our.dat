Co-writer James Wong also enjoyed the episode, saying [...] "I really love that show". Director R. W. Goodwin said of the episode, [...] "What's so unusual about [...] "One Breath" [...] is that it had very little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> usual X-File stuff. It was more about human emotions, drama, relationships".|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson {{granted that}} the {{experience}} of playing Led Zeppelin songs with Jimmy Page influenced Lions, but not on a song-by-song basis. [...] "Led Zeppelin's music is very dramatic and very dynamic. [...] That's something we've attempted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> style also. I think it definitely affected how we make our music." [...] Funk and R were bigger influences than on past albums, and [...] "Miracle to Me" [...] was influenced by Nick Drake.|$|E
500|$|In 1881 the observatory's director, Charles Carpmeal, {{suggested}} {{adding a}} high-quality telescope to the observatory. He felt that direct solar observations {{would lead to}} a better understanding of sunspot effects on weather (as late as 1910 the observatory's then-director, R. F. Stupart, noted that [...] "sun spots have more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> weather conditions than have the rings around the moon."). Coincidentally, the Canadian government (having formed in 1867) was interested in taking part in the major international effort to accurately record the December 1882 Transit of Venus.|$|E

500|$|A {{paramedic}} {{also said}} police allowed the first ambulances that reached Pearl Roundabout to pass safely, while some security personnel captured videos, {{but when the}} ambulances moved out carrying casualties security forces had targeted the vehicles. He said: [...] "Later Bahrain T.V. showed only the scenes where they allowed us to pass in order to mislead the public opinion. I personally heard orders given to security forces via their communication devices to target, threat and delay paramedics {{as long as they}} can. Security forces dealt with us as if we were defendants and partners to protesters who wanted to hide them, whereas what we were doing was a professional and humane duty that has nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> political position." [...] When the block was lifted in the late morning till noon, paramedics did not find any casualties to take back to the SMC at Pearl Roundabout, despite seeing handcuffed protesters being stomped on by police when they arrived.|$|E
500|$|Bill Veeck hired Lemon {{to succeed}} Paul Richards as the Chicago White Sox manager on November 16, 1976. Lemon {{took over a}} Chicago team that {{finished}} in last place in the AL West in 1976. [...] "Bob {{is the type of}} manager we need {{at this stage of the}} game", Veeck said. During spring training of 1977, Lemon said, [...] "I think we'll surprise a few people." [...] White Sox shortstop Alan Bannister quickly noticed a difference. Comparing Richards to Lemon, Bannister said, [...] "He'd post the lineups 10 minutes before the game, and only then we'd find out who was playing and where. Lemon's made it a serious operation." [...] As late as August 14, the White Sox were in first place in the AL West. The White Sox finished with a 90–72 record, a 26-game improvement. The team finished third in AL West and Lemon won his second Manager of the Year Award. [...] "The fans got behind us after about three weeks. They had a lot <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> success", Lemon said after being winning the award.|$|E
500|$|McIlrath {{wrote the}} video treatment, and remarked how the band at first {{had no idea}} {{what they wanted to do}} for the video due to the song's unique sound. McIlrath did know that since [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] has simple lyrics, he wanted the video to {{replicate}} the song's easygoing feel. The video was shot over a year after the release of Siren Song Of The Counter Culture, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only a few months after the song's parent album is released. Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts. Looking back on the video, McIlrath said: [...] "Parts of it are kind of cheesy...but it captured where I was at when that song was written - it was written when I was living in a house with four roommates in a bedroom and we were all just trying to figure out what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Aurobindo's view, Krishna was a {{historical}} figure, but his {{significance in the}} Gita is as a [...] "symbol of the divine dealings with humanity", while Arjuna typifies a [...] "struggling human soul". However, Aurobindo rejected the interpretation that the Gita, and the Mahabharata by extension, is [...] "an allegory of the inner life, and has nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> outward human life and actions": ...|$|E
2500|$|Assessing the {{importance}} of Arnold's prose work in 1988, Stefan Collini stated, [...] "for reasons <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> own cultural preoccupations as much as with the merits of his writing, {{the best of his}} prose has a claim on us today that cannot be matched by his poetry." [...] "Certainly there may still be some readers who, vaguely recalling 'Dover Beach' or 'The Scholar Gipsy' from school anthologies, are surprised to find he 'also' wrote prose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Health {{locus of}} control is how people measure and {{understand}} how people relate their health to their behavior, health status {{and how long it}} may take to recover from a disease. Locus of control can influence how people think and react towards their health and health decisions. Each day we are exposed to potential diseases that may affect our health. The way we approach that reality has a lot <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> {{locus of control}}. Sometimes it is expected to see older adults experience progressive declines in their health, for this reason it is believed that their health locus of control will be affected. However, this {{does not necessarily mean that}} their locus of control will be affected negatively but older adults may experience decline in their health and this can show lower levels of internal locus of control.|$|E

2500|$|For {{philosophical}} reasons, it {{is important}} to note that it is not necessary to work in ZFC or any related system to carry out this proof. A common argument against the use of NFU as a foundation for mathematics is that our reasons for relying on it have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> intuition that ZFC is correct. We claim that it is sufficient to accept TST (in fact TSTU). We outline the approach: take the type theory TSTU (allowing urelements in each positive type) as our metatheory and consider the theory of set models of TSTU in TSTU (these models will be sequences of sets [...] (all of the same type in the metatheory) with embeddings of each [...] into [...] coding embeddings of the power set of [...] into [...] in a type-respecting manner). Given an embedding of [...] into [...] (identifying elements of the base [...] "type" [...] with subsets of the base type), one can define embeddings from each [...] "type" [...] into its successor in a natural way. This can be generalized to transfinite sequences [...] with care.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1997 {{the band}} {{released}} their second album, Our Newest Album Ever!. Following {{the success of}} their first album, the band felt that their success had been based at least partially on the third wave of ska in general. According to Scott Kerr [...] "The unfortunate reality is that good songs and good live performances have far less <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> so-called success than our being a part of the 'flavor-of-the-month'." [...] Five Iron Frenzy sought to distance themselves from the ska scene while maintaining their artistic integrity. Dennis Culp portrayed their goal, stating that [...] "The Police used a lot of ska, but they really weren't referred to as a ska band... they went far beyond ska." [...] For Five Iron, the method of achieving that goal was the creative process. On the first three releases Roper wrote most of the lyrics and Kerr supplied the musical portion. After Kerr left, the band began to explore a wider variety of musical influences, incorporating diverse influences such as Latin and swing music. Roper continued to write the lyrics, a task that he took seriously. He explained to 7ball in 1997 that [...] "It's not like we try to sit down and write wacky songs. I take songwriting pretty seriously... I've been given this podium. I have a responsibility to tell the truth about things." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kierkegaard, {{the human}} self desires {{that which is}} beyond reason. Desire itself {{appears to be a}} desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, {{according}} to Plato, is a kind of desire for immortality—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. Erotic love itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of time and space. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals {{in the name of a}} higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion.|$|E
