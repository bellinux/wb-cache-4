This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo and a visual <b>treat</b> <b>for</b> the audience.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy was {{subjected}} to surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) by using SAE 52100 steel balls of 5 mm diameter for two treatment durations (30 and 60 min). SMAT resulted {{in the formation of}} nanostructured material on the surface and near surface regions, increased hardness, increased surface roughness and compressive residual stress on the surface. Treated samples exhibited lower tangential force coefficient (TFC) compared to untreated samples. Samples <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> 60 min exhibited higher grain refinement, higher hardness, lower surface roughness and higher TFC compared to the samples <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> 30 min. Fretting wear resistance of the samples <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> 30 min was higher than that of untreated samples and the samples <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> 60 min. Due to very high hardness and presumably reduced ductility, the fretting wear resistance of the samples <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> 60 min was lower than that of the untreated samples and samples <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> 30 min...|$|R

40|$|Background: Active {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{disease can}} impose substantial morbidity, while treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) has frequent side effects. We compared health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQOL) between persons diagnosed and <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> TB disease, persons <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> LTBI, and persons screened but not <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> TB disease or LTBI, over one year following diagnosis/initial assessment. Methods: Participants were recruited at two hospitals in Montreal (2008 – 2011), and completed the Short Form- 36 version 2 (SF- 36) at baseline, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months thereafter. Eight domain scores and physical and mental component summary (PCS and MCS, respectively) scores were calculated from responses. Linear mixed models were used to compare mean scores at each evaluation and changes in scores over consecutive evaluations, among participants <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> TB disease and those <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> LTBI, each compared to the control group. Results: Of the 263 participants, 48 were <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> TB disease, 105 for LTBI, and 110 were control participants. Fifty-four percent were women, mean age was 35 years, and 90 % were foreign-born. Participants <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> TB disease reported significantly worse mean scores at baseline compared to control participants (mean PCS scores: 50. 0 vs. 50. 7; mean MCS scores: 46. 4 vs. 51. 1), with improvement in mean MCS scores throughout the study period. Scores reported by participants <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> LTBI and control participants were comparable throughout the study. Conclusion: TB disease is associated with decrements in HRQOL {{as measured by the}} SF- 36. This is most pronounced during the weeks after diagnosis and treatment initiation, but is no longer evident after two months...|$|R

25|$|In 2000, former NHL players Dale Hunter, Mark Hunter and Basil McRae {{bought the}} Knights from Doug Tarry Jr. The sale was {{brokered}} by George Georgopoulos, who was {{negotiating with the}} city of London {{for the development of a}} state of the art multpurpose entertainment centre and arena – the John Labatt Centre. The Hunters began the process of rebuilding by firstly joining in the lobbying for a new 9,900 seat arena in Downtown London and putting together a smart scouting network. The Ice House was scheduled to be sold and closed at the conclusion of the 2001–02 OHL season, and as a <b>treat</b> <b>for</b> their fans, the Knights changed back to their 1986–94 green and gold uniforms in February 2002. In October that year the Labatt Centre opened, and new, modernized versions of the old green and gold uniforms debuted. The 2003–04 OHL season would mark the beginning of a remarkable dynasty. The Knights had the best regular season record in the CHL and set an OHL record with 110 points, but lost the OHL Western Conference final to the Guelph Storm. In the 2004–05 season, the Knights set a new CHL record by going 31 games in a row without a loss (29–0–2). The previous record of 29 games, held by the 1978–79 Brandon Wheat Kings (who went 25–0–4 during their streak), was broken with a 0–0 tie against the Guelph Storm on December 10, 2004. The streak ended at 31 games after a 5–2 loss to the Sudbury Wolves on December 17. The Knights finished the season with 120 points (59 wins, 7 losses, 2 ties), breaking their own OHL record set the previous season. In the playoffs, the Knights started by sweeping two best-of-seven series against the Guelph Storm and Windsor Spitfires. In the Western Conference final, the Knights defeated the Kitchener Rangers 4–1 to win the Wayne Gretzky Trophy. In the OHL finals against the Ottawa 67's, the Knights won the series 4–1 to win their first J. Ross Robertson Cup, ending the longest championship drought in the CHL. That same year, the London Knights and the John Labatt Centre (renamed Budweiser Gardens in 2012) were awarded the right to host 2005 Memorial Cup Tournament, which was played from May 21 to May 29. In the tournament, they defeated the Rimouski Océanic 4–3 on May 21, the Kelowna Rockets 4–2 on May 23, and the Ottawa 67's 5–2 on May 26. This earned the Knights a bye into the championship game. On May 29, the Knights defeated Rimouski 4–0 to win their first Memorial Cup. In 2005–06, the team won their third consecutive Hamilton Spectator Trophy for winning the regular season title, but their run into the playoffs ended with a loss to Peterborough in the OHL final. In 2006–07 the Knights continued their run of success, winning their fourth consecutive Hamilton Spectator Trophy as regular season champions. However, they lost the Western Conference Championship to the Plymouth Whalers.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to illustrate the usefulness of Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data for examining variations in medical expenditures for people with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). We analyzed 2009 MEPS data to produce estimates of <b>treated</b> prevalence <b>for</b> MCC and associated medical expenditures for adults in the US civilian noninstitutionalized population (sample = 24, 870). We also identified the most common dyad and triad combinations of treated conditions. Approximately one-quarter of civilian US adults were <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> MCCs in 2009; 18. 3 % were <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> 2 to 3 conditions and 7 % were <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> 4 or more conditions. The proportion of adults <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> MCC increased with age. White non-Hispanic adults were most likely and Hispanic and Asian adults were least likely to be <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> MCC. Health care expenditures increased as the number of chronic conditions treated increased. Regardless of age or sex, hypertension and hyperlipidemia was the most common dyad among adults <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> MCC; diabetes in conjunction with these 2 conditions was a common triad. MEPS has the capacity to produce national estimates of health care expenditures associated with MCC. MEPS data in conjunction with data from other US Department of Health and Human Services sources provide information that can inform policies addressing the complex issue of MCC...|$|R

The incidence of chemotherapeutic toxicity in patients <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> malignant SCT and possible effects on the QoL were analyzed. Retrospective chart review of patients ≥ 18 years <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> SCT in the Netherlands was performed. Present QoL was evaluated using the SF- 36 questionnaire. The results of survivors of malignant SCT were compared to those of patients <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> benign SCT. Fifty-one of 76 traceable patients consented to participate. The results of 47 (92. 2 %), 9 men and 38 women (median age 25. 4 years, range 18. 3 - 41. 2), were analyzed. Eleven had been <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> malignancy; 63. 6 % suffered from at least one chemotherapeutic sequel with hearing loss as the most common one.
