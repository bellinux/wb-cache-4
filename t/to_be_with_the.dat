5|$|Having won the battle, Nelson {{needed to}} send despatches to his commander, Vice-Admiral Earl St. Vincent {{reporting}} on {{the destruction of the}} French Mediterranean fleet. These messages were entrusted to Captain Edward Berry, who had served as Nelson's flag captain on HMS Vanguard during the battle. Thompson was ordered to escort Berry to St. Vincent, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blockade squadron off Cadiz, in Leander. Although Leander had not suffered serious damage in the battle, Thompson had manning problems: casualties from the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in July 1797 had never been replaced, 14 men had been wounded in the battle at Aboukir Bay and two officers and fifty men had been detached to man the captured French prizes. This left Thompson with just 282 men on board Leander. Following Nelson's orders, Thompson sailed on 5 August.|$|E
5|$|After the 1897 {{baseball}} season, {{he returned}} to his home in Portland, Oregon with his health deteriorating. In December, Parrott traveled to New Mexico in hopes of re-gaining his health. When in New Mexico, he reported that the weather was too cold and that he was planning to move to Arizona where the climate is more mild. On April 14, 1898, while in a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, Parrott died of tuberculosis. Earlier that day, Parrott had telegraphed his father, Thomas H. Parrott, back in Portland alerting him that it was not likely he would live two more days. Upon receiving the telegram, Thomas H. Parrott sent his son, Archie Parrott, on a train to Arizona <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dying Jiggs Parrott. However, after the train left the station in Portland, the Parrott family got word that Jiggs Parrott had died. Archie Parrott continued to Arizona to retrieve his brother's remains. His remains were returned on April 23. Parrott's funeral was held on April 25, at his home in East Portland. His pall-bearers were several former teammates from the Portland Willamettes: Joseph Beveridge, Charles Neale, Frank Buchtel, William Kern, Fred Bailey, and John Rankin. According to The Oregonian hundreds attended his funeral and 500 people attended his burial at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland.|$|E

25|$|Walker reentered Virginia, in Loudoun County on September 9, {{across from}} Point of Rocks. Walker was escorted by Col. E.V. White, Loudoun native, and his 35th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry. White {{was unhappy with}} the {{assignment}} and preferred <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the army. Unfortunately White had gotten into an altercation with Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart in Frederick and was subsequently ordered back to Virginia by Lee. Whether or not his disposition was to blame, White led Walker on a meandering route around the Short Hill Mountain to reach the base of Loudoun Heights four days later on September 13. So the attack on Harpers Ferry that had been planned for September 11 was delayed, increasing the risk that McClellan might engage and destroy a portion of Lee's army while it was divided.|$|E
25|$|The duck {{has long}} been {{recognised}} as a distinct taxon, with its affinities previously considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> teals. Robert Cushman Murphy {{was the first to}} demonstrate that it is a pintail, its closest relatives the yellow-billed pintails of South America (now split as the Chilean pintail A. g. spinicauda and the extinct Niceforo's pintail A. g. niceforoi), though he retained it as a full species for its isolated distribution and its 16 (rather than 14) rectrices, or tail feathers. However, the number of retrices in the ducks is variable, with many mainland pintails also having 16 retrices and a few South Georgia pintails even having 18, and the three ducks are now usually lumped as the yellow-billed pintail.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1913 the 19-year-old Anthony {{followed}} his two older brothers in emigrating to the United States, making use of a steamship ticket provided by his oldest brother.

Bimba sought to escape the miserable conditions of the mill and soon relocated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other brother working at a pulp mill in Rumford, Maine. Although wages and working conditions were somewhat better in the paper mill, Bimba developed chest pains from the noxious fumes produced by chemicals used in the pulp-making process and was forced to find new employment.|$|E

25|$|However, memory scepticism {{has been}} criticized as being {{applicable}} to public language, also. If one person can misremember, {{it is entirely possible}} that several people can misremember. So memory scepticism could be applied with equal effect to ostensive definitions given in a public language. For example, Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree T; but the next day both misremember which tree it was they named. If they were depending entirely on their memory, and had not written down the location of the tree, or told anyone else, then they would appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same difficulties as the individual who defined S ostensively. And so, if this is the case, the argument presented against private language would apply equally to public language.|$|E
25|$|Ereenia {{sets out}} to wake up Shiva at Mount Calasay. When he gets there, he rings the Silver Bell and the {{mountain}} turns into light followed by a message telling Ereenia to talk to Yamen. Ereenia returns to Kailyal and Ladurlad, and the three travel {{to the world of}} the dead, Padalon. They are brought to the city Yamenpur and are able to meet Yamen. After talking to Yamen, they are told to wait, but Kehama attacks Padalon. Kehama defeats Yamen and tries to convince Kailyal to join him. After being rejected again, Kehama attains the Amreeta and becomes immortal. However, the Amreeta gives Kehama an immortality of torment, which reflects Kehama's soul. Shiva comes down and restores Yamen to power. Shiva allows Kailyal to drink the Amreeta, which allows her to become a divine being that can be with Ereenia. Ladurlad is given the ability to die and the poem ends with him entering the paradise Yedillian <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other dead.|$|E
25|$|In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general and given command of all the Union armies. He devised a coordinated strategy to apply pressure on the Confederacy from many points, something President Lincoln had urged his generals to do {{from the beginning of}} the war. Grant put Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman in immediate command of all forces in the West and moved his own headquarters <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Army of the Potomac (still commanded by George Meade) in Virginia, where he intended to maneuver Lee's army to a decisive battle; his secondary objective was to capture Richmond, but Grant knew that the latter would happen automatically once the former was accomplished. His coordinated strategy called for Grant and Meade to attack Lee from the north, while Benjamin Butler drove toward Richmond from the southeast; Franz Sigel to control the Shenandoah Valley; Sherman to invade Georgia, defeat Joseph E. Johnston, and capture Atlanta; George Crook and William W. Averell to operate against railroad supply lines in West Virginia; and Nathaniel P. Banks to capture Mobile, Alabama.|$|E
