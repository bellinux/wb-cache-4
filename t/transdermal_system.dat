40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to develop membrane-moderated <b>transdermal</b> <b>systems</b> of ampicillin sodium and to evaluate them with respect to various in vitro and in vivo parameters. The membrane-type <b>transdermal</b> <b>systems</b> were prepared using a drug with various antinucleant polymers— hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), methylcellulose (MC), cellulose acetate phthalate, chitosan, sodium alginate (SA), and sodium carboxymethylcellulose—in an ethanol: pH 4. 7 buffer volatile system by the solvent evaporation technique with HPMC as the rate-controlling membrane for all the systems. The swelling properties of the polymers were studied, and drug-polymer interaction studies were performed. The patches were subjected to various physicochemical studies, in vitro release studies, permeation studies, and skin irritation studies. The best patch among the formulations was selected for further in vivo studies. Compared to the other patches, SA exhibited the highest moisture content at 16 %; a 21 % moisture uptake was found with MC. The release and permeation of the drug from the SA patch was found to be the maximum. The in vivo study of the SA patch exhibited a peak plasma concentration Cmax of 126 μg/mL at Tmax 4 hours.

This study presents subgroup analyses from a large, randomized, multicentre, European study comparing the efficacy and safety of the fentanyl HCl iontophoretic <b>transdermal</b> <b>system</b> and morphine intravenous patient-controlled analgesia for postoperative pain management. Methods The efficacy and safety of the fentanyl iontophoretic <b>transdermal</b> <b>system</b> and morphine intravenous patient-controlled analgesia were evaluated for patients divided by surgery type, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status and type of anaesthesia used during surgery. Efficacy measures included a patient global assessment of the method of pain control (a rating of 'good' or 'excellent' was considered as a success rating) and mean last pain intensity scores in the first 24 h. Discontinuation rates and the incidence of adverse events were also evaluated. Results Numerically similar percentages of patients in most subgroups reported success on the last patient global assessment in the first 24 h for both the fentanyl iontophoretic <b>transdermal</b> <b>system</b> and morphine intravenous patient-controlled analgesia. Similar percentages of investigators reported success ratings on the investigator global assessment at the last assessment for both treatment groups regardless of surgery type, except for the knee surgery subgroup (fentanyl iontophoretic <b>transdermal</b> <b>system,</b> 75 %; morphine intravenous patient-controlled analgesia, 95 %). Mean last pain intensity scores in the first 24 h after surgery were similar in all subgroups. Rates of patient withdrawals and the incidence of adverse events were generally similar between treatment groups in the patient subgroups.

Patient-controlled analgesic techniques are recognized as preferred administration methods. Previously, research has focused on intravenously administered opioids via a programmable pump. More recently, an iontophoretic <b>transdermal</b> <b>system</b> (ITS), which is patient controlled, has been developed. The focus of this review is on pain management using the fentanyl ITS during the 24 – 72 -hour time period immediately following surgery. Fentanyl ITS offers a needle-free alternative to traditional intravenous (IV) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) system that is as effective and safe as IV PCA. This system is easy to use for both patients and nurses. The use of fentanyl ITS is generally associated with a better ease-of-care profile, including a greater ease of mobility, from a patients&# 39; perspective when compared with morphine IV PCA.

METHODS: We began with insurance claims data from UnitedHealthcare. We identified women exposed to the <b>transdermal</b> contraceptive <b>system</b> or norgestimate-con-taining oral contraceptives from April 2002 through De-cember 2004. Outcomes were confirmed from medical records. We calculated incidence rates and age-adjusted incidence rate ratios. In a nested case-control analysis, we investigated and controlled for confounding. RESULTS: There were 49, 048 woman-years of transder-mal contraceptive system exposure and 202, 344 woman-years of norgestimate-containing oral contraceptives ex-posure. There was a more than two-fold increase in the venous thromboembolism rate (incidence rate ratio 2. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 3 – 3. 8) among <b>transdermal</b> contraceptive <b>system</b> users (20 cases, 40. 8 per 100, 000 woman-years) compared with norgestimate-containing oral contraceptives users (37 cases, 18. 3 per 100, 000 woman-years). Acute myocardial infarction occurred in three <b>transdermal</b> contraceptive <b>system</b> users compared with seven among norgestimate-containing oral contra-ceptives users (incidence rate ratio 1. 8, 95 % CI 0. 5 – 6. 8).

In the US, the selegiline <b>transdermal</b> <b>system</b> (STS; EMSAM) is the first antidepressant transdermal delivery system to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved labeling {{for the treatment of}} major depressive disorder (MDD). Currently, the use of orally administered MAO inhibitor antidepressants (eg, phenelzine, tranylcypromine) is limited by the risk of tyramine-provoked events (eg, acute hypertension and headache, also known as the “cheese reaction”) when combined with dietary tyramine. The selegiline <b>transdermal</b> <b>system</b> is the only MAOI available in the US for the treatment of MDD that does not require dietary restriction at the clinically effective dose of 6 mg/ 24 hours. Delivery of selegiline transdermally (EMSAM®) bypasses hepatic first pass metabolism, thereby avoiding significant {{inhibition of}} gastrointestinal and hepatic MAO-A activity (ie, reduced risk of tyramine-provoked events) while still providing sufficient levels of selegiline in the brain to produce an antidepressant effect. At dosages of 6 – 12 mg/ 24 hours, EMSAM has been shown to improve symptoms of depression, have good tolerability, and have high rates of medication adherence. However, at higher doses of EMSAM (ie, 9 mg/ 24 hours or more), dietary restriction of tyramine intake is recommended.

METHODS: a single centre, open, randomised, parallel-group study was conducted. A total number of 33 postmenopausal women were enrolled. In 23 of them the menopause occurred spontaneously, while 10 women were bilaterally ovariectomized. Randomly, the subjects were treated with Estraderm TTS 50 (no. 8) or with Gelestra (no. 14). The pharmacokinetic study of the drugs was performed at the seventh, ninth and 14 th day in Gelestra treated women and at the first, third and second day in Estraderm TTS 50 treated women. In fact, the seventh, ninth and 14 th day of percutaneous treatment corresponds to the first, third and second day of application of the <b>transdermal</b> <b>system</b> application. Blood samples were taken by each subject at baseline and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after the gel or <b>transdermal</b> <b>system</b> application.

40|$|Background and objective: There {{has been}} {{relatively}} little investigation {{of the effect of}} temperature on skin permeation compared to other methods of penetration enhancement. A principal physicochemical factor which controls the passive diffusion of a solute from a vehicle into the skin arises from the skin temperature.

Ex vivo transdermal permeation studies were carried out at varied donor compartment temperatures. Permeation data analysis was carried out and activation energy for transdermal permeation was estimated. Results: Temperature found to enhance ex vivo permeation parameters of alfuzosin hydrochloride from its <b>transdermal</b> <b>systems.</b> It was also noted that chemical permeation enhancers potentiate permeation enhancing effect of temperature. The permeation flux values approximately doubled after exposure to 45  °C. The activation energy for transdermal permeation was found lower for the runs with chemical permeation enhancers indicating existence of a lower energy barrier in the presence of chemical permeation enhancers.
