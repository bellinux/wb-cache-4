50|$|The Benghazi burner (Thermette) design {{originates}} as {{an independent}} invention in 1929 by John Ashley Hart. It uses an internally narrowing (conical) chimney and a construction of either copper or tin plate. The shape is a straight cylinder leading up to a flat top; the water spout also being on the flat <b>top.</b> <b>Pouring</b> is done with a fixed handle on the side, and the base can be removed. The Thermette is considered a New Zealand cultural icon.|$|E
5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} {{was built on}} a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two Mountains and {{the mouth of the}} Des Prairies River. This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), with thick walls, square loopholes for muskets, with machicolation at the <b>top</b> for <b>pouring</b> lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.|$|R
50|$|Coal scuttles {{are usually}} made {{of metal and}} shaped as a {{vertical}} cylinder or truncated cone, with the open <b>top</b> slanted for <b>pouring</b> coal on a fire. It may {{have one or two}} handles. Homes that don't use coal sometimes use a coal scuttle decoratively.|$|R
50|$|Suet pastry {{is used to}} line a bowl {{into which}} the steak and kidney mix is placed with onions, stock etc. A suet pastry lid is then placed on top and sealed tightly. The top is then covered with muslin cloth which is tied round the bowl. This is placed in a covered {{saucepan}} and steamed for about four hours or until the pudding is cooked. Some recipes then stipulate making a small opening in the <b>top</b> and <b>pouring</b> rich stock into the pudding ten minutes before serving.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} July, the 16-year-old was {{to raise}} his profile yet again. At an ABCD summer basketball camp, he outplayed Tim Thomas, a rising star at that time. Before long, recruiting letters from various <b>top</b> colleges came <b>pouring</b> in. O'Neal, however, also faced great pressure off the court. That same year, the District Attorney contemplated prosecuting him for rape after he and his 15-year-old girlfriend were found partially nude in bed together by her father. The DA eventually did not prosecute O'Neal, but as the latter struggled {{to cope with the}} pressure on and off the court, Glymph stepped in, introducing discipline to his life and keeping his feet to the ground. At the same time, O'Neal's mother had met a new man, Abraham Kennedy, who also guided O'Neal along.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{spray forming}} work {{was based on}} a resistively heated electric holding furnace. The melt then passed through a 3 mm diameter Al2O3 nozzle. However the low flow rate made a high superheat necessary to prevent solidification in the nozzle. The next generation melting procedures in spray forming applications were bottom pour induction units, which offer many benefits. In this system, the melting crucible is directly above the atomiser head with a ceramic nozzle feeding directly from the furnace to the atomiser. A stopper rod runs through the melt to the <b>top</b> of the <b>pouring</b> nozzle, the rod is withdrawn when the melt reaches the designated temperature for spraying, typically 50 to 150 C above the alloy's liquidus. Alternatively a pre-prepared plug of alloy to block the nozzle is used, and at a specified superheat this plug melts allowing the contents of the furnace to drain through the nozzle. Another problem associated with bottom pour furnaces is the change in flow rate associated with the reducing metalo-static head in the crucible. In some cases, introducing an inert gas overpressure during pouring can compensate for this effect.|$|R
