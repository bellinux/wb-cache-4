5|$|Common ravens have coexisted {{with humans}} for {{thousands}} of years and in some areas have been so numerous <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about early human {{habitation}} in the Bryce Canyon area. Archaeological surveys of Bryce Canyon National Park and the Paunsaugunt Plateau show <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been {{in the area for}} at least 10,000years. Basketmaker Anasazi artifacts several thousand years old have been found south of the park. Other artifacts from the Pueblo-period Anasazi and the Fremont culture (up to the mid-12th century) have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Kyle becomes annoyed, {{responding}} {{that the}} economy is not actually angry with them, and that they should be out spending money, and continues to preach {{that the economy}} only exists as a mental construct, and <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> lost their faith in it because of the recession. He then convinces his friends that if they want the economy to be strong, they must have faith in it. Upon hearing of this heresy, Randy and his makeshift economic council decide that they must kill Kyle. Cartman, in his desire to obtain a copy of , says that he will deliver Kyle to Randy and his friends in exchange for the game.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a basic desire {{to feel good}} about themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E

5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on {{expectations about the}} future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that expectations were based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while rational expectations modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

25|$|People {{engage in}} sexual {{activity}} for any of a multitude of possible reasons.

25|$|It is {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been collecting paper money {{for as long}} as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the Serienscheine (Series notes) Notgeld.

25|$|Plato's Problem {{particularly}} {{refers to}} {{a point in the}} dialogue when Socrates is talking with an uneducated servant and shows, through this interaction, that the servant knows the Pythagorean Theorem though he has never been explicitly taught any geometry.

25|$|English {{tort law}} is the law {{governing}} implicit civil responsibilities <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> to one another, {{as opposed to those}} responsibilities laid out in contracts. It provides legal remedies, often the payment of money, to those who have been damaged by someone else's failure to meet these implicit responsibilities. Other countries' tort laws can work quite differently.|$|E
