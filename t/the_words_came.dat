500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> out like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, {{some of which were}} picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E
2500|$|Louis Albert Bowman, an {{attorney}} from Illinois, {{was the first}} to suggest the addition of [...] "under God" [...] to the pledge. The National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution gave him an Award of Merit as the originator of this idea. He spent his adult life in the Chicago area and was chaplain of the Illinois Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. At a meeting on February 12, 1948, he led the society in reciting the pledge with the two words [...] "under God" [...] added. He said that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Although not all manuscript versions of the Gettysburg Address contain the words [...] "under God", all the reporters' transcripts of the speech as delivered do, as perhaps Lincoln may have deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he said [...] "that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom." [...] Bowman repeated his revised version of the Pledge at other meetings.|$|E
