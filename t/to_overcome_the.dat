The mass of beetles are able <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E

Marine mammals are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber, circulatory adjustments (counter-current heat exchangers); torpedo shaped bodies, reduced appendages, and large size to prevent heat loss.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Computational {{thinking}} {{has been identified}} as an essential 21 st century skill. Unfortunately, many computer users, particularly children, consider programming to be hard and boring. There are two fundamental barriers to making programming more appealing: cognitive challenges <b>to</b> <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> hard part, and affective challenges <b>to</b> <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> boring part. AgentCubes is a new 3 D creativity tool that addresses both barriers. AgentCubes addresses cognitive challenges by advancing beyond current drag and drop programming approaches that are limited to syntactic support. Instead, AgentCubes provides semantic support that helps users in fully comprehend and debug their programs. AgentCubes addressed affective challenges by including innovative 3 D authoring mechanisms that let users create their own exciting 3 D models and worlds. AgentCubes lets users share their creations as HTML 5 web applications without needing Java or Flash...|$|R
