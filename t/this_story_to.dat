5|$|Dawson relayed <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> Bulawayo, where Company {{authorities}} made enquiries. No man who {{had been}} attached to the column corroborated the account. The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war). Lawyers appointed by the Company launched a formal investigation early in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth {{takes some}} time off from his page duties to {{volunteer}} at an animal shelter. He claims his time on a pig farm {{will allow him to}} not emotionally connect with the dogs being held there, but he quickly names all of the dogs and adopts the many dogs scheduled to be euthanized that day. Kenneth asks for someone at TGS to adopt the dogs and Tracy quickly brings them all to Liz's apartment to continue annoying her. Liz and Tracy go to Jack to finally resolve their conflict. Jack decides that, because Liz ruined Tracy's life with her book, Tracy should be given the right to ruin her life, and he orders Liz to sign over her life rights to Tracy. Jack tells Liz a story about an accident he had ice climbing, falling into a crevasse. He broke his leg and was unable to climb upwards to escape, but by going deeper down into the crevasse he found a path out. Liz applies <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> her situation with Tracy and stops resisting him, instead suggesting that Tracy make a pornographic film based on her life. Tracy agrees and moves out of Liz's apartment. In addition, Jenna and Liz resolve their issues when they see two adult stars acting out a scene of Jenna (Caitlin Fowler) and Liz (Savanna Samson) apologizing to one another.|$|E

25|$|Oral {{tradition}} in Sierra Mojada, Coahuila, documented by a priest named James Lienert, states that Bierce was executed by firing squad {{in the town}} cemetery there. However, Nickell finds <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> be unreliable. He quotes Bierce's friend and biographer Walter Neale as saying that Bierce had not ridden for quite some time, was suffering from serious asthma, and had been severely critical of Pancho Villa. Neale concludes {{that it would have}} been highly unlikely for Bierce to have gone to Mexico and joined Villa.|$|E
25|$|Edmonds later (to Liddell Hart in 1937 {{and in his}} own {{unpublished}} memoirs) told {{an exaggerated}} version of these events, that Wilson had stitched up the job for himself whilst acting as Director of Staff Duties, by recommending May ("a really stupid Irishman") for the job and placing himself as the second recommendation. Tim Travers (in The Killing Ground, 1987) used <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> help {{paint a picture of}} a prewar Army highly dependent on patronage for senior appointments. John Hussey, in his research into the matter, described Wilson’s appointment as “a collegiate decision about a difficult but suitable man” and dismisses Edmonds’ story as “worthless as evidence to prove anything about the structural defects of the old Army”. Keith Jeffrey argues that Travers’ argument is not entirely without substance – even if he is misinformed about this particular incident – and that Wilson’s career took place at “a transitional period” in which the Army was becoming more professionalised, so that Lyttelton was not able to use patronage to appoint May, his preferred candidate.|$|E
500|$|Goodman Beaver was a {{stand-in}} for Kurtzman {{himself in}} this semi-autobiographical tale. [...] At {{this point in}} his career, Kurtzman had had several negative experiences with publishers, and he used <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> satirize the corrupting influence of capitalism and power. [...] Kurtzman's memories of his time at Timely Comics were a strong influence on the Schlock Publications he portrayed; [...] Timely publisher Martin Goodman was Kurtzman's model for the publisher in the story. [...] Kurtzman also used Burt Lancaster as his model for the editor of the men's magazine in the story, and Hugh Hefner was his model for the editor of the [...] "girlie" [...] magazine. [...] As Goodman Beaver did in the story, early in his career Kurtzman worked making crossword puzzles for Goodman. [...] The title is an amalgamation of three bestselling 1950s novels: Executive Suite (1952) by Cameron Hawley, [...] The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1955) by Sloan Wilson, and [...] The Organization Man (1956) by William H. Whyte.|$|E

500|$|Later, {{in popular}} imagination, these two events became {{confused}} with each other, {{leading to a}} legendary but inaccurate version of events. This myth has Pheidippides running from Marathon to Athens after the battle, to announce the Greek victory with the word [...] "nenikēkamen!" [...] (Attic: we've won!), whereupon he promptly died of exhaustion. Most accounts incorrectly attribute <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> Herodotus; actually, the story first appears in Plutarch's On the Glory of Athens in the 1st century AD, who quotes from Heracleides of Pontus's lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles. Lucian of Samosata (2nd century AD) gives the same story but names the runner Philippides (not Pheidippides). It {{should be noted that}} in some medieval codices of Herodotus the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta before the battle is given as Philippides, and this name is also preferred in a few modern editions.|$|E
500|$|On one side, {{the opponents}} of Ben-Gurion {{attacked}} his [...] "moral authority". They said that the intrusion into Latrun by the [...] "scum of the earth" [...] immigrants who died had changed the situation for the worse. And the number of victims, {{and the proportion of}} immigrants, inflated in the narratives: from [...] "several hundreds of dead" [...] to [...] "500 to 700 dead and even [...] "1,000 to 2,000 dead". The proportion of immigrants making up this total of victims was up to 75%. His opponents accused Ben-Gurion of wanting to take out the myth of the [...] "invincible Arab Legion" [...] and to justify the abandonment of the city of David to Abdallah. (Anita Shapira considers <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> be at the origin of the theory of Avi Shlaim who brought forth what she considers as the myth of the collusion between Ben-Gurion and Abdallah.) On the other side, those supporting Ben-Gurion put everything to advance the case of the [...] "historic sacrifice" [...] by the immigrants, laying the failure to their poor training.|$|E
500|$|Continuing his analysis, Barlow {{addressed}} [...] "The Last of the Masters", contrasting it with {{an earlier}} work by Dick, [...] "The Defenders". In [...] "The Defenders", humanity has been duped by a noble lie—provided by their robot soldiers—into believing in a war which is not actually taking place. In the latter story, Barlow asserts that Dick surprisingly agreed with such neoconservative theorists as Leo Strauss in {{the efficacy of the}} deception. [...] "Here, the [...] have saved mankind... The 'noble lie' has served its purpose." [...] However, Barlow concedes, [...] "ut this is an extremely early story and Dick had not yet clarified his own world view..." [...] Comparing <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> [...] "The Last of the Masters", Barlow took note of Dick's commentary from The Golden Man collection ("...sometimes there lies a gulf between what is theoretically right and that which is practical.") and concluded that the story represented Dick's understanding of [...] "the problems at the other extreme..." [...] in politics. Where most of Dick's stories presented government in skeptical terms to warn the reader of potential abuse, [...] "The Last of the Master" [...] presented an argument for the utility of government.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of this infiltration, a white officer and 35–40 African-American {{soldiers}} left their position south of Haman at a roadblock and fled to the rear until they reached Check's 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, command post [...] away. There, at 05:00 this officer said 2,000 North Koreans had overrun his position and others near Haman, including the 24th Regiment command post. Check reported <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> Kean, and then sent a platoon of tanks with a platoon of infantry toward Haman to find out what had happened. Some of his officers, meanwhile, had stopped about 220 soldiers streaming to the rear. Check ordered these men to follow his tank and infantry patrol back into Haman. Some of them did so only when threatened with being shot. The tank-led column entered Haman unopposed, where they found the 24th Regiment command post intact and everything quiet. The next day, September 6, a sniper severely wounded Champney while he was inspecting his front-line positions west of Haman. Champney was evacuated immediately. The commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, Corley, succeeded to the command of the regiment.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think that we can use <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> really educate people and get the word out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E
