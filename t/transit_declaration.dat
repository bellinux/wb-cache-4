30|$|The {{transport}} {{rules of}} CIM and SMGS help to better organise transport processes in international {{rail freight transport}} and they harmonise conditions for quick, quality and safe international rail freight transport. Establishing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the transport rules of CIM and SMGS is a complicated process which is affected by several factors. For example, Belarus, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan have common customs areas and for these countries and their railway companies SMGS transport rules are preferable. In the Slovak Republic it is more convenient to use CIM transport rules based on the membership in the EU. One of great advantages of CIM rules is that the consignment note can be used as a customs paper in rail transport. When a carrier uses CIM consignment note for import or export to/from the EU there is no need to make an additional customs document. With the SMGS consignment note this option does not exist and the carrier (or shipper) must create a <b>transit</b> <b>declaration</b> based on the Union Customs Code ([URL] [22].|$|E
