5|$|On February 21, 2013, the Heat traded Dexter Pittman {{to create}} {{space on the}} roster to pursue a more {{experienced}} big man. On March 2, 2013, Howard signed a 10-day contract with the 2012–13 Miami Heat. On March 12, 2013, he signed a second 10-day contract with the Heat, and on March 22, 2013, he was signed {{for the remainder of}} the season. He made his first appearance of the season for <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>on</b> March 24 against the Charlotte Bobcats tallying two points, a rebound and two assists in three minutes of play as the Heat made their way to their 26th consecutive victory. On April 15, he made his first start since April 14, 2010 as the Heat defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers without James, Wade, Bosh, Battier, Chalmers and Udonis Haslem in the penultimate game of the regular season. Howard's April 17 start in the season finale against the Orlando Magic marked Howard's 900th career start. On May 30, during halftime of game 5 of the Eastern Conference championship against the Indiana Pacers, Howard delivered a passionate speech that fired up the team in its clinching game. With the retirement of Grant Hill on June 1, 2013, Howard became the oldest active player in the NBA at age 40. During the playoffs, Howard did not play, but he served as a quasi-assistant coach.|$|E

25|$|The Heat beat San Antonio {{again the}} next day, but the Rampage forced {{overtime}} after fighting back from a 2-0 deficit in the final six minutes of regulation. MacDonald, in his first start with the Heat, made 29 saves and stopped all four shootout shots, while Street and Jones scored in the shootout for Abbotsford. Billins was returned to <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>on</b> November 9, and recorded points in two consecutive wins over the Toronto Marlies on November 9 and 10. Winger Michael Ferland scored his first two professional goals in the first game, a 4-3 victory, and the Heat won the second game 6-3 after scoring three unanswered goals in the final period, including a successful penalty shot by Granlund.|$|E
25|$|On February 21, 2012, Rondo {{was named}} an injury {{replacement}} for Joe Johnson on the Eastern Conference roster at the 2012 NBA All-Star Game. With 18 points, 17 rebounds, and 20 assists against the Knicks on March 4, he joined Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, and Jason Kidd {{as the only}} players {{to have at least}} 15 points, rebounds, and assists in the same game. In a win against <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>on</b> April 1, Rondo registered another triple-double (16 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds). Rondo closed out the regular season with 24 consecutive games of 10 or more assists. This is not only a Celtics franchise record, but is also the longest streak the NBA has seen since John Stockton logged a streak of 29 such games in 1992. This streak was still considered active and resumed {{at the beginning of the}} 2012–13 regular season.|$|E
25|$|The Mavericks {{raised their}} {{championship}} banner {{prior to their}} Finals rematch with <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>on</b> Christmas Day, but in what would soon become {{a mirror image of}} the 2006–07 Heat's eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105–94 loss, marking Dallas's first regular-season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things didn't get better for Dallas after starting the season 0–3, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks won 13 of 18 games in January, but they posted a 22–22 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing 7th with a 36–30 record, their lowest finish since the 2007–08 season. Nowitzki produced 21.6 points, 6 rebounds and 45.7% shooting, his lowest numbers since the 2000–01 season. Meanwhile, Odom proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, and they decided to sit him out for the final two months of the season.|$|E

25|$|The {{network was}} also criticized for {{focusing}} its coverage on a select number of teams, particularly {{the decision to}} broadcast a Lakers-Heat game on its Christmas Day schedule for three consecutive years. However, for 2007, ABC decided to break this tradition by instead having the Heat, for the fourth straight time, appear on Christmas Day facing the 2007 Eastern Conference Champions, the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 2008, the Boston Celtics replaced <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>on</b> the Christmas Day schedule, and faced the Los Angeles Lakers; and in 2009, the Cavaliers played the Lakers on Christmas Day. However, the Heat-Lakers Christmas Day special would make its return in the 2010–11 NBA season, {{as a result of}} LeBron James' recent move from the Cleveland franchise to Miami. For the 2011–12 NBA season, the Lakers and Heat played again on Christmas Day, but against separate opponents. The Lakers played the Chicago Bulls, while the Heat played the Dallas Mavericks in a rematch of the 2011 NBA Finals; both the Bulls and Mavericks made their ABC Christmas Day debuts, which also acted as the league's opening day that season due to the 2011 NBA lockout delaying the start of the season. In the case of the latter, ABC aired the pre-game championship ring and banner ceremony for the Mavericks, which marked the first time in NBA history a national broadcast network televised the ceremony.|$|E

500|$|The song has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics.

[...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone rated it three out of five stars. He commended the singer for the electro and Europop composition of the track, describing it as [...] "buoyant and warm-rinse soothing. It's {{the sound of a}} woman who hits the dance-floor for restoration more than craziness." [...] Haigh from Attitude believed that [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] should have been released as the lead single from MDNA. He felt that the track [...] "screams" [...] early 1990s Madonna's work, and complimented it for being a [...] "basic, balls-to-the-wall night out anthem", adding [...] "why does that have to be something that's considered 'below' Madonna?" [...] In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from the same magazine praised the [...] "pop stomper" [...] track, writing: [...] "The production might sound like she's been listening to a fair bit of Rihanna, but who's counting. Madonna brings her own authority, creating the kind of anthemic party song that she does best, the kind where everyone from your three-year-old niece to your 60-year-old mother gets up on the dancefloor."

[...] John Janick of Fueled by Ramen had heard an early version of a song online and cold-called the band members at their apartment, first reaching Stump and later talking to Wentz for an hour.

Fueled by Ramen, at the time the smallest of independent labels clamoring to sign the band, would effectively release the group's debut album and help build the band's ever-expanding fanbase before the group moved to Island.

The band, according to Stump, didn't [...] "sleep anywhere that we could shower [...] There was a girl that Andy's girlfriend at the time went to school with who let us sleep on her floor, but we'd be there for maybe four hours at a time.
