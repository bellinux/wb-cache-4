40|$|This paper {{does not}} address the issue of aid {{effectiveness}} [...] that is, the extent to which foreign aid dollars actually achieve their goals [...] but on "best practices" {{in the way in which}} official aid is given, an important component of the wider debate. First we discuss best practice for an ideal aid agency and the difficulties that aid agencies face because they are typically not accountable to their intended beneficiaries. Next we consider the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> agencies and four additional dimensions of aid practice: specialization, or the degree to which aid is not fragmented among too many donors, too many countries, and too many sectors for each donor); selectivity, or the extent to which aid avoids corrupt autocrats and goes to the poorest countries; use of ineffective aid channels such as tied aid, food aid, and technical assistance; and the overhead costs of aid agencies. We compare 48 aid agencies along these dimensions, distinguishing between bilateral and multilateral ones. Using the admittedly limited information we have, we rank the aid agencies on different dimensions of aid practice and then provide one final comprehensive ranking. We present these results as an illustrative exercise to move the aid discussion forward. ...|$|E

The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), a multi-stakeholder initiative that seeks to improve the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> has developed an open standard for the publication of aid information. As of 2013, over 150 donors, NGOs and governments have registered to the IATI registry by publishing their aid activities in this XML standard. Taking the IATI model as an input, we have created a Linked Data model based on requirements elicitated from qualitative interviews using an iterative requirements engineering methodology. We have converted the IATI open data from a central registry to Linked Data and linked it to various other datasets such as World Bank indicators and DBpedia information. This dataset is made available for re-use at [URL] To demonstrate the added value of this Linked Data approach, we have created several applications which combine {{the information from the}} IATI dataset and the datasets it was linked to. As a result, we have shown that creating Linked Data for the IATI dataset and linking it to other datasets give new valuable insights in aid transparency. Based on actual information needs of IATI users, we were able to show that linking IATI data adds significant value to the data and enables fulfilling the needs of IATI users...|$|E

Firstly, Japanese NGOs {{would be able to}} independently carry out the small-scale aid projects that directly address the needs of local communities in aid recipient countries.

50|$|To achieve this, {{literature}} on the topic suggest that donors should agree on adopting a standardized format for providing information on volume, allocation and results, such as the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), or other similar standards, and commit to improve recipient countries' databases with technical, financial and informational support. The format should be easily downloadable and with sufficient disaggregation to enable comparison with other data. Making aid data public and comparable among donors, {{would be likely to}} encourage a process of positive emulation towards a better usage of public funds. After all, official development assistance (ODA) is a voluntary transfer that depends on the support of donor country taxpayers. Donors should therefore consider improving the <b>transparency</b> and traceability <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> funds also as a way of increasing engagement and support toward aid inside their own country. Moreover, a generalized adoption of IATI would ensure the publication <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> information in a timely way, the compatibility with developing countries' budgets and the reliability of future projections, which would have a strong and positive effect on the predictability <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} {{the scale}} and scope of {{emerging}} donors, many of which are developing economies themselves. On the basis of a survey of the literature, we find that estimates <b>of</b> annual <b>aid</b> flows from new donors (so-called non-DAC donors) vary greatly and are somewhere between $ 11 billion and $ 41. 7 billion, or 8 and 31 percent of global gross ODA. We find that new donors are not a monolithic group but instead represent three distinct models <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> delivery, which we describe as the DAC Model, the Arab Model and the Southern Model. While we see the need to increase <b>transparency</b> and accountability <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> flows across these delivery models, we do not see a convergence to the DAC model. Rather, emerging donors may follow different paths, in accordance with their own traditions and standards. We argue that encouraging aid transparency, especially reporting data on project-level assistance, must be the core focus <b>of</b> the <b>aid</b> community. To engage the non-DAC donors, the forum for international aid coordination might need to be moved away from the OECD-DAC platform; DAC could instead serve as one donor caucus within a larger international system <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> reporting.

40|$|Direct {{government}} aid and fiscal incentives {{for research and}} development each have distinctive advantages and disadvantages. An appropriate mix adjusted to prevailing conditions may increase the efficiency of the system <b>of</b> government <b>aid.</b> As a matter of fact, the majority of OECD countries provides support to R&D both through direct subsidies and, increasingly, by means of tax incentives. At present the EU is paying greater attention to fiscal incentives for R&D than in the past. For a considerable period of time, Austria has been offering an instrument <b>of</b> fiscal <b>aid</b> to R&D – the R&D tax allowance – which is rather generous by international standards. In its present form, however, the R&D tax allowance shows some weak points. A reform <b>of</b> fiscal <b>aid</b> for R&D, presently in the stage of a draft amendment of the income tax law, is designed to eliminate some of these weaknesses by additional measures (a new R&D tax allowance for R&D expenditure based on the OECD definition, an R&D premium for firms that do not manage to make sufficient profit). This reform of tax incentives for R&D does not leave any firm worse off than before. On the other hand, however, it means that the set of instruments is becoming increasingly complex, and that in turn the costs of administration and compliance by firms tend to increase. Moreover, for the purpose of marketing Austria as a good business location, an easily understandable design of tax incentives would be preferable. Up to now the actual use and effects of the R&D tax allowance have not been very transparent and no evaluation has been presented so far. Therefore, it is recommended to increase the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> fiscal <b>aid</b> for R&D and to evaluate the newly designed set of instruments according to international standards after they have been in use for three years.

40|$|Essay I: Which {{countries}} receive aid {{as insurance}} and why? A theory <b>of</b> optimal <b>aid</b> policy Empirical {{evidence shows that}} developing countries with opaque institutions receive procyclical Official Development Aid (ODA) while developing countries with transparent institutions receive acyclical or countercyclical ODA. This paper pro-vides a dynamic equilibrium model <b>of</b> optimal <b>aid</b> policy that quantitatively accounts for this fact. In the model, the donor wants to (a) encourage actions by the aid re-ceiving government that increase output and (b) smooth out economic fluctuations. The <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> institutions in the country affects the donor’s ability to dis-tinguish downturns caused by exogenous shocks, from those caused by government actions. The solution to the donor’s mechanism design problem {{is dependent on the}} <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> government actions. If the donor has good information about government actions, aid policy is countercyclical and aid acts as insurance. How-ever, if the donor is unable to infer perfectly the cause <b>of</b> the downturn, <b>aid</b> policy is procyclical to encourage unobservable good actions. The model predicts a simila...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} two period model of {{political}} competition in which voters imperfectly observe the electoral promises made to other voters. Imperfect observability generates {{an incentive for}} candidates to offer excessive transfers even if voters are homogeneous and taxation is distortionary. Government spending is larger than {{in a world of}} perfect observability. Transfers are partly financed through government debt, {{and the size of the}} debt is higher in less transparent political systems. The model provides an explanation of fiscal churning; it also predicts that groups whose transfers are less visible to others receive higher transfers, and that imperfect <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> transfers may lead to underprovision of public goods. From the policy perspective, the main novelty of our analysis is a separate evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> spending and the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> revenues. We show that the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the political system does not unambiguously improve efficiency: <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> spending is beneficial, but <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> revenues can be counterproductive because it endogenously leads to increased wasteful spending. 1...|$|R
