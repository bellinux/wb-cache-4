5|$|Motifs and {{arrangements}} of figures extend along the lower panels {{from one to}} the next, {{to the extent that the}} separations between panels are ignored with the intersections cutting figures in two. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> on the lower register where each panel division intersects figures, so that parts of figures are painted on two adjoining panels; whereas Christ and St Michael are enclosed within the single central panel, giving emphasis to the iconography.|$|E
5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer {{than that of the}} Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E
25|$|The meadow vole {{is active}} year-round, usually at night. It also digs {{underground}} burrows, where it stores {{food for the}} winter and females give birth to their young. Although these animals tend to live close together, they are aggressive towards one another. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in males during the breeding season. They can cause damage to fruit trees, garden plants, and commercial grain crops.|$|E
5|$|In {{the preface}} of The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic, Merrifield {{noted that the}} book's bias was to the {{archaeology}} of London, and that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in its use of illustrations.|$|R
25|$|Manufacturing {{industry}} {{no longer}} had to be close to the river as raw materials were being moved by road to cheaper locations within the UK, leaving the docks with less trade. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> with processed foods.|$|R
5000|$|Besides these activities, the ACP {{encourages}} {{and promotes}} the civil engagement of chess players into the decision-making processes of FIDE (the world chess body). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> {{with the formation of}} the joint ACP-FIDE panel Anti Cheating Committee.http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/7920-fideacp-anti-cheating-committee-meeting.html ...|$|R
25|$|Numerous Sufi traditions place {{emphasis}} upon a meditative procedure {{which comes from}} the cognitive aspect {{to one of the}} two principal approaches {{to be found in the}} Buddhist traditions: that of the concentration technique, involving high-intensity and sharply focused introspection. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident,</b> where muraqaba takes the form of tamarkoz, the latter being a Persian term that means concentration. Meditative quiescence is said to have a quality of healing, and—in contemporary terminology—enhancing creativity.|$|E
25|$|The age of {{the forest}} {{and the range of}} {{habitats}} it contains make it a valuable area for wildlife, and it is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Its former status as a working or pasture forest has had a great effect on its ecology. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> with the pollarded trees, which, as they have not been cut since the passing of the Epping Forest Act, have now grown massive crowns of thick, trunk-like branches with correspondingly large boles. This gives the trees an unusual appearance, not known in other forests. Often the weight of the branches cannot be supported by the parent tree, and the large amount of dead wood in the forest supports numerous rare species of fungi and invertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Bachmann {{released}} a Tornado model in BR Apple Green livery just before Christmas 2009. Unlike the TMC models, which featured a standard Bachmann A1 repainted in Tornado's then grey livery, {{and unlike the}} original Bachmann limited edition model of Tornado which had the locomotive in BR Brunswick Green livery with the late BR crest, the 2009 release was a new model, with most (though not all) of the detail differences applied. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> on the tender, which features the enlarged water capacity and reduced coal storage of Tornado {{as compared to the}} original A1 locomotives. The model proved extremely popular, to the extent that 10 weeks after going on sale Bachmann stocks were exhausted and more models had to be ordered.|$|E
50|$|Having {{reached its}} {{pinnacle}} {{during the long}} reign of emperor Basil II, the Byzantine empire entered a steady decline following his death in 1025. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in the Balkans, where {{the elimination of the}} perennial Bulgarian threat combined with an insensitive taxation policy helped spur liberation movements.|$|R
50|$|The FDA Carstens Memorial at Port Douglas, a {{decorative}} marble memorial drinking fountain erected -08, {{is important in}} demonstrating part {{of the evolution of}} Queensland's history, being evidence of a period in which public memorials honouring prominent local citizens was an acceptable expression of public sentiment. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in North Queensland, where distance focused local loyalties.|$|R
2500|$|While France lost {{political}} control of Acadia in 1713, the Mí'kmaq did not concede {{land to the}} British. [...] Along with some Acadians, the Mi'kmaq {{from time to time}} used military force to resist the British. [...] <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in the early 1720s during Dummer's War but hostilities were brought to a close by a treaty signed in 1726.|$|R
25|$|Some {{corporate}} sponsors are criticized {{for having a}} conflict of interest. For example, some of the prominent sponsors of these advertisements include businesses that sell the expensive equipment needed to perform screening mammography; {{an increase in the}} number of women seeking mammograms means an increase in their sales, which has led critics to say that their sponsorship is not a voluntary act of charity, but an effort to increase sales. The regulated drug and medical device industry uses the color pink, positive images, and other themes of the pink ribbon culture in direct-to-consumer advertising to associate their breast cancer products with the fear, hope, and wholesome goodness of the breast cancer movement. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in advertisements designed to sell screening mammograms.|$|E
500|$|... "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" [...] {{is a power}} ballad {{written by}} Jim Steinman. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> when the dead {{characters}} seem to be resurrected in {{the memories of the}} main vocalist. Although in the case of Celine Dion's video, the theme is less about the living being doomed and more about a lost love.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} 12th-century Ban Kulin, Queen Catherine {{is one of}} the two princely personages who entered Bosnian folk tradition. As such, she is {{traditionally}} referred to as [...] "the last Queen of Bosnia" [...] – erroneously, as her stepdaughter-in-law both replaced her as queen and outlived her. The cult of Queen Catherine, who was first mentioned as beatified in the Paris-published Martyrologium franciscanum in 1638, originated in the Franciscan province of Bosna Argentina during the Ottoman rule. Following the Ottoman conquest, a majority of Bosnians converted to Orthodoxy or Islam, and the Franciscans started promoting Catherine as a symbol of Bosnia's statehood and of its pre-Ottoman Catholic identity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in Central Bosnia, where folk tradition concerning Catherine is most vivid.|$|E
50|$|Prockner had {{received}} considerable support and intervention from his schools. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> {{in the lower}} grades but even later. When Prockner began to re-attend high school while on day passes from the APU, Dr. Haque reported that the school was “going {{to great lengths to}} try and arrange a school program which would help him to graduate”. Unfortunately, Prockner did not maintain his school attendance after his discharge from the APU.|$|R
5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|R
5|$|Like Jarmusch's {{previous}} films, Mystery Train {{enjoyed a}} warm reception from critics. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> at Cannes, where {{the film was}} nominated for the Palme d'Or and Jarmusch was commended for the festival's Best Artistic Achievement. It was nominated in six categories at the 1989 Independent Spirit Awards: Best Picture, Best Screenplay (Jim Jarmusch), Best Director (Jim Jarmusch), Best Cinematography (Robby Müller), Best Actress (Youki Kudoh), and Best Supporting Actor (Steve Buscemi and Screamin' Jay Hawkins).|$|R
500|$|Early {{stages of}} the MRT's {{construction}} paid relatively scant attention to station design, {{with an emphasis on}} functionality over aesthetics. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in the first few {{stages of the}} North South and East West lines that opened between 1987 and 1988 from Yio Chu Kang to Clementi. An exception to this was Orchard, chosen by its designers to be a [...] "showpiece" [...] of the system and built initially with a domed roof. Architectural themes became a more important issue only in subsequent stages, and resulted in such designs as the cylindrical station shapes on all stations between Kallang and Pasir Ris except Eunos, and west of Boon Lay, and the perched roofs at Boon Lay, Lakeside, Chinese Garden, Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak, Choa Chu Kang, Khatib, Yishun and Eunos stations.|$|E
500|$|He {{became the}} night shift team {{supervisor}} for the Las Vegas CSI unit on the second episode of the series, after Jim Brass was demoted {{following the death of}} co-worker Holly Gribbs. In , Grissom took a sabbatical to teach a class at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts for four weeks. Prior to his sabbatical, Grissom had been showing signs of [...] "burnout". Upon his return, however, he appeared reinvigorated and told Warrick Brown that he [...] "missed" [...] Las Vegas. After the resignation of Sara Sidle, his fiancée, from the lab, and the murder of Warrick Brown, his burnout seemed to be resurfacing. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in [...] "Say Uncle", where, {{at the end of the}} episode, he expressed deep regret over solving a particularly depressing case.|$|E
2500|$|Catalan denti-alveolar stops {{can fully}} {{assimilate}} {{to the following}} consonant, producing gemination; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> before nasal and lateral consonants: e.g. cotna ('rind'), motlle/motle ('spring'), and setmana ('week'). Learned words can alternate between featuring and not featuring such assimilation (e.g. atles [...] 'atlas', administrar [...] 'to administer').|$|E
5000|$|In {{the preface}} of The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic, Merrifield {{noted that the}} book's bias was to the {{archaeology}} of London, and that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in its use of illustrations.He dedicated the book {{to the memory of}} H.S. Toms, the former Curator of Brighton Museum and a one-time assistant to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers; in his dedication, Merrifield noted that Toms had been his [...] "first mentor in archaeology and folk studies".|$|R
5000|$|... {{budgetary}} constraints continued, {{leading to the}} disbanding of the Boeing 707 transport squadron and maintenance problems for half of the C-130 Hercules fleet. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> when, {{in a matter of}} days in March, the same C-130 aircraft could be seen, in addition to their routine missions, travelling 3 times to Haiti, 9 times to Chile (in both cases delivering humanitarian aid) and also doing a resupply airdrop to the Argentine southernmost Antarctic base Belgrano II.|$|R

2500|$|The cathedral {{and four}} tall kremlin churches with their silver [...] "blind" [...] domes were imitated {{throughout}} the city. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in the Savior-on-the-Market {{church and the}} cathedral church of the Nativity convent, both dating from the 17th century and situated near the kremlin walls. The oldest church within the town center was consecrated to St.Isidore the Blessed in 1565. They say that Ivan the Terrible had the architect executed, because his church was so much smaller than its predecessor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{local churches}} {{practice}} [...] "mutuality" [...] in their meetings, based on verses such as 1 Corinthians 14:26 ("Whenever you come together, each {{one has a}} psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up."). [...] Participants are encouraged to request hymns, offer brief comments, or pray at will. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in [...] "prophesying meetings" [...] in which members speak one after another usually {{based on what they}} studied the previous week." ...|$|E
2500|$|In England the Renaissance {{tended to}} {{manifest}} itself in large square tall houses such as Longleat House. Often these buildings had symmetrical towers which {{hint at the}} evolution from medieval fortified architecture. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> at Hatfield House built between 1607 and 1611, where medieval towers jostle with a large Italian cupola. This {{is why so many}} buildings of the early English Neo-Renaissance style often have more of a [...] "castle air" [...] than their European contemporaries, which can add again to the confusion with the Gothic revival style.|$|E
50|$|The {{results of}} the 2014 Research Excellence Framework showed that, overall, Plymouth was ranked joint 66 of 128 UK institutions, rising 9 places from the {{previous}} Research Assessment Exercise in 2008. Across all assessed subject areas Plymouth showed substantial evidence of 3* (internationally excellent) and 4* (world leading) research, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in Clinical Medicine, Computer Sciences & Informatics, Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience, and Earth Systems & Environmental Sciences, where 79-85% of research was ranked as 3* or 4*.|$|R
5000|$|By 1969, it {{was also}} the case that both urban and rural revolutionary {{committees}} at all levels quickly became subordinate to existing or revived Party committees. [...] The leadership of both organisations was often almost identical, and revolutionary committees became little more than instruments of the Party committees' bidding. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> with the factory revolutionary committees- heralded {{as one of the great}} achievements of the Cultural Revolution, they were often little more than bureaucratic extensions of Party power.|$|R
25|$|Until 2003, {{reserves}} and pitchers were {{chosen by the}} manager. Player voting was re-introduced in 2003 after the managers were criticized for picking players from their own team over more deserving players from other teams. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in 2002, when National League manager Bob Brenly selected his own catcher, Damian Miller, over the more deserving Paul Lo Duca; while American League manager Joe Torre selected his own third baseman, Robin Ventura, over the Oakland Athletics' Gold Glove and Silver Slugger-winning third baseman Eric Chavez.|$|R
2500|$|While {{the drum}} {{is central to}} pow wows, [...] "the drum only helps them keep beat. Dancers key on the melody of the song. Rhythms, tones, pitch all help create their 'moves'." [...] (p.85) Note that Bill Runs Above {{did not mention the}} lyrics of the songs, and while they are no doubt important, most lyrics of most songs employ vocables, {{syllable}} sounds such as [...] "ya", [...] "hey", and [...] "loi" [...] (p.86). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in intertribal songs, such as the AIM Song, which cannot be biased towards a certain language.|$|E
2500|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in {{the feminist}} journal L'Egyptienne {{published}} by the EFU. Written and published in French, the journal was only accessible to the French speaking Egyptians who were mostly members of the upper classes. However the issues discussed in the magazine included Turkish reforms regarding women, which had influenced Egyptian women and Islam. The journal editor Ceza Nebarawi stated in 1927 that [...] "we the Egyptian Feminists, have a great respect for our religion. In wanting to see it practised in its true spirit". Another journal, published 1937, was called el-Masreyyah (The Egyptian Woman).|$|E
2500|$|In a {{relevant}} sense, a trust {{can be viewed}} as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors (investors) are also the beneficiaries. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in the Delaware business trust, which could theoretically, with the language in the [...] "governing instrument", be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation, although traditionally the Massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the US. One of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee, multiple beneficiaries, and their respective creditors (particularly the trustee's creditors), making it [...] "bankruptcy remote", and leading to its use in pensions, mutual funds, and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{hydrocarbons}} {{which contain}} only σ-bonds are relatively inert chemically.

2500|$|The {{city has}} a {{particular}} connection to Cunard Line and their fleet of ships. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> on 11 November 2008 when the Cunard liner [...] departed {{the city for the}} final time amid a spectacular fireworks display after a full day of celebrations. Cunard ships are regularly launched in the city, for example [...] was named by HRH The Duchess of Cornwall in December 2007, and the Queen named Queen Elizabeth in the city during October 2011.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008 season, {{the playing}} {{standard}} of the league had progressed to a stage where it was difficult for a new or developing club to compete against the established sides. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in the struggles of the Berlin Crocodiles to remain competitive. Conversely, the larger clubs were seeing an increase in players numbers and were in need of a venue for their reserve players. These factors, combined with the entrance of the Stuttgart Emus into the AFLG, saw the creation of a second division to the league in 2009.|$|R
