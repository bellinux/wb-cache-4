40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} computing the distance-dependent two-point function of general planar maps and hypermaps, i. e. the problem of counting such maps with two marked points at a prescribed distance. The maps considered here may have faces of arbitrarily large degree, which re-quires new bijections to be tackled. We obtain exact expressions for the fol-lowing cases: general and bipartite maps counted by <b>their</b> <b>number</b> of edges, 3 -hypermaps and 3 -constellations counted by <b>their</b> <b>number</b> of dark faces, and finally general and bipartite maps counted by both <b>their</b> <b>number</b> of edges and <b>their</b> <b>number</b> of faces. 1...|$|R

5|$|Earlier common {{throughout}} deciduous {{forests in}} India, four-horned antelopes are now found in low numbers. <b>Their</b> <b>numbers</b> were estimated at slightly above 10,000 in 2001, and are feared to be decreasing. In Mudumalai National Park, the populations are low and scattered. <b>Their</b> <b>numbers</b> in Gir National Park were estimated at 256 individuals in 1974; later estimates at waterholes {{in the same}} location put them a little above 1000. Densities of above 0.7 individuals per km2 have been considered as being healthy. Presently the four-horned antelope is confined to the Indian subcontinent, occurring widely in disjunct and small populations. The range in India covers a vast expanse, from {{the foothills of the}} Himalayas in the north to the Deccan Plateau in the south. Most of the existing populations are in India, and lower numbers in adjoining Nepal.|$|E
5|$|Increasing sea {{temperatures}} in tropical regions (~1 degree C) {{the last century}} have caused major coral bleaching, death, and therefore shrinking coral populations since although {{they are able to}} adapt and acclimate, it is uncertain if this evolutionary process will happen quickly enough to prevent major reduction of <b>their</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York City, they stayed {{for several days}} and an exhibition game was organised.

The team then travelled to San Francisco, via the Niagara Falls, Chicago, and the Grand Canyon. In San Francisco they played two matches against British Columbia; the first won 43–6 and the second 65–6. From there they sailed back to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who also lived in longhouses, {{primarily}} in what is now the state of New York. The Iroquois had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond <b>their</b> <b>numbers.</b> To fill the void left by {{the demise of}} the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the Susquehanna watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).|$|E

5|$|As {{the number}} of condors grew, {{attention}} {{began to focus on}} releasing some back into the wild. In 1988, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only females were released, to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America. California condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon. Though the birth rate remains low in the wild, <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> are increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.|$|E
5|$|As the stallions of the Poitevin breed {{could not}} be used to produce mules, they were {{generally}} sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in Vendée and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as to horse merchants in Berry, Beauce, Perche and the Midi. In these areas, they were used for agriculture. In Paris, they were used for pulling omnibuses, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> have recovered to a sufficient level.|$|E

5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas.

Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
