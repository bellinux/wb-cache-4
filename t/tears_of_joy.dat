5|$|Auden began {{summering}} in Europe, {{together with}} Chester Kallman, in 1948, first in Ischia, Italy, where he rented a house, then, starting in 1958, in Kirchstetten, Austria, where {{he bought a}} farmhouse from the prize money of the Premio Feltrinelli awarded to him in 1957, and, he said, shed <b>tears</b> <b>of</b> <b>joy</b> at owning {{a home for the}} first time. In 1956–61, Auden was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University where he was required to give three lectures each year. This fairly light workload allowed him to continue to winter in New York, where he lived at 77 St. Mark's Place in Manhattan's East Village, and to summer in Europe, spending only three weeks each year lecturing in Oxford. He earned his income mostly from readings and lecture tours, and by writing for The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, and other magazines.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have offered}} various {{interpretations of the}} film's message and its {{significance}} for the series. Particular {{attention has been paid}} to the ambiguous imagery in the ending: set 700 years after the main events, the last scene depicts a statue of Caesar shedding a single tear as the Lawgiver recounts Caesar's story to an integrated audience of ape and human children. By one interpretation, the statue cries <b>tears</b> <b>of</b> <b>joy</b> because the species have broken the cycle of oppression, giving the series an optimistic finale. By another, the statue weeps because racial strife still exists, implying the dystopian future of Planet and Beneath is unavoidable.|$|E
25|$|Rias {{develops}} {{feelings for}} Issei {{over the course}} of the series. In the storyline where she is to be Riser Phoenix's fiancee, she resigns her Rating Game against him in order to save Issei; however, after Issei subsequently defeats Riser, she kisses him and moves into his family's home. She does not mind being intimate with Issei, but gets upset when other girls want to steal him away. Later, Rias' mother, Venelana, encourages her to push her relationship further with Issei (in which Rias would attempt to seduce Issei), but gets upset when Issei could not call her by her name. Eventually, Issei finally professes his love for her and calls Rias by her first name instead of her President title. She cries <b>tears</b> <b>of</b> <b>joy</b> and tells him that she feels the same way and the two officially become a couple. Though it seems none of the other girls (Akeno, Xenovia, Asia, Koneko, Irina, Rossweisse and Ravel) have given up on Issei. She has also shown more tolerance towards Issei's dreams of becoming Harem King, even allowing everyone to make dates with Issei with the understanding that he will always return to her afterwards.|$|E

500|$|After the race, Degenkolb contrasted {{his tears}} of {{frustration}} at his eighteenth {{place in the}} 2014 race to the <b>tears</b> <b>of</b> <b>joy</b> that followed his victory in 2015. He attributed his win {{in part to the}} fact that he was not seen as a favourite, and he gave credit to his teammates Bert De Backer and Tom Dumoulin for their assistance during the race. Degenkolb described it as [...] "the best day in [...] cycling career", as it was his first victory in one of the cycling monuments (he won a second in April in the Paris–Roubaix).|$|E
500|$|However, {{in two of}} Sonic's TV adaptations (Sonic X and Sonic Boom), their {{feelings}} are explored to a much deeper extent (although this content is not considered canon). Throughout Sonic X, although Sonic usually attempts to repel her advances when {{in the company of}} friends, the two share a handful of intimate moments when alone together. In episode 52, when Sonic returns to Earth, Amy is the first person whom he chooses to visit. In the ensuing conversation, Sonic silently mouths the words [...] "I love you", causing Amy to break into <b>tears</b> <b>of</b> <b>joy,</b> and the two share a very heartfelt moment. This was changed in the English dub, where Amy demands that Sonic never leave her again and Sonic audibly replies that he never will.|$|E
500|$|Some reports {{indicate}} that during Queen Mary I's reign bystanders were vocal in their support: while in transit convicts sometimes suffered directly {{at the hands of}} the crowd. [...] William Wallace was whipped, attacked and had rotten food and waste thrown at him, and the priest Thomas Pilchard was reportedly barely alive by the time he reached the gallows in 1587. [...] Others found themselves admonished by [...] "zealous and godly men"; it became customary for a preacher to follow the condemned, asking them to repent. [...] According to Samuel Clarke, the Puritan clergyman William Perkins (1558–1602) once managed to convince a young man at the gallows that he had been forgiven, enabling the youth to go to his death [...] "with <b>tears</b> <b>of</b> <b>joy</b> in his eyes... as if he actually saw himself delivered from the hell which he feared before, and heaven opened for receiving his soul".|$|E

500|$|Billboards Michael Paoletta applauded Vespertine for its [...] "positive [...] ", feeling some of {{the tracks}} [...] "have the {{strength}} to bring <b>tears</b> (<b>of</b> <b>joy</b> and pain) to the eyes." [...] Q also praised the album, stating that it [...] "quietly proves that cutting-edge production and human contact aren't mutually exclusive." [...] American music journalist Robert Christgau enjoyed the album's central theme of sex and wrote: [...] "when she gets all soprano on your ass you could accuse her of spirituality". A more lukewarm review came from Pitchforks Ryan Schreiber, who felt that: [...] "while undeniably beautiful, Vespertine fails to give electronic music the forward push it received on Björk's preceding albums". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "her lyrics occasionally dive into the deep end" [...] and [...] "her voice is at times stiff", although he also wrote [...] "when it all comes together, [...] Björk and her electronica collaborators create moving interplanetary chorals". Almost Cool wrote: [...] "if there's one question to be raised with the album, it's that it's all simply so lush and nice that on some levels it fails to excite". Various reviews named Vespertine Björk's best album to date, including The A.V. Club, Rolling Stone, About.com, and PopMatters.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "North Hollywood" [...] is an affectionate ode to Hunt's {{community}} at the time. Its lyrics portray the district as the [...] "crown jewel of saboteurs" [...] and reference its population of misfits and low-lifes, including evicting landlords and conniving starlets. The song features abrasive funk, distorted guitar, {{and a heavy}} beat. [...] "Watching You Go Crazy Is Driving Me Insane" [...] features a melodic punk and garage rock style, with dark humor in its lyrics. It is about a couple whose financial difficulties affect their relationship. [...] "Designer Jeans" [...] features lyrics with psychedlic musings on the contemporary social climate, including criticism of [...] "mass production and consumption of opinions" [...] and the erasure of independent thought. [...] "Plum" [...] is an ode to a lover's posterior. [...] "Falls (Violet)" [...] is a ballad with a sketchy country music feel. Its narrator expresses support to a woman he is infatuated with as she dates someone else. [...] "Moving Targets" [...] is a bedroom ballad with sparse, 1980s-styled percussion and an Isley Brothers influence. Its lyrics use warfare imagery in detailing a romance. [...] "Eyes Like Pearls" [...] features hard rock guitar and earnest, romantic lyrics, which Hunt explained to The Huffington Post: [...] "It's a very passionate love, one that's rarely known in one's life. They're obviously <b>tears</b> <b>of</b> <b>joy,</b> but it's a passion beyond anything I've ever known. It's a relationship where somebody understands me and who I understand." ...|$|E

Later, the Doctor arrives outside the home of Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), two years since he left them there ("The God Complex").
