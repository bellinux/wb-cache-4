5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} has {{a relatively}} low melting point and boils at around 315°C. The vapour consists of the dimer Fe2Cl6 (c.f. aluminium chloride) which increasingly dissociates into the monomeric FeCl3 (D3h point group molecular symmetry) at higher <b>temperature,</b> <b>in</b> competition with its reversible decomposition to give iron(II) chloride and chlorine gas.|$|E
5|$|Next to the {{hydrated}} {{region is}} an intermediate region {{that is only}} partially hydrated. This boundary layer is approximately 0.3nm thick. Within this short distance, the water concentration drops from 2M on the headgroup side to nearly zero on the tail (core) side. The hydrophobic core of the bilayer is typically 3-4nm thick, but this value varies with chain length and chemistry. Core thickness also varies significantly with <b>temperature,</b> <b>in</b> particular near a phase transition.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a soft silver-white {{metal that}} resembles {{platinum}}. It {{is the least}} dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked.

5|$|Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has {{the highest}} average {{elevation}} of all the continents. Antarctica is a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200mm (8in) along the coast and far less inland. The <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> Antarctica has reached −89.2°C (−128.6°F) (or even −94.7 as measured from space), though the average {{for the third quarter}} (the coldest part of the year) is −63°C (−81°F). Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation, where it occurs, is tundra.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and <b>temperature.</b> <b>In</b> a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.|$|E
50|$|Geraldton has a Mediterranean climate with dry, sunny {{conditions}} and warm sea temperatures throughout the summer.

5|$|Beryl made {{landfall}} in a {{sparsely populated}} region of northeast Mexico, so no official reports of tropical storm force winds were recorded. Moisture from Beryl brought 0.8 in (20.1mm) {{of rain in}} Corpus Christi, Texas and 0.5in (13.7mm) in Brownsville, Texas in a 48-hour period between August 14 and August 16. The highest winds from these stations {{were no more than}} 28mph (46km/h). Cloud cover and rainfall resulted with cool high temperatures in southern Texas. Brownsville had a high temperature of 84˚F (28.9˚C) on August 15. This broke the record for the coolest maximum <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> Brownsville for August 15; the previous record was 85˚F (29.4˚C) set in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1866, he {{developed}} {{the theory of the}} distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula, called the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, gives the fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given <b>temperature.</b> <b>In</b> the kinetic theory, temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. Maxwell's work on thermodynamics led him to devise the thought experiment that {{came to be known as}} Maxwell's demon, where the second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.|$|E
40|$|Tiller Reservoir In {{an average}} year the {{reservoir}} {{is capable of}} holding water <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> South Umpqua River below 70 ° F. {{for a wide range}} of regulation schedules.

Regulations designed to control water <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> South Umpqua River will have no significant influence on water <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> the main stem of the Umpqua River because of the large volume contributed by the unregulated North Umpqua River. Galesville Reservoir The reservoir has the capability to hold water <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> Cow Creek below 70 ° F. in an average year provided nearly the entire storage capacity is regulated for <b>temperature</b> control. <b>In</b> a year of maximum temperature, only about one-half of the length of Cow Creek below the reservoir can be held below 70 ° F. for the entire summer. Hinkle Reservoir The reservoir is capable of holding water <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> Calapooya Creek below 70 ° F. for all meteorological conditions.

5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then {{converted}} into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E
5|$|In 1761, Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov {{observed}} an arc {{of light}} surrounding {{the part of}} Venus off the Sun's disc {{at the beginning of}} the egress phase of the transit and concluded that Venus has an atmosphere. In 1940, Rupert Wildt calculated that the amount of CO2 in the Venusian atmosphere would raise surface temperature above the boiling point for water. This was confirmed when Mariner 2 made radiometer measurements of the <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> 1962. In 1967, Venera 4 confirmed that the atmosphere consisted primarily of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Main-sequence stars employ {{two types}} of {{hydrogen}} fusion processes, {{and the rate of}} energy generation from each type depends on the <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> the core region. Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts, based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process. In the lower main sequence, energy is primarily generated {{as the result of the}} proton-proton chain, which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium. Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the CNO cycle. (See the chart.) This process uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium.|$|E
