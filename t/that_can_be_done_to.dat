When Samuel hears God {{speaking}} to him, he at first thinks it is Eli; Eli, who doesn't hear God calling Samuel, eventually realizes the truth, and instructs Samuel on how to respond. Samuel is told that God's threat (which isn't elaborated further) {{will be carried out}} on Eli and his family, and that there is nothing <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> prevent it. Eli asks Samuel what he had been told, insisting that he be told the whole truth, and so Samuel does; Eli reacts by saying that God will do as he judges best.|$|E
25|$|A {{demand for}} control {{of this process is}} based on the {{principle}} of caution and effective control measures are regarded as necessary. However this faces problems that are not negligible. To separate the “pure” dingo from other domestic dogs is difficult, if it is possible at all. The costs would be enormous, and even if all hybrids are destroyed, there are currently no methods to tests the dingoes in the field. Furthermore, control measures usually do not discriminate between dingoes and other domestic dogs. According to the biologist David Jenkins from the Australian National University there is little <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> reverse the process of interbreeding. Even if selectively searching for hybrids during the killings, it would only disrupt the pack structure and therefore affect the breeding rate of the dogs.|$|E

25|$|Currently the Fiero has a cult {{following}} {{of owners}} and customizers. While all Fiero models {{are considered to}} be collectible, the 1988 model year is particularly sought after by collectors due to its limited production numbers and vastly improved underpinnings. Because of an abundance of replacement parts available from other General Motors vehicles, there are many upgrades <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> improve performance and reliability of the cars. Additionally, a multitude of different General Motors engines have been installed by enthusiasts, from the Quad-4 engine to the Chevrolet small-block V8 to the Cadillac 4.9L and Northstar V8s. The GM 3800 Supercharged is also a very popular choice, as well as the 3.4L found in the 1993, 1994, or 1995 Camaro/Firebird. One shop in particular that pioneered and now specializes in V8 installations has even {{gone so far as to}} install the famed Z06 Corvette powerplant, the 505horsepower LS7, into a Fiero. Installation of the 4.9L V8 or smaller engines is possible with few modifications to the car itself, because Fiero prototypes were tested with a similar small aluminum V8 prior to production. As a result, the engine bay is large enough to accommodate engines of that size.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to new LRVs, San Diego Trolley also slowly retrofitted the SD-100s LRVs with new paint, door sensors & switches, wheelchair lifts, route display signs, and interior & exterior lighting. The oldest model U2 trolleys {{had very little}} <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> improve their functionality or operation as they lacked the overhead equipment compartments found in the SD-100s and S70s, and were planned to be entirely phased out and retired by 2015. Eleven of the U2 cars were sold to the upstart Metrotranvía Mendoza in Mendoza, Argentina; another 29 had been retired by early 2013, {{and the rest of}} the U2 trolleys were retired from service in January 2015. [...] Four U2 cars have been preserved: car 1019 at the Rockhill Trolley Museum, car 1008 at the Orange Empire Railway Museum, as well as cars 1017 and 1018 at the Western Railway Museum.|$|E

Pietro enters to confirm that Aurelio is safe but is changing his clothes. [...] His wife demands that he be brought to her and, when Aurelio arrives he brings with him their young son, Filippo. [...] There is a great reunion of all four: (Aurelio's Aria di sortita: cantabile: Al mio cor oggetti amati / Vi congiunga un solo amplesso... / [...] "Let me hold to my heart / All my dearest in one embrace"). [...] Overcoming tears, Aurelio is questioned as to the chances of survival. He turns to the problems at hand, fiercely proclaiming that there is nothing <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> survive the English attack except by fighting to the end: (Cabaletta: Aureilo, then ensemble: Giovanni, Eleanora, Eustachio; Aurelio repeats, then all: Giammai del forte l'ardir non langue / [...] "The audacity of the strong never languishes").|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{exercises}} <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> strengthen the lower leg. For example, in order to activate plantar flexors in the deep plantar flexors one can sit on the floor with the hips flexed, the ankle neutral with knees fully extended as they alternate pushing their foot against a wall or platform. This kind of exercise is beneficial as it hardly causes any fatigue. [...] Another form of isometric exercise for the gastrocnemius would be seated calf raises which can be done with or without equipment. One can be seated at a table with their feet flat on the ground, and then plantar flex both ankles so that the heels are raised off the floor and the gastrocnemius flexed. An alternate movement could be heel drop exercises with the toes being propped on an elevated surface—as an opposing movement this would improve the range of motion. One-legged toe raises for the gastrocnemius muscle can be performed by holding one dumbbell in one hand while using the other for balance, and then standing with one foot on a plate. The next step would be to plantar flex and keep the knee joint straight or flexed slightly. The triceps surae is contracted during this exercise. Stabilization exercises like the BOSU ball squat are also important especially as they assist in the ankles having to adjust to the ball’s form in order to balance.|$|E
