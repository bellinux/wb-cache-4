5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> {{followed through}} {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E
5|$|For Register of Wills, as for City Controller, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> {{a primary}} fight between the Hamilton-Meade regulars and the Meehan faction. As in that contest, the regulars were victorious, nominating Robert C. Duffy, {{attorney}} and former football star, with 67,283 votes. In second came Meehan's man, Morris J. Root, with 42,977, and William P. Shermer, an independent candidate, with 8,909. The Democrats had {{an easier time}} nominating former Congressman Francis R. Smith, who trounced Joseph F. Amodie, 40,582 to 5,470. The general election contest {{was one of the}} closest on the ballot but the Republican, Duffy, still defeated the Democrat by more than 7,500 votes.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with other results, this 12 percentage point margin was smaller than Gore's 25 point margin over Bush in the state Presidential contest, was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D'Amato in the hotly contested 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger Howard Mills. The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, {{because in recent decades}} <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E

50|$|Maloney {{was heavily}} favored, but <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> held {{legislative}} seats {{in this district}} as recently as 2002, and <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> opposition is not token. Nonetheless, Maloney won the general election on November 2, 2010.|$|R

5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> {{formed a}} number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They {{believed}} that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic {{about the idea of}} African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E
5|$|The battleground {{proved to}} be the Midwest—the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryan—and the Democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states. The Northeast was {{considered}} most likely safe for McKinley after the early-voting states of Maine and Vermont supported him in September. By then, it was clear that public support for silver had receded, and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue. By the end of September, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> discontinued printing material on the silver issue, and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question. On November 3, 1896, the voters had their say. McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest; he won 51% of the vote and an ample majority in the Electoral College. Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue, and had not appealed to urban workers. Voters in cities supported McKinley; the only city outside the South of more than 100,000 population carried by Bryan was Denver, Colorado.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> chosen Grant Matthews {{to run for}} President. Grant is {{estranged from}} his wife Mary, and he has become romantically {{involved}} with Kay Thorndike, a newspaper publisher.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two major}} American {{political}} parties, the Democrats and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>have</b> become increasingly polarized, with the Democrats described as [...] "liberal" [...] and [...] "left wing" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> as [...] "conservative" [...] and [...] "right wing".|$|R

5|$|William H. West of Ohio {{nominated}} Blaine with {{an enthusiastic}} speech {{and after the}} first ballot, Blaine led the count with 334½ votes. While short of the necessary 417 for nomination, Blaine had far {{more than any other}} candidate with Arthur in second place at 278 votes. Blaine was unacceptable to the Arthur delegates just as Blaine’s own delegates would never vote for the President, so the contest was between the two for the delegates of the remaining candidates. Blaine’s total steadily increased as Logan and Sherman withdrew in his favor and some of the Edmunds delegates defected to him. Unlike in previous conventions, the momentum for Blaine in 1884 would not be halted. On the fourth ballot, Blaine received 541 votes and was, at last, nominated. Logan was named vice presidential nominee on the first ballot, and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> their ticket.|$|E
5|$|Franklin County, {{which has}} elected Kilroy twice, makes up 87% of the 15th Congressional {{district}}. The 2006 race in Ohio's 15th district gained significant national attention {{as it was}} seen {{as one of a}} handful of seats that Democrats had an opportunity to gain from Republicans. As of mid-October, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to incumbent Representative Pryce's leadership in the Republican Party. Pryce had not had a close contest since her first election in 1992 and had garnered 10% more of the vote than George W. Bush in 2004. However, Pryce was vulnerable due to Ohio Republican Party (Bob Taft and Bob Ney) scandals, the lagging Ohio economy, her association with controversial Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley, and backlash to Republican support of the Iraq War. Another Ohio Republican scandal in the minds of Ohio voters during the 2006 campaign was the Coingate scandal. Pryce and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> to keep conservative independent, Charles Morrison, off the ballot to have their best shot at success. A month before the election, Pryce was 12points behind Kilroy. On the eve of the election, some experts, such as Time, considered Pryce the underdog. Kilroy was expected to be the beneficiary of the decade-long migration of conservative voters to suburbs outside of the district.|$|E
25|$|Opposing them, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> the Army of the North, {{led by the}} Colonel Prada, {{with the}} XIV Army Corps led by Francisco Galán (8,000–10,000 men) and the Colonel Linares's XVII Army corps (35,000). The Prada's chief of staff was Francisco Ciutat. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> 180 cannons, one {{squadron}} of Chatos and two flights of Moscas, around 35 aircraft.|$|E
50|$|From 1940 onwards, when Wendell Willkie {{carried the}} county due to {{opposition}} to involvement in World War II, Hamilton <b>has</b> become increasingly <b>Republican.</b> Although Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992 all gained absolute majorities for the Democratic Party, since 1992, {{as with all}} traditionally Democratic parts of the Upland South, a very rapid swing to <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>has</b> taken place due to overwhelming local opposition to the Democratic Party’s liberal views on social issues. Over the past six elections, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> advanced from losing by 21 percentage points to winning by an overwhelming fifty-eight - an average of gaining thirteen percentage points per election.|$|R

25|$|Nevertheless, by 1890 <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> {{agreed to}} the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Interstate Commerce Commission in {{response}} to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} December, Orgaz {{received}} reinforcements {{and decided}} to relaunch the offensive on 3 January. This offensive {{became known as the}} Battle of the Fog. The Republican high command redeployed their units in the Pozuelo-Brunete sector. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> an army corps led by Miaja with five divisions (led by Nino Nanetti, Modesto, Colonels Perea, Adolfo Prada and Galan) but had little ammunition or supplies.|$|E

25|$|After the {{occupation}} of Mérida and Badajoz, the Nationalists connected the Nationalist-held northern zone and the southern zone. Furthermore, the Nationalists occupied the western half of the province of Badajoz and the Republican government {{lost control of the}} Portuguese frontier.

Between 6,600 and 12,000 Republican supporters were executed by the Nationalists (<b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> executed 243 Nationalist supporters).|$|E
25|$|Dyer ran unsuccessfully {{for reelection}} in 1932, 1934 and 1936, during the Great Depression.

The administration of President Franklin D.

25|$|The 2009 New York State Senate {{leadership}} {{crisis was}} a political dispute that began on June 8, 2009. The State Senate was controlled by Democrats with a 32–30 majority, when a coalition of all 30 Republicans and two Democrats, Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada Jr., voted to replace the Majority Leader and Temporary President of the Senate. The other Senate Democrats attempted to block the change, but it was uncertain whether they were successful, or if <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> legally changed the Senate leadership.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Army {{was under}} the command of Juan Hernández Saravia, who had reorganized the army almost from scratch. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> a total of 100,000 men in two armies. The Army of the Levante was to conduct {{the main part of the}} assault {{supported}} by the Army of the East. Saravia wanted the coup de main against Teruel to be an all Spanish operation without the assistance of the International Brigades. Among his commanders was the trustworthy and able Communist commander, Enrique Líster, so Saravia chose Lister's division to lead the first assault.|$|E
