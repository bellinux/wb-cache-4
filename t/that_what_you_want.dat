2500|$|Rowling made a guest {{appearance}} as {{herself on the}} American animated sitcom The Simpsons, in a special British-themed episode entitled [...] "The Regina Monologues". The dialogue consisted of a short conversation between Rowling and Lisa Simpson, who mispronounces Rowling's name. She acknowlewdges Lisa with [...] "Thank you, young Muggle". When Lisa asks her about the ending of Harry Potter, Rowling sighs and says: [...] "He grows up, and marries you. Is <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to hear?" [...] to which Lisa swoons and dreamily replies, [...] "Yes!" [...] before Rowling rolls her eyes and walks away.|$|E
2500|$|In David Gordon's dances, simple {{movement}} phrases are reiterated until {{what you}} notice {{is not the}} movement itself but the distinctiveness of {{the bodies of the}} performers. Gordon's genius lies both in his choice of dancers, most noticeably his wife and longtime collaborator Valda Setterfield, and in his gestural vocabulary. Also, his use of language underscores the message of his dances, which is that the body's actions and signals, like words, can change their meaning depending on their context. The phrasing of Gordon's movements is uninflected, fluid, tending to slide comfortably through the memory, so <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to pay attention to is the very manner in which these particular interesting figures do whatever it is they are doing.

6000|$|The President's {{attitude}} {{to his colleagues}} had now become: I want to meet you so far as I can; I see your difficulties and I should {{like to be able}} to agree to what you propose; but I can do nothing that is not just and right, and you must first of all show me <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> does really fall within the words of the pronouncements which are binding on me.

60|$|I {{proved the}} fact by {{successive}} visits; but, after all my {{content with the}} outside of the Pantheon, I came to think <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> in Rome is not the best-preserved monument, not the most perfect pagan building, but the most ruinous ruin you can get. I am not sure that you get this in the mouldering memorials of the past on the Palatine Hill, but you get something more nearly like it than anything I can think of at the moment. In that imperial and patrician and plutocratic residential quarter you see, if you are of the moderately moneyed middle class, what the pride of life must always come to when it has its way; and your consolation is full if you pause to reflect how some day Fifth Avenue and the two millionaire blocks eastward will be as the Palatine now is.|$|E

6000|$|Sidonia {{listened to}} Tancred with deep attention. Lord Montacute was seated {{opposite}} the windows, {{so that there}} was a full light upon the play of the countenance, the expression of which Sidonia watched, while his keen and far-reaching vision traced {{at the same time the}} formation and development of the head of his visitor. He recognised in this youth not a vain and vague visionary, but a being in whom the faculties of reason and imagination were both of the highest class, and both equally developed. He observed that he was of a nature passionately affectionate, and that he was of a singular audacity. He perceived that though, at this moment, Tancred was as ignorant of the world as a young monk, he possessed all the latent qualities which in future would qualify him to control society. When Tancred had finished speaking, there was a pause of a few seconds, during which Sidonia seemed lost in thought; then, looking up, he said, 'It appears to me, Lord Montacute, <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> is to penetrate the great Asian mystery.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young woman, {{it will be}} easy {{to solve}} the difficulty: the dining-table itself shall be our platform, and you shall mount on top of that." [...] This was Basil Ransom's {{sportive}} reply to his companion's very natural appeal for light, and the reader will remark that if it led her to push her investigation no further, she was very easily satisfied. There was more reason, however, {{as well as more}} appreciation of a very considerable mystery, in what he went on to say. [...] "Charming to me, charming to all the world? What will become of your charm?--is <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know? It will be about five thousand times greater than it is now; that's what will become of it. We shall find plenty of room for your facility; it will lubricate our whole existence. Believe me, Miss Tarrant, these things will take care of themselves. You won't sing in the Music Hall, but you will sing to me; you will sing to every one who knows you and approaches you. Your gift is indestructible; don't talk as if I either wanted to wipe it out or should {{be able to make it}} a particle less divine. I want to give it another direction, certainly; but I don't want to stop your activity. Your gift is the gift of expression, and there is nothing I can do for you that will make you less expressive. It won't gush out at a fixed hour and on a fixed day, but it will irrigate, it will fertilise, it will brilliantly adorn your conversation. Think how delightful it will be when your influence becomes really social. Your facility, as you call it, will simply make you, in conversation, the most charming woman in America." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{weeks and}} weeks I have written nothing in my diary {{because it has been}} so discouraging. After Uncle William's offer to take over the {{presidency}} of Columbia University had been refused, he debated with Uncle Henry and with Cousin Ferdinand of Bulgaria (who is not living in our boarding house now but who comes over quite often in the evenings) whether he would accept the presidency of Harvard. Cousin Ferdinand looked up the salary in a book and told him not to take it. Cousin Ferdinand has little books with all the salaries of people in America and he says that these books are fine and much better than the Almanach de Gotha which we used to use in Europe to hunt people up. He says that if he ever goes back to be King of Bulgaria again he is going to introduce books like these. Cousin Ferdinand is getting very full of American ideas and he says <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know about a man is not his line of descent but his line of credit. And he says that the whole King business in Europe has been mismanaged. He says that there should have been millions in it. I forgot to say in my diary sooner that Cousin Ferdinand's two friends, Mr. Mosenhammer and Mr. Sheehan, took him into their clothing business at once as a sort of partner. The reason was that they found that he could wear clothes; the effect on the customers when they see Cousin Ferdinand walking up and {{down in front of the}} store is wonderful. Of course all kings can wear clothes and in the old days in the Potsdam palace we thought nothing of it. But Cousin Ferdinand says that the kings should have known enough to stop trying to be soldiers and to put themselves at the head of the export clothing trade. He wishes, he says, that he had some of his Bulgarian generals here now in their blue coats trimmed with black fur; he says that with a little alteration, which he showed us how to do, he could have sent them out [...] "on the road," [...] wherever that is, and have made the biggest boom in gentlemen's winter fur trimmings that the trade ever saw.|$|E
