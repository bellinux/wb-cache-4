5|$|From its {{headwaters}} downstream to the downstream-most {{crossing of}} the Scranton/Moosic line, the drainage basin of Stafford Meadow Brook is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From that point downstream to its mouth, the stream is classified as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. A large section of the stream from its headwaters to the lower Pennsylvania Route 307 bridge meets the criteria for an Exceptional Value designation. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream {{at least as far}} upstream as river mile 6.82 and as far downstream as its mouth. The stream was stocked with 500 adult and fingerling rainbow <b>trout</b> <b>in</b> 1894–1895. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Fish Commission speculated that there were native brook <b>trout</b> <b>in</b> part of the stream.|$|E
5|$|Henry C. Bradsby's 1893 book History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania {{stated that}} Long Pond and Round Pond, two ponds in the watershed, {{had a large}} fish population. The creek was stocked with 700 fingerling, yearling, and adult brook <b>trout</b> <b>in</b> 1909.|$|E
5|$|More {{fish have}} been {{discovered}} in the newly daylighted section of the river. Baby eastern blacknose dace and tessellated darter have been spotted in the river in addition to <b>trout.</b> <b>In</b> addition, wood frogs, eastern painted turtles, and redbreast sunfish live in the river too. All of these species have been hurt by the industrialization of the river.|$|E

5|$|Anglers {{will find}} pike {{in excess of}} , with good stocks of chub, dace, roach, bream, tench, perch, rudd, and gudgeon. There are <b>trout</b> <b>in</b> the upper reaches. There are several access points along the river {{suitable}} for canoeing, and the river has been paddled as far up as Bruton, but above West Lydford only after recent rain. There are public footpaths alongside many stretches of the river. There are also areas of the river that serve as desirable spots for wild swimming.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{and hunting}} are popular outdoor {{activities}} in South Dakota. Fishing contributes over $224million to South Dakota's economy, and hunting contributes over $303million. In 2007, over 275,000 hunting licences and 175,000 fishing licences {{were sold in}} the state; around half of the hunting licences and over two-thirds of the fishing licences were purchased by South Dakotans. Popular species of game include pheasants, white-tailed deer, mule deer, and turkeys, as well as waterfowl such as Canada geese, snow geese, and mallards. Targets of anglers include walleye in the eastern glacial lakes and Missouri River reservoirs, Chinook salmon in Lake Oahe, and <b>trout</b> <b>in</b> the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} <b>trout</b> <b>in</b> sea-run, resident {{stream and}} lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run cutthroat trout fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E

5|$|The {{total biomass}} of wild <b>trout</b> <b>in</b> Scotch Run in its lower reaches is 4.39 {{kilograms}} per hectare. All of the biomass comes from brook trout (3.40 kilograms per hectare {{of which are}} less than 175 millimeters long and 0.99 kilograms per hectare of which are more than 175 millimeters long).

5|$|The {{total biomass}} of wild <b>trout</b> <b>in</b> Scotch Run in its upper reaches is 2.98 {{kilograms}} per hectare. 2.93 kilograms per hectare come from brook trout (2.42 kilograms per hectare {{of which are}} less than 175 millimeters long and 0.51 kilograms per hectare of which are more than 175 millimeters long).

5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) <b>trout</b> <b>in</b> the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E
