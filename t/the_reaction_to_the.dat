5|$|Communication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago was {{impossible}} without months of delay, {{so he was}} not part of this rapid publication. Fortunately, Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed public or private bitterness. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to {{the highest levels of the}} scientific community. <b>The</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries; but, with Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.|$|E

Additionally, when IGN interviewed Shinji Hashimoto about Kingdom Hearts III, he stated that the studio would consider another HD collection if <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first one was positive enough. The collection was announced on October 14, 2013, exclusively for the PlayStation 3. As with HD 1.5 Remix, the collection was developed mainly by the Square Enix 1st Production Department in Osaka, along with some help from Square Enix's Tokyo team. In July 2017, Nomura spoke on bringing the collection to the Xbox One, saying {{he did not believe}} there was much demand for it outside of North America, but felt it could be a possibility after Square Enix completed development on Kingdom Hearts III.|$|E

5|$|Ripostes, {{published}} in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. Michael Alexander describes the poems as showing a greater concentration {{of meaning and}} economy of rhythm than his earlier work. It was published when Pound had just begun his move toward Imagism; his first {{use of the word}} Imagiste appears in his prefatory note to the volume. The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century Old English poem The Seafarer, although not a literal translation. It upset scholars, as would Pound's other translations from Latin, Italian, French and Chinese, either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the cultural context. Alexander writes that in some circles, Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Seafarer was a rehearsal for the negative response to Homage to Sextus Propertius in 1919. His translation from the Italian of Sonnets and ballate of Guido Cavalcanti was also {{published in}} 1912.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{announcement}} of a share repurchase provides a firm’s management with <b>the</b> opportunity <b>to</b> communicate with existing and potential shareholders. Our results indicate that voluntary information disclosed by management in an insurance compa-ny’s repurchase announcement concerning the future prospects of the firm has little marginal impact on <b>the</b> market’s <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> repurchase announcement. The one exception is management statements indicating that the repurchase of common shares represents a good investment for the firm. In contrast, our results indicate that information disclosed by management {{about the details of}} the repurchase program does have a marginal impact on <b>the</b> market’s <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> repurchase announcement. For example, if the firm’s management mentions the method of repurchase there is an increase in <b>the</b> market’s <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> announcement, regardless of the method. In addition, the usage of a tender offer to repurchase stock has a large statistically significant positive effect on <b>the</b> market’s <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{announcement of}} a repur-chase.

This thesis operationalizes these research questions by looking at three case studies: <b>the</b> US <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2006 Lebanese-Israeli War, <b>the</b> US <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2011 Bahraini uprising, and the March 2011 uprising against Bashar Al-Assad’s regime in Syria.

The response from music critics was overall very positive, although some responded negatively to Strauss's use of waltzes, a music form practically unknown during the era when the story of the opera takes place. Despite this, the opera became one of the composer's most popular works during his lifetime and the opera remains a part of the standard repertoire today.|$|E
25|$|Species-specific defense {{reactions}} (SSDRs) or avoidance {{learning in}} nature is the specific tendency to avoid certain threats or stimuli, {{it is how}} animals survive in the wild. Humans and animals both share these species-specific defense reactions, such as the flight, fight, which also include pseudo-aggression, fake or intimidating aggression, freeze response to threats, which {{is controlled by the}} sympathetic nervous system. These SSDRs are learned very quickly through social interactions between others of the same species, other species, and interaction with the environment. These acquired sets of reactions or responses are not easily forgotten. The animal that survives is the animal that already knows what to fear and how to avoid this threat. An example in humans is <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sight of a snake, many jump backwards before cognitively realizing what they are jumping away from, and in some cases it is a stick rather than a snake.|$|E

As World Bank President Robert McNamara declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources, doctors in La Paz, Bolivia called it insulting that money should be exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation. In Colombia, Cardinal archbishop Aníbal Muñoz Duque declared, if American conditionality undermines Papal teachings, we prefer not to receive one cent. The Senate of Bolivia passed a resolution stating that Humanae vitae could be discussed in its implications for individual consciences, but was of greatest significance because the papal document defended the rights of developing nations to determine their own population policies. The Jesuit Journal Sic dedicated one edition to the encyclical with supportive contributions.|$|E
