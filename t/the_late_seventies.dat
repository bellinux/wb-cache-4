5|$|Later in the 1960s, Greyhound {{leadership}} saw a {{trend of}} declining ridership and began significant changes, including using the profitable bus operations {{to invest in}} other industries. By the 1970s, Greyhound had moved its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona and was a large and diversified company, with holdings in everything from the Armour meat-packing company (which in turn owned the popular Dial deodorant soap brand), acquired in 1970; Traveller's Express money orders, MCI bus manufacturing company, and even airliner leasing. Indeed, Greyhound had entered {{a time of great}} change, even beginning to hire African American and female drivers in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>seventies.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{sport was}} first {{developed}} at a bridge located in Ashdown Forest, {{close to the}} village of Upper Hartfield, East Sussex, England. Built in 1907 and originally called Posingford Bridge, it is considered to be the bridge on which Milne and his son first played the game. However, it is uncertain whether the sport was first played at the bridge then written into the story, or vice versa. The bridge maintained the public's interest and a campaign to rebuild it in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>seventies</b> was considered important enough to feature on the BBC NineO'Clock News. The bridge was subsequently reopened by Christopher Robin Milne and officially renamed as Poohsticks Bridge.|$|E

5000|$|Paddlefish (family Polyodontidae) are basal Chondrostean ray-finned fish.

5|$|The {{release of}} Ultime grida dalla savana {{initiated}} a rivalry between Climati and Morra {{and two other}} Italian Mondo film makers, Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni. These two filmmaking teams became the frontrunners of the Mondo genre in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>seventies</b> and early eighties. The Castiglionis had made two previous Mondo films, Africa segreta and Africa ama, before the release of Ultime grida dalla savana. They later released three additional films: Magia nuda in 1975, Addio ultimo uomo in 1978, Africa dolce e selvaggio in 1982. Climati and Morra made two follow-up films to Ultime grida dalla savana. The first followup, Savana violenta, also known as Savage Man Savage Beast no. 2, was released in 1976. Savana violenta was slightly less graphic in its depiction of violence. The last film, Dolce e selvaggio, was released in 1983 and consisted partly of outtakes and recycled footage from Climati and Morra's two previous films. Each subsequent release by the two parties would attempt to outperform the previous films with more explicit and shocking content.|$|E

25|$|Volvo's long-time CEO Pehr G. Gyllenhammar saw {{early on}} that Volvo {{was too small to}} survive in the future, and {{attempted}} several times to merge with other manufacturers. Volvo nearly merged with Saab in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>seventies,</b> while in 1978 an aborted affair would have seen the Norwegian state take over 40 percent of the company. In return, Volvo would receive 200 million SEK and a ten percent concession in the Oseberg oil field. Major institutional actors in Sweden opposed the deal and blocked it. A deal to merge with Renault was blocked in 1993, mainly opposed by a Swedish stockholders' association.|$|E
25|$|By 1981, Rajneesh's ashram hosted 30,000 {{visitors}} per year. Daily discourse audiences were by then predominantly European and American. Many observers {{noted that}} Rajneesh's lecture style changed in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>seventies,</b> becoming less focused intellectually and featuring {{an increasing number}} of ethnic or dirty jokes intended to shock or amuse his audience. On 10 April 1981, having discoursed daily for nearly 15 years, Rajneesh entered a three-and-a-half-year period of self-imposed public silence, and satsangs—silent sitting with music and readings from spiritual works such as Khalil Gibran's The Prophet or the Isha Upanishad—replaced discourses. Around the same time, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman) replaced Ma Yoga Laxmi as Rajneesh's secretary.|$|E

The major objective of the project was to improve the teaching of primary school teachers through selected microteaching skills, lesson planning, use of teaching kit and AV aids. This project was started in 1991 - 92 and completed in the year, 1999. Different studies were conducted which indicated that the project has an impact on the performance of the trained teachers.

25|$|Nottinghamshire enjoyed one {{of their}} strongest teams in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>seventies</b> and early eighties when the New Zealand all-rounder Richard Hadlee, South African captain Clive Rice and England batsman Derek Randall led the team to the County Championship in 1981. The club's most {{successful}} season came in 1987, as Rice and Hadlee marked their departure with the double of County Championship and NatWest Trophy. Chris Broad and Tim Robinson continued the club's long tradition of batting excellence into the England team but for some years the club struggled to repeat those achievements, although they did claim a Benson & Hedges Cup in 1989 and a Sunday League title in 1991 under Robinson's captaincy. Former Warwickshire off spinner Eddie Hemmings made a significant contribution while local seam bowler Kevin Cooper was a consistent wicket taker.|$|E
25|$|Ernő Zórád {{ended his}} {{professional}} relationship with Tibor Cs. Horváth and wrote his own comic scripts. Luckily Zórád {{was not just}} a great artist, but also a talented storyteller: these comics came much closer to the medium's own language. He also made experimental collage comics in the early seventies attracting international attention. These works were invited to the Salone Internazionale del Comics festival in 1970 but his portfolio – due to Hungarian bureaucracy – has arrived late. Furthermore, the works has been stolen from the festival. By <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>seventies</b> the classic trio of Hungarian comics creators disappeared: Korcsmáros died in 1975, Sebők died in 1980 and Zórád retired temporarily. Since young talents were not introduced during the preceding three decades (except for Attila Fazekas), many mark these years the end of Hungarian comics' golden age.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>seventies</b> {{and early}} eighties Tadao Ando's {{architecture}} and theoretical writings explored {{the idea of}} Critical regionalism – the idea of promoting local or national culture within architecture. Ando's interpretation of this was demonstrated by his idea of reacquainting the Japanese house with nature, a relationship he thought had been lost with Modernist architecture. His first projects were for small urban houses with enclosed courtyards (such as the Azuma House in Ōsaka in 1976). His architecture is characterised {{by the use of}} concrete, but it has been important for him to use the interplay of light, through time, with this and other materials in his work. His ideas about the integration of nature converted well into larger projects such as the Rokkō Housing 1 (1983) (on a steep site on Mount Rokkō) and the Church on the Water (1988) in Tomamu, Hokkaidō.|$|E
