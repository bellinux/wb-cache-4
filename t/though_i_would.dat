25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.' I mean, I do not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Rundgren started {{recording}} the album, {{he had already}} achieved commercial success as a solo artist, and a producer, and this increased his self-confidence. He had also become dissatisfied with other musicians playing on his recordings, recalling, [...] "I'd never played drums or bass before, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hector those that did." [...] This led him to decide to record the entire album by himself using multi-tracking.|$|E
5000|$|... c. Down {{the stairs}} came I. - First-person {{personal}} pronoun as subject; more likely, <b>though</b> still <b>I</b> <b>would</b> require stress ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet it {{will find}} you out before all is done, or so I think. Look you, pagan blood still runs in me, and, Christian <b>though</b> <b>I</b> am, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not dare {{one of the great}} gods of Greece and Rome. I'd leave that to the priests. Do you fear nothing, Olaf?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Frank; {{you ask me}} for my advice, and I {{will give}} it you: go home; <b>though,</b> indeed, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather you went {{anywhere}} else." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wong {{signed for}} the {{recording}} giant EMI in 1997 {{after her first}} daughter was born, in a contract worth HK$60 million (approx. US$7.7 million), to release 55 songs in five albums. While most of her earlier albums were sung in Cantonese, Wong has since sung almost exclusively in Mandarin, her mother tongue, although she recorded Cantonese versions {{of a couple of}} songs in each of her last four albums with EMI to please her Hong Kong audience. Having gone through a period of experimentation, Wong stated that she wished to make [...] "music that I like. I do not care if others don't, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be delighted if they do".|$|E
2500|$|The group {{developed}} a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even {{without the benefit of}} best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed [...] "fast-stepping" [...] dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: [...] "The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, but this is something that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!" [...] The group was a touring standout during this period with Knight's contralto lead vocals and the Pips' impeccable choreography and characteristic background vocals becoming highlights.|$|E
60|$|Well! I am for Ariosto against Tasso; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather praise Aristo's poetry {{than his}} poem.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so. Poor Matilda {{had been}} {{accustomed}} to all that money could buy for her. I never used to be close-fisted with her, <b>though</b> sometimes <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be tight." ...|$|R
6000|$|Unhappy, can I {{give you}} back your honour? [...] <b>Though</b> <b>I</b> forgave <b>would</b> any man forget? [...] While {{all the great}} green land has trampled on her [...] The treason and terror of the night we met.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, Chandos," [...] {{said the}} Prince; [...] "I would commit {{the matter to}} none so willingly as to you, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> scarce <b>would</b> have asked it, {{considering}} you were not quite so prompt on a late occasion." ...|$|R
60|$|Hip. Neither of us; for, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not lodge {{with you}} Myself, I never can endure he should.|$|E
6000|$|... "It means this, that <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{welcome you}} back to my arms with joy, I cannot do so, till you have--confessed your fault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My master says I must go, Emir; and I must obey his orders, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather {{stay with}} him. Tonight, I will leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a {{house in}} Claremorris belongs to me," [...] said Lord Ballindine, again rather sulky, [...] "or ever did to any of my family. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> as soon own Claremorris, <b>though,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> Castleblakeney. Your own town is quite as shattered-looking a place." ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{needless to}} add (<b>though</b> <b>I</b> knew nothing <b>would</b> come of it) that I consented {{to be the}} man.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a great}} deal, Larry, but not enough;--not {{enough to}} bring {{together}} {{a man and woman}} as husband and wife. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sooner marry a man <b>I</b> loved, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> knew he <b>would</b> ill-use me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Leland laughed softly. [...] "Well, {{perhaps that}} was the reason, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sooner believe it was because I {{recognised}} what I owed the State." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even {{under those}} {{circumstances}} I must refuse, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give a guinea to be with you. John Eames is coming here to say good-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At any rate,' said Lady Everingham, sighing, with {{a rather}} smiling face, 'we are kinsfolk, Mr. Coningsby; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> gladly have wished {{to have been}} more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quien sabe? The {{girls do}} not like me! The men do not care," [...] she declared. [...] "José took me by surprise, <b>though,</b> or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have killed him. But who are you, and where did you come from?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I make no doubt, Major Duncan, {{we shall}} {{be able to do}} all that will be {{necessary}} should Jasper turn out as you seem to anticipate; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> risk my life on his truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sam, I'll be frank,' she said, {{putting her}} hand on his. 'If it were only myself <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do it, and gladly, <b>though</b> {{everything}} <b>I</b> possess <b>would</b> be lost to me by marrying again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I tell? I {{did not ask}} her. I {{would not}} have asked her for the world, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have given the world to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the blood}} of his minion," [...] {{answered}} M'Aulay--"It is the blood which I was predestined to shed, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather have spilt my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; I {{will tell}} you, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not tell {{anyone else in}} the world. When we parted last I was angry with him--very angry with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{makes us}} {{a sort of}} cousins, {{according}} to those Dutch notions which he so much despises, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> fancy it <b>would</b> not count for much at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as you will, my daughter. It {{is not for}} me {{to force}} my {{presence}} upon you, <b>though,</b> believe me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have wished to serve you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "brother <b>though</b> he is, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not bend my head {{before a}} usurper, while Cacama lives. When {{do you think}} we had better leave here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is only my father. I {{can tell}} him I am invited to a party, and I don't think he'll mind. <b>Though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather not tell him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I suppose I must do it, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{much rather}} not. Still, as you say, it were {{best to get}} it all over at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldna," [...] replied Mr. Cathro, [...] "though I could, and I couldna <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> It would {{defy the}} face of clay to do it, you canny lover." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well, I don't want to drag you, old lady, {{against your}} will, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> fancy you <b>would</b> be rather {{surprised}} at the real aspect of the abode of iniquity your fancy depicts.' ...|$|R
