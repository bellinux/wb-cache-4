It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E

5000|$|There. That is {{the main}} thing I wanted to say. Comics.com, however, will, as they have announced, {{no longer be the}} source. Nothing {{dramatic}} happened, really. I simply came to feel that the editorial needs of comics.com and those of “Pibgorn” were becoming more and more divergent and incompatible. For this reason I asked to be released from my contract with United Media in order to secure a new online home for “Pibgorn.” United Media most graciously, and reluctantly, agreed. In short order I hope to get Pib back up and flying.Meanwhile, you have seen the most current installments of '"Pibgorn." [...] Hold that thought.

60|$|Before they {{departed}} from the cave Margaret expressed her <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> earnestly to the outlaw and his wife for their kindness in receiving her and the little prince into their cave, {{and in doing so}} much for their comfort while there, although by so doing they not only encroached <b>very</b> <b>much</b> upon their own slender means of support, but also incurred a very serious risk in harboring such a fugitive. Having been plundered of every thing by the robbers in the wood, she had nothing but thanks to return to her kind protectors. The nobles who were now with her offered the wife of the outlaw some money--for they had still a small supply of money left--but she would not receive it. They would require all they had, she said, for themselves, before they reached Scotland.|$|R

60|$|To a {{thoughtful}} man, no {{point of the}} social horizon is more full of light, than the altered temper of the young gentlemen. They have their faults and follies still--for when will young blood be other than hot blood? But when one finds, more and more, swearing banished from the hunting-field, foul songs from the universities, drunkenness and gambling from the barracks; when one finds everywhere, whether at college, in camp, or by the cover-side, more and more, young men desirous to learn their duty as Englishmen, and if possible to do it; when one hears their altered tone toward the middle classes, and that word 'snob' (<b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to Mr. Thackeray) used by them in its true sense, without regard of rank; when one watches, as at Aldershott, the care and kindness of officers toward their men; and over and above all this, when one finds in every profession (in that of the soldier as much as any) young men who are not only 'in the world,' but (in religious phraseology) 'of the world,' living God-fearing, virtuous, and useful lives, as Christian men should: then indeed one looks forward with hope and confidence {{to the day when}} these men shall settle down in life, and become, as holders of the land, the leaders of agricultural progress, and the guides and guardians of the labouring man.|$|E

5000|$|Spartak legends Nikita Simonyan and Alexander Mirzoyan have {{personally}} sent well {{wishes to}} Movsisyan {{in connection with}} his becoming a Spartak player. Mirzoyan personally wished Movsisyan success and gave Movsisyan an autographed photo of him. Simonyan wrote to Movsisyan, “Dear Yura, I hope that you win more titles at Spartak than I. I wish you success!” Movsisyan replied: “It {{will be difficult to}} exceed Simonyan’s achievements—both as a player and a coach. <b>Thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for such valuable gift. I know of Simonyan and Mirzoyan as the greatest players, and I am proud to be an Armenian just like them. I have not seen them play, but I know that they have done a lot for Spartak. I am not even close to them terms of accomplishments. But I certainly do have plans. I want to score goals and achieve wins. And when something goes successfully, I will enter into history at that time.” ...|$|E

He reminisced that if he were 20 years younger, he would be happy to still play for the club.|$|E
5000|$|Nader {{went on to}} say, [...] "I said that's the {{question}} HE has to answer. He can become a great President, or he can become a toady for the corporate powers that have brought both parties to their knees against working people in this country, and have allowed our country to be hijacked by global corporations who have no allegiance to this country other than to ship its jobs and industries to fascist and communist dictators abroad {{who know how to}} keep their workers in their place. This is reality here. This is not show business. It's not celebrity politics. There are people suffering in this country, and we expect a great Presidency from Barack Obama, and we're gonna try to hold his feet to the fire." [...] Fox News correspondent Shepard Smith asked rhetorically, [...] "I just wonder if in hindsight you wished you'd used a phrase other than 'Uncle Tom.'" [...] Nader responded, [...] "Not at all.

5000|$|NBC's last NBA {{telecast}} to {{date was}} Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Finals, which closed with highlights from the network's 12-year {{run with the}} league, through the Chicago Bulls' dynasty led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the retirement of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers' new Shaq/Kobe reign. The final image of the end montage was set in an empty gym, showing a basketball bouncing into the background and ending with the message, [...] "Thanks for The Memories." [...] Prior to the sequence, announcer Marv Albert and color commentators Steve Jones and Bill Walton evaluated {{the end of their}} NBA contract and of the series. After that, Bob Costas closed the network's last NBA broadcast with the following: Okay, Marv. <b>Thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> And as Marv himself would say, [...] "it should be pointed out" [...] that Marv is celebrating his forty-ninth birthday tonight for a record twelfth consecutive year. Well, another season is in the books. The Lakers title run continues with perhaps no end in sight. But as Marv said, we have reached the end of our run with the NBA. NBC's twelve years televising the league had been filled with indelible moments. And so, as we say good night, here's an appreciative look back. And for one last time, you've been watching the NBA on NBC.|$|E
5000|$|At its launch, The Bugle was {{distributed}} by TimesOnline, {{which is owned}} by Rupert Murdoch's News International. During the News International phone hacking scandal of 2011, The Bugle satirised its parent company in a manner which the New York Times characterized as [...] "blistering" [...] in an article published 15 August. Over the course of a few weekly episodes prior to the New York Times' article, Zaltzman and Oliver had gone [...] "straight for the jugular" [...] regarding News International, its newspapers, and Murdoch himself. Their barbs included a comment that The News of the World [...] "would not be missed at all", as well as the assertion by Oliver—in response to the shaving cream pie attack on Murdoch—that despite the humor inherent in the attack, [...] "you just don't want to find yourself with any misplaced sympathy for Rupert Murdoch." [...] The comedians jokingly marveled with one another that no one in News International had yet shut down their podcast, with Oliver tapping his microphone and asking, [...] "Should this not have been stopped by now? It doesn’t make sense!" [...] In response to the report from the New York Times, in an episode of The Bugle released 19 August, Oliver gave this opening monologue:"Welcome to any first-time Buglers who are here because they might have read The New York Times' story on us earlier this week&hellip;but now that the story's in a newspaper that I'm guessing Murdoch reads cover to cover every day, I'm thinking there's an even smaller chance of us managing to not get fired now. So <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> New York Times! Your trumpeting of this podcast may well turn into bugling the Last Post. I guess what I'm saying is—to our new listeners—'Hello and goodbye!'" ...|$|E
5000|$|The teenage Rachel was [...] "bolshy" [...] and vastly {{different}} from later appearances, being {{a lot more}} selfish. She {{was said to be}} clever and attractive and fierce like her mother and was once referred to as a, [...] "stroppy little madam who always has to get her own way." [...] When Bloomfield was cast, she read the character synopsis and was pleasantly surprised, [...] "That defensive, overconfident, angry little girl. I can do that, for some reason. She was the sarcastic, say-all-the-things-you-want-to-say-but-no-one-ever-does kid ... She felt she had a high status, and though she really didn't, she gave that to herself and that's a self-defence mechanism." [...] Television New Zealand described her first love as being with, [...] "her mother's credit card" [...] and it was noted that by 1995, Rachel had become the [...] "hippest" [...] thing on New Zealand television due to her parents fortune allowing her to have a vast wardrobe. This was said to be a large change from the [...] "schoolgirl in a miniskirt" [...] who first arrived to the show in 1993. She was said to be physically mature but mentally had a lot of growing to do and also had a [...] "ruthless streak". Bloomfield described the teenage Rachel as [...] "messed up" [...] but praised this aspect of her personality as it allowed her to play [...] "a whole array of emotions". The character is known for her [...] "sharp tongue" [...] and [...] "quick wit". By the mid nineties, it was said that Rachel had, [...] "acquired a calmer approach to life and is looking at the bigger picture for the first time. Now she's into helping others besides herself and is learning to take more of the good with the bad." [...] Bloomfield has stated that due to the characters personality being; [...] "hostile, caustic and aggressive", it made it difficult to continuously play the role. Rachel is known to cover [...] "ethical storylines" [...] over melodrama, something which Bloomfield believes leads Rachel to act like she does. Bloomfield believed Rachel was a true portrayal of a working woman in the 21st century, stating, [...] "Rachel represents many modern women. She's crammed so much into her twenties that it's almost as if she needs to step back and reassess her life." [...] During Rachel's 2007 return, Bloomfield described her as not being, [...] "completely the same Rachel. She's all about work now, any time they discuss her personal life she brings it back to how it supports her work agenda." [...] Bloomfield realised while at voice training, that she did not like Rachel as a person and would struggle to be friends with her in reality. Producer Steven Zanoski described Rachel's personality as; [...] "Independent, feisty and always quotable". Rachel has been described as the person who; [...] "says all those things you're too scared to say but you wish you could. She'll do it her way, <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> and she doesn't suffer fools." [...] Upon her return in 2009, Rachel took on a more antagonistic role, being labelled a [...] "villain" [...] and a [...] "home-wrecker". Rachel {{has been described as a}} [...] "glossy little rich bitch" [...] and a [...] "bossy boots". Bloomfield found it hard to understand some of Rachel's personal motives, saying; [...] "She doesn't need to be liked, but she likes to be loved and respected. So although I don't believe she is at one with herself she is hopeful. There haven't been too many triumphs for Rachel." [...] Bloomfield believed that Rachel acted differently depending on whom she was with, [...] "there were a few she loved and when you saw her feel protected and loved you got to see a softer side of her. But then again, when the shit hits the fan, all she can fall back on is self-preservation. She's very flawed in a way where she didn't realise people could see her flaws but it doesn't take much to pick holes in her." ...|$|E
