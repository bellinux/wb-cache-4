50|$|Double {{taxation}} is avoided for UK dividends by exempting {{them from}} tax for most companies: only dealers in shares suffer tax on them. Where double taxation arises because of overseas tax suffered, relief is available {{either in the}} form of expense or credit relief. Expense relief allows the overseas tax to be treated as a deductible expense in the tax computation. Credit relief is given as a deduction from the UK tax liability, but is restricted to the amount of UK tax suffered on the foreign income. There is a system of onshore pooling, so that overseas tax suffered in high <b>tax</b> <b>territories</b> may be set off against taxable income arising from low <b>tax</b> <b>territories.</b> From 1 July 2009, new rules were introduced to exempt most non-UK dividends from corporation tax so these double taxation rules in respect of non-UK dividends will be of less common application in practice after that date.|$|R

50|$|The revolt, {{which began}} in September 869, was {{concentrated}} in the districts of Iraq and al-Ahwaz (modern Khuzestan Province) in the central regions of the Abbasid Caliphate.

They became adept at raiding towns, villages and enemy camps (often at night), seizing weapons, horses, food and captives and freeing fellow slaves, and burning the rest to cinders to delay retaliation. As the rebellion grew in strength, they also constructed fortresses, built up a navy for traversing the canals and rivers of the region, collected <b>taxes</b> in <b>territories</b> under their control, and minted their own coins.|$|R

50|$|In 426 BC, Spartan general Eurylochus, {{on his way}} to Naupactus, {{arrived to}} Delphi and sent a herald to Amfissa, in order to detach them from Athens and make the Amfissians leave him pass through their lands. The latter were the first to give him hostages and also persuaded the other Locrian cities to do the same, as they were alarmed at the hostility of the {{neighbouring}} Phocians. After the Peloponnesian War the Amfissians were allies to Thebes. In 395 BC, the Thebans encouraged the Amfissians to collect <b>taxes</b> from <b>territories</b> claimed by both Locris and Phocis; in response, the Phocians invaded Locris, and ransacked Locrian territory and its metropolis, Amfissa. As a result, the Amfissians and the rest of Locrians, along with the Thebans, attacked Phocis, and the Phocians, in turn, appealed to their ally, Sparta. These conflicts led to the Corinthian War, with the Amfissians on the side of Athens, Argos, Corinth and Thebes.|$|R

The results show that the Basque design supposes a fiscal pressure by IRPF slightly superior to the one of the common territory, next to a greater degree of progressivity and redistribution. The Navarrese system throws a fiscal pressure similar to the Basque, but with the progressivity and redistributive capacity of the common design, results derived from Kakwani and Reynolds-Smolensky indicators...|$|R

50|$|The Caliphate {{was then}} {{still in its}} first decades, very {{unstable}} politically, and had not yet developed a system of administration able to keep their numerous conquests under control. The main manifestation of Arab power over a region was {{at the same time}} a religious command of Islam: the payment of a <b>tax</b> (for <b>territories</b> under direct rule), or a tribute (for vassal states), by non-believers, called the jizya. Payment of it symbolized submission to the Islamic state, but was also, for the Christians of the Caucasus, a way to avoid new invasions, or punitive expeditions by the Arabs against those who did not pay. In Iberia as in Armenia, revolts against the tribute were frequent during the second half of the 7th century, each time the local nobility and presiding princes felt internal weakness in the Caliphate. The most significant of those uprisings, which engulfed the whole Caucasus region, happened in 681-682, and was led in Georgia by presiding prince Adarnase II. Despite a two-year-long struggle, the revolt was quelled, Adarnase was killed, and the Arabs installed in his place Guaram II of the rival Guaramid Dynasty.|$|R
