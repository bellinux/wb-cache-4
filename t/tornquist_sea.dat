40|$|The {{recognition}} of wide-spread remagnetization events during the Palaeozoic has greatly {{added to the}} problems of reconstructing the Palaeozoic drift history of Laurentia and in recent years increasing emphasis has been placed on evaluating the relative reliability of palaeomagnetic data, in an attempt to overcome some of these difficulties. In the light of these developments a revised apparent polar wander (APW) path has been constructed following a rigorous evaluation of all published Palaeozoic palaeomagnetic data from Laurentia and its Palaeozoic margins (i. e.

The use of data from the Laurentian margins, when corrected for the opening of the North Atlantic, has resulted in a revision of previously published Palaeozoic palaeoge-ographic reconstructions and these new palaeogeographic reconstructions for Laurentia are in good agreement with faunal and lithological data.

40|$|In {{light of}} recent {{additions}} to the Palaeozoic palaeo-magnetic data-base, particularly for the Ordovician era, a revised apparent polar wander (APW) path for Baltica has been constructed following a rigorous synthesis of all Late Precambrian-Permian data. The APW path is characterized by two prominent loops. Firstly, a Late Precambrian-Cambrian loop probably relating to a rifting event and secondly, a younger loop relating to a Mid-Silurian (Scandian) collision event. These features imply major change in plate-tectonic reconfiguration. Baltica probably represented an individual continental unit in Early Palaeozoic times and was positioned in high southerly latitudes in an "inverted" geographic orientation. In such a reconstruction Baltica was separated from the northern margin of Gondwana by the <b>Tornquist</b> <b>Sea</b> and from Laurentia by the Iapetus Ocean. The Tornquist Zone is thus interpreted as a passive or dextral transform margin during the early Palaeozoic. While undergoing counter-clockwise rotations (up to 1. 6 [deg]/Ma), Baltica drifted northward {{through most of the}} Palaeozoic; except {{for a short period of}} southerly movement in Late Silurian-Early Devonian times after collision with Laurentia. Rapid movements in latitude (up to 9 cm/yr) are noted in Late Precambrian/early Palaeozoic times and significant decrease in velocities throughout Palaeozoic time probably reflect the progressive amalgamation of a larger continent by Early-Devonian (Euramerica) and Permian (Pangea) times. The <b>Tornquist</b> <b>Sea</b> had a principal component of palaeo-east-west orientation. Hence it is difficult to be precise in the timing of when micro-continents such as Eastern Avalonia and the European Massifs ultimately collided along the southwestern margin of Baltica. These micro-continents are considered to have been peripheral to Gondwana (in high southerly latitudes) during the Early Ordovician. Eastern Avalonia clearly had rifted off Gondwana by Llanvirn-Llandeilo times and may have collided with Baltica during Late Ordovician times, although the present available Silurian palaeomagnetic data from Eastern Avalonia may suggest collision in Late Silurian times. Across the Iapetus facing margin of Baltica, Laurentia was situated in equatorial to southerly latitudes during most of the Lower Palaeozoic. These continents collided in Mid-Silurian times, i. e. a first collision between southwestern Norway and Greenland/Scotland which gave rise to the early Scandian Orogeny (425 Ma) in southwestern Norway possible followed by a later, but less dramatic, Scandian event in northern Norway at around 410 Ma. Since Baltica was geographically inverted in early Palaeozoic times, the collisional margin could not have been a margin that once rifted off Laurentia as assumed in a number of plate-tectonic models...|$|E

As suggested by the strict consensus tree, evolutional trends of the genus include mainly the isolation of the anterior glabellar portion anterior to S 1, the forward shifting of eyes and the related lengthening (exsag.) of the posterior fixigena, the reduction of the number of pygidial axial segments and pleural abaxial rounded free tips, the shortening of the pygidial postaxial region, and the development of cranidial genal spines. Ovalocephalus may have originated in shallow-water sites of the South China Plate in the Early Floian, but migrated into the deep-water regions from the Darriwilian onwards. All the records of the genus from the Early Floian to Early Katian were confined to eastern peri-Gondwanan plates and terranes in low-latitude zones. It was only restricted to the South China, Tarim and North China plates until the Middle Darriwilian, but the Late Darriwilian eustatic sea-level rise and especially the Sandbian–Early Katian immense transgression may have brought about its dispersal to Alborz, Sibumasu and central Asian terranes. Following the closure of the <b>Tornquist</b> <b>Sea,</b> the genus was even able to spread to Baltica during the latest Katian, and the pre-Hirnantian warming (the Boda event) may have promoted a wider distribution of Ovalocephalus to western peri-Gondwana (the Taurides and Armorica terranes) in the then-high latitudes...|$|E

Collectively, the Arenig poles demonstrate a midsoutherly latitudinal position for Baltica, then separated from Avalonia by the Tomquist Sea. <b>Tornquist</b> <b>Sea</b> closure and the Baltica-Avalonia convergence history are evidenced from faunal mixing and increased resemblance in palaeomagnetically determined palaeolatitudes for Avalonia and Baltica during the Mid-Late Ordovician. By the Caradoc, Avalonia had drifted to palaeolatitudes compatible with those of SW Baltica, and subduction beneath Eastern Avalonia was taking place. We propose that explosive vents associated with this subduction and related to Andean-type magmatism in Avalonia were the source for the gigantic Mid-Caradoc (c. 455 Ma) ash fall in Baltica (i. e. the Kinnekulle bentonite). Avalonia was located south of the subtropical high {{during most of the}} Ordovician, and this would have provided an optimum palaeoposition to supply Baltica with large ash falls governed by westerly winds. In Scama, we observe a persistent palaeomagnetic overprint of Late Ordovician (Ashgill) age (pole: latitude- 4 degreesS, longitude= 012 degreesE). The remagnetisation was probably spurred by tectonic-derived fluids since burial alone is inadequate to explain this remagnetisation event. This is the first record of a Late Ordovician event in Scania, but it is comparable with the Shelveian event in Avalonia, low-grade metamorphism in the North Sea basement of NE Germany (440 - 450 Ma), and sheds new light on the Baltica-Avalonia docking.

Although the existing global models represent the first arrivals, they do not represent the full wavefield with all reflected waves because they do not take into account the structural features occurring regionally such as 300 km discontinuity. We perform P wave traveltime analysis using 1 -D forward ray-tracing modelling for the distances up to 3000 km. We analysed 249 natural seismic events that were divided into four azimuthal spans with epicentres in the western Mediterranean Sea region (WMSR), the Greece and Turkey region (GTR), the Caucasus region (CR) and the part of the North Atlantic Ridge near the January Mayen Island (JMR).

40|$|The Trans-European Suture Zone (TESZ) is a {{broad and}} complex zone of terrane {{accretion}} separating ancient lithosphere of the Baltic Shield and East European Craton (EEC) from the younger lithosphere of western and southern Europe. There is debate {{about the number of}} terranes involved, and their origins. The most significant terrane boundaries, originally oceanic sutures, are poorly exposed, and are defined using faunal provinciality. Prominent geophysical lineaments may represent sub-terrane boundaries within composite terranes. The Avalonia Composite Terrane was amalgamated to Baltica in latest ician time. The provenance of the Malopolska and Moravo–Silesian terranes, whose Neoproterozoic basement is suspect with respect to Baltica, but with which they nonetheless share faunal affinities, is still debated. The extent of the Variscide Rhenohercynian Zone defines the southern limit of the early Palaeozoic-accreted terranes. Terranes within the Bohemian Massif exhibit HP metamorphism recording subduction-driven collision prior to incorporation in the TESZ collage, itself associated with a HP event. In Romania, the Saxothuringian Zone (and Rheic Suture) are directly juxtaposed with the EEC, and the crustal structure of the TESZ has been much modified by post-Palaeozoic tectonism. Deep seismic reflection data, where available, show that the oceanic sutures are frequently associated with inclined reflectivity zones (IRZ) in the lithospheric mantle, here inferred to mark relict subduction zones. Interpreting the age of subduction is complicated by offset of originally coplanar mantle and crustal segments of the IRZ, resulting from early orogenic lithospheric delamination at the Moho interface and/or post-orogenic ‘reordering’ processes. The mantle IRZ appear to indicate a N-directed polarity for early Palaeozoic subduction, apparently incompatible with the geological evidence, which indicates subduction of the <b>Tornquist</b> <b>Sea</b> beneath Avalonia, and a large amount of underthrusting of Avalonia by Baltica.

U-Pb dating of zircon demonstrates that the parental magmas crystallized in the earliest Ordovician (499 + 8 - 3 Ma), but 40 Ar- 39 Ar step-heating analysis of amphiboles suggests that at least the northernmost zone of the gneiss was subjected to an amphibolite-grade metamorphic event at c. 374 Ma, probably associated with thrust emplacement of the ophiolite. The gneiss exhibits major, trace and rare earth element variations in conformity with an origin through partial melting of an amphibolitic source containing hornblende and plagioclase, probably with minor garnet and zircon. The elemental abundances and variations are characteristic of granitoids formed in supra-subduction zone environments. A granitoid sill within the adjacent Old Lizard Head Series schists, previously inferred {{to be related to}} the Man of War Gneiss, is trondhjemitic and exhibits higher SiO 2, TiO 2 and MgO, but lower Zr, V, Ba, and Sr contents, and therefore is probably not genetically related to the latter.

The Man of War Gneiss probably represents a structural inlier of pre-Hercynian basement incorporated in the Hercynian nappes of SW England during NNW-directed thrusting. We emphasize the geological and geochronological similarities between variably deformed granitoid units of the Lizard complex, the Sudeten Massif of southern Poland, and the allochthonous complexes of northern Portugal and NW Spain.

For all chosen regions, except the JMR group for which 2 -D modelling was performed, we estimate a 1 -D average velocity model which will characterize the main seismic discontinuities.

40|$|Subsidence {{analysis}} was performed on 43 boreholes penetrating the Upper Vendian-Lower Palaeozoic sedimentary succession of the Baltic Basin. The results were related to lithofacial and structural data to elucidate subsidence mechanisms and the regional tectonic setting of basin development. Tectonic subsidence patterns are consistent throughout the basin for the time period studied. An extensional tectonic subsidence event, possibly of two phases, is indicated from the Late Vendian {{to the beginning of}} the Middle Cambrian. This event is seen in the southwestern part of the Baltic Basin (Peri-Tornquist zone) until the earliest Cambrian after which it is also observed in the SW-NE-trending Baltic Depression part of the basin. Basin development during this time is interpreted as recording the latest stages of break-up of the Precambrian super-continent Rodinia and ultimately the formation of the <b>Tornquist</b> <b>Sea.</b> The late Middle Cambrian to Middle Ordovician tectonic subsidence pattern of the Baltic Basin is characteristic of post-rift thermal subsidence of the newly formed passive continental margin of Baltica, developed along its southwestern edge. A gradual increase in subsidence rate is observed from the (Middle?) Late Ordovician and throughout the Silurian (particularly for Ludlow and Pridoli times) creating subsidence curves with convex shapes typical of foreland basin development. The rate of Late Silurian tectonic subsidence increases significantly towards the southwest margin of the Baltic basin, adjacent to the present location of the North German-Polish Caledonides. The Baltic Basin therefore appears to have developed primarily as a flexural foreland basin during Silurian oblique collision of Baltica and Eastern Avalonia. A foreland setting is supported by the influx of distal turbidites into the basin from southwest sources in the Late Silurian. Compressional deformation structures of Early Devonian (Lochkovian) age are seen in seismic sections in the central part of the Baltic Basin (Lithuania). These, together with a change in subsidence pattern, mark the end of the Caledonian stage of basin development of the Baltic Basin. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The Appalachian Orogen in Atlantic Canada, and its {{extension}} {{into the}} Variscan Orogen of Europe, are crucial locations {{for the development}} of some of the earliest ideas associated with plate tectonic theory. The recognition of a boundary that separated rocks of Gondwanan faunal affinity from those of Laurentian faunal affinity in the northern Appalachians was fundamental in defining a Wilson cycle; the process of opening and closing an oceanic basin that pre-dated the Atlantic Ocean. Tectonic models for the Appalachian Orogen have become increasingly complex as more geological data have become available resulting in the subdivision of distinct exotic terranes (Avalonia, Ganderia and Meguma) and putative multiple subduction/accretion events. These terranes, collectively referred to as “peri-Gondwanan”, are generally interpreted to have been rifted from the northern Gondwanan margin in the early Paleozoic and sequentially accreted to the Laurentian margin via the closure various oceans, thereby suggesting successive Wilson cycles during the mid-late Paleozoic. A viable method for testing the model of multiple Wilson cycles is to investigate the hafnium isotopic arrays from zircon grains, which are capable of recording the evolution of complex accretionary orogenic systems. This thesis presents a comprehensive hafnium data set from igneous and sedimentary rocks in the Appalachian and Variscan orogens to assess the isotopic signature of sequential Wilson cycle tectonics. Hafnium isotopic (εHf) arrays allow the provenance of exotic terranes in the Appalachian- Variscan orogenic system to be established. Ganderia and Avalonia, and probably Meguma, were built on a Mesoproterozoic basement that must have formed along the former Grenvillian suture-zone. In Variscan Europe, εHf arrays show that Iberia was derived from the Saharan metacraton and Armorica from the West African Craton. The Upper Allochthon of Iberia is often linked to the West African Craton, but it is more similar to the εHf array of Avalonia. Hafnium isotopes of magmatic and detrital zircons from Ganderia indicate the terrane hosted a long-lived magmatic arc that began between 800 - 750 Ma and continued until 450 Ma. The arc initially formed on juvenile Grenvillian crust, but a transition toward more evolved Hf isotopic compositions between 650 - 600 Ma coincides with accretion of Ganderia to the Gondwanan margin. Increasing amounts of juvenile crustal inputs between ~ 550 - 500 Ma are interpreted to reflect subduction roll-back and eventual rifting of Ganderia from the margin, associated with opening of the Rheic Ocean. Juvenile zircons from the leading-edge arc system of Ganderia, the Penobscot-Popelogan-Victoria arcs, indicate that they were exclusively oceanic by ~ 500 Ma. By contrast, evolved Hf values confirm that the coeval Notre Dame arc developed on the Laurentian margin between ~ 515 - 430 Ma. The preservation of very evolved (εHf =- 15 to - 25) Notre Dame arc zircons in Ganderian overstep sequences confi rm the arrival of the leading edge of Ganderia to Laurentia by ~ 450 Ma. The Dover Fault separates Ganderia from Avalonia. Monazite geochronology and mineral phase equilibria modelling of amphibolite facies rocks from within the fault system help constrain the younger tectonic evolution of Ganderia. The metamorphic rocks record two major stages of Ganderia evolution: (1) a low pressure (P), high temperature (T) (3 - 4 kbar, 600 °C) event recorded by 460 ± 7 Ma monazites, associated with formation of the adjacent Tetagouche-Exploits back-arc basin, and (2) a higher P, lower T event (5 - 6 kbar, ~ 600 - 650 °C) characterised by migmatisation and formation of garnet-sillimanite bearing metamorphic assemblages at 409 ± 6 Ma, interpreted to refl ect a short interval of compression associated with the widespread Acadian orogeny. The Hf isotopic arrays show that Avalonia records a history of arc magmatism dating back to 800 - 750 Ma, when it formed on Grenvillian-aged crust. A shift to more juvenile (+εHf) values by 700 Ma indicates it had evolved to an oceanic terrane at that stage, but like Ganderia, it also records the transition toward more evolved Hf isotopic compositions between 650 - 600 Ma, coinciding with accretion onto the Gondwanan margin. Thereafter, it also records the shift back toward juvenile values as the terrane rifted from Gondwana to open the Rheic Ocean. The isotopic array of Meguma overlaps with those of Ganderia and Avalonia, indicating that it travelled the same journey. Accordingly, the three terranes are combined and referred to as “composite Avalonia”. The characteristic Hf array of composite Avalonia, and comparison with Hf data compilations from cratonic Amazonia, Baltica and Laurentia, allow Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic paleogeographic models to be reassessed. Avalonian continental arc magmatism began at ~ 800 Ma near the former Grenville suture-zone, most likely along the Laurentian margin. It is proposed that arc magmatism is the southern extension of the Valhalla arc in east Greenland. Propagation of an ocean spreading ridge behind the developing Valhalla Orogen opened the Asgard Sea, separating Baltica and Amazonia from Laurentia, possibly as early as 900 Ma. Subduction was initiated along the Laurentian margin between ~ 800 - 750 Ma, and the uniform shift toward juvenile ε(Hf) values between 750 - 650 Ma suggests the arc retreated from Laurentia to form the microcontinental ribbon of composite Avalonia by 700 Ma, opening proto-Iapetus as a back-arc basin between the ribbon and Laurentia. Migration of the composite Avalonian ribbon and its accretion to Gondwana by 650 Ma closed the Asgard Sea, as shown by the reversal of εHf data to progressively negative values between 650 - 600 Ma. Reversal of the isotopic trend to +εHf values between 600 - 450 Ma for composite Avalonia, along with the Iberian and Amorican terranes of Europe, shows that all developed as a retreating oceanic arc off the north Gondwanan margin. As the ribbon separated the Rheic Ocean formed, with Meguma as the trailing passive margin. Composite Avalonia migrated northward, initially closing the <b>Tornquist</b> <b>Sea</b> as it collided with Baltica, then closing Iapetus at ~ 450 Ma during protracted collision with Laurentia. Following the fi nal accretion of composite Avalonia by ~ 440 Ma, subduction stepped outboard into the trailing Rheic Ocean, placing composite Avalonia in an upper plate, suprasubduction zone setting. The εHf array for the northern Appalachian Orogen shows a progressive homogenisation toward CHUR. This “arrow-head” εHf array is interpreted to indicate crustal reworking during tectonic switching, between retreating (e. g. Salinic and Neoacadian orogenies) and advancing (e. g. Acadian orogeny) subduction episodes, which exclusively reworked the juvenile (Late Neoproterozoic) and Grenvillian-type basement. The Variscan European hafnium array is remarkably similar to the Appalachian array between ~ 600 - 450 Ma in that both transition towards increasingly radiogenic values, indicating all the terranes along the northern Gondwanan margin developed into retreating magmatic arcs during subduction rollback. After ~ 450 Ma, the European arrays also record continual recycling of the former Neoproterozoic arc basement along a typical crustal evolutionary path, with limited input from the depleted mantle and no recycling of ancient Gondwanan crust. Intermittent backarc opening and closing events, including the Variscan orogeny at ~ 360 Ma, occurred throughout the Paleozoic and early Mesozoic of Europe. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic εHf array of Variscan Europe simply refl ects ongoing subduction-related magmatic activity in Europe associated with opening and closing of basins in the Tethyan oceanic realm, following Pangean amalgamation. A strong negative εHf excursion at 30 Ma indicates subduction and melting of Gondwanan cratonic lithosphere {{for the first time since}} 600 Ma, suggesting the arrival of former Gondwana into the subduction zone. Hf isotopic arrays indicates that the completion of the type-Wilson cycle in the northern Appalachians is marked only by termination of magmatism as the εHf array converged on CHUR at ~ 300 Ma. Similarly in Europe the collision of Gondwana with Laurentia to form Pangea is not reflected in the εHf array and also reflects only the reworking of composite Avalonia. Therefore, the assembly of Pangea could form only part of a larger, longer-term supercontinental cycle. Accordingly, Hf isotopic arrays provide an opportunity to reassess Precambrian supercontinent reconstructions at a cratonic scale, but are less likely to recognise individual Wilson cycles unless they involve reworking of cratonic crust at the beginning and end of each cycle.
