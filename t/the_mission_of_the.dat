5|$|After World War II, the 20 {{years of}} {{foundational}} {{work by the}} bomber mafia resulted in {{the separation of the}} United States Air Force from the Army to become an independent military arm. The bomber mafia's strategic doctrine, changed by war and experience, helped shape <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Air Force and its Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee}} that the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of chronometers, especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E
5|$|For the Americans, Laos {{became almost}} {{exclusively}} an air war, one which saw {{a reversal of}} the role it played in the conflict in neighboring South Vietnam. In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944 the Currans {{were part}} of a group of British {{scientists}} invited to go to the US to take part in the Manhattan Project – the Allied project to develop an atomic bomb. They joined the British Mission at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in California, headed by Mark Oliphant, a distinguished Australian scientist that Joan knew from the Cavendish Laboratory. Oliphant also acted as de facto deputy to Ernest Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laboratory was to develop the electromagnetic isotope separation process to create enriched uranium for use in atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|Operation Deny Flight was a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) {{operation}} that began on 12 April 1993 as {{the enforcement of}} a United Nations (UN) no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United Nations and NATO later expanded <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation to include providing close air support for UN troops in Bosnia and carrying out coercive air strikes against targets in Bosnia. Twelve NATO members contributed forces to the operation and, by its end on 20 December 1995, NATO pilots had flown 100,420 sorties.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guardian Angel {{was somewhere}} in the {{vicinity}} of Chicago from 1696 until it was abandoned in around 1700. The Fox Wars effectively closed the Chicago area to Europeans {{in the first part of}} the 18th century. The first non-native to re-settle in the area may have been a trader named Guillory, who might have had a trading-post near Wolf Point on the Chicago River in around 1778. After Point du Sable, Antoine Ouilmette is the next recorded resident of Chicago; he claimed to have settled at the mouth of the Chicago River in July 1790, a few months after Hugh Heward visited Point du Sable.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{complexion}} of the American {{effort was}} altered on 8 March 1965, when 3,500 U.S. Marines came ashore at Da Nang, ostensibly {{to defend the}} southern airfields committed to prosecuting Rolling Thunder. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground forces was expanded to combat operations and, from that point onward, the aerial campaign became a secondary operation, overwhelmed by troop deployments and the escalation of ground operations in South Vietnam. Until {{the third week of}} April, Rolling Thunder had enjoyed at least equal status with air missions conducted in the south. After that time, strikes that interfered with requirements for the southern battlefield were either cut back or cancelled.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swiss Air Force {{historically}} {{has been to}} support ground troops (erdkampf) in repelling invasions of neutral Swiss territory, with a secondary mission of defending the sovereignty of Swiss airspace. During World War II this doctrine was severely tested when Switzerland was literally {{caught in the middle}} of an air war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants. Its inability to prevent such violations of its neutrality led for a period to a complete cessation of air intercepts, followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment.|$|E

5|$|While {{playing with}} the Flyers, Vanbiesbrouck and his family lived in Moorestown Township, New Jersey. He and his wife, Rosalinde, have four sons, Ian, Ben, Nicholas and Daniel. Ian was {{diagnosed}} with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) when he was five-years old. As a result, Vanbiesbrouck started the Vanbiesbrouck Foundation for children with Attention Deficit Disorder to increase awareness of and raise money for children with ADD. However, when he left Florida via free agency the foundation was dissolved and <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program went into an information service based in South Florida. Vanbiesbrouck is also the celebrity sponsor of a golf event in support of The Alan T. Brown Foundation to Cure Paralysis. He returned to {{his home state of}} Michigan following his playing days.|$|E
5|$|Krueger did not {{immediately}} give Martin permission for such an operation. There was still the possibility of Japanese attack, and the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation. On 20 January, a visiting staff officer from Alamo Force was asked to raise the possibility with Krueger. However, on 21 January Martin received a letter stating that <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Michaelmas Task Force remained unchanged and a radiogram was received on 22 January {{to the effect that}} this was not consistent with Krueger's wishes. On 8 February, Martin received a garbled radiogram from Krueger that indicated that the earlier restrictive message of 22 January had itself been garbled, and on 9 February a radiogram was received authorising offensive action. Plans were immediately made but on 10 February contact was made with elements of the Australian 5th Division, which had relieved the 9th Division on 20 January. This closed the gap on the east flank.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 2012, Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh {{announced}} the 7th Infantry Division headquarters would be reactivated at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in October 2012. The headquarters element of about 250 would not activate any subordinate brigades. Instead, it filled an administrative {{role as a}} non-deployable unit. In the announcement, McHugh noted the base is home to I Corps, which until then had directly overseen 10 subordinate brigades on the base, while other bases with similar corps headquarters had active division commands for intermediate oversight. The unit oversees the 2nd and 3rd Brigade Combat Teams of the 2nd Infantry Division, {{as well as the}} 17th Field Artillery Brigade, 201st Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade, and 555th Engineer Brigade, about 21,000 personnel. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headquarters primarily focuses on making sure soldiers are properly trained and equipped, and that order and discipline is maintained in its subordinate brigades.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ARVN {{central column}} was to advance {{down the valley}} of the Se Pone River, a {{relatively}} flat area of brush interspersed with patches of jungle and dominated by heights to its north and the river and more mountains to the south. Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey work}} {{leading to the}} {{discovery}} of Styx was in preparation for <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unmanned New Horizons spaceprobe, which flew by the Pluto system on 14 July 2015. The discovery of another small Plutonian moon heightened concerns that this region of space may harbor more bodies too small to be detected, and that the probe could be damaged by an uncharted body or ring as it traversed the system at a speed of over 13km/s; tiny moons, such as Saturn's moon Pallene, tend to be associated with tenuous rings or arcs, because their gravity is unable to hold on to material ejected by meteoroid impacts; such diffuse material represents the chief navigational hazard. However, the New Horizons probe did not detect any smaller moons or rings, and passed through the Pluto system safely.|$|E
