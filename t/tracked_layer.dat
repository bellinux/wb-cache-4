40|$|The dinosaur {{tracks of}} the Glen Rose Formation in the Paluxy River at Dinosaur Valley State Park {{are among the}} best {{preserved}} and most abundant in the world. Although many tracksites are easily correlated to the Main Tracksite, others, especially those at the extreme ends of the park, are differently preserved and not obviously correlated. To count track horizons, several stratigraphic sections were measured along the river from upstream at the McFall Ledge Site to 7. 6 km downstream at the County Road 1001 crossing (3. 1 km linear distance). High-resolution correlation of these sections reveals that 6 meters of strata separate two track-bearing intervals exposed in the river. Seven distinctive beds can be correlated: 1) the lowest, the main <b>track</b> <b>layer,</b> a dolomitic mud with Arenicolites burrows and finely preserved footprints, 2) a hardground bed with oyster-encrusted bored cobbles, 3) the “steinkern marl,” a fining upward shaly-concretionary unit containing a diverse fauna including clams and serpulid mounds in life position, 4) the “Corbula bed,” a few cm of grainstone consisting almost exclusively of mm-size, diagenetically-altered articulated clam steinkerns, 5) the serpulid bed, a fine-grained packstone riddled with Thalassinoides burrow networks and occupied by sparsely-scattered metersized serpulid mounds, 6) the Taylor <b>track</b> <b>layer,</b> containing variably-preserved footprints and mudcracks and 7) the highest, the Diplocraterion bed, a wackestone ledge characterized by the U-shaped burrow Diplocraterion. High-resolution geologic maps showing the outcrop distribution of these stratigraphic units in the Paluxy Riverbed reveal patterns of local structural relief that expose the main <b>track</b> <b>layer</b> in the northern Park Central park area, and expose the higher Taylor <b>track</b> <b>layer</b> at the eastern and western/southern part of the park. These maps also serve as a guide to resource management in the Park, showing where erosion is destroying <b>track</b> <b>layers</b> and where the same erosion is uncovering new tracksites...|$|R

40|$|Although dinosaur trackways {{are common}} in the Cretaceous Glen Rose Formation of Texas, the {{recently}} discovered Joanna track site illustrates a unique ichnological relationship where dinosaur tracks were disrupted by invertebrate burrows made long after burial. In an effort to document the precise sequence of events, we described the interval from 0. 3 m below the <b>track</b> <b>layer</b> through 2. 7 m above it in a vertical outcrop adjacent to the track site, focusing on the 70 -cm of strata immediately above the track horizon. An 8 -meter N-S cross-section of this 70 -cm interval was power-washed, examined for trace fossils, body fossils, and lithology in the field, and the interval sampled as a hand-cut 2 -piece 20 cm square core. To prevent disintegration, the rock was coated in epoxy as it was removed. The lower piece was dry cut into a few 3 - 4 cm thick vertical slabs; the upper part will be prepared similarly. These are to be dry sanded and polished to reveal microstratigraphic details. A continuous series of thin sections will also be made through {{the thickness of the}} sample. The <b>track</b> <b>layer</b> contains burrows of at least two ichnogenera, Arenicolites and Thalassinoides. The former is restricted to the <b>track</b> <b>layer,</b> whereas Thalassinoides originates in two generations, one before formation of the Arenicolites and another from the top of a highly bioturbated 30 cm bed of ostracod and foraminifera-rich mud overlying the <b>track</b> surface. This <b>layer</b> contains unidentified crustaceans, a turtle shell fragment, shark teeth, and small vertebrae. Capping this is a thin bed of pyritic mud; 20 cm of burrowed mud with bivalves in life position and Planolites; Thalassinoides (near top, filled with grainier sediment); and Teichichnus (spreiten showing retrusive movement). A 20 cm grainstone bed tops the interval. Beneath the <b>tracks,</b> the <b>track</b> <b>layer</b> wackestone grades into 20 cm of ostracod packstone with mud-filled burrows. An upward increase in mud and deeper water fauna suggests a transgressive succession, and the burrowed mud bed overlaying the tracks suggests episodic burial events. Relationships between tracks and traces suggest that Thalassinoides and Arenicolites tracemakers colonized the <b>track</b> <b>layer</b> prior to the creation of tracks, then the second generation of Thalassinoides formed after burial of the dinosaur tracks by at least 30 cm of mud...|$|R
40|$|Dinosaur trackways {{are common}} in the Cretaceous Glen Rose Formation of central Texas. While the trackways in Dinosaur Valley State Park are well known, many other sites {{can be found in}} this region. Recently, a new track site was {{discovered}} during construction in Glen Rose, Texas. The Joanna Track Site features tridactyl tracks which have been partly obliterated by invertebrates burrowing through the thick mud which buried them. We measured and described the interval from 0. 3 m below the <b>track</b> <b>layer</b> through 2. 7 m above it in a vertical outcrop directly adjacent to the track site. Samples were collected in 10 cm intervals through this section. A larger sample, roughly 30 cm tall and 20 cm wide and deep, comprising 15 cm below and above the upper surface of the <b>track</b> <b>layer</b> was also collected. To prevent disintegration, the fragile rock, it was coated in epoxy as it was removed. This sample was dry cut with a diamond saw into a few vertical slabs, 3 - 4 cm thick. These are to be dry sanded and polished to reveal microstratigraphic details. A continuous series of thin sections will also be made through the thickness of the sample. The <b>track</b> <b>layer</b> marl is riddled with Thalassinoides which nearly erased evidence of dinosaur tracks. The Thalassinoides originates from the top of a highly bioturbated 30 cm bed of ostracod and foraminifera-rich mud immediately overlying the <b>track</b> surface. This <b>layer</b> contains fragments of an unidentified crustacean—possibly the burrow makers along with turtle shell, shark teeth, and small vertebrae. Capping this is a thin bed of pyritic mud, 20 cm of burrowed mud with bivalves in life position, then 20 cm of grainstone with mud-filled burrows. Beneath the tracks, there are 10 cm of fissile mud with bits of marl, then a 20 cm ostracod packstone with mud-filled burrows. An upward increase in deeper water fauna supports the conclusion that the succession was deposited during a period of increasing water depth. The mud bed overlaying the <b>track</b> <b>layer</b> suggests rapid burial, but burrowing has damaged the quality of preservation. Since Thalassinoides extends from the mud into the <b>track</b> <b>layer,</b> it can be inferred that the burrows occurred after burial by 30 cm (compacted thickness) of mud. While deep burial preserved the tracks, deeper burrowing nearly destroyed them...|$|R

40|$|The {{controller}} of {{a large-scale}} distributed system (e. g., the internet, the power-grid and automated highway systems) is often faced with two complementary tasks: (i) that of finding an optimal trajectory {{with respect to}} a functional or economic utility, and (ii) that of efficiently making the state of the system follow this trajectory despite model uncertainty, process and sensor noise and distributed information sharing constraints. While each of these tasks has been addressed individually, there exists as of yet no controller synthesis framework that treats these two problems in a holistic manner. This paper proposes a unifying optimization based methodology that jointly addresses these two tasks by leveraging the strengths of well established frameworks for distributed control: the Layering as Optimization (LAO) framework and the distributed optimal control framework. We show that our proposed control scheme has a natural layered architecture composed of a low-level <b>tracking</b> <b>layer</b> and top-level planning <b>layer.</b> The <b>tracking</b> <b>layer</b> consists of a distributed optimal controller that takes as an input a reference trajectory generated by the top-level layer, where this top-level layer consists of a trajectory planning problem that optimizes a weighted sum of a utility function and a "racking penalty" regularizer. We further provide an exact solution to the <b>tracking</b> <b>layer</b> problem under a broad range of information sharing constraints, discuss extensions to the proposed problem formulation, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a numerical example...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The conference {{proceedings}} are available from: [URL] {{of the major}} roles of railway <b>trackbed</b> <b>layers</b> is to reduce vehicle induced stresses applied to the underlying subgrade to a level that limits the progressive build up of permanent deformation. The ability of <b>trackbed</b> <b>layers</b> to satisfy this requirement is dependent upon the materials used for construction and their thickness. Numerous design methods, (both empirical and analytical), have been developed across the World to evaluate trackbed design thickness. However, where there is limited information or experience of previous trackbed design with the specific materials or site conditions under consideration, the choice of methodology becomes one of engineering judgment, in assessing the significance and reliability of the design input parame-ters. This paper describes a number of design methods which were assessed in a recent project to design a new heavy haul freight railway trackbed, founded on moisture sensitive subgrades, using locally available materials for the <b>track</b> support <b>layers.</b> The produced design thicknesses {{for each of the}} methods are compared for differing subgrade conditions. The results show considerable variation of thicknesses from each method with little consistent pattern to the variation. Reasons for these variations are suggested and the choice of the final design used for specific subgrade conditions are presented together with appropriate justification. Concluding on these issues, recommendations are made for a more considered approach to trackbed design...|$|R

Decays of this sort arise naturally within the Gauge Mediated model of Supsersymetry breaking (GMSB) [1]; the relatively weak coupling between the SU(3) xSU(2) xU(1) and gravity sectors that produces the macroscopic decay lengths of interest lies within the cosmologically-allowed region.

40|$|The first 75 km {{section of}} Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) project, {{a new high}} speed railway between London and the Channel Tunnel, is {{currently}} under construction in Kent. The earthworks and <b>trackbed</b> <b>layers</b> for the CTRL have been designed {{in accordance with the}} International Union of Railways (UIC) Code 719 R together with French TGV best practice. The UIC code recommendations for high speed lines are largely based on extrapolating to higher speeds an empirical and prescriptive approach developed from experience on main lines (i. e. up to 200 km/h). To give more assurance to the extrapolated use of UIC Code 719 R for high speed lines, analytical and experimental work was carried out including a knowledge of the resilient modulus of the subgrade and for less common soils such as chalk, laboratory determination of the resilient modulus. This paper describes the laboratory cyclic triaxial testing carried out to determine the resilient modulus of chalk recovered from the CTRL route.
