5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor themes in the B strain, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>section</b> is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. Here, for the first time, the piece departs from the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division. Its first 12 measures parallel the 12-bar blues form and the next two measures extend the subdominant as a transition into the last ten bars.|$|E
5|$|The LNWR began {{construction}} {{work on the}} surface section of the new tracks in 1909. By 1911, it had modified the plans to omit the underground section and to split its proposed electrified services into three. The first section was to follow the existing surface route into Euston on newly electrified tracks, the second section was {{to connect with the}} North London Railway at Chalk Farm and continue on electrified tracks from there to Broad Street station in the City of London. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>section</b> involved the extension of the Bakerloo Tube from Paddington to Queen's Park.|$|E
5|$|The chelicerae ("claw horns") {{that give}} the sub-phylum its name {{normally}} consist of three sections, and the claw is formed by <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>section</b> and a rigid extension of the second. However, spiders' have only two sections, and the second forms a fang that folds away behind the first when not in use. The relative sizes of chelicerae vary widely: those of some fossil eurypterids and modern harvestmen form large claws that extended ahead of the body, while scorpions' are tiny pincers {{that are used in}} feeding and project only slightly in front of the head.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>section</b> {{discusses}} {{the rulers of}} secular society and their flaws. The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} the Good Friday mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section as he looks back on his period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>section</b> to open {{was from}} Bloor Street to the Gardiner Expressway.

5|$|When {{the boats}} first {{started for the}} port, the Tripolitanians began firing upon them with their shore batteries. The {{shelling}} lasted until 11:00 PM and delayed the assault until 1:00 AM when the Nerid began escorting the boats in closer to shore. Though at first the second Sardinian attack was unnoticed by the Tripolitanians, a sentry sighted the approaching force at 2:30 AM. Despite resistance from the Tripolitanian fleet and forces ashore, Mamelli pushed his force onward through grapeshot and musket fire. He soon reached the Tripolitanian brig and had his force board her, killing its officers and captain {{as well as a}} large portion of its crew. A second section of boats assaulted the schooners, taking them by boarding. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>section</b> of Sardinian boats managed to force their way ashore despite heavy opposition, capturing the dockyard and routing its Tripolitanian defenders.
