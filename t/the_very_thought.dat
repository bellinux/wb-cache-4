It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thought—which, for me, is <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> of this film —is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought. It is that which frays images so that images become this thought, so that they become the evidence of this thought—and not in order to [...] "represent" [...] it.|$|E
500|$|The band were {{adamant about}} not {{replacing}} Duane's {{position in the}} band. Les Dudek, the guitarist who would eventually record [...] "Jessica" [...] and [...] "Ramblin' Man," [...] had entered the sessions {{when he was asked}} to jam with Betts through mutual friends. The band enjoyed how Dudek played and Phil Walden, the band's manager, seemed set on Dudek being in the band. Word of mouth, propagated by Dudek himself, was that he [...] "got the gig" [...] and had become the Allman Brothers' new co-lead guitarist. [...] "We went looking for this dude to kick his ass. Nobody was going to replace Duane and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> of it was infuriating to us," [...] said Trucks. After recording completed, Dudek went on the road with Boz Scaggs and the Steve Miller Band. He wanted to end his contract with Phil Walden at Capricorn, and part of his release granted him no part of the publishing deal for Brothers and Sisters, including a songwriting credit for [...] "Jessica", as he had no written contract.|$|E

[...] The car is also the source of many clashes with Longtarin, as Gaston endlessly devises schemes to avoid paying parking meters, even going as far as parking it up in a tree or faking roadworks.|$|E

2500|$|William Fisher {{was killed}} in a riding {{accident}} when John was 15. John's relationship with his mother Sophie suffered from their separation, and he never saw her again. However, he continued to send her an allowance until her death. In 1870, she suggested visiting Fisher in England, but he dissuaded her as strongly as he could. Fisher wrote to his wife: [...] "I hate <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> of it and really, I don't want to see her. I don't see why I should as I haven't the slightest recollection of her." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{respect to}} the Orthodox Ukrainian {{population}} in eastern Poland, the Polish government initially issued a decree defending {{the rights of the}} Orthodox minorities. In practice, this often failed, as the Catholics, also eager to strengthen their position, had stronger representation in the Sejm and the courts. Any accusation was strong enough for a particular church to be confiscated and handed over to the Catholic Church. During the Polish rule, 190 Orthodox churches were destroyed (although some of them have already been abandoned) and 150 were forcibly transformed into Catholic (not Ukrainian Catholic) churches. Such actions were condemned by the head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who claimed that these acts would [...] "destroy in the souls of our non-united Orthodox brothers <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> of any possibility of reunion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dev.D has 18 tracks by artiste Amit Trivedi. The {{songs were}} written by Amitabh Bhattacharya, Shellee, Anusha Mani, and Shruti Pathak. Released on 31 December under T-Series, he {{specifically}} reports {{that there are two}} special Punjabi tracks, one which is raw Punjabi and the other with a street band baaja flavor to it. He also reports two romantic Haryanvi folk tracks, apart from a hard rock song, world music, an Awadhi number and a song with 1970s-80s pop touch to it. The soundtrack received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critic Joginder Tuteja said, [...] "Chuck <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> around whether this album will do well commercially or not; it is an exemplary piece of work and that's what that matters most." [...] Ekansh Aatre, critic of Hindustan Times fame, said [...] "Each part of each song in this album is special & gives a great impact on audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, Paul {{was one of}} {{only seven}} Republicans to vote against a bill which, if passed, would have made {{performing}} or pressuring a woman into having a sex-selective abortion, or transporting a woman into the country or across state lines for the purpose of undergoing such an abortion, a federal crime, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. The bill would also have subjected nurses and other healthcare workers to fines and possible imprisonment for failing to report suspected violations of the law. Paul explained that although he found <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> of sex-selective abortions revolting, he could not support the measure because it would be unconstitutional and would create [...] "yet another set of federal criminal laws, even though the Constitution lists only three federal crimes: piracy, treason, and counterfeiting." [...] He urged advocates of abortion bans to seek instead to repeal Roe v. Wade and allow abortion regulation to be handled at the state level.|$|E

He being dead, they cannot assume new forms of beauty in any future poems, and cannot be thus diffused from mind to mind, but they remain mourning round their deceased herdsman, or master. It is possible that this image of a flock and a herdsman is consequent upon the phrase in the Elegy of Moschus for Bion--'Bion the herdsman is dead' (p. 65).|$|R

60|$|I caused Friday {{to gather}} all the skulls, bones, flesh, and {{whatever}} remained, and lay {{them together in}} a heap, and make a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes.

60|$|Second. Spiritual {{understanding}} espieth in {{the heart}} of God a readiness and willingness to give those things to the soul that it stands in need of. David by this could guess at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thoughts</b> of God towards him (Psa 40:5). And thus it was with the woman of Canaan; she did by faith and a right understanding discern, beyond all the rough carriage of Christ, tenderness and willingness in his heart to save, which caused her to be vehement and earnest, yea, restless, until she did enjoy the mercy she stood in need of (Matt 15:22-28).|$|R

O, it dares not sin! it sees Hell-fire is {{prepared}} for them that sin, God's justice will not spare it if it live in sin; the Law will damn it if it live in sin; the devil will have it if it follows its sins. [Here I am speaking of one that is effectually brought in]. O, I say, it trembles at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thoughts</b> of sin! Ay, if sin do but offer to tempt the soul, to draw away the soul from God, it cries, it sighs, it shunneth <b>the</b> <b>very</b> appearance of sin, it is odious unto it. If God would but serve you thus that love your pleasures, you would not make such a trifle of sin as you do.|$|R
