[...] The entrance to the ashram is marked by wide open entrance without a gate(openness to all) which leads to Viswagopuram and an outer mandapa without walls meant for yoga, upadesa and dialogue meetings. [...] On {{both sides of this}} mandapa, there are two footpaths in a curved fashion <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the inner area directly. [...] If you walk directly through the mandapa, you pass through Swagata Nilaya - welcome abode and [...] reach another structure(Atma Purna Nivas) used for meditations and prayer meetings. [...] Then comes the residences for inamates like Dasavatara cottages, Star shaped Buildings, pyramidal buildings, Om Building, Yin Yang and the 24 hermitages. There are trees Peepal tree( [...] morning samdhya) Fig tree (Noon samdhya) and Banyan trees (for upadesas). Then comes the sanctum. [...] The last building is the sanctum sanctorum containing the Satcitananda Mandir within which the samadhi of the Founder is found.. [...] The small cottages for the inmates are built on either sides of the sanctum sanctorum. [...] There is a footpath that takes you directly to the other gate from the sanctum sanctorum. Beyond it is found Ashtabhagya gopuram inviting everyone either to sing kirtana (praises) or be in mauna(silence). Still beyond is the Navagrahavana forest of nine planets.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> my own quarters," [...] she explained. [...] "They {{are rather}} cut off but I like them--especially on hot nights." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, my dear, I think it's {{about time}} I was <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> back <b>to</b> your hotel.|$|R
6000|$|... 1 2 3 1 Changed single closing {{quotation}} mark to double closing {{quotation mark}} Vol. II--Page 105, line 18 [...] "My <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> across <b>to</b> the States."* ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{spoke of}} <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> back <b>to</b> London immediately, but I {{persuaded him to}} wait till they go into Wiltshire, so you need not be rooted up from Fern Torr just yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{much more}} likely, Mark. If the {{pleasure}} of meeting Mrs. Proudie is <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Chaldicotes, I have not a word more to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, I’m in no hurry,” said Osborne, glancing {{toward his}} automobile, which {{stood outside the}} station. “I suppose it’s the labor trouble that’s <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Vancouver?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} would like the view," [...] she said; [...] "but perhaps you have been here, perhaps I am <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{one of your own}} possessions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like <b>to</b> hear <b>you</b> say that, Bax," [...] {{returned}} the other; [...] "it will rejoice {{my heart to}} think that love for me will be the means of <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> often <b>to</b> the throne of God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I, my lad. You {{will want}} a better introducer. I {{expect that the}} lawyer who was here will give <b>you</b> a letter <b>to</b> his son-in-law, who will, of course, place himself at your service, {{establishing}} you in your house and <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> round <b>to</b> your tenants." ...|$|R
60|$|There's a {{new life}} beyond, Nora, whistled the wind. A good life--and it's yours for the <b>taking.</b> <b>You</b> have but <b>to</b> put out your hand and all you've wished for will be in your grasp.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will in a minute, but I want to {{tell you}} something, for it's not nice to have folks <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be a thief," [...] went on Haskett, tactfully.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, my boy,' {{said the}} captain, after twice reading it; 'I don't mind <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Cadiz; I daresay you'll {{be able to}} make {{yourself}} useful on board. What can you do?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> a {{safe place}} where {{no one will ever}} find you. I must climb a little here and call the dogs. Don't be afraid. I'll soon come for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be frightened, love," [...] he said, {{kissing her}} very gently and tenderly on the forehead. [...] "You are as safe here as anywhere. Was I not right {{in saying that}} it would be madness <b>to</b> attempt <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> back <b>to</b> the {{farmhouse}} this evening? You can sleep in that room, Perrine, when you are tired--you can sleep with the two girls." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "-Where are <b>you</b> <b>taking</b> us?- <b>To</b> the {{extermination}} camp.- Finally {{some good}} news. When will we get there?- It's hard to tell. It's wartime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A plague on your whimpering," [...] said Dalgarno, {{somewhat}} harshly,--"Nay, {{never look}} pale for the matter, Nell. I am not angry with you, you simple fool. But {{what would you}} have me think, when you are eternally looking back upon your dungeon yonder by the river, which smelt of pitch and old cheese worse than a Welshman does of onions, and all this when I am <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> down <b>to</b> a castle as fine as is in Fairy Land!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} your father pays for coal. Have you {{reckoned}} what it costs to keep a locomotive {{two or three hours}} for the purpose of <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Santa Brigida and back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put you down--what do you mean?" [...] cried his leader. [...] "I am <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{the front}} of the revolutionary war, where you {{will be one of the}} first of the revolutionary leaders." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the servant}} would say nothing. At last, moved by Bobino's entreaties, he said: 'My poor boy, I am <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> your death, and, what is worse, I am doing {{so by the}} order of your father.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] I said slowly, [...] "it {{was because}} Gavin is my name. You were called after your father. Do you not {{remember}} my <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> one day <b>to</b> the shore at Harvie {{to see the}} fishermen carried to their boats upon their wives' backs, that they might start dry on their journey?" ...|$|R
5000|$|NME's Alex Needham {{reviewed}} the single negatively saying the song [...] "feels like a lifetime - and one nobody sane {{would be in}} a hurry to return to, either." [...] He said that it [...] "hits you like a shot of pure camphor, <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> back <b>to</b> those dark, pre-CD:UK days when The Chart Show used to run down the indie chart." [...] He went on to criticize Snow Patrol, calling them [...] "too poor and unimaginative to have made videos." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I intend <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> both back <b>to</b> Helium," [...] I said. [...] "No harm {{will come}} <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> You {{will find the}} red men of Helium a kindly and magnanimous race, but if they listen to me {{there will be no}} more {{voluntary}} pilgrimages down the river Iss, and the impossible belief that they have cherished for ages will be shattered into a thousand pieces." ...|$|R
60|$|It's {{very natural}} {{that he should}} be in love with you. I'm always {{surprised}} that everybody else isn't. I don't see how I can prevent that except by <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> live {{in the depths of the}} Sahara.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much!" [...] {{returned}} the would-be story-teller. [...] "If I can't tell that story now, I'm {{going to be}} mum forever." [...] He suddenly looked at Dave. [...] "What is <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> New York?" [...] he inquired.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's all right, really. <b>Taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the 'Blue Boar' doesn't land {{me out of}} my way at all. Most of {{the work}} lies round in this direction. I call at cottages, and lug oldest {{inhabitants}} to the poll. It's rare sport." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to {{the work}} of the 'Deductores,' who go out with you--as it is much more severe than that of those who merely come to pay their compliments, let them {{understand}} that <b>you</b> feel it <b>to</b> be so, and, as far as possible, be ready to go into town with them at fixed hours." [...] Quintus here means that the [...] "Deductores" [...] are not to be kept waiting for the patron longer than can be helped. [...] "The attendance of a daily crowd in <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> down <b>to</b> the Forum gives a great show of character and dignity.|$|R
6000|$|Beaming, he went on, [...] "I'd {{pull the}} rough stuff right here, instead of wastin' {{my time as}} a cap'n of {{industry}} by <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> up <b>to</b> see the scenery in that daisy little gully off the road; but the whole world can see us along here--the hicks in the valley and anybody that happens to sneak along in a car behind us. Shame the way this road curves--see too far along it. Fact, you're giving {{me a lot of}} trouble. But you'll give me a kiss, won't you, Gwendolyn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{congress}} of nations, truly!" [...] muttered another male voice near {{the father and}} daughter. [...] "You have been taught music in general, by seven masters of as many different states, besides the touch of the guitar by a Spaniard; Greek by a German; the living tongues by the European powers, and philosophy by seeing the world; and now with a brain full of learning, fingers full of touches, eyes full of tints, and a person full of grace, your father is <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> back <b>to</b> America, to 'waste your sweetness on the desert air.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got an idea," [...] said Dave's uncle, one morning, {{after the}} snow had cleared away. [...] "The roads are so fine just now, what is to prevent my <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Oak Hall in the touring car? We can make it in a day, I think." ...|$|E
60|$|HARRY. And you {{returned}} those {{cards and}} that was the end of it. I asked George what he thought about my <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the club to play tennis and he said he thought we'd better not risk it. The result is that you don't know a soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why can't {{you give}} up beating about the bush, Pa?" [...] she demanded, with contemptuous pity. [...] "You might as well own up what's <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Carmody. I can see through your design. You {{want to get away}} to the Garland auction. That is what is troubling you, Pa Sloane." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marrying Arabella again. It {{was in the}} Alfredston paper. She {{has never}} been other than yours, Jude--in a proper sense. And {{therefore}} you did so well--Oh so well!--in recognizing it--and <b>taking</b> her <b>to</b> <b>you</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good luck to you," [...] he said. [...] "If you win Marian Lindsay you'll win a pearl among women. I haven't {{been able}} to grasp her <b>taking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in this fashion, though. It's so unlike Marian. But, since she {{undoubtedly}} has, you are a lucky man." ...|$|R
50|$|Wright {{described}} the shrine {{as a white}} concrete structure built {{into the side of}} a hill, reachable down a narrow dirt path that is nearly a mile from the nearest road. It is on a section of land with a pond and many trees. The building is built into the side of a hill and has a set of stairs <b>taking</b> <b>you</b> up <b>to</b> a landing on the roof. Atop is the monument to all of the Axis forces. Inside the building are large bookshelves and a large conference table, along with the pictures of Adolf Hitler.|$|R
