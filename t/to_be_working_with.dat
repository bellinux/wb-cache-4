5|$|During {{the first}} season, Nikita gains some allies {{to aid in}} her fight against Division, {{including}} Owen Elliot (Devon Sawa), a guardian to one of Division's several black boxes; hard drives contain files of Division's missions, until Percy tried to have him killed, CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean) who was investigating black operations invisible to the United States government, and eventually her trainer Michael, after he learns Percy {{was responsible for the}} deaths of his wife and daughter. The two would be in a relationship for the rest of the series' run. By the first-season finale, Alex learns that Nikita killed her father and leaves her to become a free agent for Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist who overthrew Percy to lead Division with the help of Oversight, a group of American politicians who ensure that Division's existence remains secret from the public (Alex would later return to fight alongside with Nikita again midway through season two). Michael is discovered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Nikita and the two end up on the run together with a black box.|$|E

25|$|Among all {{counseling}} specialty areas, public elementary, {{middle and}} high school counselors are (2009) paid the highest salary on average of all counselors. Budget cuts, however, have affected placement of public school counselors in Canada, Ireland, the United States, and other countries due to the global recession in recent years. In the United States, rural areas and urban areas traditionally have been under-served by school counselors in public schools due to both funding shortages and often a lack of best practice models. With the advent of No Child Left Behind legislation in the USA and a mandate for school counselors <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> data and showing evidence-based practice, school counselors able to show and share results in assisting to close gaps are {{in the best position to}} argue for increased school counseling resources and positions for their programs (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012).|$|E

25|$|In Japan, Ryu Hayabusa is {{approached}} by Hayate and joins him and Ayane. Helena informs {{them that the}} Phase Four will see a mass production of Kasumi clones to sell them to top militaries in the world. Feeling {{that something is wrong}} with Kasumi, Hayate orders Ayane to follow her and discover her real intentions. Frustrated with her failure to track down Alpha, Kasumi returns to Helena, demanding to be told the truth, and Helena directs her to the platform. There, Hayate wins the right to follow her from Bayman. Kasumi discovers the lab, with Alpha-152 in it, and appears to destroy her clone. However, she is then attacked and mortally wounded by Hayate and Ayane, and dies in Ryu's arms. This Kasumi is revealed to be merely a clone herself, but Ryu regrets her death anyway. Ryu destroys attacking helicopters (of the kind that attacked the rig earlier), while Hayate is captured in the lab by Rig, who turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Donovan. Ryu sends a falcon with a message for the true Kasumi, who has been sheltering with Murumasa all that time; she immediately joins them up at the platform. In the lab, they defeat Rig, who escapes after saying it was a plan to lure them there. Lisa, dismayed to find out that Project Epsilon has been reactivated, frees Hayate. Alpha-152 then appears, taking forms of not only Kasumi but also of Hayate and Ryu, but Hayate and Ayane, Ryu and ultimately Kasumi succeed in destroying her along with the lab.|$|E
