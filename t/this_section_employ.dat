We employ the traditional spatial Alonso–Mills–Muth framework (AMM) (Alonso 1964; Mills 1972; Muth 1969).

30|$|To {{illustrate}} this {{role of the}} arbitrator <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>employs</b> a model of collaborative production with imperfect contracting. For a meta-organization, {{a joint venture between}} two parties is assumed and the effort levels are represented by the investments in the joint venture. In a first step the joint venture with a unanimous sharing rule is illustrated. Then an arbitrator is introduced who is able to observe the investment levels and who allocates the shares of the surplus by the means of a contest. Since this allocation is enforceable in court, the arbitrator’s decision marks the parties’ outside option and hence their bargaining power over the surplus.|$|R

30|$|In [26] and [30], the Papoulis' {{multichannel}} sampling theorem {{has been extended}} for bandlimited signals in the FRFT domain and the LCT domain, respectively.

30|$|It {{is known}} that as M gets large, RLNC {{achieves}} the max-flow capacity of the network [5]. In practice, however, where M may not be large, we would experience some loss in the end-to-end rate. In <b>this</b> <b>section,</b> we <b>employ</b> a Markov chain model to calculate the expected completion time of S 2 HNC in the small M regime for given link erasure rates. In [25], a Markov chain model is proposed to analyze the two-hop network-coded transmission, where RLNC of infinite field size is assumed. In the following, we use a similar approach but applied to finite field sizes.|$|R
30|$|In <b>this</b> <b>section,</b> we <b>employ</b> the MLC NAND Flash memory channel modeled in[10, 11], where random {{telegraph}} noise[12], {{the incremental}} step pulse programming[13], cell-to-cell interference[14], and non-uniform quantization[15] are considered. In particular, {{in order to}} support soft-decision LDPC decoding, we adopt the LLR computation method proposed in[16], in which the four threshold voltage distributions are assumed as Gaussian distributions and the partial cumulative distribution functions of the Gaussian distribution are used to compute quantized LLRs. Thus, the LLR computation method only requires the means and the variances of the distributions obtained by performing channel estimation. Note that the LLR computation can be implemented by using a look-up table.|$|R
30|$|In <b>this</b> <b>section,</b> {{we shall}} <b>employ</b> the {{multiple}} scale method to derive the amplitude equations describing the dynamics close to onset b=b^c {{based on the}} weakly nonlinear analysis theory. For more details as regards the weakly nonlinear analysis, we refer the reader to [45, 46] and some articles which use similar techniques [47, 48]. In what follows, we will suppose that there exists only one unstable eigenvalue λ(k̂_c^ 2), which lies in the instability band.|$|R
30|$|The two-way interference-range edge-coloring {{introduced}} in e-TICA {{leads to an}} improved CA scheme and eliminates the problem of hidden links. However, in some topologies, owing to the long links, LICs result in increasing the interference. Hence, reuse of a channel within the interference range causes significant decrease in network throughput. Since the long links contribute to interference, they should be replaced with shorter links wherever possible. So, a modified CAA, e-TICA 2, is presented in <b>this</b> <b>section</b> which <b>employs</b> an MST rooted at the gateway instead of a SPT to reduce the occurrence of conflicting channels, thereby, improving fairness in medium access and network throughput. Its computational complexity is also {{same as that of}} TICA.|$|R

40|$|The need to {{minimize}} fan noise radiation from commercial aircraft engine nacelles continues {{to provide an}} impetus for developing new acoustic liner concepts. If the full value of such concepts is to be attained, an understanding of grazing flow effects is crucial. Because of this need for improved understanding of grazing flow effects, the NASA Langley Research Center Liner Physics Group has invested a large effort {{over the past decade}} into the development of a 2 -D finite element method that characterizes wave propagation through a lined duct. The original test section in the Langley Grazing Incidence Tube was used to acquire data needed for implementation of this finite element method. <b>This</b> test <b>section</b> <b>employed</b> a stepper motor-driven axial-traversing bar, embedded in the wall opposite the test liner, to position a flush-mounted microphone at pre-selected locations. Complex acoustic pressure data acquired with this traversing microphone were used to educe the acoustic impedance of test liners using this 2 -D finite element method and a local optimization technique. Results acquired in this facility have been extensively reported, and were compared with corresponding results from various U. S. aeroacoustics laboratories in the late 1990 ’s. Impedance data comparisons acquired from this multi-laboratory study suggested that it would be valuable to incorporate more realistic 3 -D aeroacoustic effects into the impedance eduction methodology. This paper provides a description of modifications that have been implemented to facilitate studies of 3 -D effects. The two key features of the modifie...|$|R
3000|$|<b>This</b> <b>section</b> aims at <b>employing</b> LSVM as {{component}} classifier in AdaBoost. Similar to the AdaBoostRBFSVM, it {{is important}} to set the C value for these LSVM component classifiers during the AdaBoost iterations. It is known that the value of C represents the importance of outliers to the classifier. The larger C represents more attention will be paid to the outliers, which means that they cannot be easily ignored. Increasing the value of C can always achieve the correct classification of the training samples, but this will lead to over-fitting and bad generalization performance. On the contrary, continuously decreasing the value of C will result in under-fitting. Obviously, if all LSVM component classifiers were set to a single C value, the boosting process will be unsuccessful. Therefore, in this paper, a set of moderately accurate LSVM component classifiers will be obtained by adaptively adjusting the C value. AdaBoostLSVM can be described as follows (Algorithm  2): [...]...|$|R
