5|$|A {{clinical}} exam {{is often}} used {{as a means to}} diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|A vast {{marshland}} {{could only}} have been formed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25million and 2million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.|$|E

5|$|Bristol {{is part of}} a {{limestone}} area {{running from}} the Mendip Hills in the south to the Cotswolds in the northeast. The rivers Avon and Frome cut through the limestone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> clay, creating Bristol's characteristically hilly landscape. The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through flood plains and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon cuts through the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, aided by glacial meltwater after the last ice age.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{fragmentary nature}} of known Paraceratherium fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several {{different}} ways since its discovery. In 1923, W. D. Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using the proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum skeleton from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.|$|E

Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for poetry. Registers in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century prosody, through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.|$|E

5|$|Tracks are an {{important}} factor in distinguishing coyote from dog predation. Coyote tracks tend to be more oval-shaped and compact than those of domestic dogs, and their claw marks are less prominent and the tracks tend to follow a straight line more closely than those of dogs. With the exception of sighthounds, most dogs of similar weight to coyotes have a slightly shorter stride. Coyote kills can be distinguished from wolf kills by less damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> tissues in the former. Also, coyote scat tends to be smaller than wolf scat.|$|E
5|$|When {{viewed in}} mass, such {{as with a}} spore print, the spores appear to be white. Viewed with a light microscope, the basidiospores are 8–10.5 by 4.5–5.5µm, , smooth, and {{yellowish}} in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four-spored and measure 48–65 long by 6–8µm thick. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (specialized cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent in this species. The pileipellis (cap cuticle) is made of a broad (175–350µm) gelatinous zone, composed of loosely interwoven, slender (1.5–4µm) hyphae; the surface hyphae are a —a dark brownish-gray color. This hyphal arrangement is called an , in which the hyphal walls swell up and gelatinize, giving a translucence to the layer that stands out in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> flesh. The layer of gelatizined hyphae is tenacious, and may be peeled off the cap as a film. Although clamp connections are found on the hyphae {{that make up the}} flesh of the gill, none are found in the cap flesh nor in the pileipellis.|$|E

5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E

40|$|Impaired {{balance is}} often seen in elderly and can result in {{impaired}} mobility and finally in falling. Failure of compensation strategies or deterioration of underlying systems involved in standing balance could result in impaired balance. To apply targeted interventions to improve balance, it is important <b>to</b> know <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> cause of impaired balance. In this thesis, it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> systems involved in balance, represented by muscle characteristics, blood pressure and cognition, are all associated with <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> maintain standing balance in elderly outpatients. However, the quality of standing balance, determined using force plates measuring ground reaction forces, is not associated with <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> systems involved in standing balance. Therefore, {{it is not possible}} <b>to</b> detect <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> cause of impaired balance in elderly outpatients using aforementioned measures. System identification techniques are introduced <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> contribution of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> systems in standing balance. In this thesis, the method is validated and it is shown that it is possible <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> systems involved in standing balance in elderly. This gives <b>the</b> opportunity <b>to</b> use this method <b>to</b> unravel <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> cause of impaired balance in elderly and therefore to apply targeted interventions and reduce falling.
