5|$|In {{the course}} of a 25-minute test an early R engine would consume 60Imperial gallons (gal) (270L) of {{pre-heated}} castor oil. The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> engine to operating temperature. The same coarse-pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E
5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> cold earth.|$|E

5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} {{reaching}} peak intensity, the storm moved over cooler waters, causing the eyewall to deteriorate and cloud tops <b>to</b> <b>warm.</b> <b>The</b> next day, {{the eye of}} Howard disappeared from satellite imagery, leading to the cyclone being downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane. Continued deterioration of the system caused rapid weakening, with Howard being downgraded to a tropical storm by 1200UTC on September4. Convection associated with the storm was separated from the center later that day. Early on September5, Howard was further downgraded to a tropical depression and later degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area about 265mi (425km) west-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. The remnants of the hurricane continued towards the northwest before turning towards the southwest the following day as it tracked along the southeast side of a ridge of high pressure. The low continued in this general direction until it dissipated on September10 about 1,150mi (1,850km) west of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The festive {{kindling}} of the badnjak commemorates {{the fire}} that—according to Serbian folk tradition—the shepherds of Bethlehem {{built in the}} cave where Jesus Christ was born, <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> Baby Jesus and his mother throughout the night. The badnjak may {{also be seen as}} a symbol of the cross upon which Christ was crucified, the warmth of its fire symbolizing the salvation which, in the Christian belief, the crucifixion made possible for mankind. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the old Slavic religion. They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. The burning symbolized sunshine, securing the vitalizing power of the sun in the coming year. Other South Slavic peoples have similar traditions, and the custom that a family brings a log into the house and burns it on Christmas Eve has also been recorded in other parts of Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the badnjak is {{explained}} by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the Gospel of Luke , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By Holy Tradition, the manger was located in a cave near that town. An angel of the Lord appeared {{to a group of}} shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region, and told them that the Savior was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather had}} begun to deteriorate, and {{it was decided that}} the schuit was not strong enough to bring the {{remaining}} Malagasy ashore. One end of a rope was anchored to the shore, and at low tide volunteers from the Dutch group on shore swam out to Meermin, bringing {{the other end of the}} rope with them and handing it up to the crew on the ship. The crew then helped the remaining fifty-three Malagasy climb down to the Dutch volunteers, who helped them to shore, some carrying children on their backs. The Dutch built a fire <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> Malagasy after their immersion in the water, and fed them; three wagons took them to Cape Town on 12March. Of the 140 or so Malagasy who had been shipped, 112 reached the Cape Colony as slaves.|$|E

25|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O) {{has risen}} in the {{atmosphere}} {{as a result of}} agricultural fertilization, biomass burning, cattle and feedlots, and industrial sources. N2O has deleterious effects in the stratosphere, where it breaks down and acts as a catalyst in the destruction of atmospheric ozone. Nitrous oxide is also a greenhouse gas and is currently the third largest contributor to global warming, after carbon dioxide and methane. While not as abundant {{in the atmosphere}} as carbon dioxide, it is, for an equivalent mass, nearly 300 times more potent in its ability <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> planet.|$|E
25|$|Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter {{and longer}} while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually for {{multiple}} times (2-3 typically). Steeping too hot or {{for too long}} results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew’s taste is also affected by the steeping technique. Two important techniques are <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down and to leave the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water as you drink the tea.|$|E

25|$|The chief {{difficulty}} with {{this model is}} that no martian climate simulation can reliably simulate a warm, wet Noachian, {{largely due to the}} distance between the sun and Mars compared to the Earth, and the inferred weaker Sun in the early solar system. Furthermore, a CO2-H2O greenhouse atmosphere <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> climate should have left extensive deposits of carbonate rocks, which have not been found. Problems also exist with sustaining such an atmosphere for long enough to allow the valleys to form, as the unweathered basalts so prevalent on Mars should form extremely effective carbon sinks, especially if the surface is wet, and continuing impacts from space in Mars' early history should quickly strip any atmosphere away.|$|E
25|$|Solar roof ponds {{are unique}} solar {{heating and cooling}} systems {{developed}} by Harold Hay in the 1960s. A basic system consists of a roof-mounted water bladder with a movable insulating cover. This system can control heat exchange between interior and exterior environments by covering and uncovering the bladder between night and day. When heating is a concern the bladder is uncovered during the day allowing sunlight <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> water bladder and store heat for evening use. When cooling is a concern the covered bladder draws heat from the building's interior {{during the day and}} is uncovered at night to radiate heat to the cooler atmosphere. The Skytherm house in Atascadero, California uses a prototype roof pond for heating and cooling.|$|E

25|$|The {{eastern and}} western stands of Beijing National Stadium are higher than {{northern}} and southern stands, {{in order to improve}} sightlines. A 24-hour-per-day rainwater collector is located near the stadium; after water is purified, it is used throughout and around the stadium. Pipes placed under the playing surface gather heat in the winter <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> stadium and coldness in the summer to cool the stadium. The stadium's design originally called for a capacity of 100,000 people; however 9,000 were removed during a simplification of the design. The new total of 91,000 was shaved further when 11,000 temporary seats were removed after the 2008 Olympics; bringing the stadium's capacity to 80,000. The farthest seat is 460 feet (140 meters) from center field. Temperature and airflow of every surface were optimized to increase ventilation.|$|E
25|$|Diesel engines can {{be started}} and stopped almost instantly, meaning that a diesel {{locomotive}} {{has the potential}} to incur no costs when not being used. However, it is still the practice of large North American railroads to use straight water as a coolant in diesel engines instead of coolants that incorporate anti-freezing properties; this results in diesel locomotives being left idling when parked in cold climates instead of being completely shut down. Still, a diesel engine can be left idling unattended for hours or even days, especially since practically every diesel engine used in locomotives has systems that automatically shut the engine down if problems such as a loss of oil pressure or coolant loss occur. In recent years, automatic start/stop systems such as SmartStart have been adopted, which monitor coolant and engine temperatures. When these temperatures show that the unit is close to having its coolant freeze, the system restarts the diesel engine <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> coolant and other systems.|$|E
25|$|Most {{species of}} birds have {{external}} nares (nostrils) located somewhere on their beak. The nares are two holes—circular, oval or slit-like in shape—which lead to the nasal cavities within the bird's skull, and thus {{to the rest of}} the respiratory system. In most bird species, the nares are located in the basal third of the upper mandible. Kiwis are a notable exception; their nares are located at the tip of their bills. A handful of species have no external nares. Cormorants and darters have primitive external nares as nestlings, but these close soon after the birds fledge; adults of these species (and gannets and boobies of all ages, which also lack external nostrils) breathe through their mouths. There is typically a septum made of bone or cartilage that separates the two nares, but in some families (including gulls, cranes and New World vultures), the septum is missing. While the nares are uncovered in most species, they are covered with feathers in a few groups of birds, including grouse and ptarmigans, crows, and some woodpeckers. The feathers over a ptarmigan's nostrils help <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>the</b> air it inhales, while those over a woodpecker's nares help to keep wood particles from clogging its nasal passages.|$|E
