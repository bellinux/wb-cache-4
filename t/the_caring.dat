5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females do most of <b>the</b> <b>caring</b> and socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers {{for the first two}} years of their lives. The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} perceptions of competence affect <b>the</b> <b>care</b> of older persons, {{and the values}} ​​and vocational conceptions of care work and care recipients that {{are tied to the}} perceptions of what skills that are needed and why. Competence is defined by three parts with relevance for <b>the</b> content of <b>care</b> work: what knowledge <b>the</b> <b>care</b> workers should have, what tasks they should perform and how they should respond to <b>care</b> recipients. <b>The</b> aim of this dissertation is to analyse how <b>the</b> <b>care</b> managers' and care workers' perceptions of competence form the direction of <b>the</b> <b>care</b> work and how that direction relates to <b>the</b> <b>care</b> recipients’ perceptions of and expectations on <b>the</b> <b>care</b> work.   <b>The</b> <b>care</b> work is characterised by what is analysed as an activation of the recipients - that the recipients themselves should perform as much of <b>the</b> <b>care</b> work as possible. The activation aims at managing the decay of the aging body and is motivated by a vocational conception of <b>the</b> <b>care</b> recipients as different from others, with designations as grateful and passive. This conception is analysed as generation character based on an idea among <b>the</b> <b>care</b> managers and <b>care</b> workers that <b>the</b> society in which the recipients grew up gave them certain cognitive prerequisites that have to be managed in <b>the</b> practical <b>care</b> work.   <b>The</b> <b>care</b> recipients in <b>the</b> study have opposing conceptions and perceptions of care work compared with <b>the</b> <b>care</b> managers and <b>care</b> workers. <b>The</b> recipients’ central objective with <b>the</b> <b>care</b> work is to prevent what has been interpreted as the disrepair of <b>the</b> home. <b>The</b> <b>care</b> recipients’ position in the organisation raises the problem of loyalty towards <b>the</b> <b>care</b> workers and in some sense <b>the</b> <b>care</b> managers. Their loyalty reduces their ability to complain and to influence their situation to the better.   Keywords: care of older persons, care needs, care work, care relationship, care receivers, care workers, care managers, competence, technologies, activation, generation characte...|$|R

30|$|By {{highlighting}} the mediated factors in delivering intergenerational support, this article {{also points to}} the different roles played by <b>the</b> obligation to <b>care</b> and <b>the</b> capacity to <b>care</b> in <b>the</b> <b>care</b> circulation system. <b>The</b> moral ethics of filiality and rural material sociality owing to long-established urban-rural segregation tied people within interdependent networks of family obligation and reciprocity. <b>The</b> obligation to <b>care</b> served as <b>the</b> driver to <b>the</b> rural Chinese <b>care</b> circulation system. However, in order to materialize <b>the</b> obligation to <b>care,</b> <b>the</b> capacity to <b>care</b> served as <b>the</b> energy resource to make <b>the</b> <b>care</b> circulation system operate.

25|$|Unger's {{critique}} of and alternative to social programs {{goes to the}} heart of civil society.

25|$|Although much {{of nursing}} ethics can appear similar to medical ethics, {{there are some}} factors that {{differentiate}} it. Breier-Mackie suggests that nurses' focus on care and nurture, rather than cure of illness, results in a distinctive ethics. Furthermore, nursing ethics emphasizes the ethics of everyday practice rather than moral dilemmas. Nursing ethics {{is more concerned with}} developing <b>the</b> <b>caring</b> relationship than broader principles, such as beneficence and justice. For example, a concern to promote beneficence may be expressed in traditional medical ethics by the exercise of paternalism, where the health professional makes a decision based upon a perspective of acting in the patient's best interests. However, it is argued by some that this approach acts against person-centred values found in nursing ethics.|$|E

25|$|Noddings {{tends to}} use unequal {{relationships}} {{as a model}} for understanding caring. Philosopher and feminist Sarah Lucia Hoagland argues that the relationships in question, such as parenting and teaching, are ideally relationships where caring is a transitory thing designed to foster the independence of the cared-for, and so end the unequal caring relationship. Unequal relationships, she writes, are ethically problematic, and so a poor model for an ethical theory. Hoagland argues that on Noddings' account of ethical caring, the one-caring is placed {{in the role of the}} giver and the cared-for in the role of the taker. The one-caring is dominant, choosing what is good for the cared-for, but gives without receiving caring in return. The cared-for is put in the position of being a dependent, with insufficient control over the nature of <b>the</b> <b>caring.</b> Hoagland believes that such unequal relationships cannot be morally good.|$|E

Its main principle is respecting God, helping the poor, doing good, preventing evil and practicing respect and tolerance. All of these teachings have made indelible contributions to civilizations. According to Siew, King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia had reassured the oil supply to Taiwan during the 1973 oil crisis.
