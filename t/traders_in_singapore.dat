The <b>traders</b> <b>in</b> <b>Singapore</b> lost so heavily as a result that they refused to accept trade unless it was paid for in cash. Along with the fear of increased taxation, many Chinese left {{to other parts of the}} Archipelago as Jolo lost its role as the regional entrepot. The Tausug had already abandoned trading when the Chinese arrived. Thus, Jolo never fully gained its previous trading status. However, the Chinese continued to dominate trade throughout the Archipelago and Mindanao.|$|E

5000|$|Nick Leeson was a dishonest futures <b>trader</b> <b>in</b> <b>Singapore</b> for {{the former}} Barings Bank. He traded {{in the front office}} and also did work, in breach of an {{internal}} audit recommendation, in the back office. He fraudulently doctored the bank's accounts, and reported large profits, while trading at losses. After an earthquake in Kobe, Japan, the stock market went into a downward spiral, and the truth of his losses were uncovered. The Secretary of State sought director disqualification orders under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 against three directors of Barings for their failure to supervise his activities. They were alleged to be incompetent, and therefore [...] "unfit to be concerned in the management of a company" [...] (sections 6-8).|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{explore the}} culture of the finance {{industry}} in general and, in particular, the problems of dealing with socalled rogue behaviour in the context of regulation and regulatory regimes. The reference points for analysis are the recent cases of Robert Maxwell, the British entrepreneur who is thought by many to have systematically 'fleeced' his companies' pension funds to finance complex corporate deals, and Nick Leeson, the Barings <b>trader</b> (<b>in</b> <b>Singapore)</b> who, it is commonly believed, single-handedly bankrupted the bank. While no doubt provocative and the subjects of considerable speculation regarding their true motives, I argue that the Maxwell and Leeson cases are representative of a strategy of demonization and selective representation designed to protect the reputations of existing institutions. In this respect, I focus upon three issues: the representation of behaviour; the significance of an industry's culture for individual behaviour; and the scope of regulation. The paper includes a discussion of the flawed logic of explanations of individual behaviour that do not take seriously the context of behaviour. To illustrate, I begin with Mrs Maxwell's recent biography of her late husband and then concentrate on recent government reports and commentaries related to Leeson and the Barings' collapse. The paper concludes with an analysis of these issues with reference to the global regulation of the securities industry. The full-text of this article is not available in ORA. Citation: Clark, G. L.

5000|$|The Armenians {{were among}} the {{earliest}} merchants and <b>traders</b> to arrive <b>in</b> <b>Singapore</b> after Sir Stamford Raffles established it as a trading port in 1819. The community already held religious services <b>in</b> <b>Singapore</b> by 1821, and the first priest, the Reverend Krikor Hovhannes (Gregory John), arrived in July 1827. A temporary chapel was set up {{at the back of}} John Little & Company at Commercial Square (today's Raffles Place). [...] The community started to raise funds {{for the construction of a}} new church in 1827. Over half the construction cost of 5,058.30 Spanish dollars was donated by the Armenian community <b>in</b> <b>Singapore,</b> with the rest coming from Armenians in Java and India, and a small portion from European and Chinese merchants <b>in</b> <b>Singapore.</b> The Armenian community was very small - the 1824 census counted only 16 members, and 34 in 1836 when the church opened - its contribution to the Armenian Church was therefore considerable in proportion, an indication of the prosperity and religious devotion of the Armenians.|$|R
