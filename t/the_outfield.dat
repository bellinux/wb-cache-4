5000|$|<b>The</b> Golden <b>Outfield,</b> {{also called}} <b>the</b> Million Dollar <b>Outfield,</b> were <b>the</b> three {{starting}} outfielders of the Major League Baseball Boston Red Sox from 1910 through 1915, {{considered one of}} <b>the</b> greatest <b>outfields</b> of all time. [...] The three members of <b>the</b> Golden <b>Outfield</b> were left fielder Duffy Lewis, center fielder Tris Speaker and right fielder Harry Hooper. The three helped the Red Sox win two World Series titles, in 1912 and 1915. Two members of <b>the</b> Golden <b>Outfield,</b> Speaker and Hooper, are enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame. [...] All three were effective hitters, but were especially known for their fielding skill. [...] Baseball writer Grantland Rice {{said that they were}} [...] "the greatest defensive outfield I ever saw...They were smart and fast. They covered every square inch of the park - and they were like three fine infielders on ground balls. They could move into another country, if the ball happened to fall there." [...] Speaker, Hooper, and Lewis all had powerful throwing arms, as well. Both Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth said that it was <b>the</b> best <b>outfield</b> that they had ever seen.|$|R

5|$|The game {{is played}} on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is {{referred}} to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is <b>the</b> <b>outfield.</b> In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of <b>the</b> <b>outfield</b> is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields). The fair territory between home plate and <b>the</b> <b>outfield</b> boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.|$|E
5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over <b>the</b> <b>outfield</b> wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to <b>the</b> <b>outfield</b> with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{fertility}} varies markedly {{within and}} between African smallholder farms, both {{as a consequence of}} inherent factors and differential management. Fields closest to homesteads (homefields) typically receive most nutrients and are more fertile than outlying fields (outfields), with implications for crop production and nutrient use efficiencies. Maize yields following application of 100 kg N ha(- 1) and different rates and sources of P were assessed on homefields and outfields of smallholder farms in Zimbabwe. Soil organic carbon, available P and exchangeable bases were greater on <b>the</b> homefields than <b>outfields.</b> In each of three experimental seasons, maize yields in homefield control plots were greater than in <b>the</b> <b>outfields</b> of farms on a granitic sandy and a red-clay soil. Application of mineral N significantly increased maize yields on homefields in the first season (2. 1 - 3. 0 t ha(- 1) on the clay soil and 1. 0 - 1. 5 t ha(- 1) on the sandy soil) but the effects of N alone were not significant on <b>the</b> <b>outfields</b> due to other yield-limiting factors. Greatest yields of about 6 t ha(- 1) were achieved on the clayey homefield with 100 kg N ha(- 1) and 30 kg P ha(- 1) applied as single super phosphate (SSP). Manure application gave greater yields (3 - 4 t ha(- 1)) than SSP (2 - 3 t ha(- 1)) in the sandy homefield and in <b>the</b> clayey <b>outfield.</b> Maize did not respond significantly to N, dolomitic lime, manure and P on <b>the</b> sandy <b>outfield</b> in <b>the</b> first and second seasons. In the third season, manure application (similar to 17 t manure ha(- 1) year(- 1)) on <b>the</b> sandy <b>outfield</b> did result in a significant response in grain yields. Apparent P recovery in the first season was 55 - 65 % when P was applied at 10 kg ha(- 1) on the clayey homefield (SSP), clayey outfield (SSP and manure) and sandy homefield (manure) with apparent P recovery less than 40 % when P was applied at 30 kg ha(- 1). On <b>the</b> sandy <b>outfield,</b> P recovery was initially poor ( 50 kg grain kg(- 1) N on the infields, to less than 5 kg grain kg(- 1) N on <b>the</b> sandy <b>outfields.</b> Apparent N recovery efficiency by maize was greatest at small N application rates with P applied. We conclude that blanket fertilizer recommendations are of limited relevance for heterogeneous smallholder farms. Targeted application of mineral fertilizers and manure according to soil type and past management of fields is imperative for improving crop yields and nutrient use efficiencies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.

5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have {{a good view of the}} strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in <b>the</b> <b>outfield</b> along the foul lines.|$|E

40|$|Models {{like the}} Supersymmetric Standard Model (SSM) possess simple, but well-hidden, `Outfields'. These Outfields are {{composite}} operators that violate superspace invariance, {{but in a}} special way. A new mechanism for SUSY breaking arises from <b>the</b> <b>Outfields,</b> for a special non-minimal version of the SSM, which will be called the CSSM. The CSSM has right neutrinos and a Higgs singlet, which we call J, {{in addition to the}} usual SSM. This breaking of SUSY cannot be avoided, because it arises from the local BRST cohomology of the theory, which is also the origin of <b>the</b> <b>Outfields.</b> It can also be seen that the Weak SU(2) group, and the well-known remarkable set of doublets and singlets for the Quarks, Leptons and Higgs, have a raison d'etre which relates to this mechanism. The SUSY breaking here depends on only one parameter, which is the VEV that breaks SU(2) X U(1) to U(1). SUSY itself is not spontaneously broken here, so the vacuum energy remains zero after SUSY breaking. The resulting predictions for SUSY breaking are very constrained by the model.

40|$|The supersymmetric {{standard}} model (SSM) {{appears to be}} firmly grounded in superspace. For example, it would be natural to assume that all the physically important composite operators {{can be made by}} combining superfields and superspace derivatives. But even for the simplest possible, free, massless and unbroken SUSY theory in 3 + 1 dimensions, this is not true. This paper shows that there is a large set of physically important composite operators in the SSM that require explicit factors of the Grassmann odd `θ' parameters of superspace. These explicitly break superspace invariance. These composite operators will be called `Outfields', because they are intrinsically `outside' of superspace. It is not possible to write <b>the</b> <b>Outfields</b> using only superfields and superspace derivatives. <b>The</b> <b>Outfields</b> {{can be found in the}} BRST cohomology space of the theory. The calculation of the BRST cohomology space for these theories is performed in this paper using a spectral sequence analysis, starting with the free massless theory, and then adding interactions, and then masses.
