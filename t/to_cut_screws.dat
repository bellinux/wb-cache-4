50|$|Langlands and Fulton {{established}} their iron foundry in Flinders Streetwith in 1842 {{with only a}} small foot-lathe, but were still able to erect a steam engine for the first flour mill in Melbourne. They produced rack woolpresses for squatters with Fulton having <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>screws</b> threads by hand because their lathe was too small. Fulton developed a technique for boiling down sheep for tallow around in 1843-44 when squatters slaughtered their otherwise worthless sheep in the thousands due to a rural depression. Fulton was located at 131 Flinders St West in about 1844 and entered partnership with George Annand and Robert Smith at 129 Flinders St West, between 1846-55, employing 150 men in 1858. The gold rush proved a boon and the firm increased output of plumbing and smithy work and dray wheels. They were also milling flour and operating as a licensed insurance agent and merchant.|$|E
5000|$|Lineman's pliers {{may be used}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> steel <b>screws</b> up <b>to</b> #10, and {{virtually}} any dry-wall screw, although the thread form will be distorted. Lineman's pliers sometimes include an integrated crimping device in the craw of the handle side of the pliers' joint.|$|R

He is also the fastest to finish at 12:36.|$|R
5000|$|Important early {{machine tools}} {{included}} the slide rest lathe, screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine, pattern tracing lathe, shaper, and metal planer, which {{were all in}} use before 1840. [...] With these machine tools the decades-old objective of producing interchangeable parts was finally realized. An important early example of something now taken for granted was the standardization of screw fasteners such as nuts and bolts. Before about {{the beginning of the}} 19th century, these were used in pairs, and even screws of the same machine were generally not interchangeable. [...] Methods were developed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>screw</b> thread <b>to</b> a greater precision than that of the feed screw in the lathe being used. This led to the bar length standards of the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
50|$|Activity-based costing {{was later}} {{explained}} in 1999 by Peter F. Drucker {{in the book}} Management Challenges of the 21st Century. He states that traditional cost accounting focuses on what it costs to do something, for example, <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> a <b>screw</b> thread; activity-based costing also records the cost of not doing, such {{as the cost of}} waiting for a needed part. Activity-based costing records the costs that traditional cost accounting does not do.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the rate of <b>screw</b> <b>cut</b> out in elderly patients treated with the dynamic hip screw and the relationship to the Tip Apex Distance (TAD). This is a retrospective radiological evaluation of 100 cases of elderly patients with intertrochanteric fracture treated with dynamic hip screw fixation surgically treated between 1998 and 2002. The incidence of <b>screw</b> <b>cut</b> out was assessed and correlation of risk of cut out with the TAD was assessed. The rate of <b>screw</b> <b>cut</b> out was 9. 0 % and the average length of time <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>cut</b> out was 3. 8 months (range, 1 to 6 months) post-operatively. The incidence of <b>screw</b> <b>cut</b> out increased significantly when the TAD was 20 mm or more. The <b>screw</b> <b>cut</b> out rates were 2. 9 %, 20. 0 %, 30. 8 %, 50 % and 100 % fo...|$|R

50|$|Henry Hindley {{designed}} and constructed a screw-cutting lathe circa 1739. It featured a plate guiding the tool and power supplied by a hand-cranked series of gears. By changing the gears, he could <b>cut</b> <b>screws</b> with different pitch. Removing a gear permitted {{him to make}} left-handed threads.|$|R

5000|$|It {{was decided}} to sail her to Alexandria, where there were {{suitable}} docking facilities, However she could not steer a straight course, and could not make more than 8 kn. She {{got as far as}} Suez Bay, but could not attempt the Suez Canal in that condition. Lt Cmdr Peter Keeble, an experienced diver and salvage expert, personally supervised the removal of her two inner screw shafts near the gland. The A-brackets holding the shafts and <b>screws</b> were also <b>cut,</b> dropping both <b>screws</b> and shafts to the bottom. Keeble had perfected available underwater cutting torches by combining British and Italian technology <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> away the thick propeller shafts. [...] She returned to the UK and was decommissioned in July 1945.|$|R

50|$|Henry Maudslay, {{who trained}} {{a school of}} machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a {{mechanic}} with superior ability who had been employed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. He was hired away by Joseph Bramah {{for the production of}} high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship. Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe. Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could <b>cut</b> machine <b>screws</b> of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw. Before its invention screws could not be <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template. The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions, although not entirely Maudslay's idea.|$|R

5000|$|A {{rotary cutter}} {{is a tool}} {{generally}} used by quilters <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> fabric. It consists of a handle with a circular blade that rotates, thus the tool's name. Rotary cutter blades are very sharp, can be resharpened, and are available in different sizes: usually smaller blades are used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> small curves, while larger blades are used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> straight lines and broad curves. Several layers of fabric can be cut simultaneously with a sharp (fresh) blade, making it easier <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> out patchwork pieces of the same shape and size than with scissors. Quilters use rotary cutters with specially designed templates and rulers made of approximately 1/8-inch thick clear or color-tinted plastic.|$|R
