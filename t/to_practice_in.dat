5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them <b>to</b> <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E

5|$|In {{political}} terms, {{the practical}} benefits were minimal, the dangers considerable. Less than 2% of Scots were professed Catholics {{who already had}} considerable freedom <b>to</b> <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> private, a point made by James himself. The opening of Catholic chapels in Edinburgh allowing public celebration of the Mass led to riots and made private worship more difficult. Attempts to build support by expanding the measures benefitted dissident Presbyterians while undermining his Episcopalian base. When James failed to get Parliament's approval, he confirmed popular prejudice linking Catholicism and arbitrary rule by using the Royal Prerogative to promote Catholics to key government positions.|$|E

5|$|The Serjeants only enjoyed their {{returned}} {{status for}} another six years, however, before Parliament intervened.

The next and final blow was the Judicature Act 1873, which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided that common law judges need {{no longer be}} appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants. With this Act {{and the rise of}} the Queen's Counsel, there was no longer any need to appoint Serjeants, and the practice ended.|$|E

In 1758, he earned an A.M. from Harvard, and the following year was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, having completed his studies under Putnam. From an early age, he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men which are scattered through his diary, which included his report of the 1761 argument of James Otis Jr. in the Massachusetts Superior Court as to the legality of Writs of Assistance. Otis's argument inspired Adams to the cause of the American colonies.|$|E

5|$|In 1821, Fillmore turned 21 and {{was thus}} legally {{independent}} of his father. He taught school in East Aurora, and accepted {{a few cases}} in {{justice of the peace}} courts, which did not require the practitioner to be a licensed attorney. He moved to Buffalo the following year, continued his study of law, first while teaching school, and then in the law office of Asa Rice and Joseph Clary; he also became engaged to Abigail Powers. In 1823, he was admitted to the New York bar, and declined offers from Buffalo law firms to return to East Aurora and establish a practice as the town's only lawyer. Later in life, Fillmore stated that he initially lacked the self-confidence <b>to</b> <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> the larger city of Buffalo; his biographer, Paul Finkelman, suggested that after being under others' thumbs all his life, Fillmore enjoyed the independence of his East Aurora practice.

5|$|The {{court can}} appoint retired judges, lawyers, and other judges to serve {{temporarily}} as judges {{at any level}} in Oregon. They can also appoint senior judges to serve on any state court at or below {{the highest level of}} court that judge had served on before retirement or resignation. The state supreme court is responsible for admitting new lawyers <b>to</b> <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> Oregon, disciplining attorneys, and appointing members to the Board of Bar Examiners. This board of a minimum of fourteen members is responsible for administering the bar exam and screening prospective lawyers before admitting applicants to practice law in Oregon. Oversight of state judges is also {{in the hands of the}} Supreme Court. The Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability investigates all reports of abuses and makes recommendations to the Supreme Court on any actions that may need to occur.

5|$|The {{court is}} {{composed}} of seven elected justices, each of whom serves a six-year term after winning a nonpartisan election.

The newest justice receives the smallest office (nicknamed “the broom closet”) and is responsible for opening the door when a conference is interrupted. When a state court judge retires, resigns, or dies before completing a term, the Governor may appoint another qualified person to the position. To retain that position, the appointed person must run for election for a full six-year term at the next general election.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was {{involved}} in a similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by Devin Moore, a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive Grand Theft Auto player. The lawyer's participation in the case, however, ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice, or temporary, admission <b>to</b> <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore’s criminal trial. Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who went ahead and revoked Thompson's temporary admission to the state bar.|$|E
