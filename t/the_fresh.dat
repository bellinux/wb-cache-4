5|$|Bolstered by <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> troops, the Spartans {{and their}} Macedonian allies {{prepared}} themselves for Pyrrhus' next assault against the trench. The presence of more adversaries intensified Pyrrhus' determination {{to capture the}} city and he ordered another attack on the trenches. He was unable to accomplish anything and suffered further losses. The failure of this attack convinced Pyrrhus about the futility of persevering with the siege {{and he decided to}} lift it and withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> weight (see table), and 65.4% of the dry weight. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally desirable high proportion of insoluble fibre in B.edulis.|$|E

5|$|Having recovered, {{the company}} worked to expand {{geographically}} into markets like Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., {{and by the}} end of 1998 reported that revenue had surpassed pre-crisis levels. Growth continued over subsequent years, in part through the $29million acquisition of Fresh Samantha, a large juice company based in Saco, Maine, in 2000. This allowed Odwalla to expand into additional East Coast markets, but incurred high transportation costs as products had to be shipped across the United States from California. To address this problem the company announced plans to build a second production facility in Palm Beach County, Florida. However, facing difficulties in obtaining building permits and allocating sufficient funds, the project was first delayed and eventually cancelled. Odwalla produced and sold products under both its own and <b>the</b> <b>Fresh</b> Samantha brand names for a few years; however, in 2003, the company decided to stop selling juice under <b>the</b> <b>Fresh</b> Samantha name and to only sell Odwalla-brand juice.|$|E
5|$|Onion powder is a {{seasoning}} {{widely used}} when <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> ingredient is not available.

It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.|$|E

5|$|After the American {{defeat in}} the Siege of Detroit, General James Winchester, who became the {{commander}} of the Army of the Northwest, offered Harrison the rank of brigadier general. Harrison also wanted sole command of the army. In September 1812, after President James Madison removed Winchester from command, Harrison became commander of <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> recruits. Initially, the British and their Indian allies greatly outnumbered Harrison's troops. During the winter of 1812–13 Harrison constructed a defensive position along the Maumee River in northwest Ohio and named it Fort Meigs in honor of the Ohio governor Return J. Meigs Jr..|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
5|$|Boating on {{the canal}} is encouraged, {{although}} {{the lack of}} a link to the River Parrett at Bridgwater is restrictive. At this point, the Parrett is a salt water river, and is laden with silt, whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate <b>the</b> <b>fresh,</b> as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of Bridgwater. The canal forms part of the local flood relief system, in winter taking water from the River Tone at Taunton and discharging it into the Parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of Bridgwater, near the Bridgwater Canalside Centre.|$|E
5|$|By January 1904, {{the ship}} had become the {{flagship}} of the Channel Fleet. As {{a result of a}} reorganization in January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet, and Magnificent accordingly became a part of the Atlantic Fleet. A gun explosion aboard Magnificent on 14 June 1905 resulted in 18 casualties. The explosion was caused by a faulty shell in one of the 6-inch guns; it failed to fire, and when the loader opened the breech, contact with <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> air detonated the shell. On 15 November 1906, she ended her Atlantic Fleet service and was paid off at Devonport. Magnificent was commissioned into reserve on 16 November 1906, based at Chatham. During her reserve service, she was attached to the Gunnery School at Sheerness as a gunnery training ship in December 1906.|$|E

5|$|Doge Domenico Contarini (10431071) had a {{relatively}} uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory {{that had been}} lost in the east to the Kingdom of Croatia in the years following the deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, one fact remained: based on their actions {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> memories of power-hungry Doges, set the stage for Domenico Selvo.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolutionary War, France allied {{itself with}} the revolutionaries, causing war with Britain to break out in 1778. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars followed, during which period Falmouth became an {{important}} military depot. In 1795, the Crown purchased the castle's land from the Killigrew family, and reinforced the fortress to deal with <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> threat of invasion. The government installed more guns and built a new gun position called the Half-Moon Battery just outside the 16th-century walls; the landward defences of Pendennis were reinforced, and a new barracks and other ancillary buildings were built inside the fortress. At its peak, the castle was equipped with up to 48 artillery pieces. A new volunteer unit of artillery was formed in Falmouth to support the forts around the harbour, many of them carrying out training using Pendennis's guns before then deploying elsewhere across Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E

Consequently, throughout October, November and into December, the 2/3rd Battalion took part in three major actions: Eora Creek (22–28 October), Oivi (5–12 November), and an action on the Sanananda Track (21 November– 19 December).|$|E
5|$|Ida's major craters {{are named}} after caves and lava tubes on Earth. The crater Azzurra, for example, {{is named after}} a {{submerged}} cave {{on the island of}} Capri, also known as the Blue Grotto. Azzurra seems to be the most recent major impact on Ida. The ejecta from this collision is distributed discontinuously over Ida and is responsible for the large-scale color and albedo variations across its surface. An exception to the crater morphology is <b>the</b> <b>fresh,</b> asymmetric Fingal, which has a sharp boundary between the floor and wall on one side. Another significant crater is Afon, which marks Ida's prime meridian.|$|E

Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) performs an autopsy on the body Doggett found and one of her FBI cadets, Rudolph Hayes, accurately guesses that the victim hooked up with a psychotic killer at a bar.
