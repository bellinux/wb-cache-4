25|$|Politically, {{this area}} {{was one of the}} first in Alabama to shake off its Democratic roots. It was one of five {{district}}s to swing Republican in 1964, when Barry Goldwater swept the state; <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> held the district in every House election since then. However, conservative Democrats continued to hold most state and local offices well into the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The voter base of <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> been {{changing}} in directions opposite from national trends. It has become older and less Hispanic or Asian {{than the general}} population. Jackie Calmes has reported a dramatic shift in the power base of the party, as it {{moves away from the}} Northeast and Pacific States and toward small-town America in the South and West. During the 2016 presidential election, the Republicans also gained significant support in the Midwest. It has become more populist in its distrust of large corporations and of state and federal governments.|$|E
500|$|In {{a speech}} at the GOP Freedom Summit in April 2014, Paul insisted that <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> to broaden its appeal in order to grow as a party. To do so, he said it cannot be the party of [...] "fat cats, rich people and Wall Street" [...] and that the {{conservative}} movement has never been about rich people or privilege, [...] "we are the middle class", he said. Paul also said that conservatives must present a message of justice and concern for the unemployed and be against government surveillance to attract new people to the movement, including the young, Hispanics, and blacks. During the 2014 election, Paul launched a social media campaign titled [...] "Hillary's Losers" [...] which was meant to highlight many of the Democratic candidates that lost their bids for the U.S. Senate despite endorsements from Hillary Clinton. Clinton was also a candidate for President and eventually won the Democratic Party's nomination, going on to lose to Donald Trump in the general election.|$|E

50|$|On March 18, 2015, Beck officially {{announced}} {{he had left}} the Republican Party, saying that <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> failed to effectively stand against the president on Obamacare and immigration reform, and because of <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> establishment’s opposition to insurgent lawmakers such as Mike Lee and Ted Cruz.|$|R
50|$|Both parties {{saw their}} turnout decline from 2010. <b>The</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> 151,101 fewer primary voters in 2014 than in 2010; the Democrats {{declined}} by 133,354. Republicans {{had a total}} turnout of 9.8 percent in 2014; the Democrats, 3.7 percent.|$|R
2500|$|The Republican {{candidate}} for President in 2012, Mitt Romney, lost to incumbent President Barack Obama, {{the fifth time}} in six elections the Republican candidate received fewer votes than his Democratic counterpart. In {{the aftermath of the}} loss, some prominent Republicans spoke out against their own party; for example, 1996 Republican Presidential candidate and longtime former Senator Bob Dole said, [...] "today's GOP members are too conservative and overly partisan. They ought to put a sign on the National Committee doors that says closed for repairs". Former Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine stated as well that she was in agreement with Dole. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs (under George H.W. Bush) and former Secretary of State (under George W. Bush) Colin Powell remarked that <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> [...] "a dark vein of intolerance {{in some parts of the}} party", commenting about the birther movement [...] "hy do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the party?" [...] and [...] "I think the party has to take a look at itself." [...] The CRNC released a report in June 2013 that was highly critical of the party, being titled [...] "Grand Old Party for a Brand New Generation".|$|E
50|$|Republicans {{have won}} {{seven of the}} last eight {{governors}} races in Alabama dating back to 1986. <b>The</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> won six consecutive races for Attorney General dating back to 1994. Six of the eight seats on the State Board of Education have elected Republicans. The Alabama Supreme Court, State Appeals Courts, {{and the rest of the}} state judiciary are moving decisively to Republican dominance. All nine Supreme Court justices and the ten judges who sit on the two statewide appellate courts are all Republicans. Today even the lower courts are moving to the GOP. The line-up of Circuit Judges as of mid-March, 2016 consists of 80 Republicans, 65 Democrats and 1 vacancy. Also as of early 2016 <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> a majority on the district courts with 58 seats to the Democrats 46. In the last four years <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> achieved a net combined gain of 39 Circuit and District Judges through a combination of election wins, party switchers and the Governor filling vacancies with GOP appointees. It is all the more dramatic when one considers that there were less than one half dozen GOP judges in Alabama prior to 1986.|$|E

50|$|Just {{before the}} election, polls showed Kleeb even with or {{ahead of his}} Republican opponent, Adrian Smith, in a congressional {{district}} <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> held for 46 years. In 2004, the district gave Bush 75 percent of its votes.|$|R
50|$|By 1984 <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> dropped <b>the</b> {{call for}} {{elimination}} from its platform, {{and with the}} election of President George H. W. Bush the Republican position evolved in almost lockstep with that of the Democrats, with Goals 2000 a virtual joint effort.|$|R
5000|$|Even after Griffith's {{entry into}} the gubernatorial race, reports {{surfaced}} that <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> leadership <b>had</b> earlier approached former Democratic Governor Orval E. Faubus, who had lost to Pryor in the 1974 primary, about switching parties and running again for governor in the 1976 general election. The liberal Republican Ripon Society, which had supported former Republican Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, termed the suggestion, if true, [...] "an ignominious end to the reform heritage" [...] that <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> earlier championed in Arkansas. Faubus and Republican leaders denied that such talk ever even occurred.|$|R
50|$|Texas has had {{at least}} three congressional districts since 1869. The current seat dates from a mid-decade {{redistricting}} conducted before the 1966 elections after Texas's original 1960s map was thrown out by Wesberry v. Sanders. It {{is one of the}} most Republican districts in both Texas and the Metroplex. <b>The</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> held the seat since a 1968 special election. The district's current congressman, Sam Johnson, has held the seat since 1991.|$|E
50|$|The {{social conservatives}} {{of the party}} tend to support {{voluntary}} organized prayer in public schools and the inclusion of teaching creationism or intelligent design alongside evolution. Although <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> voted for increases in government funding of scientific research, many members actively oppose the federal funding of {{embryonic stem cell research}} because it involves the harvesting and destruction of human embryos (which many consider ethically equivalent to abortion), while supporting for applying research money into adult stem cell or amniotic stem cell research.|$|E
50|$|Like all of Northern Illinois, Champaign County was powerfully Republican {{between the}} Civil War and New Deal. It was not {{won by a}} Democrat between the Civil War and 1928, and only three times - all in {{landslide}} national victories - did it go Democratic between 1856 and 1988. Since then, the social conservatism and rural Southern orientation of <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> made Champaign County solidly Democratic: George Bush senior in 1988 was the last Republican to carry the county, and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 performance is the best ever by a Democrat.|$|E
25|$|Watson blamed {{his loss}} {{on the low}} turnout: 482,000. State Republican Chairman Raymond Harris {{predicted}} that Watson would have prevailed had the turnout been 550,000. Harris said <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> not repudiated African Americans but had to build the party according to its prevailing political philosophy.|$|R
50|$|Vermont {{historically}} was {{a bastion}} of liberal Northeastern Republicanism, and by 1972 the Green Mountain State had gone Republican in every presidential election since {{the founding of the}} Republican Party, except in the Democratic landslide of 1964, when <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> nominated staunch conservative Barry Goldwater.|$|R
5000|$|A May 2014 Kansas City Star article remarked {{about the}} Tea Party {{movement}} post-2012, [...] "Tea party candidates are often inexperienced and sometimes underfunded.

Some in <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>have</b> made that strategy explicit." ...|$|R
50|$|The OTI {{program is}} an initial step {{in support of}} the GOP's renewed efforts to better deliver {{services}} to communities. The GOP is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA in particular, demonstrating a renewed commitment toward the region by enhancing the role of the FATA Secretariat (FS) and attracting investment to the area through the FATA Development Authority. To begin bringing sustained and coordinated development to the region, the FS has produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP). <b>The</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> pledged $1 billion to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States.|$|E
50|$|In the 2008 November {{elections}} Republicans won {{the majority}} of the state House, winning 50 of the 99 seats, with the Democrats holding 49. This is the first time <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> had a majority in the Tennessee House since 1971, and the first time both House and Senate have had Republican majorities since Reconstruction. This ended Naifeh's long term as Speaker, but the Republicans' narrow majority in the House did not allow them to elect their preferred Speaker. While 49 Republicans voted for Jason Mumpower, the 49 Democrats and Republican Representative Kent Williams voted for Williams to succeed Naifeh as Speaker.|$|E
5000|$|Although Democrats often like to [...] "claim" [...] {{they still}} control the County Courthouses even that bastion has slipped away. As of March 1, 2016 of the 351 County Commissioners in Alabama's 67 counties, the {{partisan}} breakdown is 183 Republicans and 168 Democrats. Put another way 37 of those Courthouses have Republican majority County Commissions, 28 have Democratic majorities and 2 are evenly split. [...] Of Alabama's 67 elected county school boards, {{the breakdown of}} seats heading into the 2016 General Election is 201 Republicans and 172 Democrats. However, <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> a majority on 33 of those boards and the Democrats also have a majority on 33 with one remaining board being evenly split in Pike County.|$|E
50|$|Politically {{the county}} has been a swing area over the past quarter century, but over three {{of the last four}} {{elections}} has trended strongly Republican in Presidential elections (2008 being the exception; though <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> most votes it was by a much smaller margin than the previous 2004 election or the subsequent 2012 and 2016 elections).|$|R
50|$|In Pennsylvania, <b>the</b> <b>G.O.P.</b> {{was still}} {{firmly in the}} driver's seat, giving Senator Guffey a win over his opponent, while James H. Duff, won the {{governorship}} over John S. Rice, 1.828 million to 1.270 million. Further, the Democrats would be sending five congressmen to Washington from the keystone state, while <b>the</b> <b>G.O.P.</b> <b>had</b> 28. This {{would be the last}} election in which the Republicans would command such an overwhelming lead over the Democrats in Pennsylvania.|$|R
25|$|Roosevelt carried 46 of the 48 states {{thanks to}} {{traditional}} Democrats along with newly energized labor unions, city machines and the WPA. The realignment creating the Fifth Party System was firmly in place.

5000|$|Journalist Stephen Sabludowsky {{considers}} Villere {{a particularly}} effective state chairman, noting that <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> become a [...] "potent force {{in shaping the}} state.

When Roger Villere and the Louisiana Republican Party speak, the Louisiana Republican legislators and conservatives listen and vote almost in lockstep. ... Rarely do the Louisiana Republican legislators veer from the words and warnings of Roger Villere. ... Governor Bobby Jindal rarely speaks out publicly giving a stern warning or rebuke. In a sense, Jindal is often playing the 'good cop' and Villere the 'bad cop'[...] [...] [...] the formula appears to be working quite well.” ...|$|E

During the 2016 Presidential Election the Republicans also gained significant support in the Midwest. It has become more populist in its distrust of large corporations, and of state and federal governments.In a shift over a half-century, the party base has been transplanted from the industrial Northeast and urban centers to become rooted in the South and West, in towns and rural areas. In turn, Republicans are electing more populist, antitax and antigovernment conservatives who are less supportive—and even suspicious—of appeals from big business. Big business, many Republicans believe, is often complicit with big government on taxes, spending and even regulations, to protect industry tax breaks and subsidies—'corporate welfare,' in their view.|$|E
50|$|However, {{in spite}} of Eisenhower's {{intensive}} barnstorming in the campaign's waning weeks, the mild post-war recession was probably enough to cause <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> to lose eighteen House seats and two Senate seats, leaving the Democrats in control of both houses, 232 to 203 and 48 to 47, respectively. Until 1994, the Democrats would remain firmly in control of both houses of Congress, {{with the exception of}} 1981-1987, when <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> held a majority in the Senate.|$|R
25|$|As a {{minority}} party, <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> two wings: <b>The</b> left-wing supported {{most of the}} New Deal while promising to run it more efficiently and the right-wing opposed the New Deal {{from the beginning and}} managed to repeal large parts during the 1940s in cooperation with conservative Southern Democrats in the conservative coalition.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, Democrats in New York picked up three {{seats in the}} U.S. House of Representatives in 2008. In the 13th district, which {{consists}} of Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Democrats picked up an open seat that was vacated by former Republican Vito Fossella who resigned after {{he was arrested for}} getting a DUI. Democrat Michael McMahon solidly defeated Republican Robert Staniere by a two-to-one margin, 60.79-33.26%. His victory made the city's delegation entirely Democratic {{for the first time in}} over 70 years. In the 25th district, centered around Syracuse, Democrat Dan Maffei handily defeated Republican Dale Sweetland 55% to 42% for the open seat vacated by Republican Jim Walsh. In New York's 29th congressional district, which includes Canandaigua, Democrat Eric Massa narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Randy Kuhl by 1.7 points. This reduced the Republicans to only three of the state's 29 seats in the House—the fewest <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> ever won in an election. At the state level, Democrats picked up a seat in the New York State Assembly and two seats in the New York State Senate which gave Democrats control of the Senate and ultimately both chambers of the New York Legislature for the first time since 1965. This gave the Democrats complete control of New York's state government for the first time since 1936.|$|E
50|$|The 2nd District {{takes in}} {{nearly half of}} the state, geographically, and has long been the voice in Washington for largely rural Eastern Connecticut. The {{redistricting}} process maintained the approximate historical area of the district, despite state Democrats' hope to draw the Republican representative at the time, Rob Simmons, out of a seat by partitioning the area between the heavily Democratic districts centered on Hartford and New Haven. Since the 108th Congress, the 2nd District seeps into the eastern parts of Hartford county, reaching into the suburbs north of Hartford such as Suffield, as well as some towns to the capital's east, like Glastonbury which it shares with the 1st. The redistricting committee intended to more or less retain the partisan balance of the district, which heavily favored Democrats to begin with, and swapped Middletown for Enfield, similarly sized towns with similarly Democratic heritages. The demographics of the 2nd District vary widely, ranging from the liberal and culturally diverse population centers of New London, Norwich, and Windham, to the blue-collar towns of Enfield and Vernon, to the wealthy (and traditionally Republican) villages along the coast like Old Saybrook and Mystic where many millionaires from both Connecticut and New York maintain vacation homes. Statistically, Democrats dominate the 2nd district, although Republicans have recently fared well here in both congressional and statewide elections. New London, Norwich, and the students from the University of Connecticut in Storrs consistently vote for Democrats in overwhelming margins. Former Republican strongholds along the coast and in the wealthier Hartford suburbs have been trending Democratic recently as <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>has</b> become increasingly conservative and regional, although most voters here have little difficulty differentiating between the national party and local moderate Yankee Republicans. While the Democratic incumbent here has a convincing advantage on paper to ward off any potentially strong challengers, Republican candidates can be very competitive as long as the local passions aren't inflamed against the conservatives in Washington.|$|E
2500|$|Retiring State Republican Chairman Charlton Lyons, of Shreveport, the 1964 gubernatorial nominee, {{declared}} {{that he was not}} discouraged by Mrs. Parker's large victory over Allison Kolb. Lyons said that <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> [...] "just lost one scrimmage." [...] Lyons vowed that the Republicans would continue to be politically active until they established a two-party system in Louisiana. Kolb said that the [...] "voice of the loyal opposition has been heard" [...] and added that he thought a two-party format could produce checks and balances in state government.|$|R
50|$|In the 2016 presidential election, <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> a {{wide open}} field with {{numerous}} promising young candidates, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. An early contender was Jeb Bush, former Florida governor, {{son of former}} president George H. W. Bush, and brother of former president George W. Bush. The uninspiring Bush attracted little interest from an electorate tired of political dynasties, and {{he dropped out of}} the race early in the year. Ted Cruz enjoyed widespread popularity among conservatives, namely the Christian right.|$|R
5000|$|Rising {{unemployment}} rates {{and other economic}} indicators dominated the 1982 midterm elections, as the Republicans argued for voters to [...] "Stay the course" [...] by continuing Reagan's economic policies of lower taxes and holding down the growth of spending. Rollins was responsible for coordinating the White House's political operations and President Reagan's schedule with party committees, campaigns and candidates. In the November 1982 balloting, <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>had</b> a 26-seat loss in the House, but gained one seat in the Senate, averting a Democratic landslide.|$|R
