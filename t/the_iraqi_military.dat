5|$|After its {{deployment}} in the Korean War, {{the division}} {{was active in}} Europe and the United States during the Cold War, but saw relatively little combat until the Persian Gulf War, when it faced <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> A few years after that conflict, it was inactivated {{as part of the}} post-Cold War U.S. military drawdown of the 1990s. The division was reactivated in October 1999 as a formation for training and deploying U.S. Army National Guard units before its deactivation in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|The ADF {{currently}} has several forces deployed to the Middle East. The ADF's {{contribution to the}} Military intervention against ISIL makes up the largest overseas commitment with 780 personnel deployed as part of Operation Okra. As of November 2015, six F/A-18A Hornets, one E-7A Wedgetail and one KC-30A tanker were deployed to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. Approximately 380 personnel were deployed to Iraq {{as part of an}} international effort to provide training and other forms of assistance to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> Deployments in Afghanistan number 250 personnel in Operation Highroad, a non-combat training mission supporting the Afghan National Army. A frigate is also deployed to the Middle East in maritime security operations in and around the Gulf of Aden as part of the Combined Maritime Forces. Australian personnel also form part of peacekeeping missions in Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Sudan. The ADF has a further 400 personnel based in the Middle East to support operations in the region.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> quickly proved {{no match}} for {{coalition}} military power, and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn. While Australia did not initially {{take part in the}} post-war occupation of Iraq, an Australian Army light armoured battlegroup—designated the Al Muthanna Task Group and including 40 ASLAV light armoured vehicles and infantry—was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April 2005 as part of Operation Catalyst. The role of this force was to protect the Japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units. The AMTG later became the Overwatch Battle Group (West) (OBG(W)), following the hand back of Al Muthanna province to Iraqi control. Force levels peaked at 1,400 personnel in May 2007 including the OBG(W) in Southern Iraq, the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team—Iraq. A RAN frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf, while RAAF assets included C-130H Hercules and AP-3C elements. Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid-2009, while RAAF and RAN operations were redirected {{to other parts of the}} Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation Slipper.|$|E
50|$|Psychological Operations was {{extremely}} valuable during the Gulf War due to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> {{desire to avoid}} combat. Through leaflets and loudspeaker broadcasts, PSYOP forces walked many enemy soldiers through successful surrender.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} Operation Desert Storm, F-15E crews observing <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> {{massacre}} of Kurdish civilians at Chamchamal were forbidden from firing on the attackers, but instead used their lasers as a dazzler weapon. This ultimately proved ineffective in crashing any attack helicopters.|$|R
25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War, Khuzestan was {{the focus}} of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> {{invasion}} of Iran, leading to the flight of thousands of the province's residents. As a result, Khuzestan suffered the heaviest damage of all Iranian provinces during the war. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein felt confident that the Arab population of the Khuzestan would react enthusiastically to the prospect of union with Iraq. However, resistance to the invasion was fierce, stalling <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> advance, and ultimately opening a window of opportunity for an Iranian counter-offensive.|$|R
5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 2004, the NATO Training Mission - Iraq was {{established}} to assist <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military,</b> including the army. On September 20 the provisional Fallujah Brigade dissolved after being sent in to secure the city. The Fallujah Brigade experiment of using former insurgents to secure a city was not repeated.|$|E
25|$|Joost R. Hiltermann {{says that}} when <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> turned its {{chemical}} weapons on the Kurds during the war, killing approximately 5,000 people {{in the town of}} Halabja and injuring thousands more, the Reagan administration actually sought to obscure Iraqi leadership culpability by suggesting, inaccurately, that the Iranians may have carried out the attack.|$|E
50|$|Jordanians {{have donated}} 250 armored {{personnel}} carriers to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Ministry of Defense. The vehicles consisted of 50 Ukrainian-built BTR-94 {{armored personnel carriers}}, 100 British Spartans, and 100 American-made M113A1 armored personnel carriers. Jordan also donated two C-130B Hercules transport aircraft to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Air Force, as well as 16 UH-1H utility helicopters. Jordanians have helped train Iraqi security forces by hosting Iraqi police and border-enforcement training in Jordan. Outside the Jordanian capital of Amman, <b>the</b> first all-female <b>Iraqi</b> army <b>military</b> police company was formed and trained by female Jordanian military personnel. Royal Jordanian aircrews have trained some Iraqi air force pilots, and Jordanian noncommissioned officers helped train <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> NCO corps in various locations in Iraq.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the initial}} invasion, most of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> former {{soldiers}} and officers offered little resistance to Coalition {{forces in the}} early days of the occupation. Many soldiers had simply gone home rather than openly fight the invading forces. This seeming acceptance of Coalition authority stemmed from the US military continuing to pay the salaries of Saddam's former soldiers, while promising senior Iraqi officers that they would have a major role to play [...] "in building a new Iraq." ...|$|R
5000|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{including}} Al Jazeera and Channel 4 live streamed the first day's battle on Facebook, a first in war coverage. Additional live video feeds were available on YouTube and the streaming app Periscope. Iraqi and Kurdish officials are also joining in {{on social media}} using the hashtag #FreeMosul. Brendan Gauthier, assistant editor of Salon, noted that given ISIL's slick campaigns on social media, [...] "It's only appropriate then that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military’s</b> effort to reclaim Mosul from the PR machine turned extremist group be live-streamed." ...|$|R
25|$|While Palestinians {{generally}} {{believe in}} pan-Arabism, Arab nationalism and socialism (principles of the ALF), they have generally {{opted for the}} Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The invasion of Iraq toppled the Iraqi-dominated Ba'ath Party, headquartered in Baghdad. This weakened the movement and, since <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> coordinated much of the ALF's activities, the ALF has also been considerably weakened.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{personnel}} in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> {{before the war}} was uncertain, but it was {{believed to have been}} poorly equipped. The International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated the Iraqi armed forces to number 538,000 (Iraqi Army 375,000, Iraqi Navy 2,000, Iraqi Air Force 20,000 and air defense 17,000), the paramilitary Fedayeen Saddam 44,000, Republican Guard 80,000 and reserves 650,000.|$|E
25|$|Following the Persian Gulf War, {{to protect}} {{minority}} populations, the US, Britain, and France declared and maintained no-fly zones in {{northern and southern}} Iraq, which <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> frequently tested. The no-fly zones persisted until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although France withdrew from participation in patrolling the no-fly zones in 1996, citing a lack of humanitarian purpose for the operation.|$|E
50|$|Ghazi went to {{secondary}} school in Beirut and subsequently entered <b>the</b> Royal <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Military</b> College {{where he was}} in the same Company as his future sovereign, King Ghazi of Iraq. Later he was sent to Woolwich where he qualified at the Royal Military Academy in 1933, returning to the Royal Engineers in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army.|$|R
50|$|An ethnic Turkmen born in Tel Afar, Nineveh Province, al-Hiyali was an Iraqi Army Colonel under Saddam Hussein. According to {{documents}} discovered in Iraq, al-Hiyali was a lieutenant colonel in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> intelligence unit Istikhbarat (Directorate of General Military Intelligence), who also spent {{time as a}} Special Forces officer in the Special Republican Guard {{right up until the}} US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was decommissioned from <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> army after U.S. forces arrived, and joined Sunni insurgents to fight the Americans. Like other ISIL leaders, Abu Muslim Al Turkmani spent time in a US prison in Iraq, specifically Camp Bucca. He once practiced a moderate form of Islam.|$|R
2500|$|To {{what extent}} the United States fought a {{campaign}} of shock and awe is unclear as post-war assessments are contradictory. Within {{two weeks of the}} United States' victory declaration, on April 27, The Washington Post published an interview with <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> personnel detailing demoralization and lack of command. According to the soldiers, Coalition bombing was surprisingly widespread and had a severely demoralizing effect. When United States tanks passed through <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> Republican Guard and Special Republican Guard units outside Baghdad to Saddam's presidential palaces, it caused a shock to troops inside Baghdad. Iraqi soldiers said there was no organization intact by the time the United States entered Baghdad and that resistance crumbled under the presumption that [...] "it wasn't a war, it was suicide." ...|$|R
25|$|Inspectors withdrew in 1998, and disbanded the {{following}} year amid allegations that the United States had used the commission's resources to spy on <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> Weapons inspector Scott Ritter later stated that Operation Rockingham had cherry-picked evidence found by the United Nations Special Commission; evidence, he says, that was later used {{as part of the}} casus belli for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|ONW {{ended with}} {{the start of the}} Iraq War on March 19, 2003. ONW flew its last patrol on 17 March 2003, and closed a {{successful}} 12-year mission to contain <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> and inactivated 1 May 2003. The 39th ASEW was also inactivated, effective 1 May 2003. The wing was completely inactivated on 16 July 2003 and the 39th Air Base Group was activated in its place.|$|E
25|$|Shalikashvili {{achieved}} real distinction {{with his}} considerable success as {{the commander of}} Operation Provide Comfort, the peacekeeping and humanitarian activity in northern Iraq after the Gulf War. This assignment involved intense and complex negotiations with the Turkish government, and tough face-to-face meetings with <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> Another important achievement was {{the establishment of the}} Joint Vision 2010 program, which would transfer the United States military into one great and effective digitalized military force.|$|E
50|$|By this point, sources {{reported}} {{that a combination of}} desertions, casualties and loss of equipment crippled <b>the</b> regular <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military,</b> forcing <b>the</b> government to increasingly rely on volunteers drawn from Shia militias. Iraqi officials also conceded they had essentially given up on the north of the country to the insurgent forces.|$|R
25|$|On August 17, 2014, the Peshmerga and <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army {{launched}} a successful operation to retake {{control of the}} dam from ISIL militants. United States airstrikes assisted <b>the</b> Kurdish and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military,</b> damaging or destroying 19 vehicles belonging to ISIS, as well as striking an ISIL checkpoint near the dam.|$|R
50|$|Carroll {{took over}} The Guardians Baghdad bureau in January 2005. He covered the US occupation, suicide bombings, <b>the</b> {{formation}} of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> and police units, growing sectarian tension, {{and the death}} of several friends, including Marla Ruzicka.|$|R
25|$|About {{halfway through}} the war the CIA {{approached}} Mr. Arnett. They believed that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> was operating a high-level communication network from {{the basement of the}} Al Rashid Hotel, which is where Mr. Arnett and a few others from CNN were staying. The CIA wanted him out so the Air Force could bomb the hotel, but Mr. Arnett refused. He said he had been given a tour of the hotel and denied there was such a facility.|$|E
25|$|Arif {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} in 1966, in what may have been an act of {{sabotage}} by Ba'athist elements in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> Abd ar-Rahman al-Bazzaz became acting president for three days, and a power struggle for the presidency occurred. In the first meeting of the Defense Council and cabinet to elect a president, Al-Bazzaz needed a two-thirds majority to win the presidency. Al-Bazzaz was unsuccessful, and Abdul Rahman Arif was elected president. He was viewed by army officers as weaker and easier to manipulate than his brother.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{autonomy}} agreement collapsed in 1974, Kurds {{had been fighting}} an armed insurgency against Saddam's regime. After the Gulf War heavily damaged <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> and an uprising began in Southern Iraq, Jash (Kurdish militia used by Saddam Hussein's regime to fight Peshmerga) deserters, seized control {{of the city of}} Raniya with support of the local population. Many of the militia took sides with the Peshmerga. The revolutionary feeling spread to the rest of Kurdistan, where people took to the streets and Peshmerga entered the cities and seized control of Raniya, Chawar Qurna, Koi-Sanjaq, Sulaymaniya, Halabja, Arbat, Arbil, Duhuk, Zahku and Kirkuk.|$|E
50|$|After 1979 Revolution, the Iranian Defence Minister Mostafa Chamran {{established}} the Irregular Warfare Headquarters {{as part of}} the Iranian Armed Forces. He employed <b>the</b> force against <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> during <b>the</b> Iran-Iraq war. The unit was later disbanded.|$|R
50|$|Of the 100 mosques in the city, {{about 60}} {{were used as}} {{fighting}} positions by the insurgents. <b>The</b> U.S. and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> swept through all mosques used as fighting positions, destroying them, leading to great resentment from local residents.|$|R
25|$|From 1533 to 1918, Iraq {{was under}} the rule of the Ottoman Empire, and fought as part of the Military of the Ottoman Empire. After 1917, the United Kingdom took control of the country. <b>The</b> first <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> forces {{established}} by the British were the Iraq Levies, several battalions of troops tasked to guard the Royal Air Force (RAF) bases from which the British controlled Iraq.|$|R
25|$|The {{main body}} of {{coalition}} forces continued their drive {{into the heart of}} Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the period of military occupation.|$|E
25|$|The 1970 peace {{agreement}} {{did not last}} long, and in 1974, the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurdish rebels, pushing them close to the border with Iran. As in the First Iraqi-Kurdish War, the Kurds received material support from Iran and Israel. Israel regarded <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> as a possible threat in case of renewed fighting between Israel and Syria (during the 1973 War about one third of Iraq's army {{had been sent to}} fight against Israel on the Syrian front) and so wished to keep the Iraqis occupied elsewhere. Iran wished to strengthen its own political and military position vis-à-vis Iraq—the only other regional power in the Persian Gulf.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> blamed ISIL for {{the attack}} despite reports {{suggesting}} that its artillery may also have hit the neighborhood, saying that 61 bodies had been recovered {{at the site of}} a booby-trapped house which it described as “completely destroyed.” The statement added that “there is no hole or indication that was subjected to an air strike.” That account strongly contradicted much field reporting and the accounts of other officials. A provincial health official, for instance, told Reuters that wide swaths of the neighborhood were destroyed in fighting, “civil defense has extracted and buried 160 bodies up to this moment.” The Iraqi Civil Defense Department reported at least 137 bodies were recovered, but by 27 March, that number had risen to 531.|$|E
25|$|Ahmed Barzani {{was later}} {{forced to flee}} to Turkey, where he was held in {{detention}} and then sent to exile {{in the south of}} Iraq. Although initially a tribal dispute, the involvement of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government inadvertently led to the growth of Shaykh Ahmad and Mulla Mustafa Barzani as prominent Kurdish leaders. Throughout these early conflicts, the Barzanis consistently displayed their leadership and military prowess, providing steady opposition against <b>the</b> fledgling <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> It is speculated that exile in the major cities exposed the Barzanis to the ideas of urban Kurdish nationalism.|$|R
5000|$|Abdul Aziz Yamulki (21 December 1890 [...] - [...] 25 July 1981) {{was the son}} Mustafa Pasha Yamulki and an Ottoman {{military}} officer. After {{the fall}} of the Ottoman Empire he became a member of <b>the</b> new Royal <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> Aziz was born in Sulaymaniah.|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{after graduating}} from college, Lowy {{was hired by the}} Corbis photo agency and {{assigned}} to cover the Iraq war for Time magazine. He was 23 at the time.
