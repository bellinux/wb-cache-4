Earthquake resistant building design must be implemented in the design of a building. dynamic analysis is necessary to determine structure behavior.

40|$|The {{time varying}} {{forces in the}} ground generates {{earthquake}} loads and the pattern of load specified as a <b>time</b> <b>history</b> of ground excitation is the most accurate means of representing earthquake actions. The difficulty with carrying out analysis procedures to compute the responses of a structure {{for this type of}} load is that the form of the acceleration <b>time</b> <b>history</b> is to be clearly known. As there is lack of earthquake data for Dhaka, Bangladesh, which is in risk of attack by severe earthquakes, the engendering earthquake <b>time</b> <b>history</b> data of this region for precise dynamic analysis is of utmost importance. So, the objective of this research is to develop the reliable Dhaka earthquake <b>time</b> <b>history,</b> functioning as a competent seismic record. Seismic data have been measured in-situ with proper seismographic instruments at the recently occurred local earthquake near the Dhaka vicinity. Choosing the nearby seismic record, probable acceleration <b>time</b> <b>history</b> of Dhaka has been properly scaled as per the seismicity and ground acceleration characteristics of its own, following the widely accepted Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC). Generated EQ <b>time</b> <b>history</b> is then evaluated with the prominent seismic records available in literature.

40|$|Abstract â€” <b>Time</b> <b>history</b> {{analysis}} {{is an important}} technique for structural seismic analysis especially when the evaluated structural response is nonlinear. To perform such an analysis, a representative earthquake <b>time</b> <b>history</b> is required for a structure being evaluated. This research paper describes {{the results of an}} extensive study on the seismic behavior of structure under two earthquakes (Bhuj, & Koyna). In this work an attempt is made to analyze high rise structure with the help of E-tab software. This work has selected <b>Time</b> <b>History</b> Analysis method. For analysis purpose high rise structure with G+ 25 stories has been selected. <b>Time</b> <b>History</b> of earthquakes at two places (Bhuj, & Koyna) are used for analysis of selected high rise structure. Comparative study is made between two selected places without & with provision of visco-elastic damper.

50|$|The more {{classical}} {{approach of}} fatigue evaluation consists of cycle counting, using the rainflow algorithm and summation {{by means of}} the Palmgren-Miner linear damage hypothesis, that appropriately sums the damages of respective cycles. When the time history is not known, because the load is random (e.g. a car on a rough road or a wind driven turbine), those cycles can not be counted. Multiple <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> can be simulated for a given random process, but such procedure is cumbersome and computationally expensive.|$|E

50|$|The time {{frequency}} approach for machine fault diagnosis {{can be divided}} into two broad categories: linear methods and the quadratic methods. The difference is that linear transforms can be inverted to construct the time signal, thus, they are more suitable for signal processing, such as noise reduction and time-varying filtering. Although the quadratic method describes the energy distribution of a signal in the joint {{time frequency}} domain, which is useful for analysis, classification, and detection of signal features, phase information is lost in the quadratic time-frequency representation; also, the <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> cannot be reconstructed with this method.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{many other}} dating techniques, fission-track dating is uniquely suited for {{determining}} low-temperature thermal events using common accessory minerals over {{a very wide}} geological range (typically 0.1 Ma to 2000 Ma). Apatite, sphene, zircon, micas and volcanic glass typically contain enough uranium to be useful in dating samples of relatively young age (Mesozoic and Cenozoic) and are the materials most useful for this technique. Additionally low-uranium epidotes and garnets {{may be used for}} very old samples (Paleozoic to Precambrian). The fission-track dating technique is widely used in understanding the thermal evolution of the upper crust, especially in mountain belts. Fission tracks are preserved in a crystal when the ambient temperature of the rock falls below the annealing temperature. This annealing temperature varies from mineral to mineral and is the basis for determining low-temperature vs. <b>time</b> <b>histories.</b> While the details of closure temperatures are complicated, they are approximately 70 to 110 Â°C for typical apatite, c. 230 to 250 Â°C for zircon, and c. 300 Â°C for titanite.|$|E
5000|$|Frost was the NASA Project Scientist for the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) {{that was}} {{launched}} on 14 February 1980. In 1984, the project included the first recorded in-orbit repair using the Space Shuttle STS-41C. SMM continued to operate until re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on 2 December 1989. It included seven instruments specifically selected to provide coordinated observations of solar activity, particularly solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Frost was PI of the Hard X-Ray Burst Spectrometer (HXRBS) that measured the hard X-ray spectrum {{of thousands of}} solar flares with high time resolution. [...] HXRBS observations became widely used as the primary indicator of energetic electrons in solar flares. [...] Many scientists, including those outside the immediate PI team, used HXRBS X-ray <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> and spectra of the flares they were interested in. The observations confirmed the energetic importance of accelerated electrons in solar flares, and for a decade they became the standard measure of solar hard X-ray emission. The free access to HXRBS data greatly increased the influence and importance of this relatively simple spectrometer that was, in fact, the back-up unit from Frostâ€™s OSO-5 spectrometer flown some ten years earlier.|$|E

30|$|Since {{the results}} of the <b>time</b> <b>history</b> depend mainly on the {{characteristic}} of the used acceleration <b>time</b> <b>history</b> records and the shapes of their corresponding elastic response spectra (Kunnath and Kalkan 2004), the reason of using the inelastic TH method is to verify the results obtained by other code-specific analysis procedures (ESL and RS methods) against a <b>time</b> <b>history</b> record. Nonlinear <b>time</b> <b>history</b> analysis was performed taking into consideration the P-Î” and large displacements effect. A constant damping ratio of 0.05 has been taken for RC buildings. The inelastic <b>time</b> <b>history</b> analysis is performed using the direct integration technique considering a time step of 0.005 s. Nonlinear analysis could be used to justify a design that would not satisfy the prescriptive building code requirements. Story drifts and floor accelerations are important indicators of damage to nonstructural components and overall building performance. For nonlinear seismic analyses, a total seismic mass including self-weight and floor cover â€˜dead loadâ€™ (DL) plus 50 % of â€˜live loadâ€™ (LL) (1.0 DL + 0.5 LL) is considered (ASCE 2005).|$|R
40|$|Three sets of ten <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> each were {{developed}} to represent the ground motions {{for each of the}} three return periods.

This approach preserves the particular characteristics of the individual time history, together with the peaks and troughs of its response spectrum. These individual characteristics are modified in the spectrally matched <b>time</b> <b>histories,</b> resulting in a suite of ten <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> (for a given return period) that all have the same response spectrum for a given component (fault normal or fault parallel) that follows the smooth shape of the probabilistic response spectrum...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a need}} {{in certain}} {{structural}} dynamics finite element analysis problems to perform a response analysis in the time domain. This would be the case, for example, if the stiffness was non-linear. Loss-of-clearance or contact between two adjacent vibrating parts is another analysis example. Consider the case of base excitation {{in the form of}} a PSD. A <b>time</b> <b>history</b> can be readily synthesized to satisfy the PSD. The corresponding number of <b>time</b> <b>history</b> samples may overwhelm the finite element programâ€™s allowable array sizes or cause excessive processing time, however. Certain military and aerospace PSD specifications have an upper frequency of 2000 Hz. A synthesized <b>time</b> <b>history</b> should thus have a sample rate of 20 KHz, which is ten times the highest PSD frequency. The total number of <b>time</b> <b>history</b> points would be 1. 2 million if the specified duration was 60 seconds.

This would be the case for evaluating the resulting response with respect to yielding, ultimate stress limit, or relative displacement. A shorter duration <b>time</b> <b>history</b> can be synthesized to satisfy this need as presented in this paper. The abbreviated <b>time</b> <b>history</b> is derived using response spectra.

Slope {{dynamic factor}} of safety (FOS) under {{earthquake}} was calculated based on <b>time</b> <b>history</b> analysis method and compared with acceleration <b>time</b> <b>history</b> to analyze correspondence between them. In {{view of the fact}} that earthquake is a dynamic process, this paper proposed that three respects can be considered to analyze the slope stability rather than adopting a single FOS value. Firstly, the variation trend of the FOS <b>time</b> <b>history</b> can be combined with the forces on key points to analyze slope stability. Secondly, the displacement and stress vector fields can be adopted to evaluate the final slope stability. Thirdly, the variation trend of the displacement and velocity <b>time</b> <b>history</b> can be used as well.

30|$|Independent of the {{approach}} selected, either displacement or force-based, most of the seismic designs of civil structures are performed using variations of the response spectrum method, where the ground motion is represented as a design response spectrum that {{is representative of the}} seismic hazard on the site. The (pseudo-accelerations or relative displacements) design response spectrum is used to estimate the force or deformation demand imposed on the structure. The main goal of this technique is to translate the ground motion into forces acting on the building. Nevertheless, for some special tasks or structures, dynamic <b>time</b> <b>history</b> analyses are required. In the standard American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 7 â€“ 10, for example, if the structure meets the characteristics necessary to be considered as irregular, dynamic analyses (either modal response spectrum or <b>time</b> <b>history)</b> are required to verify the design of the structure. In the nuclear industry, dynamic <b>time</b> <b>history</b> analyses are required in the design, verification, and seismic assessment of critical buildings. In addition, they are needed for the development of floor (or in-structure) response spectra and free-field ground response spectra. When dynamic <b>time</b> <b>history</b> analyses are to be performed, the seismic input needs to be defined as a <b>time</b> <b>history</b> of accelerations. To comply with code requirements, the acceleration series used should be compatible with the design spectrum, i.e., the response spectrum of the acceleration <b>time</b> <b>history</b> should match with the design spectrum in average.|$|R
