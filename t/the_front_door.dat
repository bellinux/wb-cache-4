5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E

Plans for entering the embassy by battering <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
