25|$|Originally, Capita Group {{maintained}} the system under {{a five-year contract}} worth around £230m. Having been threatened with the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> by Ken Livingstone, then Mayor of London, for poor performance, when the zone was subsequently extended, Capita was awarded an extension to the original contract up until February 2009 to cover the expanded zone. Capita employed sub-contractors including India-based Mastek, who were responsible {{for much of the}} Information Technology infrastructure. Due to the wide spread of sub-contractors around the world and due to varying data protection regulations in different countries, the scheme had prompted concerns about privacy.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} he shared his homes, first in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, then in France, {{with his partner}} Anthony Forwood, who was the former husband of actress Glynis Johns {{and the father of}} their only child, actor Gareth Forwood. Bogarde {{repeatedly}} denied that their relationship was anything other than platonic. Such denials were understandable, mainly because male homosexual acts were criminal during most of his career, and could lead to prosecution and imprisonment. Rank Studio contracts included morality clauses, which provided for <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> in the event of 'immoral' conduct {{on the part of the}} actor. This would have included same-sex relationships, thus potentially putting the actor's career in jeopardy.|$|E

25|$|From 1955 to 1962, under {{contract}} to the International Cooperation Administration in Washington and the Vietnamese government in Saigon, faculty and staff from Michigan State University consulted for agencies of the Ngô Đình Diệm regime. The group advised and trained Vietnamese personnel in the disciplines of public administration, police administration, and economics. MSUG worked autonomously from most U.S. government agencies, had unmatched access to the presidency, and even assisted in writing the country's new constitution. Several of its proposals were undertaken by the Vietnamese government and had positive results {{for the people of}} Vietnam. However, the group had limited influence on Diệm's decision-making and on the course of events in Vietnam, and publications by dissatisfied faculty led to Diệm's <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b>|$|E
500|$|Hart {{announced}} on 17 July 2001 that the National Assembly had terminated the contract of RRP. She said {{that despite the}} <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> the debating chamber should still be built to RRP's design. RRP said of the project that [...] "From the outset, RRP has advised that the project could not be built within a construction budget of £13.1M due to client changes, the political requirement to use indigenous materials at any cost and exceptional contractor changes. RRP's advice was consistently ignored. It is plainly untrue for the Finance Minister to assert that RRP underestimated the costs." [...] Hart said she stopped the project because of the [...] "significant underestimates in the cost plan prepared by RRP", and that RRP [...] "had hidden costs from the Assembly".|$|E
2500|$|Adrian Baron {{has argued}} that the {{implication}} of a term of good faith runs contrary to basic principles of contract law, because it tends to disregard the reality that (at least in commercial contexts) parties to a contract [...] "pursue their own commercial interests, and enter into terms that reflect the risks and benefits that each party is prepared to bear". Baron argued that in 1990, when the parties entered the Development Agreement, [...] "it would have been plain to Hungry Jack's that if certain events occurred, Burger King could, at its option, terminate the agreement", and that the contract sufficiently identified the circumstances warranting <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> with the result that [...] "he appendage of a requirement of reasonableness and good faith by the court to the agreement was inconsistent with the bargain freely entered into by the parties." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{static test}} of the C-17 wing in October 1992 {{resulted}} in the wing failing at 128% of design limit load, which was below the 150% requirement. Both wings buckled rear {{to the front and}} failures occurred in stringers, spars and ribs. Some $100 million was spent to redesign the wing structure; the wing failed at 145% during a second test in September 1993. A careful review of the test data, however, showed that the wing was not loaded correctly and did indeed meet the requirement. [...] The C-17 received the [...] "Globemaster III" [...] name in early 1993.

This short article advances the discrete argument that in order to determine if <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breached <b>contract</b> is necessary for <b>the</b> recovery <b>of</b> damages, a practitioner’s enquiries could be more usefully focussed upon ascertaining whether the damages sought to be recovered are in respect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss arising from the breaching party’s unperformed obligations, rather than adopting <b>the</b> criteria <b>of</b> ‘expectation’, or ‘loss of bargain’, losses, or for anticipatory breach, as the case may be...|$|R
