5|$|After World War II many Polish sport clubs resumed slowly their activity. After the {{communist}} takeover {{of power in}} Czechoslovakia in February 1948 communists began to curb number of organizations {{in the country and}} tried to achieve the state of only several active nationwide organizations. Therefore, many Polish clubs after 1948 stopped their activity. The ones who still operated were subjected <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> pressure since 1951. Last independent Polish organizations were dissolved in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Although disbanded in 1919 {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, it was re-raised in 1921 in the Citizens Force (later known as the Militia) as a part-time infantry battalion based in Victoria. However, due to lack of funding {{following the}} Great Depression and a shortage of manpower following the suspension of the compulsory training scheme in 1929, the battalion was amalgamated with the 38th Battalion as the 7th/38th Battalion, although it was delinked again in 1936 when the Army was expanded due <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> tensions in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations the reform was neither popular nor productive.

5|$|In 1983, the Hong Kong dollar {{left its}} 16:1 peg with the Pound {{sterling}} and {{switched to the}} current US-HK Dollar peg. Hong Kong's competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined due <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> labour and property costs, {{as well as new}} development in southern China under the Open Door Policy introduced in 1978 which opened up China to foreign business. Nevertheless, towards the early 1990s, Hong Kong had established itself as a global financial centre along with London and New York City, a regional hub for logistics and freight, one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia and the world's exemplar of Laissez-faire market policy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} of rapid {{economic}} growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed {{by the government and}} industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.|$|E
5|$|September 15, 2003- Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Henri produce heavy rainfall over portions of Delaware, including a peak of 9.02inches (229mm) in Hockessin. The flooding damages hundreds of houses, and traps motorists in submerged vehicles. Several bridges are destroyed or damaged due <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> flood waters, including the Red Clay Creek which peaks at 17.27feet (5.2m). Damage totals $16.1million (2003USD, $18.9million 2008USD). Due to the damage, President George W. Bush declares the state a disaster area.|$|E

5|$|September 28, 2004- The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Jeanne, combined with two cold fronts, produce heavy rainfall peaking at 8.01inches (203mm) in Newark. The precipitation leads <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> rivers, including the Red Clay Creek which crests at 13.59feet (4.14m) The rainfall also floods {{roads in the}} northern portion of the state, resulting in trapped vehicles. The {{remnants of}} Jeanne also spawn an F2 tornado in northern New Castle County. The tornado's 5mile (8km) path includes moving through the New Castle Airport and several buildings. The tornado damages numerous planes and buildings {{at the airport and}} injures five people. Damage totals to around $1million (2004USD).|$|E
5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} {{policy is}} {{to hold the line}} only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat as the solution <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences.

The castle grounds, including the remains of St Nicholas College, two sections of castle wall and the motte hill, are now open to the public. An archaeological research project run by Leicester University conducted a sequence of excavations between 2002 and 2010, aiming to better understand the historical transition from the Anglo-Saxon town of Wallingford and the burgh, to the period of the Norman castle.|$|E
5|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Delhi was {{the most}} {{polluted}} {{city in the world}} in 2014. In 2016 WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database. According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people in Delhi every year. During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) in Delhi increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states. Delhi has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms. Rising air pollution level has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women. The dense smog in Delhi during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year. According to Indian meteorologists, the average maximum temperature in Delhi during winters has declined notably since 1998 due <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> air pollution.|$|E
5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is particularly vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> sea levels. In addition, the {{land on which}} it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E

5|$|But {{the real}} reason was that the {{production}} had financial issues, with the acquisition of new crew members {{and the increase in}} popularity of Doctor Leonard McCoy meaning that those salaries needed {{to come out of the}} original budget. In Justman and Herb Solow's 1996 book Inside Star Trek, they stated that following a discussion between Roddenberry, Solow and Bernie Weitzman in which they discussed her contract, they decided to terminate it because of Whitney's limited appearances and the financial issues that the series was having. The decision was attributed elsewhere in David Alexander's 1995 authorized biography of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek Creator, which said that during the first batch of episodes, casting director Joseph D'Agosta reviewed the contracts for the main actors due <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> costs.|$|E
5|$|Construction was of crossed wooden poles, {{driven into}} the {{waterlogged}} soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used {{for a period of}} only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original in Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response <b>to</b> <b>rising</b> concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
