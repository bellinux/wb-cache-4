Williams worked to keep all sides <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another.

500|$|After infiltrating the station's secure wing, Adam discovers {{a massive}} {{detention}} camp {{with hundreds of}} detainees. After <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the prisoners, Nina Sullivan, and overhearing a conversation between Burke {{and two of the}} scientists, Gary Savage and Tiffany Kavanagh, he confirms that innocents are kidnapped across the globe to further the Illuminati research that Jensen is investigating, and that the experiments prove fatal to the majority of subjects. With Burke's spare retinal prosthesis, and Quinn's technical expertise, Adam is able to gain access to a concealed elevator that takes him to a massive undersea research facility. He confronts Kavanagh who, already having misgivings about the inhumane nature of the research, agrees to turn informant. Burke discovers Keitner's mutiny, and she is killed by his soldiers. Burke then initiates [...] "Code Yellow": pumping toxic gas into both the detention camp and the research facility to eliminate any witnesses. Adam can either redirect the gas to save either Kavanagh or the prisoners, find and sabotage the gas distributor to save everyone, or simply do nothing and allow both parties to be killed.|$|E

[...] In his dungeon, Mulder is given a sharp object by other prisoner, who had built it to commit suicide. When all the prisoners are taken out and are arranged in a line, Mulder sees Krycek <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the captors and runs toward them, tackling them. Mulder then steals a truck and flees with a unconscious Krycek in the back of it; a pursuit by his captors ensues. As Mulder drives the truck, Krycek awakes and jumps off it. Mulder, having been unable to stop it, runs it off the road and it crashes. Mulder quickly makes {{his way out of the}} truck and hides under the dry leaves, while Krycek is found by a group of men whose left arms have all been amputated and has his arm forcibly severed to prevent his involvements in black oil vaccination tests.|$|E

500|$|The {{issue of}} trust was {{difficult}} to overcome. [...] Wooden Leg himself relates {{the attitudes of the}} Cheyenne at a peace feast organised to commemorate the 30th anniversary (1906) of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. [...] In the presence of many United States soldiers, the Cheyenne were questioned about the battle. [...] They answered with extreme caution; many facts, particularly regarding the deaths of US soldiers, were avoided. [...] Despite the long passage of time since the battle, they feared that they were being trapped into incriminating admissions. [...] They also chose not to reveal that they believed that many soldiers had died through suicide or at the hands of their comrades, as they knew this issue had made soldiers angry in the past. [...] They left most of the <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> boastful Indian, Two Moons, who gave a colourful—but entirely inaccurate—account. [...] The others elected not to contradict him since this allowed them to remain silent. [...] Marquis slowly broke down the barriers and eventually persuaded all the Cheyenne survivors he was in contact with, not just Wooden Leg, to open up to him.|$|E
500|$|One {{day in the}} mid-1990s, Smith was at {{her home}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of her {{daughter}}s on the phone. After telling her mother {{what she was going}} to that night, her daughter asked Smith what her plans for that night were. Because she did not have anything fun planned, Smith lied so her daughter wouldn't have to worry about her. After the conversation ended, Smith realized that she didn't need her own children worrying about her at the start of their adult lives and decided that it was time to return to her career. With country artist Marty Stuart (whom she later married in 1997), acting as the album's main producer, Smith signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996. Although the label preferred her to record an album of duets, Smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album. In October 1998 she released her second self-titled studio album. Consisting of ten tracks, nine of them were co-written by both Smith and Stuart. Although the album attracted little attention, it was given high critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style. Kurt Wolff of the book Country Music: The Rough Guide commented that the album sounded [...] "far gutsier than anything in the Reba and Garth mainstream". Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the release four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a solid effort", also commenting, [...] "...it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff that's come out of Nash Vegas in over a decade. Even if it doesn't sell a copy, it's a triumphant return for Smith. She hasn't lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer." ...|$|E
