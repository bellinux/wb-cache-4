40|$|TES is {{a traffic}} {{modelling}} methodology that aims at reproducing a given stationary time series with simultaneous respect to its marginal distribution, its autocorrelation {{structure and the}} shape of its plot. Whereas the first two requirements can be satisfied sufficiently, {{it is not possible}} to receive modelled <b>traffic</b> <b>curves</b> resembling the appearance of given complex periodic structures by using the standard TES method. Therefore, the concept of non-standard stitching functions is proposed which allows to enforce model results resembling any desired shape in an elegant way. The main advantages of TES, especially the fact that the resulting autocorrelation functions may be calculated analytically instead of being estimated from a simulation run, remains valid. Thus, the proposed extension improves the TES methodology without touching its qualities. ...|$|E

30|$|In Figure 5, from 5 : 00 to 17 : 00, {{the same}} {{variation}} trend of blocking probability {{can be observed}} about the proposed algorithms, {{and it is not}} monotonous with the traffic variation. The average blocking probability is around 1 %, which can satisfy the blocking probability constrain of general communication service. It can be observed that from 5 : 00 to 10 : 00, the blocking probability is decreasing with the incremental traffic, and the rationale can be explained as follows. When the traffic increases from the trough to the moderate intensity, more PBSs need to be active to provide service; thus, the resource is sufficient to serve the UEs, and the probability that an UE cannot find an appropriate BS to serve is relatively small. Therefore, the overall blocking probability is decreasing. But when the traffic continues to increase to the peak, the blocking probability is increasing contrarily even with more active PBSs. This is due to that the interference among UEs is becoming significant with more UEs served in the network, which results in decreasing the UEs’ spectrum efficiency and makes BSs provide more RBs to UEs to satisfy their rate requirement. However, the frequency resource is limited, some newly arriving UEs needing more RBs can be blocked, and the increasing active PBSs cannot compensate the decreasing QoS of the network due to the decreasing UEs’ spectrum efficiency. Hence, the blocking probability is increasing with the <b>traffic</b> <b>curve</b> until the peak. The explanation to the variation trend of the other two periods is the same as above owing to the symmetrical variation of the sinusoidal-like <b>traffic</b> <b>curve.</b> Moreover, the average blocking probability during the peak traffic is lower than that during low traffic due to the densification of active PBSs, which provides sufficient network capacity. However, during low traffic, some UEs enter the macrocells’ edge where no PBS exists cannot obtain the minimum service rate, and thus become easily blocked.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we will {{establish}} a duality be-tween maximum delay and maximum backlog {{in a single}} queue network. Min-plus algebra will be employed to devise the duality. In min-plus algebra, the maximum backlog {{is represented by the}} scalar projection of ac-cumulated input <b>traffic</b> <b>curve</b> onto accumulated output <b>traffic</b> <b>curve.</b> We will define the adjoint operator of a nondecreasing function and show that the maximum de-lay can be represented as the scalar projection of the adjoint of accumulated output traffic onto the adjoint of accumulated input traffic. Based on this observation, we will draw a duality between the maximum backlog and the maximum delay. We will also define the left- and the right-seminorms of a nondecreasing function and will use it to introduce the concept of a “matched ” queue. A matched queue is a queue in which the accumulated input and output curves are adjoint. In a matched queue, the maximum delay and the maximum backlog are identical and are equal to the left-norm of input process. I. introduction Worst-case quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning {{has been the focus of}} recent research in high-speed network-ing [1] — [7]. QoS is usually indicated by performance measures such as delay, delay jitter, traffic loss, back-log, minimum bandwidth and so on. The QoS parame-ters can be studied in average-case and/or in worst-case paradigms. In the average-case analysis of QoS parame-ters, the input traffic is usually modelled by a canonical probability distribution function and the behaviour of network is measured in terms of the percentiles of the QoS parameters. In the worst-case approach, the QoS parameters are usually quantified in the extreme case in which the input traffic is greedy and resource allo-cation is parsimonious. In fact, the worst-case analysis quantifies the maximum deviation from the normal net-work operation. In this approach, the maximum value of QoS parameters are studied. In this paper, we study maximum delay and max-imum backlog as the two indices of network perfor-mance. For simplicity, the whole network is modelled as a single queue [1] [3].

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{describe}} and analyze resource scheduling solutions for energy efficiency in LTE and LTE-Advanced networks. We start by presenting SimuLTE, a simulator for LTE and LTE-Advanced networks, based on OMNeT++ and developed in C++. It includes {{all the relevant}} protocol layers of the LTE stack, a realistic channel model and offers scheduling capabilities. We then we start analyzing energy efficient solutions at various levels of the LTE network architecture. As a first step {{we focus on the}} user level: we describe the Discontinuous Reception (DRX) mechanism, that allows the central base station of an LTE cell to configure User Equipments for periodic wake/sleep cycles, so as to save energy. We investigate how to configure the parameters that defines DRX behavior and we explore the trade-off between energy saving and per-user QoS. We perform extensive simulations using realistic traffic models (i. e. VoIP, VoD, HTTP, YouTube-like) and factorial analysis for statistical soundness. We show that the above trade-off can be fine-tuned and that using less aggressive DRX settings prevent QoS degradation as the load increases. The second step is performed at cell level: we propose a dynamic algorithm for interference coordination of base stations in heterogeneous networks. In such networks each cell has at least one macro node (i. e. a high power base station) and may have micro nodes (i. e. low power base stations). The LTE standard allows the macro node to define subframes as Almost Blank Subframes (ABS), where it may only transmit at low power, thus significantly reducing the interference suffered by micro nodes. ABS are arranged in patterns, configured by the macro node and notified to the micro. We propose an algorithm for dynamic selection of the ABS pattern, based on the instantaneous traffic request of both macro and micro nodes, and focused on energy efficiency. Our experimental results shows that this solution leads to a significant reduction of consumed energy at low loads, and better QoS performances at higher loads. Finally we consider a whole network, i. e. a large set of adjacent heterogeneous cells controlled by the same operator. We present a framework to decide the activation and deactivation of micro nodes, based on load and energy efficiency considerations. Our framework relies on historical data (i. e. per-cell load curves) to select a set of candidate switch-on/switch-off instants, assuming a limited number of transitions is allowed in a day. The actual switching instants are detected online, by considering the traffic requests in each cell. We perform simulations with real-life <b>traffic</b> <b>curves</b> taken operator data. Our results show that this solution allows the network to cope with peak-hour traffic requests, and to reconfigure to a minimum coverage configuration whenever possible, thus saving energy (between 10 and 25 % in our scenarios) ...|$|E

40|$|Route {{planning}} {{forms an}} important aspect of airline operations for them to sustain the effects of deregulation and fierce competition. The Indian economic liberalization in 1991 has seen diminishing monopoly of Air India and dynamic demand splits amongst the service providers. Our research focuses on developing an aggregate route traffic demand forecasting (RTDF) model specifically for international carriers operating from India. The model is an econometric model that combines concepts of the traditional Gravity model of Physics and the Micro-economic theoretic model that links demand to price. In other words, the RTDF model is a fusion of the behavioral and gravity models. While developing the model, Becker’s approach of utility maximization has been made use of, thereby combining time and other inputs required to produce travel. The model is developed for the existing international routes from India with 2005 aggregative data provided by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which spanned 15 countries in Europe, Asia, Canada, and North America. The model has been validated and tested for its predictive power on a few intentionally left out routes from the original sample. The model explains about 70 % of the variance, which is well above the acceptable zone for cross-sectional data. The model is then estimated for 2007 data on a few randomly selected high demand routes; the prediction error ranging from a minimum of 3. 5 % to a maximum of 13 %, a range well within the acceptable error limits. We derive a sector-cost-model (SCM) by applying the concept of break-even analysis on the RTDF model. The SCM provides cost estimates on a particular route at various levels of airfare. The SCM helps us gain further insights into the business nature prevailing in the airline sector. On the viability of operations, we propose the sector-operation-fare (SOF) to be charged on a respective route, given the load factor, if the airline wishes to continue operations. For arriving at the SOF, we follow a demand oriented framework that comprises of two demand curves: the airline <b>curve</b> and the <b>traffic</b> <b>curve.</b> The numerical analyses provide room for policy formulations that help airlines in refining, redefining, and revitalizing the decision-making process in their operations.
