5000|$|The {{traditional}} 1/1000 s and 1/2000 s top {{speeds of}} {{horizontal and vertical}} FP shutters are on the knife's edge of mechanical controllability - often ¼ stop too slow, even in ultra-high-quality models. Spring powered geartrains become inadequate to durably control and reliably time any higher accelerations and shocks. For example, some highly tensioned FP shutters could suffer from [...] "shutter curtain bounce." [...] This phenomenon is exactly {{what it sounds like}} - if the curtains are not properly braked after crossing the film gate, they might crash and bounce; reopening the shutter and causing double exposure ghosting bands on the image edge. Even the Nikon F2's ultra-high precision shutter suffered from this as an early production <b>teething</b> <b>problem.</b> As the Square-type FP shutter's blades moved faster and faster to provide shorter and shorter shutter speeds, the need for better blade timing control only increased.|$|E
50|$|A Shiba Inu {{that had}} been {{purchased}} at Woofles by {{an old man who}} died of old age a mere week later. Having lost her new owner, she was adopted by Kim and named after the tiles she mixed up during a game of mahjong that Kim was playing with Suguri. Chanta has something of a <b>teething</b> <b>problem,</b> chewing up Kim's special guitar pick and a band aid on his face given to Kim by Suguri. Shortly after being taken home, Chanta nearly died from electrocution when she chewed on a power cord. Luckily, Chanta was able to be revived by Kim with some emergency coaching in dog CPR by Teppei over the phone. She's a very diverse dog and she greatly loves Kim. She was humped by Melon in Volume 4 of the manga but did not become pregnant since she was too young to have puppies. Kim has plans to breed her with Lupin, his goal being to see her brightest smile ever.|$|E
50|$|The E.626 {{series was}} built in 448 units and three series, each with only slight electro-mechanic differences: unadvanced but reliable, it {{subsequently}} constituted the mainstay of the new FS lines at 3,000 V DC, which gradually spread to the whole peninsula. The firsts tests occurred on the Foggia-Benevento line in the September 1927, using three prototypes built at Savigliano, with the electric part provided by the Metropolitan-Vickers of Manchester. The first 14 prototypes (eight E.625 with shorter gear ratio, for cargo services, and six E.626) proved powerful and reliable, and entered service the following year. The only <b>teething</b> <b>problem</b> encountered was with the six 32R motors mounting on the axles, hanging laterally over transverse beams, a system devised to avoid the complicate side rods of the contemporary steam and three-phase locomotives: {{after a series of}} breakdowns, it was decided to limit the speed to 95 km/h. Traction control was provided by three different configurations of the motors' coupling (series, series-parallel, parallel) through banks of resistor-based rheostats. The transmission was rather noisy, but at the time the crew's comfort was not an important issue. The carbody was in a single steel piece, mounting on an articulated chassis. The large bonnets at the front limited the visibility of the rails, and were reduced in size from the 3rd series.|$|E

40|$|This work is {{a further}} attempt at trying to proffer {{solution}} to the <b>teething</b> <b>problem</b> of high cost and quality fish feed for the aquaculture industry in Nigeria. Here fermented wheat bran was used to replace fish meat at four graduated levels – 15 %, 30 %, 45 % and 60 % respectively. 0 % substitution remained as the control. These trials feed where tested on the African mud catfish, Clarias gariepinus fingerlings for 56 days. Parameters evaluated include nutritional value, digestibility, and body composition of the fish. The {{results indicated that the}} 30 % fishmeal substitution diet (FWB 2) showed superior performance in terms of the parameters used for nutritional value such as mean weight gain (2. 92 g) specific growth rate (7. 42 cm); percentage weight gain PWG (84. 5) and Nitrogen metabolism (903. 48) {{at the end of the}} experiment. However, the body composition indicated a high fat level and lowest fibre content compared to other treatments. The ADC values take the following trend; FWBo (95. 65) >FWB 3 (94. 83) > FWB 2 (94. 55) > FWB 1 (92. 76) > FWB 4 (85. 63). Further investigation is neede...|$|E
40|$|When object {{databases}} {{arrived on}} the scene some ten years ago, they provided database capabilities for previously neglected, complex applications, such as CAD, but were burdened with one inherent <b>teething</b> <b>problem,</b> poor performance. Physical database design is one tool that can provide performance improvements and it is the general area of concern for this thesis. Clustering is one fruitful design technique which can provide improvements in performance. However, clustering in object databases has not been explored in depth and so has not been truly exploited. Further, clustering, although a physical concern, can be determined from the logical model. The object model is richer than previous models, notably the relational model, and so it is anticipated that the opportunities with respect to clustering are greater. This thesis provides a thorough analysis of object clustering strategies with a view to highlighting any links between the object logical and physical model and improving performance. This is achieved by considering all possible types of object logical model construct and the implementation of those constructs in terms of theoretical clusterings strategies to produce actual clustering arrangements. This analysis results in a greater understanding of object clustering strategies, aiding designers in the development process and providing some valuable rules of thumb to support the design process...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To reveal mothers’ {{beliefs about}} signs and {{symptoms}} associated with teething and their treatment practices. Population and methods: A cross-sectional study done in Mansoura District on 457 mothers and their children {{with one or more}} erupted teeth. Mothers were interviewed during vaccination session at 25 chosen health facilities. Mothers were asked whether they agree or disagree about 24 {{signs and symptoms}} claimed to be associated with teething. Results: Only 1. 8 % reported no symptoms at the time of teething. Majority had correct knowledge related to bite fingers/objects (70. 5 %) and drooling (60. 0 %). Inaccurate knowledge was reported as gum rubbing (42. 0 %), gum swelling (47. 0 %), diarrhea (51. 0 %), fever (83. 2 %) and weight loss (46. 0 %). Only 16. 8 % of mothers have good knowledge about <b>teething</b> <b>problems.</b> Logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent predictors of good knowledge are higher education (AOR =  3. 7), urban residence (AOR =  2. 5) and having a first-born child (AOR =  5. 5). Only 13. 4 % of mothers did not give any treatment for <b>teething</b> <b>problems.</b> Antipyretics and antibiotics were the most frequently given treatments (71. 3 %, and 24. 3 %; respectively). Conclusions: The majorities of mothers had low knowledge about <b>teething</b> <b>problems</b> and gave unnecessary treatments...|$|R

50|$|The TR-85 {{tank was}} soon {{found to be}} {{mechanically}} unreliable. <b>Teething</b> <b>problems</b> included high fuel and oil consumption, engine and transmission problems and chronic oil leakage. Furthermore, the Ciclop fire control system was unreliable because of the poor quality of electronics. The laser rangefinder was not integrated with the daylight aiming system and {{only a limited number}} of corrections could be inserted in the ballistic fire-control computer. Problems were made worse when Nicolae Ceaușescu decided to cancel in July 1982 all imports of special equipment for the arms industry. At one point, Ceaușescu threatened to stop tank production altogether because of the poor manufacturing quality. The initial <b>teething</b> <b>problems</b> were not corrected until after the fall of communism in Romania when the Romanian engineers used foreign parts to improve TR-85's reliability.|$|R
