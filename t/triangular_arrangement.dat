5|$|The new <b>triangular</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{between the}} Southern Song, Jin, and Western Xia {{continued}} {{the age of}} division and conflict in China. The region of Huainan (between the Yangzi and Huai rivers) became a new borderland and battleground between Song and Jin from 1128 to 1141, displacing {{hundreds of thousands of}} families who had lived there for generations. The Southern Song deployed several military commanders, among them Yue Fei and Han Shizhong, to resist the Jin as well as recapture territory, which proved successful at times. Yue Fei in particular had been preparing to recapture Kaifeng (or Bianjing as the city was known during the Song period), the former capital of the Song dynasty and the then southern capital of the Jin, after a streak of uninterrupted military victories.|$|E

This was essentially a large mechanical calculator that directly represented the wind triangle using three long pieces of metal in a <b>triangular</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The hypotenuse of the triangle was the line the aircraft needed to fly along in order to arrive over the target {{in the presence of}} wind, which, before the CSBS, was an intractable problem. Almost all air forces adopted some variation of the CSBS as their standard inter-war bomb sight, including the US Navy and US Army, who used a version designed by Georges Estoppey, the D-series.|$|E
25|$|The muqarnas {{dome type}} may have {{originated}} in Abbasid Iraq as single brick shells of large squinch-like cells, {{but it was}} popular in North Africa and Spain with more intricate cell patterns in stucco on a wooden inner shell. Two outstanding examples from the Moorish palace of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, are the 14th century Hall of the Abencerrajes and Hall of the two Sisters. In 14th century Egypt, the Mamluks began building stone domes, rather than brick, for the tombs of sultans and emirs and would construct hundreds of them {{over the next two}} and a half centuries. Externally, their supporting structures are distinguished by chamfered or stepped angles and round windows in a <b>triangular</b> <b>arrangement.</b> A variety of shapes for the dome itself were used, including bulbous, ogee, and keel-shaped, and included carved patterns in spirals, zigzags, and floral designs. Bulbous minarets from Egypt spread to Syria in the 15th century and would influence the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of northwest Europe, having become associated with the Holy Land by pilgrims. In the Low Countries of northwest Europe, multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the sixteenth century.|$|E

It is shown that a conventional DOA estimation for the equilateral <b>triangular</b> microphone <b>arrangement</b> is a special case of the proposed method. Sensitivity to the relative time-delay is derived in a closed form and demonstrated for different microphone arrangements.

40|$|AbstractWe {{provide a}} link between topological graph theory and pseudoline {{arrangements}} from the theory of oriented matroids. We investigate and generalize a function f that assigns to each simple pseudoline arrangement with an even number of elements a pair of complete-graph embeddings on a surface. Each element of the pair keeps the information of the oriented matroid we started with. We call a simple pseudoline <b>arrangement</b> <b>triangular,</b> when the cells in the cell decomposition of the projective plane are 2 -colorable and when one color class of cells consists of triangles only. Precisely for <b>triangular</b> pseudoline <b>arrangements,</b> one element of the image pair of f is a triangular complete-graph embedding on a surface. We obtain all triangular complete-graph embeddings on surfaces this way, when we extend the definition of <b>triangular</b> complete pseudoline <b>arrangements</b> in a natural way to that of <b>triangular</b> curve <b>arrangements</b> on surfaces in which each pair of curves has a point in common where they cross. Thus Ringel's results on the triangular complete-graph embeddings {{can be interpreted as}} results on curve arrangements on surfaces. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between 2 -colorable curve arrangements and Petrie dual maps. A data structure, called intersection pattern is provided for the study of curve arrangements on surfaces. Finally we show that an orientable surface of genus g admits a complete curve arrangement with at most 2 g+ 1 curves in contrast to the non-orientable surface where the number of curves is not bounded...|$|R

40|$|Plasmonic dark modes {{are pure}} {{near-field}} modes that can {{arise from the}} plasmon hybridization {{in a set of}} interacting nanoparticles. When compared to bright modes, dark modes have longer lifetimes due to their lack of a net dipole moment, making them attractive for a number of applications. We demonstrate the excitation and optical detection of a collective dark plasmonic mode from individual plasmonic trimers. The trimers consist of <b>triangular</b> <b>arrangements</b> of gold nanorods, and due to this symmetry, the lowest-energy dark plasmonic mode can interact with radially polarized light. The experimental data presented confirm the excitation of this mode, and its assignment is supported with an electrostatic approximation wherein these dark modes are described in terms of plasmon hybridization. The strong confinement of energy in these modes and their associated near fields hold great promise for achieving strong coupling to single photon emitters...|$|R
40|$|With {{an array}} of {{collocated}} force actuators and velocity sensors, decentralised feedback controllers can not only be unconditionally stable, but their performance in reducing vibration and radiated sound can approach that of a centralised LQG controller [1]. They also have a modular architecture that can be scaled, even for very large structures. This paper discusses the use of either piezoelectric or proof-mass transducers, instead of ideal force actuators, in such decentralised controllers. Piezoceramic actuators can give significant control in thinner structures, but as well as controlling out-of-plane vibration they also create in-plane motion in the structure that can couple into closely located strain sensors causing instability in feedback controllers. Novel <b>triangular</b> <b>arrangements</b> of such transducers will be described in which the effect of in-plane coupling is minimised, thus significantly improving their performance. Proof-mass actuators are attractive when generating significant forces at low frequencies, but their natural frequency must be well below the first structural resonance frequency for stable operation...|$|R

40|$|We derive {{a general}} theory of {{effective}} properties in metasolids based on phononic crystals with low frequency resonances. We demonstrate that in general these structures need to be described {{by means of a}} frequency-dependent and non-local anisotropic mass density, stiffness tensor and a third- rank coupling tensor, which shows that they behave like a non-local Willis medium. The effect of non-locality and coupling tensor manifest themselves for some particular resonances whereas they become negligible for other resonances. Considering the example of a two-dimensional phononic crystal, consisting of <b>triangular</b> <b>arrangements</b> of cylindrical shells in an elastic matrix, we show that its mass density tensor is strongly resonant and anisotropic presenting both positive and negative divergent values, while becoming scalar in the quasi-static limit. Moreover, it is found that the negative value of transverse component of the mass density is induced by a dipolar resonance, while that of the vertical component is induced by a monopolar one. Finally, the dispersion relation obtained by the effective parameters of the crystal is compared with the band structure, showing a good agreement for the low-wave number region, although the non-local effects are important given the existence of some resonant values of the wave number...|$|R

We investigated {{the contribution of}} various visual cues to grouping processes that might determine whether single or multiple objects. were perceived and therefore which type of spatial coding {{would be used for}} a stimulus. Methods: We asked three patients to make shape judgments with a series of displays showing <b>triangular</b> <b>arrangements,</b> moving from more implicit triangles defined by separate objects at the apices (between-object spatial coding) to more explicit triangles with line edges or surface texture (within-object spatial coding). Results: In two patients with prosopagnosia, within-object spatial judgments were impaired;, whereas between-object spatial judgments were normal. In a patient with Balint syndrome, the reverse pattern was obtained. Surface texture but not'outline closure led to mandatory within-object coding in the prosopagnosic patients, where as outline or surface texture Wag sufficient to support intact within-object spatial judgments in the patient with Balint syndrome. Illusory contours were ineffective in promoting Within-object coding in either condition. Conclusions: These findings support the existence of parallel representations of space for within-object and between-object processing and reveal the efficacy of different cues in deter-mining which representation is potentially accessible...|$|R
