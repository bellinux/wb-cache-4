After publishing specifications in 1949 and 1961 of EOCI 61, CMAA’s Engineering Committee continued to propose specifications of CMAA 70, CMAA 74, CMAA 78, the last of which are Standards and Guidelines for Professional Services Performed on Overhead and <b>Travelling</b> <b>Cranes</b> and Associated Hoisting Equipment. Re-released in 2003, CMAA engineering committee published the <b>Crane</b> <b>Operators</b> Manual, as well as the Operational Guide for Lifting Devices in 2006.

40|$|The {{information}} on job strain among <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> in Malaysia is lacking. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the prevalence and contributing factors of job strain among <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> working in port container terminals. A cross sectional study was carried out at a port container terminal in Malaysia. Data was collected using validated self-administered questionnaires, which consisted of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS- 21). All <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> in the selected terminal participated in the study. Data was analyzed using SSPS version 19. Two-hundred-and-forty <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> participated in the study [...] The prevalence of job strain determined from the JCQ was 43. 8 %. Job strain was significantly associated with psychological job demand, decision latitude, anxiety, physical isometric loads and muscle ache. The prevalence of job strain in this study was high. There is an urgent need to recognize the existence of this problem among <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> by their respective management. Implementation of comprehensive stress management programs are recommended to reduce job strain among these workers...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{investigated the}} current inadequate holistic training practices given to tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> which significantly impact {{health and safety}} in Gauteng, South African construction projects. The primary motivation for conducting the research was due to tower crane related accidents, fatalities and related project delays which have become endemic in the construction industry. These occurrences have not been researched {{from the perspective of}} the basic training given to tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> in the SA construction industry. The study sought to examine the current structure and characteristics of the training programmes used in developing the skills of tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators.</b> This included exploring the current barriers and the effectiveness experienced in the training programmes given to tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators.</b> The study also sought to find the major improvements or restructuring that is still needed in skills development and training of tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> from the perspective of tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators.</b> It consisted of a sample of 25 tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> trained in various skills development programmes used in the South African construction industry. The research also included interviews from 9 site foremen and managers who manage the operations of tower cranes during construction project delivery, who also provided key data in relation to the training practices of tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> from the manner in which their contractors conduct them. The study found several major factors contributing to inadequate holistic training of tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> related to the following: the manner in which the current training programmes were structured in terms of theoretical and practical training; lack of effectiveness of the training programmes in terms of safety, communication, rigging and hoisting and the important knowledge of tower crane operations; inefficiency of tower cranes in terms of the technological aspects that relate to giving a clearer site view of the environment in which lifting and unloading of construction materials was conducted; inadequately trained banksman or signalers and lack of training in general personalities needed in operating tower cranes as the main contributing factors. These major factors that the study found to contribute to tower crane related accidents need to be addressed if the continuing accidents and fatalities are to be significantly reduced in Gauteng, South African construction projects during project delivery and execution...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{amount of}} cargo transported by container vessels require port terminals to have efficient cargo handling. A port terminal needs to be efficient {{in order to attract}} and keep customers, hence the productivity in the terminal is important. Loading and discharging operations on container vessels are performed with cranes and the working pace of the cranes are referred to as crane productivity. This thesis investigates what factors a <b>crane</b> <b>operator</b> experiences as difficult and time consuming during cargo operations. The results are that obstructed view are considered as the major issue. The <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> need to operate behind stacks of containers on board, referred to as Manhattan Stowage. <b>Crane</b> <b>operators</b> consider this as a factor lowering the crane productivity. This is strengthened by the vessel planners who agree and according to them, this issue can be dealt with by taking this into consideration when making the stowage plan at the shipping line. If <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> can work with unobstructed view, the crane productivity would increase and loading Layer-by-Layer would be an alternative. However, the interviewed shipping line argued that doing so will have negative consequences as a result which makes it not likely to implement. Alternative solutions could be to leave an empty row behind the stack to help the <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> since they agree on leaving an empty row would give them better conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{serious problem}} in <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> maintenance, crane {{supporting}} beams and other carrying elements of material handling facilities in foundry shops is phenomenon of permanent deformations. There are known many ways to eliminate these deformations like mechanical compression by tension members however a disadvantage of such methods is work consuming process of railways rectification. One of technological methods relies on application of shrinkage of compression plates welded with box girder. Regeneration {{with the use of}} such method can be executed for the <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> box girders but also with <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> support beams that have permanent deformations in both vertical or horizontal planes.

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of crane {{accidents}} is human failure. Many crane accidents could be avoided by a specific safety training for <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> that exposes the users to specific hazardous situations. Intention of the presented research project is the composition of a safety training program for <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> as well as the development and realisation of the according Virtual Reality (VR) crane simulator. The VR simulation of a ground controlled gantry <b>crane</b> allows the <b>operator</b> to train safety behaviour schemes at wide range of different realistic hazardous situations, while neither persons nor goods nor machinery get compromised. Investigations based on this project show that the developed VR crane simulator is suitable for a behaviour training in specific hazardous situations. The acquired experiences can be transferred and applied into practice. The experiences in a virtual training environment lead to an increased awareness of hazardous factors as well as a more rule compliant behaviour. Safety training at the VR crane simulator augments the existing training program VDI 2194 for crane operation and {{turns out to be a}} surplus for job training of <b>crane</b> <b>operators...</b>|$|R
