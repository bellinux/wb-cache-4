5|$|The only studio recording, made in New York by Nonesuch {{two months}} after <b>the</b> <b>Oct.</b> 1987 Houston premiere, used the same cast, just a {{different}} chorus, orchestra and conductor: Edo de Waart led the Chorus and Orchestra of St. Luke's. Gramophone’s Good DVD Guide praised the singing, noting James Maddalena’s “aptly volatile Nixon” and Trudy Ellen Craney’s admirable delivery of Chiang Ch’ing’s coloratura passages. This recording also received the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Composition in the Classical category. It was reissued in 2011 {{to coincide with the}} opera’s production at the Metropolitan Opera. The Denver live recording on Naxos has Marin Alsop conducting the Colorado Symphony Orchestra and Opera Colorado Chorus, with Robert Orth as Nixon, Maria Kanyova as Pat Nixon, Thomas Hammons as Kissinger, Chen-Ye Yuan as Chou En-Lai, Marc Heller as Mao Tse-Tung and Tracy Dahl as Chiang Ch’ing. Sumi Jo and June Anderson star as the two wives in the Paris video.|$|E

40|$|The Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) {{are located}} in more or less remote {{geographical}} regions all over the world. Despite being located outside the Union´s European borders, <b>the</b> <b>OCTs</b> themselves and <b>the</b> four Member States {{to which they are}} linked (Denmark, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) often point to the strategic importance of <b>the</b> <b>OCTs</b> as <b>the</b> ´ultimate frontiers of Europe´or the ´outposts of the EU´. Strikingly though, the strategic value of <b>the</b> <b>OCTs</b> as <b>the</b> Union´s outposts and the potential risks they pose to the EU are not reflected in the European Security Strategy of 2003 and its review of 2008. From the inside looking out - which is the perspective adopted in this chapter - this raises two main questions. Firstly, what is the actual strategic importance of <b>the</b> <b>OCTs</b> for <b>the</b> EU as a whole? Secondly,what kind of responsibilities do <b>the</b> <b>OCTs</b> - and <b>the</b> Member States to which they belong -have vis-a-vis the Union in {{the development and implementation of}} the Common Foreign and Security Policy towards the regions in which they are located, and indeed towards the rest of the world? While brief remarks on the former will not be shunned, this contribution to the legal debate will focus mainly on the second question. Special attention will be paid to the duty of loyal cooperation resting upon <b>the</b> <b>OCTs</b> and Member States according to which they have to align their positions and actions in the foreign and security policy field with the CFSP. To that end, this contribution will expose the national legal frameworks in which certain OCTs have been empowered to develop their own external relations and draw parallels with subnational entities of federal Member States that conduct their own foreign affairs. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Oct</b> 2017 Law changes {{removed the}} need for {{repetition}} before calling a No ball for dangerous or unfair short-pitched bowling (bouncers), set the limit for beamers in all cricket at waist height, regardless of delivery speed, and treat a deliberate front foot No ball as 'dangerous or unfair,' with immediate sanctions as for a deliberate beamer. There will only be a first and final warning for throwing. There is now an explicit penalty for underarm bowling. Interception of the ball by a fielder before it reaches the batsman became an explicit No Ball. Bye and Leg bye extras are now be scored as such, rather than as No ball extras.|$|E
