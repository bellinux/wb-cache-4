Results: <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> motion in depth perception produced by DO were similar for cyclopean and non-cyclopean targets over the entire 0. 25 – 8 Hz frequency range investigated. <b>Thresholds</b> <b>for</b> perceiving motion in depth produced by SO were considerably (up to 2. 5 times) higher for cyclopean targets than for monocularly-visible targets, as were <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> perceiving size oscillations.

5|$|For {{southern}} sea otters to {{be considered}} for removal from threatened species listing, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined that the population should exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years. In response to recovery efforts, the population climbed steadily from the mid-20th century through the early 2000s, then remained relatively flat from 2005–2014 at just under 3,000. There was some contraction from the northern (now Pigeon Point) and southern limits of the sea otter's range during the end of this period, circumstantially related to an increase in lethal shark bites, raising concerns that the population had reached a plateau. However, the population increased markedly from 2015–2016, with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) California sea otter survey 3-year average reaching 3,272 in 2016, the first time it exceeded the <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> delisting from the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Assuming the population maintains positive trends, ESA delisting is inevitable, although southern sea otters would still be fully protected by state regulations and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which sets a higher <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> protection, subjectively at about 8,400 individuals.|$|E

5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E

5|$|After development, Dora was steered {{towards the}} {{northwest}} by a ridge over the Southwestern United States. Situated {{in an area}} of favorable atmospheric conditions and warm sea surface temperatures, the tropical cyclone quickly strengthened, developing an intermittent eye before being classified as a hurricane at 1800UTC on July19. At the time, the storm was roughly 245mi (400km) south-southwest of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon reaching hurricane status, Dora began an episode of rapid intensification as its inner structure became more well-defined and its eye more permanent. At the same time, mesovorticies within the eye—often indicators of intense tropical cyclones—were noted on satellite imagery. By 1800UTC on July20, Dora had attained the <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> major hurricane status. After acquiring some characteristics of an annular hurricane early on July21, Dora reached its peak intensity at 1200UTC that day with a minimum barometric pressure of 929mbar (hPa; 27.43inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 155mph (250km/h), making it a high-end Category4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E

40|$|Vernier acuity {{is a form}} of hyperacuity {{in which}} the {{threshold}} offset between a test object and a reference object is smaller than the size of a foveal cone. Because the test and the reference objects usually have regular shapes (e. g. rectangular, triangular or circular), relatively few studies have addressed the role of shape information in determining hyperacuity thresholds. In this study, we investigated the effect of shape information on hyperacuity performance using targets of irregular shape with different skew and symmetry properties. Vernier thresholds smaller than 10 arc-sec were obtained for closely spaced asymmetric irregular-shape targets. <b>Thresholds</b> <b>for</b> dots and asymmetric irregular shapes increased with increase in center-to-center gap between the targets. Unlike dots, the <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> asymmetric irregular shapes also increased with target area. Although the <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> asymmetric irregular shapes were higher than those <b>for</b> dots, <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> symmetric irregular shapes were similar.

5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E

However, some controversy occurred with the establishment of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty (ITS) due to its ideology; the members of the group were far-right, so there were concerns about public funds going towards such a group.
