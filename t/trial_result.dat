50|$|Patients {{who become}} lost to {{follow-up}} during a clinical research <b>trial</b> <b>result</b> in many negative effects {{on the outcome of}} the trial and on the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the clinical research trial. Patients who are lost-to-follow-up lead to incomplete study results, which in turn can put a bias on the result of the study as well as a bias on the investigational study medication. A lack of complete results leads to intensified FDA scrutiny of the particular study drug, as well as the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the clinical research study. Biased study outcomes also lead to issues of HIPAA standards and compliance.|$|E

Around a year later, she withdrew her appeal {{as part of a}} settlement with Spelling and Goldberg for $1,000. Emmet later filed a legal malpractice action against her own lawyers in which it was argued that she would have won her original lawsuit but for the malpractice. The case went to trial and a jury awarded her $1.7 million in damages. The verdict was then successfully appealed based on the resumption of the suit having occurred beyond a one-year limitation period allowed in the law.

40|$|A {{relevant}} {{problem in}} meta-analysis concerns the possible heterogeneity between trial results. If {{a test of}} heterogeneity is not significant the trials are often considered to be "homogeneous" and the individual trial results are replaced by an overall mean effect size and its confidence interval ("equal effects model"). If the trials are heterogeneous the individual trial effect sizes are conserved ("fixed effects model"). In a more flexible approach ("random effects model"), each trial makes use of knowledge from the other trials so individual effect sizes are "shrunken" towards an overall mean effect size. The more flexible tool may be useful for doctors involved in a trial when the outcome of their individual trial differs markedly from the overall mean effect size. Where a particular <b>trial</b> <b>result</b> is opposite in direction to the overall mean result, a conflict may arise: should a new patient be treated with the new method or not? The more flexible position and a graphical comparison of the three approaches {{are likely to be}} helpful in guiding the decision.

40|$|Objective: In {{an effort}} to {{understand}} how results of human clinical trials are made public, we analyze a large set of clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, the world’s largest clinical trial registry. Materials and Methods: We considered two <b>trial</b> <b>result</b> artifacts: (1) existence of a <b>trial</b> <b>result</b> journal article that is formally linked to a registered trial or (2) the deposition of a trial’s basic summary results within the registry. Results: The study sample consisted of 8907 completed, interventional, phase 2 -or-higher clinical trials that were completed in 2006 - 2009. The majority of trials (72. 2 %) had no structured trial-article link present. A total of 2367 trials (26. 6 %) deposited basic summary results within the registry. Of those, 969 trials (10. 9 %) were classified as trials with extended results and 1398 trials (15. 7 %) were classified as trials with only required basic results. The majority of the trials (54. 8 %) had no evidence of results, based on either linked result articles or basic summary results (silent trials), while a minimal number (9. 2 %) report results through both registry deposition and publication. Discussion: Our study analyzes the body of linked knowledge around clinical trials (which we {{refer to as the}} “trialome”). Our results show that most trials do not report results and, for those that do, there is minimal overlap in the types of reporting. We identify several mechanisms by which the linkages between trials and their published results can be increased...|$|E
