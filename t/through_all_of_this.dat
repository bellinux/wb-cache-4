500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

50|$|There {{is a lot}} of speculation, {{because the}} writers of the show weren’t always paying {{attention}} to things like time, space and distances, but broadly speaking we can see BSG as a surprisingly constrained show, spanning just a few thousand light-years rather than implausibly trying to take in the entire galaxy like some shows do. Something that does come <b>through</b> in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is how utterly vast space is and how even a tiny proportion of the galaxy (Galactica traverses approximately 3% of the width of the galaxy in its journey) is unfathomably huge.|$|R
2500|$|The album's opener, [...] "Doll", {{involves}} {{the fear of}} entering into situations unprepared. [...] "Wind Up" [...] was written {{about the relationship between}} musicians and journalists, wherein the latter tend to paint the former as convicted and reluctant. [...] "My Hero" [...] criticizes idolatry and instead extolls friends who are ordinary heroes, which has been considered a statement on fame and partially inspired by former bandmate Kurt Cobain. On the record's closing track, [...] "New Way Home," [...] Grohl longs for his hometown and recalls the drive there on Highway 99. Through this journey, [...] "I realise that it’s OK, I can make my way <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> and I’m not that freaked out at the end." [...] Three types of songs permeate the record: ballads, up-tempo tracks and combinations of the two. Grohl felt they were representative of the specific emotions he would feel after the divorce.|$|E

[...] Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly one morning with a chair and spent the day, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students. [...] Elements of free speech activism still exist at FSU today. [...] The Center for Participant Education was established in 1970 [...] as an alternative to traditional university academics. [...] Its purpose is to allow students to [...] "explore socially relevant topics and to foster a healthier philosophy of education through classes in which anyone could teach or attend. Since then, CPE has been investigated by the Legislature, suspended by the Board of Regents, and challenged by FSU administration.

Jackson later commented, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident" [...] when the statement was replayed in the media. A written statement read, [...] "The decision to have a costume reveal {{at the end of my}} halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand." [...] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, [...] "Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{three main}} components: firstly, close readings and critical analyses of four major poetical works by W. H. Auden—“The Watershed”, The Sea and the Mirror, “New Year Letter”, and “In Time of War”; secondly, ten semi-informal letters addressed to W. H. Auden; and thirdly, a serial poem consisting of {{short and long}} poems based on the speeches of the public figure, Barack Obama. The thesis proposes a creative writing discipline founded on the productive and intensive exchange between reading and writing poetry, and reflection through letter writing. The chapters of critical analysis argue the following: firstly, that through his idiosyncratic handling of syntax and voice in poems like “The Watershed”, Auden introduced a new element of the uncanny into English poetry; secondly, that in The Sea and the Mirror, Auden re-evaluated his poetics and altered his poetic voice {{in response to a}} new reading public; thirdly, that in the “New Year Letter,” Auden uses tone to expand the range of his poetic voice; and fourthly, that in the sonnet sequence “In Time of War”, Auden uses parable to combine lyric and narrative elements in order to universalise the Sino-Japanese War. Some of the issues raised in the chapters of critical analysis, such as poetic truth, poetic voice, the lyric subject, and parabolic writing, are elaborated on in the letters to W. H. Auden. Finally, the Serial Poem presents 74 short and long poems produced using appropriative writing procedures. The idea that runs <b>through</b> <b>all</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>this</b> thesis is that speech, voice, and parable are crucial elements in the poetic practice of W. H. Auden, and that close attention to these three elements <b>through</b> <b>all</b> stages <b>of</b> <b>this</b> project— critical reading and writing, letter writing, and creative writing—has contributed {{to the development of a}} rich and productive poetic writing practice...|$|R

Moreover, the fruit of his work merited legal protection <b>through</b> copyrights. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> points to a conception of the designer as a self-determined individual with a particular style.
