500|$|Copland {{conducted}} Connotations in 1966, 1967 and 1968 {{around the}} United States. This included an engagement at the Musica Viva series in San Francisco and concerts with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington D.C. and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. [...] "I {{spoke to the}} audiences," [...] Copland writes, [...] "with humorous accounts of the work's adverse effect on droves of letter writers, who had heard the original performance, in person or on TV. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the brass section to illustrate the opening chords, and the strings how they sounded. Before they knew it, the audience was sympathetic. My purpose was not to sell the work but to demonstrate it." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 12, 2005, Milla Jovovich was {{announced}} to reprise {{her role as}} the heroine Alice. In an interview with BlackFilm.com on September 9, 2005, Mike Epps confirmed {{that he would be}} reprising his role from [...] as L.J. Wayne, noting that [...] "Black people die in these movies and [...] was like, 'Well Mike, I kinda like you.' So <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him, 'Are you setting me up to die because if there's a fourth movie, I'm as good as dead.'" [...] Sienna Guillory was planned to reprise her role as Jill Valentine; however, she passed on the role, citing commitments to Eragon. On May 9, 2006, Oded Fehr was confirmed to reprise his role of Carlos Olivera, as well as Iain Glen, Spencer Locke and Ashanti Douglas who were added to the cast. It was rumored that Debra Marshall was originally cast as Cindy Lennox. However, it was proven to be only a rumor. Chris Redfield was rumored to appear in the film portrayed by Australian actor Charlie Clausen and Leon S. Kennedy was also rumored to be played by Jensen Ackles.|$|E
2500|$|While at a {{cocktail}} party, Dziubinska met the actor Sir John Mills. She is quoted as saying, 'I adored Hayley, so I went over {{to talk to him}} about my favourite film of all time, Whistle Down The Wind, which I've seen four million times. I said to him that I was an actress and that I'd been acting since I was at school and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him if he had any advice, and he said, 'do everything you're offered, because everything you do will give you some experience!' The first thing I was offered the next day was Vampyres!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 7. Hath that Christ {{that was}} with God the Father {{before the world}} was, no other body but his church? If you say no, as it is your wonted course; <b>then</b> again <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you, what that was in which he did bear the sins of his children? If you answer, It was 'in his own body on the tree,' for so saith the scripture (1 Peter 2:24). <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you further, whether that body in which he did bear our sins, (which is also called his own body) was, or is, the church of God, yea, or no? Again if you say he hath no body but the church, the saints, <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> what that was that was taken down from the cross, and laid into Joseph's sepulchre (Luke 23:53).|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Winters, if my {{refusal to}} sign such a paper {{as you have}} demanded must entail upon me all that your {{language}} in this room fairly implies, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> a few minutes for prayer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you mean," [...] said she, [...] "that it {{will cause}} me sorrow and humiliation to free my {{grandfather}} from suspicion, and that he refuses to speak because he fears the truth will hurt me, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to speak out, Mr. O'Gorman." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for a Supplementary Option, {{to cover}} the world, and we parted.|$|E
60|$|Providential! Jolly! Well, it's {{fortunate}} that some people's madness takes a cheerful turn. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the Kalubi where the god was.|$|E
60|$|What an inhuman old murderer! I thought. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him whether}} he had ever in his life felt remorse for {{shedding}} blood.|$|E
6000|$|Query 7. My seventh query was, [...] "Hath that Christ {{that was}} with God the Father {{before the world}} was, no other body but his church?" [...] If you say No, as it is your wonted course; <b>then</b> again <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you, [...] "what was that in which he did bear our sins, was, or is, the church of god, yea, or no?" [...] Again, if you say he hath no other body but his church, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> What that was that was taken down from the cross? But here thou puttest a stop {{to the rest of}} my words, with an &c.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What happens <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask!</b> What happens? Why, I {{find myself}} at the very period when I might shine most in society, and should most like for very momentous reasons to shine in society--I find myself in a {{situation}} which {{to a certain extent}} disqualifies me for going into society. It's too bad, really!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To me it seemeth, Don Christopher, {{that it will}} be time {{to reason}} thus, when our casks are drained, and the last biscuit is broken. Until <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> leave of your Excellency to apply the {{necessary}} logic to the outside of the heads of these varlets, instead of their insides, of which I much question the capacity to hold any good." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Charmian privily if she'd {{really care}} to do it, {{and she said}} that it was too good to be true.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} I {{walked up and down}} the room; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked,</b> [...] "How did Mother Anastasia come to be the Mother Superior?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, she's amazing--she's amazing," [...] I repeated; [...] "but so are you." [...] And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{her what}} she had said to my boy.|$|E
6000|$|Possibly you {{consider}} those acts {{too small for}} notice. Would you venture to so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against the humblest of our people? I know you would not. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> is the precept [...] "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" [...] obsolete? of no force? of no application? ...|$|R
6000|$|Now, <b>I</b> would <b>ask</b> {{very special}} {{attention}} to the consideration of Judge Douglas's speech at Jacksonville; and when you shall read his speech of to-day, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to watch closely and see which of these pieces of testimony, every one of which he says is a forgery, he has shown to be such. Not one of them has he shown to be a forgery. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> the original question, if each of the pieces of testimony is true, how {{is it possible that the}} whole is a falsehood? ...|$|R
50|$|When I lecture {{about this}} issue, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> this question: Who would shrink from {{introducing}} a living fly into a spider's web {{to get a}} shot of the spider feeding on the fly. Usually no one objects to that. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> carry the same question through the animal kingdom, up to using a monkey as a bait for a boa constrictor. Not many people like that too much. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> - supposing of course that adequate provisions were made for his family - how would you feel about feeding a human to a crocodile? Crocodiles do feed on humans, you know, so it would be scientifically correct (original emphasis).|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{about his}} home in Maryland; of his journey to the Ohio River, and, finally, how he felt while bound to the stake.|$|E
6000|$|Then, I said I {{supposed}} {{he had a}} fine business, and Wemmick said, [...] "Ca-pi-tal!" [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> if there were many clerks? to which he replied,-- ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{looked at}} the newspaper. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the landlady for a cigarette, not knowing how else to begin. So she came to my table, and we talked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cocksbones, man, only hold thy tongue, and thou shall {{know all}} about it,--and <b>then</b> all <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> of thee is to shake hands and part.--This Margaret Ramsay,--you have seen her, man?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "He who {{draws the}} {{conclusion}} that I mentally medicate a human who has broken his leg is very true - but I adjust the fracture and dress the wound. And <b>then</b> - <b>I</b> give him a massage, make exercises with him, give a daily bath to the leg with water at 45 Â°C {{for half an hour}} and I take care that he does neither gorge nor booze, and every now and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> him: Why did you break your leg, you yourself ?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Maggie waited--her glimmer had deepened; {{her chance}} somehow was at hand. The only danger was her spoiling it; {{she felt herself}} {{skirting}} an abyss. [...] "What <b>then,</b> may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> IS your plan?" ...|$|R
60|$|The ticket {{was soon}} in my possession, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the ticket seller {{a number of}} {{questions}} concerning the route and the time I would reach my destination.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will repeat}} it, <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> what had so {{suddenly}} determined {{you to give}} up all idea of making any future experiments on the superstitious fears of Count Fabio?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him what}} he was going to do about Footsack and the bottle of gin, which he countered by asking me what I was going to do with that diamond.|$|E
60|$|How <b>then?</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask.</b> So--let {{them say}} {{it if they}} will. Let all that great cloud of {{witnesses}} compass me about, lads and maidens, children and infants, whose bones cumber the churchyards yonder in Dunchester. I defy them, for it is done and cannot be undone. Yet, in their company are two whose eyes I dread to meet: Jane, my daughter, whose life was sacrificed through me, and Ernest Merchison, her lover, who went to seek her in the tomb.|$|R
6000|$|... "My hand grows {{weaker and}} weaker: I can write no more. Let me close this letter by entreating your pardon. If you ever grant it me, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> also <b>ask</b> your prayers." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to clarify her answer, she {{proposed}} a shell game [...] to illustrate: [...] "You look away, and I put a pea under one of three shells. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to {{put your finger on}} a shell. The odds that your choice contains a pea are , agreed? <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> simply lift up an empty shell from the remaining other two. As I can (and will) do this regardless of what you've chosen, we've learned nothing to allow us to revise the odds on the shell under your finger." [...] She also proposed a similar simulation with three playing cards.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her if {{she liked}} to hear stories; this also puzzled her, and after some cross-questioning I {{discovered}} {{that she had never}} heard a story, and did not know what it meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} that there were {{probably}} cards on board somewhere--Jorgenson would know. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him whether he looked on me as a gaoler. He was quite startled and sorry for what he said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cow-catcher," [...] I {{suggested}} eagerly, and {{we continued}} in this ecstatic duet for some time. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him {{what it was}} all about, and he told me. He explained the thing eloquently and at length.|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't grip {{on to my}} arm like a fish-eagle on a trout! I {{went back}} to the major, <b>then,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him when he was in Paris to pass by the archbishop's door." ...|$|R
40|$|The new {{document}} of the Pontifical Biblical Commission âThe Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scriptureâ elaborates on {{the truth in}} the Bible, also {{in the context of}} historical problems that emerge form biblical text. The consensus of modern historians and archaeologists is moving towards separating biblical history and history as a science. In this article I present contemporary discussion on this issue, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> how the {{document of}} Pontifical Biblical Commission treats this issue. At the end I suggest directions for further work of biblical scholars...|$|R
6000|$|DON JUAN. <b>Then</b> may <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> Commander, why {{you have}} left Heaven {{to come here and}} wallow, as you express it, in sentimental beatitudes which you confess would once have driven you to cut your throat? ...|$|R
