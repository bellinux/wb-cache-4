[...] During this time, {{he picked up the}} nickname 'pork chops' because it [...] "was the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to order off the menu."

In the book Along Came Mary: A Bad Girl Creek Novel (by writer Jo-Ann Mapson of the original bestseller Bad Girl Creek), character Mary Madigan details the extent of the impact that the Tad and Dixie love story has had on the people in her life: [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> for sure, unless Mama had gotten a job, she was home, because it was time for All My Children. Both MayAnn and Mama had a king-size investment in Tad and Dixie's marriage, the one union on earth they considered unbreakable. It was the source of most of their bickering." ...|$|E

I kept on dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until I ran out of sky and had to hedge hop over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [...] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn't know what I was doing myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure out what I was going to do".|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Miller {{worried that}} lawyers for The Simpsons {{would try to}} stop him from {{performing}} the play. At the 2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the cast members of the television series were performing a special reading of dialog that featured their characters. When the producers found out that Miller was also at the festival, they invited him to a cast party. There he met The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, who had previously seen a video of MacHomer. According to Miller, [...] "next <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> Matt Groening was shaking my hand, was giving me his blessing and was telling me he'd do all he could to help me continue my show. It's the best situation I could have dreamed of. No one is suing me, or asking for royalties, either." ...|$|E

2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E

Next <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't. That hardens you: You get used {{to the fact that it}} can happen. And that it is the only sensible thing to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruddock {{went back}} to Japan in 1966 {{specifically}} to learn Aikido, travelling six weeks by sea. He first saw Ueshiba about four days after he started regular training. [...] "He was {{the real reason for}} my Aikido pilgrimage to Japan. I had read quite a bit about this miraculous old man and having seen the pictures – I wanted the real <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what he did was special and wanted to be like that too – but I did not feel the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eden Riegel {{was cast}} in 2000 as Bianca Montgomery, the lesbian {{daughter}} of Erica Kane. Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series Imaginary Bitches, fans let her know how much they wanted {{her back on the}} show. [...] "I definitely wanted to fulfill that desire if I could," [...] she said. Riegel then let the show know she was willing to come back. [...] " [...] next <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I got a call and they said, 'Okay, we've got something for you,'" [...] she said. The story the All My Children writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun. Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. [...] "It was the storyline that got me excited," [...] she said. [...] "I always want to come back. I love All My Children, and they’re my family. I barely need an excuse -- it’s usually just about timing." [...] Riegel added that [...] "this time {{it was the fact that}} they were going to have Bianca in a committed relationship". She stated, [...] "It was very, very important to me, and I was so glad to hear that. In the context of that, there’s some pretty exciting story line plot points that I’m aware of that are dramatic and fun to play and enticing as an actress." [...] In addition, Riegel was enthused about playing opposite Braun. [...] "It means so much [...] because it shows how committed AMC is to this pairing," [...] Riegel said in an interview with Soap Opera Weekly. [...] "We're going to have some serious stuff to play- they aren't going to waste her talents." ...|$|E
