5|$|Dating {{the monuments}} remains {{difficult}} because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation. Most have been dated to the Early Preclassic period (1500–1000BC) with some to the Middle Preclassic (1000–400BC) period. The smallest weigh 6 tons, while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons, although it was abandoned and left uncompleted close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> its stone.|$|E
5|$|Sergeant Hallett (Nathaniel Dean) is a {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant and Sergeant Lope's husband. He embarks on the expedition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Shaw's signal. At {{the entrance of the}} crashed Engineer ship, Hallett observes mutated floral pods, which he squeezes, causing the airborne mutagen to be inhaled through his nose. By the time the expedition departs from the crash site, Hallett begins to show symptoms of the parasite, which worries Lope. As they make their way back to the lander, Hallett's condition drastically deteriorates. Upon reaching the lander, which explodes, a Neomorph bursts from Hallett's throat, killing him.|$|E

5|$|The various musical themes {{associated}} with the Rhinemaidens are regarded as among the most lyrical in the entire Ring cycle, bringing to it rare instances of comparative relaxation and charm. The music contains important melodies and phrases which are reprised and developed elsewhere in the operas to characterise other individuals and circumstances, and to relate plot developments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the narrative. It is reported that Wagner played the Rhinemaidens' lament at the piano, {{on the night before}} he died in Venice, in 1883.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept {{on his hands and knees}} to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days.|$|E

25|$|Food {{irradiation}} is {{the process}} of exposing foodstuffs to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is energy that can be transmitted without direct contact <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the energy (radiation) capable of freeing electrons from their atomic bonds (ionization) in the targeted food. This treatment is used to preserve food, reduce the risk of food borne illness, prevent the spread of invasive pests, and delay or eliminate sprouting or ripening. Irradiated food does not become radioactive. The radiation can be emitted by a radioactive substance or generated electrically.|$|E
25|$|The main {{branch of}} the Sheshequin Path {{followed}} Lycoming Creek north past the modern villages of Hepburnville, Cogan Station and Trout Run (the modern path of U.S. Route 15 and the future Interstate 99). From Trout Run it continues past Fields Station, Bodines, Marsh Hill, Ralston <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Lycoming Creek in {{the southwest corner of}} Bradford County. There the path traversed a swampy area for a short distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Towanda Creek near Grover, following Towanda Creek northeast to modern Canton (this is the route of Pennsylvania Route 14) and on to the village of East Canton. A short cut left the creek between Grover and East Canton. From East Canton the path followed the creek past Leroy, West Franklin, Powell, and Monroeton to the creek's mouth at modern Towanda on the North Branch Susuquehanna River. The path then followed the river north to Sheshequin (and from there north to modern New York and the Iroquois there). The alternate branch known as St. Joseph's Path left Towanda Creek at Powell, and ran north to Sugar Creek, which it either followed to the river and the village of Oscalui then north to Sheshequin, or crossed to go on to Sheshequin. Pennsylvania Route 414 follows the path from Canton to Monroeton, and U.S. Route 220 follows it to Towanda and north along the river to Sheshequin.|$|E
