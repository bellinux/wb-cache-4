5000|$|Although Orphan's Benefit was Donald's second appearance, {{the film}} {{was the first to}} {{significantly}} develop his character. Many of Donald's personality traits first seen in Orphan's Benefit would become permanently associated with him, such as his love of showmanship, his fierce determination, belligerence, and most famously his easily provoked <b>temper.</b> The <b>film</b> also introduced some of Donald's physical antics, such as his signature temper tantrum of hopping on one foot while holding out one fist and swinging the other. This was the creation of animator Dick Lundy who termed this Donald's [...] "fighting pose." ...|$|R

5000|$|Because of his talents, Van Artsdalen was {{featured}} in several early surf films by Dale Davis and Bruce Brown, the most notable of which was The Endless Summer. Van Artsdalen received onscreen credit in one of William Asher's [...] "surfploitation" [...] comedies, Muscle Beach Party, starring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello.

Experiments are carried out under a high-load, low-speed condition, where wear takes place predominatly. Results show that the <b>tempering</b> prolongs the <b>film</b> life more than twice. This is caused by increased fracture toughness of the substrate and improved adherence at the coating-substrate interface by formation of a high-titanium layer, both suppressing wear of the TiN layer by scratching...|$|R
5000|$|Downtown pulls {{numerous}} pranks {{on their}} colleagues on Gaki no Tsukai. A common prank {{is to have}} Hamada pretend to lose his <b>temper</b> during a <b>filming</b> and become furious towards the unwitting victim. In the past, he has violently attacked the victim, including kneeing him in the face, giving a headbutt, and pulling his hair. His act is so convincing, it has brought his victims to tears. This prank has been pulled on Naoki Tanaka of the comedy duo Cocorico, a regular on Gaki no Tsukai. Tanaka testified during the mock trial, [...] "I cried on someone's chest {{for the first time}} in my life." ...|$|R
50|$|S/O Satyamurthy grossed 205 {{million on}} its first day at the global box office, the third-highest opening-day gross {{in the history of}} Telugu cinema. The film also had the best opening-day gross of Arjun's film career, {{breaking}} records set by 2014's Race Gurram (his previous <b>film),</b> <b>Temper</b> and Gopala Gopala. Trade analyst Trinath told IANS that the film grossed 335 million in two days at the global box office, the biggest opening of the year to date. S/O Satyamurthy earned 269.2 million in three days at the global box office. By the end of its first weekend, the film earned 303.1 million and was the highest-grossing Telugu film of the year to date.|$|R
50|$|The film {{collected}} 261.5 {{million at}} AP/Nizam box office and nearly 330 {{million at the}} worldwide box office in seven days and surpassed the first week collection of Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013) at AP/Nizam box office and Baadshah, Gabbar Singh (2012) at the worldwide box office. The film collected a gross of 590 million and a share of 379 million in nine days at the worldwide box office thus surpassing the lifetime collections of Pokiri (2006) and took the 18th spot {{in the list of}} all-time top 25 Telugu films with highest worldwide share. The film also created a new record in Mandapeta in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh by collecting 2.08 million in nine days, breaking the record set by Magadheera (2009) in its lifetime run. The film witnessed a drop in its collections at AP/Nizam box office and earned around 310 million share in ten days. However the film crossed 400 million mark at the worldwide box office overtaking the totals of Businessman and Robo, the Telugu dubbed version of Enthiran (2010). Due to stiff competition from I, Pataas and <b>Temper,</b> the <b>film</b> collected a gross of 880 million and a distributor share of 411 million at the worldwide box office during its lifetime run. The film passed the 500 million gross mark and collected 335 million in its lifetime at the AP/Nizam box office alone.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{paper will}} present a review of {{different}} solutions for transparent conducting electrodes on flexible substrates. The analysis of the present situation reveals a gap for low sheet resistance electrodes. Two new approaches to the problem will be presented. The first one is a novel technology for the deposition of zinc oxide on polyethylene terephtalate film. The intention for this process is {{the establishment of a}} low cost coating in a roll-to-roll machine. Silicon was used as the dopant material with a concentration varying in different samples between 1 and 4 %. The optimum parameters provided a transparent layer with a sheet resistance of 16 Ωsqu. Metal grids are a second promising approach for achieving low sheet resistance electrodes. The combination of these grids with transparent conducting oxides (TCO) will be presented. The TCO were deposited under vacuum in a roll-to-roll coating machine. The grids were applied by aerosol jet printing and subsequent <b>tempering</b> of the <b>film...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Kajal's first {{release of}} 2015 {{was in the}} Telugu action <b>film</b> <b>Temper</b> {{directed}} by Puri Jagannadh alongside NTR Jr. The film received positive response from critics and was a commercial success at the box office. Kajal {{played the role of}} an animal lover and on her performance, a critic from The Times of India said [...] "Despite her limited role, the actress does well". [...] Next, she featured in two Tamil films, working with industry-leading actors and directors. In July, 2015 she was seen as an entrepreneur in Balaji Mohan's gangster comedy film Maari opposite Dhanush. Critics rated as [...] "regular masala movie" [...] and Rediff noted [...] "Kajal Aggarwal does have a significant role to play, but their onscreen chemistry just does not work". The film became an economic success. Her other release, Suseenthiran's action film Paayum Puli alongside Vishal received mixed reviews and failed at the Box office. Reviewers criticized her character stating [...] "badly written and has nothing {{more to do with the}} script" [...] She also did a cameo appearance in a bilingual romantic comedy film Size Zero.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the variations in photocatalytic efficiencies of titania thin films prepared by different physical vapor deposition techniques, we studied the microstructure and resulting properties for the two widely used PVD methods, electron beam evaporation and reactive pulsed DC magnetron sputtering. In addition, we investigated the effect of oxygen vacancy defects induced by tempering in reducing atmospheres and the aging behavior. After deposition, several tempering series in oxygen, air, argon, and forming gas were carried out to control the amount of oxygen vacancy defects. The films were characterized with respect to crystallinity, texture, grain growth, grain structure, surface roughness, light transmission as well as band gap energy; the photocatalytic efficiency was measured via methylene blue degradation. The results show different nucleation and growth mechanisms between evaporated and sputtered titania thin films, resulting in severe influence on photocatalytic efficiency. The evaporated thin films exhibited homogeneous nucleation and growth, and stayed in the anatase structure even after tempering at 800 °C for 1 h. In contrast, the sputtered thin films started to form grains at the interface to the substrate and showed heterogeneous nucleation and growth. Moreover, the sputtered films already formed rutile when tempered at 600 °C for 1 h. The gain in surface area due to tempering, which promotes adsorption of photocatalytic reactants, was more pronounced in sputtered thin films (+ 29 %) compared to evaporated thin films (+ 6 %). Films with oxygen vacancy defects, preserved by tempering in argon or induced by tempering in forming gas, showed a large improvement in photocatalytic efficiency. However, aging of the samples over a period of 19 months lead to a progressive decline in efficiency, finally reaching the level of thin <b>films</b> <b>tempered</b> in air, which had remained stable over the same 19 month period. This strongly questions widely applied concepts based on improving the photocatalytic efficiency via oxygen vacancy defects...|$|R
