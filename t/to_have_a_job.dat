Some jobs are very basic, such as washing tables after dinner or keeping a common room neat. Others are more involved, such as being a student tour guide or being a student computer technician. The job program is an integral part of the school's history and character even if many of the jobs are different than when they were originally created.|$|E
25|$|In England, by the 1890s, {{a long-standing}} Rugby Football Union ban on {{professional}} players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were {{working class and}} {{could not afford to}} take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> outside sport.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year (in July 1934), they visited Angola once again. This time Lead Belly begged {{them to make}} a recording of a song he had written to take to the Governor requesting parole, which they did. However, unbeknownst to them, Lead Belly was released in August for good time (and because of cost-cutting due to the Depression) and not because of the Lomaxes' recording, which the Governor may not have listened to. In September 1934, Lead Belly wrote to Lomax requesting employment, since he needed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> in order not to be sent back to prison. At the urging of John Jr., Lomax engaged Lead Belly as his driver and assistant, and the pair traveled the South together collecting folk songs for the next three months. Then, in December 1934, Lead Belly famously performed illustrating John Lomax's scheduled lecture of folk songs at a smoker and sing-along held at the national MLA meeting in Philadelphia (see Lead Belly). Their association continued for three more months until the following March (1935). In January, Lomax, who knew nothing whatever about the recording business, became Lead Belly's manager and, through a friend, cowboy singer Tex Ritter, got Lead Belly a recording contract with the famous A man Art Satherly of ARC records. Satherly had publicity photos made of the singer wearing overalls and sitting on sacks of grain, garb and setting that were customary in commercial publicity photos of country singers in those days. But Lead Belly's recordings, marketed as race music, failed to sell. A filmed re-enactment in early 1935 for The March of Time newsreel of Lomax's discovery of Lead Belly in prison, led to the myth that John Lomax made Lead Belly perform in prison stripes (which is inaccurate). He did perform in overalls, however. During Lomax's two-week lecture tour with Lead Belly on the eastern college circuit in March 1935 (pre-scheduled by Lomax before teaming up with Lead Belly), the two men quarreled over money and never spoke to one another again.|$|E

40|$|A {{sample of}} {{unemployed}} British men was interviewed {{for a third}} time after an average of 25 months continuous unemployment. As predicted, it was found that mental health, indexed in terms of affective well-being, had improved slightly since the previous interview. Adaptation of this kind was greater for men who had previously reported lower commitment <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> and greater contact outside their immediate family, and also for those at the extremes of the age range. Measured availability of money and quality of social relationships were not related to adaptation. Changes in aspiration, autonomy and competence were considered likely to underpin the improvement in well-being.

In 1965, to combat the perceived injustice in the case where the wives of British subjects could not obtain British nationality, the British Nationality Act was adopted. Shortly afterwards, refugees from Kenya and Uganda, fearing discrimination from their own national governments, began to arrive in Britain; as they had retained their British nationality granted by the 1948 Act, they were {{not subject to the}} later controls. The Conservative MP Enoch Powell campaigned for tighter controls on immigration which resulted in the passing of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act in 1968.|$|E

2500|$|It {{eventually}} became {{too difficult for}} Krasner to support herself as a waitress due to the Great Depression. In order to provide for herself, she joined the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project in 1935. She worked on the mural division {{as an assistant to}} Max Spivak. Her job was to enlarge other artists' designs for large-scaled public murals. Since murals were created to be easily understood and appreciated by the general public, the abstract art Krasner produced was undesirable for murals. While Krasner was happy <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> she was dissatisfied since she did not like working with [...] figurative images created by other artists. Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, she created gouache sketches in the hopes of one day creating an [...] abstract mural. As soon as one of her proposals for a mural was approved for the WYNC radio station, the Works Progress Administration turned into [...] War Services and all art had to be created for war propaganda. She continued working for War Services by creating collages for the war effort which were displayed in the windows of nineteen department stores in Brooklyn and Manhattan.> She was very involved with the Artists Union during her employment with the WPA but {{was one of the first}} to quit the organization when she realized the communists were taking it over. By being part of this organization, she was able to meet more artists in New York City and enlarge her network.|$|E

30|$|The {{opportunity}} labeled “no economic distress” {{is defined}} as not having suffered any event of economic distress or shock related to employment in the past one year. In order to see whether {{taking into account the}} quality of jobs, to the extent allowed by the data, makes a difference to the results, we impose some additional restrictions to our original definition of opportunity in the labor market. We start with the original indicator of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> with more than 20  hours per week. In order to capture the stability aspect of the job in question, we first modify the definition of <b>an</b> “opportunity” <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> with more than 20  hours/week and at least 6  months of tenure. Next, we define having any job with contract (regardless of hours worked) as the indicator of opportunity, where the sample of analysis consists of only the salaried workers and the unemployed and excludes the self-employed. Since salaried workers are a subgroup of all employed persons, we then broaden the indicator {{so that it can be}} defined for all workers: <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> that is either salaried with contract or being self-employed in a professional occupation.|$|R

Old as I am, Miss Majesty, an' used as I am to cowboy excentrikities, I nearly dropped daid when I heered that little hobble-footed, burned-up Montana cow-puncher say there wasn't any game too swell for him, an' gol-lof was just his speed. Serious as a preacher, mind you, he was. An' he was always practisin'. When Stewart gave him charge of the course an' the club-house an' all them funny sticks, why, Monty was tickled to death. You see, Monty is sensitive that he ain't much good any more for cowboy work. He was glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> that he didn't feel he was hangin' to by kindness. Wal, he practised the game, an' he read the books in the club-house, an' he got the boys to doin' the same. That wasn't very hard, I reckon. They played early an' late an' in the moonlight. For a while Monty was coach, an' the boys stood it. But pretty soon Frankie Slade got puffed on his game, an' he had to have it out with Monty. Wal, Monty beat him bad. Then one after another the other boys tackled Monty. He beat them all. After that they split up an' begin to play matches, two on a side. For a spell this worked fine. But cowboys can't never be satisfied long onless they win all the time. Monty an' Link Stevens, both cripples, you might say, joined forces an' elected to beat all comers.
