5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are {{the centerpiece}} of general relativity. They provide a precise formulation {{of the relationship between}} spacetime geometry and the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> Riemannian geometry, in which the geometric properties of a space (or a spacetime) are described by a quantity called a metric. The metric encodes the information needed to compute the fundamental geometric notions of distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).|$|E
5|$|In 1857, Cayley {{introduced}} matrix notation, {{which allows}} for a harmonization and simplification of linear maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations. In his work, <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces, since his consideration of multiplication led him to what are today called algebras.

Unlike palindromes, it is also font dependent. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> strobogrammatic numbers is not neatly expressible algebraically, the way that <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> repunits is, or even <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> palindromic numbers.|$|R

5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that {{the speed of light}} in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> space and time.|$|E

5|$|In the 1820s however, Tucker's {{views of}} slavery changed notably with {{personal}} experience, and profit, realized in his purchase {{and sale of}} slaves for his account {{and that of his}} father-in-law, Charles Carter. For years he opposed <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> abolition and colonization as impractical, then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable. Though he recounted the insipid benefits of slavery, he predicted its eventual death. Indeed, he freed his own slaves in 1845, 16 years prior to his death.|$|E
