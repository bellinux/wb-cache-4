5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition {{to many in}} the Air Force. Most pilots switching to the A-10 did not want <b>to</b> <b>because</b> fighter pilots traditionally favored speed and appearance. In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10. In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|E

Instead, he allowed his brother to buy his interest in the house, a decision that led to conflict between the two brothers regarding the price and timing of the sale.

After the crash, Paulo becomes suspicious Nikki is just using {{him to get the}} diamonds. The first thing she asks him after the crash is the whereabouts of the diamonds, and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they would still be together if she did not need him to help find the diamonds. Paulo does what Nikki tells him <b>to</b> <b>because</b> of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy was}} revised, with Negro {{soldiers}} serving in provisional platoons. In the 12th Army Group these {{were attached to}} regiments, while in the 6th Army Group the platoons were grouped into whole companies attached to the division.

5|$|The regimental colours of green, red and yellow, {{which appear}} on the regimental tie and Stable belt, were decided on in the late 19th century. One officer (who was also a Conservative MP) {{suggested}} green with a red stripe, but this was objected <b>to</b> <b>because</b> it {{was similar to the}} Rifle Brigade. Another officer (a Liberal MP) suggested adding yellow, which was agreed. The joke was that red and yellow were Liberal colours, and the Liberal MP got away with this under his rival's nose.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{moratorium}} {{was put in}} place in 1986, more than 50,000 whales have been hunted and killed; there are three nations that are still able <b>to</b> hunt whales <b>because</b> of loopholes in the ban. Norway is able <b>to</b> hunt <b>because</b> of an “objection” to the ban; Iceland is able <b>to</b> hunt <b>because</b> of a “reservation” and Japan is able <b>to</b> hunt <b>because</b> they claim it is for “research purposes”.

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 2009 regular season, Tennessee's offense was the 32nd most successful squad in the nation, scoring an average of 30.58 points per game. In terms of yardage gained, Tennessee was 48th. There wasn't much difference between the success of the rushing offense (43rd) and the passing offense (47th). Tennessee quarterback Jonathan Crompton, after struggling in 2008, improved significantly in 2009, when he passed for 2,565 yards and 26 touchdowns. In 2008, the Volunteers were 11th in the SEC in offense, averaging 145.8 yards per game. In 2009, they were third, averaging 225.6 yards per game. In addition to Crompton, running back Montario Hardesty also improved his performance from 2008 to 2009. In the season leading up to the Chick-fil-A Bowl, he had 1,306 rushing yards, just 158 short of the single-season Tennessee record, and 12 touchdowns. Entering the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Hardesty hoped to match the team's rushing record, but doubted he would be able <b>to</b> <b>because</b> of past knee injuries that made it difficult to run on artificial turf. Volunteers tight end Luke Stocker, who caught 27 passes for 370 yards and six touchdowns in 2009, was a player Virginia Tech's defense focused on in pregame preparation.|$|E

When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had <b>to</b> <b>because</b> she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
