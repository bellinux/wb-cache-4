50|$|The {{respondent}} contended that, {{despite his}} near-constant {{presence in the}} country over the time period in question, {{he had no intention}} of making South Africa his home and staying there permanently. The respondent argued that the doctrine of effectiveness had relevance to the issue of residence and contended that he could only be considered to have been resident in the trial Court's area of jurisdiction if his presence there at the relevant time had been of a nature which would enable the Court <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> which would normally be effective against aperson in his position.|$|E
5000|$|Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States {{interpreted}} the meaning of the phrase [...] "substantially impairs" [...] as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. It reversed the decision by the Court of Appeals <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> partial summary <b>judgment</b> in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability.|$|R
2500|$|Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court {{interpreted}} the meaning of the phrase [...] "substantially impairs" [...] as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It reversed a Sixth Court of Appeals decision <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> partial summary <b>judgment</b> in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the [...] "major life activity" [...] definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The issue is not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises {{to the level of a}} disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks, which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found that Williams was disabled. This ruling is now, however, no longer good law—it was invalidated by the ADAAA. In fact, Congress explicitly cited Toyota v. Williams in the text of the ADAAA itself as one of its driving influences for passing the ADAAA.|$|R

25|$|In Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int’l, Inc., 615 F.Supp.2d 575 (E.D.
