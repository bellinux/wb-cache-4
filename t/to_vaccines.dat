40|$|AbstractWhen {{faced with}} vaccine hesitancy, public health {{authorities}} {{are looking for}} effective strategies to address this issue. In this paper, the findings of 15 published literature reviews or meta-analysis that have examined the effectiveness of different interventions <b>to</b> reduce <b>vaccine</b> hesitancy and/or <b>to</b> enhance <b>vaccine</b> acceptance are presented and discussed. From the literature, there is no strong evidence to recommend any specific intervention <b>to</b> address <b>vaccine</b> hesitancy/refusal. The reviewed studies included interventions with diverse content and approaches that were implemented in different settings and targeted various populations. Few interventions were directly targeted <b>to</b> <b>vaccine</b> hesitant individuals. Given the paucity of information on effective strategies <b>to</b> address <b>vaccine</b> hesitancy, when interventions are implemented, planning a rigorous evaluation of their impact on vaccine hesitancy/vaccine acceptance will be essential...|$|R

25|$|No {{evidence}} {{has been found to}} support a link between autism spectrum disorders and vaccines, and the scientific consensus is that routine childhood vaccines have no link to the development of autism. Despite this, some parents of children with autism spectrum disorders have attributed the disorders' onset <b>to</b> <b>vaccines,</b> and more than 5,300 parents have filed petitions at the vaccine court. The vaccine court dismissed the suites and ruled that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.|$|E
25|$|Autism Speaks {{believes}} that vaccines {{have been shown}} to be safe for most children, and are important for preventing serious diseases such as measles and mumps. It recognizes that some individuals may have adverse reactions, or respond poorly, <b>to</b> <b>vaccines,</b> and advocates research into identifying any subgroups of such individuals and mechanisms behind any such reactions. This has strained relations between the Wrights and their daughter Katie, the mother of a boy with autism. Katie believes her son's autism was caused by thiomersal, a preservative that was formerly common in children's vaccines in the United States; no major scientific studies have confirmed this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The FDA has {{classified}} the HPV vaccine as {{a pregnancy}} Category B, meaning {{there is no}} apparent harm to the fetus in animal studies. HPV vaccines have not been causally related with adverse pregnancy outcomes or adverse effects on the fetus. However, data on vaccination during pregnancy is very limited and vaccination during the pregnancy term should be delayed until more information is available. If a woman {{is found to be}} pregnant during the three-dose series of vaccination, the series will be postponed until pregnancy has been completed. While there is no indication for intervention for vaccine dosages administered during pregnancy, patients and health-care providers are encouraged to report exposure <b>to</b> <b>vaccines</b> to the appropriate HPV vaccine pregnancy registry.|$|E

25|$|Another {{concern is}} whether {{countries}} {{which do not}} manufacture vaccines themselves, including those where a pandemic strain is likely to originate, {{will be able to}} purchase vaccine to protect their population. Cost considerations aside, they fear that the countries with vaccine-manufacturing capability will reserve production to protect their own populations and not release vaccines to other countries until their own population is protected. Indonesia has refused to share samples of H5N1 strains which have infected and killed its citizens until it receives assurances that it will have access <b>to</b> <b>vaccines</b> produced with those samples. So far, it has not received those assurances. However, in September 2009, The United States and France agreed to make 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization.|$|E
25|$|Concerns about {{immunization}} safety often {{follow a}} pattern. First, some investigators {{suggest that a}} medical condition of increasing prevalence or unknown cause is an adverse effect of vaccination. The initial study and subsequent studies by the same group have inadequate methodology—typically a poorly controlled or uncontrolled case series. A premature announcement is made about the alleged adverse effect, resonating with individuals suffering from the condition, and underestimating the potential harm of forgoing vaccination to those whom the vaccine could protect. Other groups attempt to replicate the initial study but fail {{to get the same}} results. Finally, it takes several years to regain public confidence in the vaccine. Adverse effects ascribed <b>to</b> <b>vaccines</b> typically have an unknown origin, an increasing incidence, some biological plausibility, occurrences close to the time of vaccination, and dreaded outcomes. In almost all cases, the public health effect is limited by cultural boundaries: English speakers worry about one vaccine causing autism, while French speakers worry about another vaccine causing multiple sclerosis, and Nigerians worry that a third vaccine causes infertility.|$|E
25|$|Some {{individuals}} {{depend on}} herd immunity because they either cannot develop immunity or for medical reasons cannot be vaccinated. Newborn infants {{are too young}} to receive many vaccines, either for safety reasons or because passive immunity renders the vaccine ineffective. Individuals who possess an immunodeficiency from HIV/AIDS, lymphoma, leukemia, a bone marrow cancer, an impaired spleen, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy may have lost any immunity that they previously had and vaccines may not be of any use for them because of their immunodeficiency. Vaccines are typically imperfect as some individuals' immune systems may not generate an adequate immune response <b>to</b> <b>vaccines</b> to confer long-term immunity, so a portion of those who are vaccinated may lack immunity. Lastly, vaccine contraindications for specific populations may prevent individuals in these populations from becoming immune. Individuals in one of these groups may be at a greater risk of developing complications from infection because of their medical status, so they generally rely on herd immunity more than others who can otherwise safely become immune via vaccination.|$|E

As a result, most people with A-T have reduced numbers of lymphocytes and some impairment of lymphocyte function (such as an impaired ability to make antibodies in response <b>to</b> <b>vaccines</b> or infections). In addition, broken pieces of DNA in chromosomes involved in the above-mentioned rearrangements have a tendency to recombine with other genes (translocation), making the cells prone to the development of cancer (lymphoma and leukemia).|$|E

2500|$|About {{two-thirds of}} people with A-T have {{abnormalities}} of the immune system.

Some people have frequent infections of the upper (colds, sinus and ear infections) and lower (bronchitis and pneumonia) respiratory tract. All children with A-T should have their immune systems evaluated to detect those with severe problems that require treatment to minimize the number or severity of infections. Some people with A-T need additional immunizations (especially with pneumonia and influenza vaccines), antibiotics to provide protection (prophylaxis) from infections, and/or [...] infusions of immunoglobulins (gamma globulin). The need for these treatments should be determined by an expert in the field of immunodeficiency or infectious diseases.|$|E
