5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change {{the outcome of the}} case. <b>The</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Legislature to concur).|$|E

5|$|On June 15, 1846, <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Treaty {{was signed}} with Great Britain, which settled {{the dispute over}} {{sovereignty}} of <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Country.

Decisions of the court are published in <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Reporter published by <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Judicial Department.

5|$|Before the {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Territory in 1848, <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Country provisional government, through legislation on June 27, 1844 and December 19, 1845, selected Oregon City as the capital. Thus Oregon's first capitol was in Oregon City. One of the private buildings used by this government was constructed by John L. Morrison in 1850; it served as a capitol until the government moved to Salem. The designation of Oregon City as the seat of power was by proclamation of Governor Joseph Lane. In 1850, the legislature passed an act designating Salem the capital. However, Governor John P. Gaines refused to relocate and remained in Oregon City along with <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court (except justice Orville C. Pratt) until an act of Congress on May 14, 1852 settled the matter in Salem's favor.|$|E

The HBC reoriented its Columbia District operations toward the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia, which became the region's main trunk route. In the early 1840s Americans began to colonize <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> country in large numbers via <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Trail, despite the HBC's efforts to discourage American settlement in the region. For many the final leg of the journey involved travel down the lower Columbia River to Fort Vancouver.
