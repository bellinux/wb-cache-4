500|$|The {{critical}} and commercial success of The Bends gave Radiohead {{the confidence to}} self-produce their third album. Their label Parlophone gave them a £100,000 budget for recording equipment. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said [...] "the only concept that we had for this album was <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> record {{it away from the}} city and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> record it ourselves." [...] According to guitarist Ed O'Brien: [...] "Everyone said, You'll sell six or seven million if you bring out The Bends Pt 2, and we're like, 'We'll kick against that and do the opposite'." [...] A number of producers, including major figures such as Scott Litt, were suggested, but the band were encouraged by their sessions with Godrich. They consulted him for advice on what equipment to use, and prepared for the sessions by buying their own equipment, including a plate reverberator purchased from Jona Lewie. Although Godrich had sought to focus his work on electronic dance music, he outgrew his role as advisor and became the album's co-producer.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} film school, Australian director James Wan and Australian writer Leigh Whannell {{wanted to}} write and fund a film. The inspiration that they needed came after watching the low-budget independent film The Blair Witch Project. [...] Another film that inspired them to finance the film themselves was Darren Aronofsky's Pi. The two thought the cheapest script to shoot would involve two actors in one room. Whannell said, [...] "So I actually think the restrictions we had on our bank accounts at the time, the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep the film contained, helped us {{come up with the}} ideas in the film." [...] One idea was to have the entire film set with two actors stuck in an elevator and being shot in {{the point of view of}} security cameras.|$|E

500|$|Folk metal {{has been}} {{associated}} with paganism ever since its inception, when Martin Walkyier left his former band Sabbat to form Skyclad, in part because the band [...] "wasn't going to go far enough down the pagan, British way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do it." [...] Consequently, the lyrics of Skyclad have been known to deal with pagan matters. The band Cruachan was also founded by a self-described pagan, Keith Fay. For Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow, the label [...] "pagan metal" [...] is preferred [...] "because that describes the ideological points in the music, but doesn’t say anything about the music itself." [...] Other bands that also prefer to use the term [...] "pagan metal" [...] as a self-description include Cruachan, Eluveitie, Obtest and Skyforger. In contrast to bands with pagan themes, some folk metal bands such as Orphaned Land have themes of Abrahamic religion.|$|E
500|$|Rest of the {{ensemble}} included leather, metallic combinations, green silk vest from A.F. Vandevorst, and cotton clothing from Greg Lauren. The lace shorts Madonna wore was vintage, and Åkerlund burnt up the singer's Agent Provocateur bra and applied dirt on it for giving special effects. The whole inspiration for Åkerlund behind the look was Jonas, {{as well as the}} couple's interest in rock-n-roll. Madonna approved the design, saying that [...] "It was magical... It perfectly represented the vibe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> bring to the video." [...] She also asked for a golf club and pocket knife to make the look more edgy. With Swedish broadcasting channel Sveriges Television, Åkerlund explained that for the opening shot, where Madonna is shown laying on the bed, she wanted boots which looked like leg braces. She contacted a designer in New York who said that he developed such pieces for fetish fashion. Åkerlund wanted him to provide the designs for arms also.|$|E

[...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke."

[...] They took the track and wrote [...] "Return the Favor" [...] over the beat. According to Hilson, she said that song was {{partially}} inspired by [...] "that conversational, back-and-forth thing" [...] they did on [...] "The Way I Are", stating, [...] "We got a great response from that <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do it again." [...] The initial draft of the hook featured the line [...] "If you kiss me then I’ll kiss you back", but according to Hilson {{in an interview with}} That Grape Juice, it was changed by unknown reason by Timbaland.

500|$|A post on Garbage's Facebook page on January 23, 2012 {{announced}} that the band launched their own record label, Stunvolume, to self-release their new studio album, distributed in the United States by Fontana. Overseas distribution deals were made with Cooperative Music, Liberator Music, Sony Music Japan and Universal Canada. On March 7, 2012, Garbage confirmed the album track listing via YouTube. Four further tracks recorded for the deluxe edition were confirmed later in a press release issued through the band's own label. In the United Kingdom, 250 copies of the deluxe edition were signed by Garbage and issued {{as part of the}} Record Store Day campaign. The album had a worldwide release date of May 14, 2012. At the launch of the record, guitarist Duke Erikson said that [...] "working with Garbage again was very instinctual. Like getting on a bicycle... with three other people"; Erikson added, [...] "We haven't felt this good about a Garbage record since the last one." [...] Los Angeles-based studio SMOG Design handled the album's artwork and creative campaign, featuring band photographs by Autumn de Wilde. According to Duke Erikson, for the cover [...] "there was some art <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do but we didn't want to spend what the artist wanted us to", so instead of [...] "a very colorful and complex cover" [...] they opted to go the other way and be simplistic, with only a lowercase [...] "g".|$|E
500|$|Nearly 20 {{visual effects}} studios worked on Captain America: Civil War {{including}} Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, Dneg, Image Engine, Trixter, Cinesite, and The Third Floor amongst others. Lola VFX de-aged Downey Jr. {{in a scene}} that involved a younger holographic version of himself. Lola VFX's visual effects supervisor, Trent Claus said, [...] "In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr. Downey at the approximate age <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> target, which was {{around the time of}} the film Less Than Zero [...]" [...] He also noted the difficulty of the scene, due to it being close to 4,000 frames, and the fact that Downey was moving his head from side to side multiple times. Lola also worked on visual effects for the Vision. The Third Floor extensively previsualized the film including the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport. Gerardo Ramirez, the Previs and Postvis Supervisor for The Third Floor said:We visualized most of the major scenes in the film, some that were more story driven and some that were more action and story driven. The Russos used various methods for planning and they used each department for what it does best. The early edits were a combination of storyboards, previs and stunt performance clips. Stunts would choreograph the hand-to-hand action while the storyboards would be used for character story moments and previs was used for the big action scenes that involved many digital characters. Method Studios, which worked on 440 shots, was responsible for the helicopter sequence in the middle of the film and the climatic fight between Iron Man, Bucky, and Captain America. The original intent for the helicopter sequence was to place the scene next to the Paul-Löbe-Haus, where the Bundestag meets; however, the location was not allowed to be shown in the film, resulting in Method needing to create a full CGI background. For the climatic fight, one of the challenges for Method was getting the color of Iron Man's suit correct, opting to go with a more [...] "classic Iron Man look versus the really glossy car paint look" [...] that Iron Man had in the previous Avengers films. ILM was primarily responsible for the visual effects during the large-scale fight sequence at the airport, along with creating the digital assets for all of the characters. VFX supervisor Russell Earl, stated that the 20 minute scene grew to be an almost fully digital sequence explaining, [...] "We ultimately ended up replacing 99% of everything that was shot with the actors being lifted from the background. Originally both Spider-Man and Black Panther were planned to be photographed elements but we ended up almost completely replacing them." [...] Luma Pictures, who also worked on Winter Soldier, was assigned with completing shots of Bucky's arm and his metal brainwashing chair. They also worked on Bucky's escape from the task force lobby and designed Iron Man's new hybrid nanotechnology armor, which was an homage to the character's Bleeding Edge armor from the comics. Their work totaled approximately 200 shots.|$|E
