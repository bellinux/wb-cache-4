5|$|Liz becomes furious when Jack {{decides that}} Tracy {{should be the}} number one {{priority}} on The Girlie Show. Jenna fears that Tracy will begin to overshadow her, but Tracy is quite pleased with his new job on the show. Liz and Jenna become more aggravated when Jack decides to {{change the name of}} The Girlie Show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, without consulting either of them. Jack has Tracy and Jenna appear in a promotion for the show, in which Tracy angers Jenna by forgetting her name and by not letting her speak. After the promotion, Liz tries to re-assure Jenna by telling her that nobody on the show likes Tracy and that the only reason that he is on the show is because of Jack. Liz finds out that Jenna's microphone was still on, and everyone in the studio heard her say <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> about Jack and Tracy.|$|E

The script was by Herb Gardner, who also wrote A Thousand Clowns.|$|E
25|$|Macri criticized Scioli for a {{negative}} campaigning {{launched by the}} Front for Victory. Several politicians and state institutions run by the FPV released messages warning about <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> that may happen if Macri was elected president. Scioli claims {{that it was a}} campaign to encourage public awareness. It is rumored that the campaign may have been suggested by the Brazilian João Santana, who organized a similar one in Brazil during the ballotage of Dilma Rousseff and Aécio Neves.|$|E

25|$|Zimbardo's book, The Lucifer Effect, {{gets its}} title from the {{metamorphosis}} of Lucifer into Satan. Though the Christian Scriptures {{do not make}} this claim, according to the Biblical account, Lucifer was once God's favorite angel until he challenged God's authority and was cast into Hell {{with all the other}} fallen angels. Thus, Zimbardo derives this title to explain how good people turn evil. Zimbardo's main assumption on why good people do <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> is due to situational influences and power given from authority.|$|E

Harpo then invites Sofia {{to come back and}} live at the Juke Joint, {{reconciling}} with her in the process. Eventually, Mister begins to feel the effect of Celie's curse. Harpo challenges his father to make things right after a bunch of <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> happen to Mister, which force Mister to try to understand the meaning of Celie's curse and the meaning of life other than his tough childhood.

500|$|In another twist Mercedes {{discovered}} that Silas {{would not be}} put on trial and would instead be put in an institute for the insane. Metcalfe said this left her alter ego feeling [...] "very let down" [...] as a trial would be the opportunity for Mercedes to [...] "tell the world about the <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> Silas did {{and make sure that}} he got punished". She {{went on to say that}} Mercedes felt like Silas was [...] "getting away with it". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes feared that Silas would escape and explained that Mercedes never recovered from her ordeal but did what she usually did: [...] "put it in a box and tried to forget about it. If Mercedes dwelt on all the bad things she's been through, she'd go crazy. That box must be full now".|$|E
500|$|When Jackson {{bought a}} pet {{chimpanzee}} named Bubbles, the media {{viewed it as}} evidence of Jackson's increasing detachment from reality. It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick, the [...] "Elephant Man"; Jackson stated that the story was [...] "a complete lie." [...] These stories inspired the nickname [...] "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson acquired the following year, and would come to despise. Another frequent response from the media was about Jackson's plastic surgery. Jackson's manager said of the media's criticism towards the topic, [...] "So many <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> have been written. Okay, so he had his nose fixed, and the cleft — big deal. I got news for you, my nose has broke five times. It's been fixed twice. Who gives a shit? Who cares? Elvis had his nose done. Marilyn Monroe had her nose done, had her breasts done? Everybody's had it done." ...|$|E
500|$|The Way I See It has a {{traditional}} soul style fashioned after the 1960s Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul. It is {{a departure from}} Saadiq's previous work with neo soul, which bears a hip hop influence. J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer said that Saadiq expands further beyond {{his work as a}} producer for other recording artists, for whom he encouraged a [...] "classic aesthetic, heavy on organic sounds and light on studio magic, deeply indebted to the past and distrustful of easy formulas". BBC Music's Chris Jones interpreted Saadiq's use of 1960s soul as the album's source material to be a reflection of [...] "America's most recent great political and cultural shift ... the first true post-Obama expression of hope in record form." [...] Saadiq viewed his rootsy direction {{as a response to the}} state of popular music and found it analogous to modern politics: [...] "You force so many <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> on people, they get tired of it. We have a black president now." ...|$|E

500|$|Baird's {{mother was}} struck and killed on 15 July 1958, just outside Mimi's home, by a Standard Vanguard car {{driven by an}} off-duty constable, PC Eric Clague, who was a learner-driver. Clague later said: [...] "Mrs Lennon just ran {{straight}} {{out in front of}} me. I just couldn't avoid her. I was not speeding, I swear it. It {{was just one of those}} <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> that happen." [...] Baird and Jackie (aged eleven and eight respectively) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater's, and were not allowed to attend the funeral. [...] They were told two months later by Norman Birch (Lennon's uncle) that their mother had died. Lennon's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls—ignoring Dykins' parentage, as he had never legally married Julia. Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool. [...] Her grave is unmarked, and over the years its location was forgotten until it was recently identified by Jackie as [...] "CE (Church of England) 38-805".|$|E
500|$|Shen and {{the other}} {{characters}} were mostly well received. Cooper applauded the conflicted nature of Shen's personality {{as a result of}} being in an overwhelming situation, arguing that this detail solidified him as a developed and likeable protagonist. Cooper found the Triad members unsatisfactory by comparison, comparing them unfavorably with Grand Theft Auto characters. Edge called Shen an engaging protagonist and also complimented the other characters, whose voice actors brought life to the characters. Blyth described the cast, aside from Shen, as [...] "brilliantly recognizable stereotypes that have been given enough extra edge for you to care about them", and felt the attitude shifts of some characters were distracting and unrealistic. Wilson said that the characters were [...] "fleshed out brilliantly". Pinsof claimed that the game's premise [...] "grants a perfect excuse for Shen to do <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> while remaining a sympathetic, level-headed lead." [...] Kelly thought Shen's two-faced nature was the main entertainment factor of the missions. Whitehead found the player's ability to switch allegiances as needed to wear away at [...] "the already fragile grasp the narrative has on Shen's conflicted loyalties." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Bono stated [...] "When things aren't {{going right}} and I'm feeling like we're not communicating, I go through <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> on stage." [...] He likened his {{emotions}} on those occasions to [...] "a big blackness", {{and found that}} performing the song helped him to purge them from his mind on some occasions. Several scenes in the 1988 film Rattle and Hum depict Bono with his arm in a sling, {{a result of his}} falling and dislocating his shoulder during a performance of [...] "Exit" [...] on 20 September 1987 in Washington. The concert was being filmed for the movie, and the Edge stated that [...] "the show was not going well". Bono fell while running across the stage [...] "in an attempt to try [...] get something going". Recalling the incident, Bono said [...] " [...] had taken me to some ugly place... but it was rage that caused it. That was when I realized rage is an expensive thing for your general well-being." [...] On another occasion he said [...] "I just want to take a bath after we do that. I just want to wash it off my skin." [...] Graham wrote that [...] "performances of 'Exit' would grow ever more fraught and purgative." ...|$|E

[...] Actress Alice Krige portrays [...] "Alma" [...] the seminar leader of [...] "The Plan" [...] - who uses jargon {{related to the}} [...] "blueprint" [...] for building a house in order to convey concepts about self-improvement. [...] She singles out the character Ruth and berates her for [...] "tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up." [...] Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversations with family, and complains to her daughter that she cannot yet go to sleep after coming home from her seminar because she must first do [...] "homework" [...] from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for [...] "all the <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> she did to me", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will [...] "renovate" [...] her life. [...] During the following day of [...] "The Plan", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to [...] "renovate their homes" [...] together. [...] In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else is laughing at them for being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke. Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor. After her rant, the leader congratulates her for [...] "knocking down her old house", and proceeds {{to tell her that}} now she can rebuild a new house.|$|E
