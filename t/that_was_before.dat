5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> he became {{a writer for the}} show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows was perfect for the role because she was very sweet, and the staff {{had a lot of fun}} during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans regarding what characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E

25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E

25|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> {{they got}} in to bat, however. England survived the first three overs, bowled by McGrath and Lee, without loss. From then on, however, the English lost wickets by the bucketful. England went from 11 for 0 to 19 for 4 {{in the space of}} four overs, as the bowlers put the {{pressure}} on immediately, and their entire top-order came and went for single-figure scores. Paul Collingwood and Andrew Flintoff survived for a couple more overs, before Flintoff edged McGrath to slip – the score 33 for 5, and England should see themselves lucky to bat out 50 overs – or even score 100 runs. Collingwood and Geraint Jones decided to wait, giving McGrath maiden overs (as he finished his first bowling spell with figures of 7–4–9–3), and despite the batsmen being rapped on the pads, they survived, even taking the occasional six off Jason Gillespie.|$|E
25|$|Eighteen wickets fell on {{the frantic}} first day at St Lawrence Ground, and {{nineteen}} on the second, as two teams clashed in an interesting, low scoring match that lasted for only 173.4 overs. The Bangladesh A tourists had won the coin toss and chosen to bat, but immediately lost Nafees Iqbal for a duck. However, Tushar Imran made 86, and with some help from Shahriar Nafees (with 30) and Nazimuddin (27), he took the score to 185. That total did not look challenging, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> Syed Rasel's medium pace came to the scene. After Niall O'Brien and Neil Dexter put on 13 for the first wicket for Kent, Rasel and Shahadat Hossain dug out two wickets each, as Kent lost four wickets for two runs. Rasel took three more wickets before stumps on day one, and two more on the second morning, to end with seven for 50 - the only five-wicket-haul of Bangladesh A on the tour. However, only Shahriar Nafees passed 20 in the second innings, Tushar lost his golden touch (before this innings, he had made 455 runs at a batting average of 65) to only scamper 12 runs, while Antiguan-born Robbie Joseph took five for 19 with his pace bowling. Kent were set 188 to win, and lost wickets at regular intervals, but 54 from the first-class debutant Dexter {{turned out to be}} crucial as Kent made it with three wickets to spare.|$|E

500|$|Some of the {{dialogue}} Blair uses to describe {{his first meeting with}} ElizabethII led to accusations of plagiarism from Peter Morgan, who wrote The Queen, set during {{the first few months of}} Blair's premiership.

[...] Within a few months his government must deal with the aftermath of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and following the Princess's funeral, ElizabethII tells Blair that lessons must be learned from the way things have been handled. Social occasions with the Queen are also recalled, including a gathering at Balmoral Castle where Prince Philip is described manning the barbecue while ElizabethII dons a pair of rubber gloves to wash up afterwards.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{included}} in Pitchforks list of their staff's favorite music books. Contributing writer Matthew Perpetua said the book's writers—either top critics at the time or those who have since become important figures in music journalism—outline the [...] "alternative sensibility" [...] by recognizing and connecting music from disparate genres in [...] "an inclusive, open-minded survey, but it's defined as much by what's left out—pretty much all Boomer-oriented rock—as what it includes." [...] According to Perpetua, the [...] "number of young readers [...] pursued music criticism" [...] because of the book was far greater than the copies it sold. Matthew Schnipper, editor of The Fader, bought the book after it was published and said he {{used it as a}} consumer guide for 10 years. Along with its influence on future critics, the book was cited by guitarist William Tyler as his only source of music education growing up, having found it in a bookstore around the time it was published: [...] "They had entries for all these different people that I had never heard of: Can, John Zorn, [...] Fahey, whatever... <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> any sort of Internet presence".|$|E
