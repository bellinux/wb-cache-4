5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E
