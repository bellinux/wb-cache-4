25|$|Much of Superman II {{was filmed}} {{at the same}} time as the first film. After most of the footage had been shot, the {{producers}} had a disagreement with director Richard Donner over various matters, including money and special effects, and they mutually parted ways. He was replaced by director Richard Lester, who had the script changed and reshot some footage. The cast was unhappy, but Reeve later said that he liked Lester and considered Superman II to be his favorite of the series. Due to fan encouragement, Richard Donner's version of Superman II titled , was released on DVD in 2006 and dedicated <b>to</b> <b>Reeve.</b>|$|E
500|$|There was initial {{concern over}} Reeve's stamina for {{shooting}} the scenes, as his particular scene with Welling was six pages long, which translated to approximately twelve {{hours of work}} day. Beeman tried to design everything so it was as simple as possible, but Reeve quickly readjusted the scene. Beeman originally had Welling walk into frame and {{stand in front of}} Reeve, and then make a single move behind Reeve. Beeman was told, by Reeve, the scene needed more dynamic between the characters, and if Welling only made a single move, the dynamic would be lost. According <b>to</b> <b>Reeve,</b> [...] "Tom moving around me will hide the fact that I'm unable to move." [...] Beeman's fear of overstretching Reeve's stamina, because of the added shots to the scene, were put to rest when Reeve himself stated it did not matter how long it took to finish the scene, as long as it turned out great. Reeve was directing Yankee Irving when Smallville was gearing up to film the fourth season opener. As a result, Reeve could not reprise his role as Dr. Swann, which was the intention.|$|E

By the Lord, masters, you should have furnished the lad a better outfit, if you meant to send him into good company aloft.

6000|$|It {{is not to}} be {{supposed}} we went {{to sleep}} again immediately. Neb was the only man on board who did, but he never missed an occasion to eat or sleep. The captain praised us, and, {{as a matter of course}} in that day, he called all hands to [...] "splice the main-brace." [...] After this, the watch was told to go below, as regularly as if nothing had happened. As for the captain himself, he and Mr. Marble and Mr. Kite went prying about the ship to ascertain if anything material had been cut by what the chief-mate called [...] "the bloody Indian matchlocks." [...] A little running-rigging had suffered, and we had <b>to</b> <b>reeve</b> a few new ropes in the morning; but this terminated the affair.|$|E

First the third mate tried and got up to the block, and [...] fastened a temporary arrangement <b>to</b> <b>reeve</b> the halyards through, but [...] had to come down, weak and almost fainting, before finishing; then [...] Joe tried, and after twice ascending, fixed it and brought down the [...] block; {{but it was very}} exhausting work, and afterward he was good [...] for nothing all day. The clue-iron which we are trying to make [...] serve for the broken block works, however, very indifferently, and [...] will, I am afraid, soon cut the rope. It is very necessary to get [...] everything connected with the sail in good easy running order before [...] we get too weak to do anything with it.|$|E

60|$|The eyes, however, of Wilder had {{fastened}} {{themselves on}} the other ship. The man so long seated {{on the end of}} the main-yard had disappeared, and another sailor was deliberately walking along the opposite quarter of the same spar, steadying himself by the boom, and holding in one hand the end of a rope, which he was apparently about <b>to</b> <b>reeve</b> in the place where it properly belonged. The first glance told Wilder that the latter was Fid, who was so far recovered from his debauch as to tread the giddy height with as much, if not greater, steadiness than he would have rolled along the ground, had his duty called him to terra firma. The countenance of the young man, which, an instant before, had been flushed with excitement, and which was beaming with the pleasure of an opening confidence, changed directly to a look of gloom and reserve. Mrs Wyllys who had lost no shade of the varying expression of his face, resumed the discourse, with some earnestness, where he had seen fit so abruptly to break it off.|$|E
6000|$|The Tigris sailed the day {{we joined}} her, which was the third after we reached Mauritius, and just fifteen days after we had left the wreck. We went to sea with the wind at the southward, and had a good run off the island, making {{more than a hundred}} miles that {{afternoon}} {{and in the course of}} the night. Next morning, early, I had the watch, and an order was given to set top-gallant studding-sails. Rupert and I had got into the same watch on board this vessel, and we both went aloft <b>to</b> <b>reeve</b> the gear. I had taken up the end of the halyards, and had reeved them, and had overhauled the end down, when, in raising my head, I saw two small lug-sails on the ocean, broad on our weather-bow, which I recognised in an instant for those of the John's launch. I cannot express the feeling that came over me at that sight. I yelled, rather than shouted, [...] "Sail ho!" [...] and then, pushing in, I caught hold of a royal-backstay, and was on deck in an instant. I believe I made frantic gestures to windward, for Mr. Marble, who had the watch, had to shake me sharply before I could let the fact be known.|$|E
60|$|The Prince {{gave some}} orders to an officer {{standing}} by him. The latter called {{two or three}} sailors and bade them bring some short lengths of thick hawser, while a strong party were set <b>to</b> <b>reeve</b> tackle to the mainyard. As soon as the hawsers, each thirty feet in length, were brought, they were dropped on to {{the deck of the}} Fan Fan, and the officer told the crew to pass them under her, one near each end, and to knot the hawsers. By the time this was done, two strong tackles were lowered and fixed to the hawsers, and the crew ordered to come up on to the ship. The tackles were then manned and hauled on by strong parties, and the Fan Fan was gradually raised. The boatswain went below again and knocked out the plug, and, as the little yacht was hoisted up, the water ran out of it. As soon as the hole was above the water-level, the tackle at the bow was gradually slackened off until she lay with her fore-part in the water, which came some distance up her deck. The carpenter then slung himself over the stern, and nailed, first a piece of tarred canvas, and then a square of plank, over the hole. Then the stern tackle was eased off, and the Fan Fan floated on a level keel. Her crew went down to her again, and, in half an hour, pumped her free of water.|$|E
