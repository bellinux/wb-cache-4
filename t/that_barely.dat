The fighting at Spotsylvania was to prove the end of his brigade. Johnson's division, 6,800 strong {{at the start of the}} battle, was now so severely reduced in size <b>that</b> <b>barely</b> one brigade could be formed.

These colonies vary in size from over a million birds to just a few pairs, and can be densely {{concentrated}} or widely spaced.

Colonies are usually located near the coast, but some species nest far inland and even at high altitudes (such as the Barau's petrel).|$|E

Henry denies the request, upset that Stephen did not follow in his line of business as a jeweler. A knife thrown in anger by Stephen misses Henry, but breaks the shop front's window. Gogol meanwhile asks Yvonne for her love, but she refuses. Stephen goes to Gogol's home and demands to know about his hands, and why they throw knives. Gogol suggests that Stephen's problem comes from childhood trauma, but later confirms to his assistant Dr. Wong (Keye Luke) that Stephen's hands had been Rollo's.|$|E

25|$|McCarver's 14th Arkansas Regiment {{has been}} {{described}} as the regiment <b>that</b> <b>barely</b> was, since it existed only briefly as a full regiment. The first eight companies were mustered into service between August 31 and September 23, and the Field and Staff Officers were appointed on September 23, 1861, at Pocahontas, Arkansas. October 22, 1861, is recognized as the date of the organization of the regiment because that's when the ninth company joined the unit, and the company muster rolls were submitted to the Confederate War Department along with official notification of the organization of the regiment, (initially designated by Colonel Solon Borland as the 9th Arkansas). Stationed in the same area were the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Arkansas Regiments, which led Col. Solon Borland, commanding Post of Pocahontas, to muster Col. James H. McCarver's new regiment into service as the 9th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. This would have been logical, {{except for the fact that}} a 9th Arkansas Infantry Regiment had already been authorized by the State Military Board and mustered into service at Pine Bluff on July 25, 1861, Colonel John M. Bradley commanding. When Colonel Borland sent the muster-in rolls to the Confederate War Department, he was informed that McCarver's regiment would instead be designated as the 14th Arkansas Regiment.|$|E

500|$|Reigomys primigenus {{was a large}} rat, though {{smaller than}} both Lundomys and living Holochilus, {{characterized}} by an S-shaped ("sigmodont") crown on the third lower molar. Features of the molars are nearly indistinguishable from those of Lundomys and include cusps located opposite each other, enamel valleys <b>that</b> <b>barely</b> reach the midline of the molars, and short mesolophs and mesolophids (accessory crests). Other notable features include a robust mandible (lower jaw) with a steeply rising coronoid process, short incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of the palate) <b>that</b> <b>barely</b> extend between the first molars, and a short bony palate that hardly extends beyonds the third molars, {{all of which are}} shared with extant species of Holochilus to the exclusion of Lundomys. Also unlike in Lundomys, there is an additional small root present at the labial (outer) side of the first upper molar. In eight specimens that could be measured, the length of the lower toothrow is 6.79 to 7.58mm, averaging 7.28mm; the first lower molar is 2.62 to 3.08mm long, averaging 2.89mm, [...] and 1.75 to 1.93mm broad, averaging 1.85mm in seven measured teeth; the only preserved complete upper toothrow is 6.64mm long; and the first upper molar is 2.63 to 2.70mm long and 2.03mm broad in two specimens.|$|E

Shortly before Maria gave birth to their son, Romanian administration began taking over in previously Ottoman-ruled Northern Dobruja. Stanchov, who was a Bulgarian nationalist, refused to accept this change and left for the Principality of Bulgaria, leaving his family behind. Consequently, Cerna never met his father. By Cerna's own account, his childhood was marked by acute poverty and social isolation: [...] " [...] told to tutor and learn in cold, unfriendly rooms. For a long time, {{we lived in a}} house on the outskirts, which was avoided by other men, since a rumor had spread that ghosts haunted its rooms.

The thriller Out of the Furnace, the company's second release, was also negatively received by critics and was a box office bomb. Scorsese directed the company's final film in 2013—The Wolf of Wall Street, a biopic {{on the life of}} Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), a New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and money laundering on Wall Street in the 1990s. The screenplay was adapted by Terence Winter from Belfort's memoir of the same name. The film was banned in Kenya, Malaysia and Nepal for its controversial depiction of events, explicit sexual content, profanity, and hard drug use. Nonetheless, it was a commercial success, becoming the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2013. According to copyright infringement tracking site Excipio, the film was the most widely infringed of 2014, as it was downloaded illegally over 30 million times via BitTorrent sites. It was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, although it failed to win in any category.|$|E
500|$|The {{reason for}} the {{difficulties}} with the bell is not certain. The Whitechapel Foundry, still in business today, takes {{the position that the}} bell was either damaged in transit or was broken by an inexperienced bell ringer, who incautiously sent the clapper flying against the rim, rather than the body of the bell. In 1975, the Winterthur Museum conducted an analysis of the metal in the bell, and concluded that [...] "a series of errors made in the construction, reconstruction, and second reconstruction of the Bell resulted in a brittle bell <b>that</b> <b>barely</b> missed being broken up for scrap". The Museum found a considerably higher level of tin in the Liberty Bell than in other Whitechapel bells of that era, and suggested that Whitechapel made an error in the alloy, perhaps by using scraps {{with a high level of}} tin to begin the melt instead of the usual pure copper. The analysis found that, on the second recasting, instead of adding pure tin to the bell metal, Pass and Stow added cheap pewter with a high lead content, and incompletely mixed the new metal into the mold. The result was [...] "an extremely brittle alloy which not only caused the Bell to fail in service but made it easy for early souvenir collectors to knock off substantial trophies from the rim".|$|E
500|$|With 2:12 left, Chamberlain had 94 points, and {{he scored}} on a fadeaway for his 96th point. His next basket at 1:19 came off a lob pass from York Larese for a {{powerful}} dunk that was rare for Chamberlain. Gary M. Pomerantz in his book Wilt, 1962: The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era wrote that Chamberlain's usual [...] "Dipper Dunk" [...] was [...] "a considerably less emphatic basket stuff, like a rock <b>that</b> <b>barely</b> ripples the pond." [...] With {{less than a minute}} left in the game, Chamberlain set up in the post. Ruklick passed to Rodgers, who passed to Chamberlain close to the basket, but he missed the shot. Ted Luckenbill rebounded and passed it back to Chamberlain, who missed again. Luckenbill again rebounded and this time passed to Ruklick, who eschewed an easy layup and instead lobbed a high pass to Chamberlain. With 46 seconds left, Chamberlain got free from the five Knicks, jumped high and put the ball into the basket to hit the century mark. [...] Eyewitness accounts of the historic basket differ as to whether Chamberlain merely laid the ball in or actually stuffed the ball through the hoop for an alley-oop slam dunk. In any event, the arena exploded in a frenzy and over 200 spectators stormed the floor, wanting to touch the hero of the night. Ruklick immediately ran to the scorer's table to ensure that he was officially credited with the assist.|$|E
