5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> office herself, without appointing {{a member of the}} government to take George's place.

Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
