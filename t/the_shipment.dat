5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> {{was meant}} to supply the mutiny planned for February 1915, it was not {{dispatched}} until June of that year, by which time the conspiracy had been uncovered in India and major leaders had been arrested or gone into hiding. The plot for <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> itself failed when disastrous co-ordination prevented a successful rendezvous off Socorro Island with the Maverick. The plot had already been infiltrated by British intelligence through Indian and Irish agents linked closely with the conspiracy. Upon returning to Hoquiam, Washington after several failed attempts, the Annie Larsen's cargo was promptly seized by US customs. The cargo was sold at an auction despite the German Ambassador Count Johann von Bernstoff's attempts to take possession, insisting they were meant for German East Africa. The Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial opened in 1917 in the United States on charges of gun running {{and at the time}} was one of the lengthiest and most expensive trials in American legal history.|$|E

5|$|The Alsos Mission now {{attempted}} to recover <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> {{that had been}} sent to France. Documentation was discovered that said that part of it {{had been sent to}} Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Pash's command reached Toulouse on 1 October and inspected a French Army arsenal. They used a Geiger counter to find barrels containing 31 tons of the uranium from Belgium. Conrad persuaded Major General Frank S. Ross to release the U.S. 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company from the Red Ball Express to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>shipment.</b> The barrels were collected and transported to Marseille, where they were loaded on a ship bound for the United States. During the loading process a barrel fell into the water and had to be retrieved by a Navy diver. In Marseilles, the Alsos Mission detachment also met up with the detachment that had been sent to Italy, which now rejoined them. The remaining 49 tons of the original shipment to France were never found.|$|E

5|$|Announced in May 2014, {{development}} on Far Cry 4 began immediately after <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> of Assassin's Creed III in late 2012. The team {{originally intended to}} develop a direct sequel to Far Cry 3 that continues 3s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided {{to develop a new}} setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of Far Cry 4 were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films Ichi the Killer and Brother. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Documentation {{indicated}} that the missing uranium {{had been sent to}} Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Boris Pash's command reached Toulouse on October 1 and inspected a French Army arsenal with a Geiger counter. When the needle jumped near some barrels, they were inspected and found to be the 31 tons of uranium from Belgium. The 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company was released from the Red Ball Express to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>shipment.</b> The barrels were collected and transported to Marseilles, where Furman supervised their loading on a ship bound for the United States.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Horse {{descended from}} the French stock Louis XIV sent to Canada in the late 17th century. <b>The</b> initial <b>shipment,</b> in 1665, {{consisted}} of two stallions and twenty mares from the Royal Stables in Normandy and Brittany, the center of French horse breeding. Only 12 of the 20 mares survived the trip. Two more shipments followed, one in 1667 of 14 horses (mostly mares, but {{with at least one}} stallion), and one in 1670 of 11 mares and a stallion. <b>The</b> <b>shipments</b> included a mix of draft horses and light horses, the latter of which included both pacing and trotting horses.

5|$|On 10 January 1870, Rockefeller {{abolished}} the partnership of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, forming Standard Oil of Ohio. Continuing to apply {{his work ethic}} and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded the company {{to be the most}} profitable refiner in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> of competing products.|$|E

50|$|A failed CIA anti-drug {{operation}} in Venezuela resulted {{in at least}} a ton of cocaine being smuggled into the United States and sold on the streets. The incident, which was first made public in 1993, was part of a plan to assist an undercover agent to gain the confidence of a Colombian drug cartel. The plan involved <b>the</b> unsupervised <b>shipment</b> of hundreds of pounds of cocaine from Venezuela. The drug in <b>the</b> <b>shipments</b> was provided by the Venezuelan anti-drug unit which was working with the CIA, using cocaine seized in Venezuela. <b>The</b> <b>shipments</b> took place despite the objections of the U.S. DEA. When the failed plan came to light, the CIA officer in charge of the operation resigned, and his supervisor was transferred.|$|R

5|$|The {{line was}} heavily used for <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> of bricks from the brickworks around Brill, and of cattle and milk from the dairy farms on the Wotton estate. By 1875 {{the line was}} {{carrying}} around 40,000gallons (180,000l; 48,000USgal) of milk each year. Delivery of linseed cake to the dairy farms and of coal to the area's buildings were also important uses of the line. The line also began to carry large quantities of manure from London to the area's farms, carrying 3,200tons (3,300t) in 1872. As {{it was the only}} physical link between the Tramway and the national railway network, almost all of this traffic passed through Quainton Road station.|$|E
5|$|U.S. rhetoric abroad {{also had}} an effect on the Guatemalan {{military}}. The military had always been anti-communist, and Ambassador Peurifoy had applied {{a lot of pressure on}} senior officers ever since his arrival in Guatemala in October 1953. Árbenz had intended the secret shipment of weapons from the Alfhem to be used to bolster peasant militias, in the event of army disloyalty. But the U.S. informed army chiefs of <b>the</b> <b>shipment,</b> forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and his top generals.|$|E
5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped through the mail. New Jersey effectively prohibits <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> {{of beer and}} spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.|$|E

5|$|In April 1920, Hananu coordinated <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> of Turkish arms to Saleh al-Ali's {{forces in}} their {{revolt against the}} French in the coastal {{mountains}} south of Latakia. Faisal's government aided Hananu's movement financially and logistically via local Arab nationalist intermediaries. French General Henri Gouraud demanded that Faisal rein in the rebels of northern Syria and end their resistance to the French military advance. Faisal continued to oppose French rule and his government launched a campaign to conscript soldiers from throughout the country in May {{as part of a}} last-ditch effort to defend Damascus against a French invasion, but the recruitment campaign was unsuccessful. On 14 July, Gouraud issued an ultimatum to Faisal to demobilize his makeshift Arab Army and recognize France's mandate over Syria. Later in mid-July, French forces broke Hananu's resistance lines in Jisr al-Shughur, capturing the town on their way to Aleppo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s British {{intelligence}} {{learned that the}} ANO held accounts with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in London. BCCI was closed in July 1991 by banking regulators in six countries after evidence emerged of widespread fraud. Abu Nidal himself {{was said to have}} visited London using the name Shakar Farhan; a BCCI branch manager, who passed information about the ANO accounts to MI5, reportedly drove him around several stores in London without realizing who he was. Abu Nidal was using a company called SAS International Trading and Investments in Warsaw as cover for arms deals. The company's transactions included the purchase of riot guns, ostensibly for Syria, then when the British refused an export licence to Syria, for an African state; in fact half <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> went to the police in East Germany and half to Abu Nidal.|$|E
5|$|On 18July 1936, {{war broke}} out on the Iberian {{peninsula}} as Spain dissolved {{into a state of}} civil war. After the chaos of the initial uprising, two opposing sides coalesced and began to consolidate their position—the Popular front (the Republicans) and the Spanish Nationalist front. In an early example of a proxy war, both sides quickly received support from other countries, most notably the Soviet Union and Germany as both wanted to test their tactics and equipment. The first shipment of foreign tanks, 50 Soviet T-26s, arrived on the 15 of October. <b>The</b> <b>shipment</b> was under the surveillance of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and Germany immediately responded by sending 41 PanzerI's to Spain a few days later.
