5|$|In the {{following}} season, the Lakers won 26 {{of their first}} 39 games, but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40. They were eliminated {{in the first round}} by Phoenix again. Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the offseason. Buss initially agreed to seek a trade, but also worked <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> Bryant's mind.|$|E
5|$|Most of Æthelred's time as {{archbishop}} {{was spent}} {{dealing with the}} effects of Viking raids, but he also had a conflict with King Alfred the Great over royal control of ecclesiastical affairs. It was during Æthelred's archbishopric that the Golden Gospels, a still-surviving 8th century gospel book, was ransomed from a raiding army and donated to Canterbury. Pope John VIII also urged Æthelred and Archbishop Wulfhere of York to reform the dress of the English clergy. The Anglo-Saxon clergy wore the short tunic that was the normal costume of the laypeople of Britain. The Roman custom, however, was to wear long clerical robes or habits, and the Anglo-Saxon custom was opposed by the papacy and other continental clergy. Whether Æthelred and Wulfred took steps <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the dress of their clergy is unknown, but the clothing customs of the Anglo-Saxon clergy did not change.|$|E

50|$|During the Middle Ages, the Christian {{church had}} vast {{influence}} on European society and charity {{was considered to}} be a responsibility and a sign of one’s piety. This charity was in the form of direct relief (for example, giving money, food, or other material goods to alleviate a particular need), as opposed <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the root causes of poverty. As there was no effective bureaucracy below city government that was capable of large scale charitable activities, the clergy carried out this role until the Early Modern Period.|$|R

[...] Despite this media and public relations training, industry sources stated, [...] "They gave him talking points and he just didn't execute". [...] The same sources also noted that, while [...] "Parker seemed at times to understand the need to emphasize his sorrow about the devastating impact of the 1999 encounter on {{the woman at the}} center of the charges, sources say when the cameras rolled he reverted to his original position." [...] In an October 2016 60 Minutes interview, Parker maintained that he was innocent of the crime and that he did not feel guilty about it, but conceded that, from the perspective of a 36-year-old man, he had done something morally wrong.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} side of the issue are those who have claimed that the {{increase}} is not significant, that it doesn't matter because America's economic growth and/or equality of opportunity are what's important, that it is a global phenomenon which would be foolish <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> through US domestic policy, that it [...] "has many economic benefits and is the result of ... a well-functioning economy", and has or may become an excuse for [...] "class-warfare rhetoric", and may lead to policies that [...] "reduce the well-being of wealthier individuals".|$|E
2500|$|About 1820–1821, news {{of these}} sacrifices reached the East Coast; it caused a {{sensation}} among European Americans. Before this, US Indian agents had counseled Pawnee chiefs {{to suppress the}} practice, as they warned of how it would upset the American settlers, who were arriving in ever greater number. [...] Knife Chief ransomed at least two captives before sacrifice. For any individual, it was extremely difficult <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> a practice tied so closely to Pawnee belief in the annual renewal {{of life for the}} tribe. In June 1818, the Missouri Gazette of St. Louis contained the account of a sacrifice. The last known sacrifice was of Haxti, a 14-year-old Oglala Lakota girl, on April 22, 1838.|$|E
2500|$|Carpenter's {{first act}} was <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the team's name (and more importantly, its {{image as a}} chronic loser) to the [...] "Blue Jays" [...] after a citywide vote on a new nickname. [...] In announcing the change, Carpenter said [...] "he had always admired the blue jay and its scrappy qualities." [...] However, [...] "Phillies" [...] {{continued}} {{to appear on the}} team's jerseys, with a blue jay appearing on the sleeves. The student council of Johns Hopkins University, whose varsity teams are also known as the Blue Jays, vehemently protested Carpenter's decision, claiming that the change dishonored their school due to the Phillies' losing history. [...] The nickname was officially dropped on January 10, 1950.|$|E

5000|$|Promotion of {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) has been used <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> overcome <b>change</b> resistance <b>to</b> solving social problems, including environmental sustainability.

At the committee's inaugural meeting, Livni characterized the Palestinian motion as [...] "part of an orchestrated diplomatic and legal struggle that is meant to create legitimacy for a Palestinian state with all that that means, and to deny legitimacy to the State of Israel." [...] She argued that despite the lack of attention it receives, [...] " [...] is a war front as any other." [...] The committee's mandate, according to Livni, is to [...] "deal with lawfare not only to see how we can defend ourselves, but also <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> international trends against Israel in a legal context and how to deal with moves the Palestinians are trying to make over Israel's head." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Willingham's claims about student-athlete literacy, UNC released another report by {{a board of}} educational experts outside the university that examined data between 2004 and 2012. That report {{found that there were}} 341 men’s and women’s basketball players and football players during these years; of this group, 34 students did not meet CNN’s threshold of being [...] "college literate", which meant a minimum SAT reading score of 400 or an ACT score of 16; essentially, the university suggested that of its athletes, ten percent had academic issues. This is in contrast with the allegation by Mary Willingham, based on her personal investigations, that 60% of college athletes were not [...] "college literate". In another of her analyses, she found that 150 to 200 of 400 student-athletes were [...] "underperforming", some [...] "badly underperforming", with the last group being mostly made of men's and women's players of basketball and football. One view suggested that the university's {{response to}} these and other allegations was <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the focus away from wrongdoing, in part by challenging Willingham's assertions and research. The review board disputed her findings on the grounds that her methodology was not appropriate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} the plan was {{explained}} in Der Weltkrieg by showing that command in the German armies was often conducted with vague knowledge of {{the circumstances of the}} French, the intentions of other commanders and the locations of other German units. Communication was botched from the start and orders could take hours or days to reach units or never arrive. Auftragstaktik, the decentralised system of command that allowed local commanders discretion within the commander's intent, operated at the expense of co-ordination. Aerial reconnaissance had more influence on decisions than was sometimes apparent in writing on the war but it was a new technology, the results of which could contradict reports from ground reconnaissance and be difficult for commanders to resolve. It always seemed that the German armies were on the brink of victory, yet the French kept retreating too fast for the German advance to surround them or cut their lines of communication. Decisions to change direction or <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> a local success into a strategic victory, were taken by army commanders ignorant of their part in the OHL plan, which frequently changed. Der Weltkrieg portrays Moltke (the Younger) in command of a war machine [...] "on autopilot", with no mechanism of central control.|$|E

5000|$|In February 1927, in a {{hotel on}} the Rue du Sommerard in Paris, France, {{a small group of}} seven {{military}} and civilian students assembled to debate the founding of a party <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bring <b>change</b> <b>to</b> Siam. Intent on not wanting to repeat the failure of the 1912 plot, they laid out a clear and coherent plan <b>to</b> <b>change</b> Siam. This group included two young students: one a soldier and an artilleryman Plaek Khittasangkha, the other a law student and radical Pridi Panomyong. The group called themselves the [...] "Promoters" [...] (ผู้ก่อการ), hoping <b>to</b> return home <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> promote <b>change.</b> The Promoters realised, ironically, as the king's advisors had done, that the Siamese people were not yet ready for democracy, and most were illiterate peasants with little concern for affairs in Bangkok. In Bangkok itself, the new and emerging middle class was dependent on the patronage of the aristocracy for jobs and positions. As a result, they realised that a [...] "mass revolution" [...] was not possible and only a military-led coup d'état was possible. For this purpose a vanguard party was formed and it was named the Khana Ratsadon (คณะราษฎร) (or the People's Party).|$|R

Had they been allowed they would have come alongside and climbed up to the deck, but the captain would not permit them to come within thirty or forty yards. Although {{there was no one}} on board who could speak their language, his emphatic gestures were understood by the natives, and were sufficient to show them that he was not to be trifled with. Two boats only were allowed to approach at a time, and a guard of six sailors with muskets were placed on deck with orders to prevent anyone coming up, and to cover those who descended the gangway. The younger passengers thought that the captain was unnecessarily timid; but ready as he was to oblige them on ordinary occasions, they saw that this time it would be no use <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his determination that none should go on shore. Going down the gangway they bargained with the natives, giving little articles in exchange for fruit.|$|E
