5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E

5|$|The far-infrared (24–70μm) and {{submillimeter}} (70–500μm) photometry {{performed by}} Spitzer and Herschel telescopes {{revealed that the}} surface of Makemake is not homogeneous. Although the majority of it is covered by nitrogen and methane ices, where the albedo ranges from 78 to 90%, there are small patches of dark terrain whose albedo is only 2 to 12%, and that make up 3–7% of the surface. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> were made before S/2015 (136472) 1 was discovered; thus, these small dark patches may actually have been the dark surface of the satellite rather than any actual surface features on Makemake. However, another experiment has refuted <b>these</b> <b>studies.</b> Between 2006 and 2013, the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo acquired new visible and near infra-red spectra for Makemake that covered nearly 80% of its surface; this {{study found that the}} variation in the spectra were negligible, suggesting that Makemake's surface may indeed be homogenous.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow for}} track or {{forecast}} uncertainties, usually several model runs with varying input parameters are generated {{to create a}} map of MOMs, or Maximum of Maximums.

5|$|Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned {{as part of}} {{a diverse}} family of {{commercial}} aircraft. In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.|$|E

5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for <b>these</b> <b>studies.</b> The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E
