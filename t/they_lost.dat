5|$|In August 2011, Arsenal {{suffered}} their heaviest league {{defeat in}} 84 years as <b>they</b> <b>lost</b> 8–2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Arsenal had not lost a league game {{by such a}} margin since 1927 when <b>they</b> <b>lost</b> 7–0 to West Ham United in the old Football League First Division. This {{was also the first}} time they had conceded eight goals in a game since 1896, when <b>they</b> <b>lost</b> 8–0 to the now defunct Loughborough in the old Football League Second Division. A year later, striker Robin van Persie joined United, having stated that he would not renew his contract with Arsenal. It was speculated that he would move to a club overseas, but signed for the Manchester club, the first Arsenal player to do so since Viv Anderson in 1987. Ferguson called Wenger to push through a deal when he learnt of the contract situation. Van Persie was instrumental in United's league win of 2012–13 – Ferguson's last, and coincidentally received a guard of honour by his former teammates before United faced Arsenal at the Emirates in April 2013.|$|E

No, they said, they COULDN'T absolutely know whether <b>they</b> were <b>lost</b> or not, because none of them had ever been in that part of the country before. They had a strong instinct that <b>they</b> were <b>lost,</b> but <b>they</b> had no proofs--except that they did not know where they were.
