50|$|The two-pipe reverse return {{configuration}} {{which is}} sometimes called 'the three-pipe system' is different to the <b>two-pipe</b> <b>system</b> {{in the way that}} water returns to the boiler.

5000|$|Power flue—Fanned flues use the {{pressure}} {{created by a}} fan to power the movement of outside air into the appliance and combustion products to external air. Thus air and flue ducts can be much longer, of smaller diameter, and include changes of direction. Most ducting is concentric; the air duct contains the smaller flue duct within it. Thus a leak from the inner flue duct will only leak the exhaust into the appliance rather than into a room. However longer runs are possible with <b>two-pipe</b> <b>systems</b> where the flue and air ducts run separately. Instead of using closed flues, some power flues use open flues, taking combustion air from the room housing the appliance. As with all open flues, the provision of adequate ventilation to supply combustion air to such appliances is vitally important.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} room thermostat with Microchip PIC microcontroller. Thermostat is designated for <b>two-pipe</b> heating <b>system.</b> The microprocessor controls thermostatic valve via electric actuator with mechanical gear unit. The room thermostat uses for its activity measurements of air temperature {{in the room and}} calorimetric measurement of heat, which is served to the radiator. These features predestinate it mainly for underfloor heating regulation. The thermostat is designed to work in a network. Communication with heating system's central control unit is proceeded via RS 485 bus with proprietary communication protocol. If the communication failure occurs the thermostat is able to work separately. The system uses its own real time clock circuit and memory with heating programs. These programs are able to cover the whole heating season. The method of position discontinuous PSD control is used in this equipment. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The whole thesis was {{designed}} to investigate the relationship between energy efficiency and thermal comfort {{with regard to the}} way heat distribution in the passive house as well as control efficiency. In order to verify the assumed also performed simulations in the IDA Indoor Climate and Energy, which is a modern tool for simulation. 	When conducting the analysis of the influence, founded the air temperature in the building, the impact of heat distribution method, as well as closing the door openings and pipe insulation, on energy efficiency and thermal comfort in the test building (located in Trondheim, Norway). Considered temperature situations were divided into: - Stable temperature equal to 21 ºC - Room temperature variable during the day - during the day and hour 7 am to 11 pm, the temperature is 21 degrees whereas at night - would fall to 19 degrees. - The last case, the most complicated, similarly as in the previous case that varies in temperature during the day, but in addition, during the year (at Christmas - 25. 12 to 31. 12), the temperature would drop to 16 degrees because of the absence inhabitants. 	Among the above-mentioned objectives in terms of comfort, most preferably dropped situation where temperature change followed only during the day. The most unfavorable in this respect {{turned out to be an}} option with the temperature at a constant level. 	The most efficient option is to maintain a constant air temperature in the room. This is due to the increased energy demand, which occurs when you need to increase the temperature from 19 ºC (night) to 21 ºC (day). 	Another factor that could have a potential impact on thermal comfort and energy efficiency model was the way the distribution of heat in the building. Two possibilities were taken into consideration: - Standard system - where one radiator falls on one room, <b>two-pipe</b> <b>system</b> - Simplified layout - lines also carried out a <b>two-pipe</b> <b>system,</b> and the heaters are located one on the floor. 	With the introduction of this assumption, it turned out that a change in the distribution of heat does not have too much impact on altering perception of comfort but only if we make the assumption unhindered flow of air masses (warm) between the two rooms. Otherwise (assuming no heat flow) streamlined solution causes a strong feeling of thermal discomfort caused by excessive fluctuations in temperature between the rooms. This is where there is the need to adopt and verify the assumptions next - door open / closed. 	The last inspected the condition insulate distribution lines to the radiator heating medium. In the absence of pipe insulation heat loss to the environment they were almost twice as high as when the pipes were insulated. This could affect the feeling of comfort in the case of high-temperature heating. 	Based on these studies it was concluded that the best solution due to thermal comfort, energy efficiency, and even the economic aspect is to simplify the heating distribution system with mandatory leaving the door open and establish a constant temperature equal to 21 ºC in the analyzed object...|$|E
40|$|The {{main concern}} of this thesis is to design heating system for 5 storey {{apartment}} building in two alternatives of heat source - with a heat pump and with traditional gas boiler. Both applications are connected to <b>two-pipes</b> distribution <b>system</b> in building using the low-temperature water and radiators. The proposal takes account of the the production of hot water. The one of aims is to compare both variants also from the economic point of view. The experimental part {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part deals with the obligation to control efficiency of boilers, imposed by the Energy efficiency law No. 177 / 2006 Co. and § 6, sect. 2 - 5 and related regulation No. 276 / 2007 Co. The second part deals with the assessment of monitored room for proper regulation of the heating system...|$|R
40|$|Heating and {{ventilation}} systems {{are designed for}} an industrial building in this final work. These systems are projected to maintain standard microclimate parameters in premises. The systems are designed {{in accordance with the}} construction regulations and hygiene standards and regulations applicable in the Republic of Lithuania. A collector heating system is designed in an administrative part of the building and a <b>two-pipe</b> heating <b>system</b> - in the premises of the other purpose. Ventilation is superposed with heating in the premises of storage and production assembling. Two condensing boilers of gaseous fuel with a total thermal capacity of 246 kW are chosen for the production of the coolant. By evaluating the technological process ongoing in the premises and simultaneity of work, four mechanical air supply/disposal systems are designed. Equipment, diffusers of air supply and nozzles of air extraction, diffusors of the extracted air and grids are chosen. Natural ventilation is designed in the boiler room, unloading premise and in the utility premises. In order to ventilate the premise of the accumulator charging with a portal-sluice located in the industrial building, separate systems of air disposal and air supply are designed. The disposal of air is being projected from the zones of upper and lower premises. The equipment of air disposal system, materials and products are designed as suitable for work in a potentially explosive atmosphere. Equipment, products and materials of all systems are chosen.
