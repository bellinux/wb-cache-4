5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide the best way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they move through the tunnel, {{in order to avoid}} blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies {{to get rid of the}} deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E

The level of inequality should be less.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} state merlin lofts, in Semyonovskoye (in modern Sokolniki Park) and Kolomenskoye. An Italian ambassador, Horatio Calvucci, {{had been trying}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> sketch at least one bird for six months; the embassy finally gained an access on February 13, 1662. In 1805 there were only fifteen hunting birds left in Semyonovskoye. The last event with hunting birds {{occurred}} during the coronation of Alexander II. The golden eagles were taken from Orenburg Governorate to hunt for wolves and foxes at that time.|$|E
25|$|Bell diving bailout options: For bell dives {{there is}} no {{requirement}} for decompression gas, as the bell itself carries bailout gas. However at extreme depths the diver will use gas fast, {{and there have been}} cases where twin 10 litre 300 bar sets were required to supply sufficient gas. Another option which has been used for extreme depth is a rebreather bailout set. A limitation for this service is that the diver must be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the bell while wearing the bailout equipment.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before his}} accident, Reeve played a paralyzed {{police officer in}} the HBO special Above Suspicion. He did {{research}} at a rehabilitation hospital in Van Nuys and learned {{how to use a}} wheelchair <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of cars. Reeve was then offered the lead in Kidnapped, to be shot in Ireland. He was excited to be going to Ireland, and he and Dana decided that they would conceive their second child there.

Not long after making these plans, the family went to Culpeper, Virginia, for an equestrian competition.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 100,000 people {{lined the}} streets of Manhattan {{to pay their respects}} at his funeral, handled by the Frank Campbell Funeral Home. Suicides of despondent fans were reported. Windows were smashed as fans tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> an all-day riot erupted on August 24. Over 100 mounted officers and NYPD's Police Reserve were deployed to restore order. A phalanx of officers lined the streets {{for the remainder of the}} viewing. Polish actress Pola Negri, claiming to be Valentino's fiancée, collapsed in hysterics while standing over the coffin, and Campbell hired four actors to impersonate a Fascist Blackshirt honor guard, purportedly sent by Benito Mussolini Media reports that the body on display in the main salon was not Valentino but a decoy were continually denied by Campbell.|$|E
25|$|History {{indicates}} that Policarpa {{was not involved}} in politics before 1810, but by the time she moved back to Bogotá in 1817, she was actively participating in political issues. Because Bogotá was the stronghold of the Reconquista, where most of the population were Spanish Royalists and approved of the take over by Pablo Morillo, it was very difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the city. Policarpa and her brother Bibiano entered the capital with forged documents and safeguards, and a letter of introduction written by Ambrosio Almeyda and José Rodríguez, two Revolutionary leaders; they recommended she and her brother stay in the house of Andrea Ricaurte y Lozano under cover of working as her servants. In reality Andrea Ricaurte's home was the centre of intelligence gathering and resistance in the capital.|$|E

25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone {{but the reason}} for that is a little harder to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{production}} model was the F-94A, which entered operational service in May 1950. Its armament was four 0.50in (12.7mm) M3 Browning machine guns {{mounted in the}} fuselage with the muzzles exiting just behind the radome. Two 165US Gallon (1,204 litre) drop tanks, as carried by the F-80 and T-33, could be carried beneath the wingtips. Alternatively, these could be replaced by 1,000lb (454kg) bombs, giving the aircraft a secondary fighter bomber role. 109 were produced. The F-94A was in operational service for only a brief time as it was originally built, and was not received well by its aircrews. Primarily, {{this was due to}} the unreliability of its J33 engine, which caused many ground aborts and was deemed by the crews to be unsafe. The aircraft was judged as unstable and hard to maneuver at high altitude by its pilots. The pilot and radar operator found that the cockpit was too narrow for them to be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the aircraft quickly during alerts and scrambles. The clearance for the ejection seats was too small, resulting in several tragic accidents during emergency ejections.|$|E

Filming took place in Big Bear Lake, California, a location previously used in the seventh season for Yang and Shepherd's fishing trip. Commenting on the filming conditions, Leigh said: [...] "It would rain and be sunny and hot. I never died before [...] That sounds funny saying that. I think everyone has an emotional wellspring and that {{happened to be a}} moment where I was sprung. Everybody was very accommodating — the crew, cast. And I opted to stay underneath [...] for the most part over two days rather than trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out." ...|$|E

500|$|With Sinclair's new {{specifications}} in hand, Ogle {{worked on}} a three-wheeled design dubbed the C5, which bore similarities with the earlier three-wheeled Bond Bug – another Ogle design. The vehicle's handlebar steering {{was the brainchild of}} Wood Rogers, who decided at the outset that a steering wheel would not be practicable as it would make it impossible for a driver <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out easily – a serious safety disadvantage. He comments that [...] "putting the bars at the driver's sides made it easy to steer and felt very natural". A prototype was presented to 63 families in the A, B, C1 and C2 demographic groups in suburban and town environments to determine that the controls were correctly positioned; this was the only external research carried out on the C5. In the autumn of 1983, Wills brought in Lotus Cars to finish the vehicle's detailing, build prototypes and test rigs, carry out testing and take forward the programme to production. The development of the C5 took place over 19 months in conditions of great secrecy, with testing carried out at the Motor Industry Research Association's proving ground in Leicestershire.|$|E
500|$|The Griffins {{call the}} FBI to {{hopefully}} get Meg back, but the FBI {{say that a}} person must be missing for 96 hours before they could take action (even though, the FBI agents admit it's not likely they'll find her alive after she's been missing that long). Concerned by it, Brian and Stewie get to Paris themselves {{to take matters into}} their own hands and save Meg. They find out where the men took Meg, who is about to be sold as a sex slave. At the auction, Stewie dresses up as a slave and Brian dresses as an Arab <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> Stewie is sold to Brian (for $500,000). However, Brian cannot afford to pay for Stewie, and the guard uncovers their disguises. They are chained to a pipe downstairs, but Brian breaks free and overpowers the guard. They then follow Meg and her captors to a yacht traveling down the River Seine. On board, Meg is delivered to an Arab emir waiting in the master stateroom. After Meg refuses to be his sex slave, the emir reveals he bought her not to be a sex slave but to be his son's wife. The king introduces his teenage son, the young prince of the kingdom, who calls Meg a [...] "goddess" [...] and asks her to marry him or if she declines he will have her flown back to America on their private jet. Meg agrees to marry him, but Stewie then kills the prince, uses a neuralizer on Meg, and takes her to a French hospital for treatment before taking her home safely.|$|E

2500|$|The {{television}} series The Dukes of Hazzard (1979–1985) featured an orange 1969 Dodge Charger that was named The General Lee.

The windows were always open, as the doors were supposedly welded shut for racing, and the actors would do a window slide <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out. The number [...] "01" [...] is painted on both doors. Also, when the horn button was pressed, it played the first 12 notes from the de facto Confederate States anthem [...] "Dixie". The car performed spectacular jumps in almost every episode, and the show's popularity produced consumer interest in the car.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} well-received critically. It {{currently}} has {{a rating of}} 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 16 reviews. In David Ansen's review for Newsweek magazine, he wrote that the film [...] "works equally as a love story, a baseball fable and a comedy, while ignoring the clichés of each genre". Vincent Canby praised Shelton's direction in his review for The New York Times; [...] "he demonstrates the sort of expert comic timing and control that allow him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of situations so quickly that they're over before one has time to question them. Part of the fun in watching Bull Durham is in the awareness that a clearly seen vision is being realized. This is one first-rate debut".|$|E
