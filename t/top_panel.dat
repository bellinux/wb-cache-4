It is available in eight two-toned colors, varying by region such as white, green, red, yellow, and pink. Two special-edition models were released: those for LovePlus+ and the 25th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. Flipnote Studio and the Nintendo DSi Browser come pre-installed with the DSi XL, alongside other, region-specific software.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the few}} {{remaining}} complaints with the Merlin-powered aircraft was a poor rearward view. The canopy structure, which was the same as the Allison-engined Mustangs, was made up of flat, framed panels; the pilot gained access, or exited the cockpit by lowering the port side panel and raising the <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> to the right. The canopy could not be opened in flight and tall pilots especially, were hampered by limited headroom. In order to at least partially improve the view from the Mustang, the British had field-modified some Mustangs with clear, sliding canopies called Malcolm hoods (designed by Robert Malcolm), and whose design had also been adopted by the U.S. Navy's own F4U-1D version of the Corsair in April 1944.|$|E

3000|$|... (<b>top</b> <b>panels)</b> {{the time}} scales are well {{separated}} {{and the system}} is fast-slow. Trajectories move first fast in almost horizontal directions, then they slow down as they approach the v-nullcline, and finally they reverse direction and move towards the fixed point in close vicinities of the displaced v-nullcline. This effect is more pronounced for smaller values of α (compare <b>top</b> <b>panels</b> a and b) because of the product αϵ in (30), which affects the effective time scales. As α decreases so does {{the slope of the}} v-nullcline, thus “pressing” trajectories that become more “compacted”. As ϵ increases (from the top to the bottom panels), the separation of time scales decreases, trajectories become more “rounded”, and reach lower maximal values of v.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the inaugural}} model year (1997), only the {{fastback}} coupé (more like a hatchback coupé) was offered, with the convertible – {{the first to}} offer a trunk since 1962. In 1999, a third body style, the hardtop (also {{referred to as the}} [...] "fixed-roof coupé" [...] or [...] "FRC"), was added to the lineup. This body style, as its name suggests, featured a fixed top (no removable targa <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> as with the fastback coupé) with a roofline shape and trunk space {{similar to that of the}} convertible, as well as a distinctive notchback-style rear window.|$|E

The case α=2 (center panel) is the maximally flat design that shows no peaking in the Bode gain vs. frequency plot. That design has {{the rule of thumb}} built-in safety margin to deal with non-ideal realities like multiple poles (or zeros), nonlinearity (signal amplitude dependence) and manufacturing variations, any of which can lead to too much overshoot. The adjustment of the pole separation (that is, settingα) is the subject of frequency compensation, and one such method is pole splitting.|$|E
2500|$|Sueno's Stone is {{an upright}} cross slab with typical Pictish style {{interwoven}} vine symbols {{on the edge}} panels. It is carved from Old Red Sandstone which is prevalent in the Laigh o' Moray but has suffered considerable weathering in places. The western face has a carved Celtic cross with elaborately interlaced decoration and a poorly preserved figural scene (perhaps a royal inauguration) set in a panel below the cross. The east face has four panels that show a large battle scene. The <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> is quite weathered and shows rows of horsemen. [...] The second panel depicts armed foot soldiers and the third panel shows the decapitated vanquished soldiers, the heads piled up, and soldiers, archers and horsemen surrounding {{what may be a}} broch. [...] The base panel depicts the victorious army leaving the battlefield. [...] The sides are also elaborately carved. [...] In the early 1990s the stone was encased in armoured glass to prevent further erosion and also graffiti.|$|E

5000|$|CKEY-FM was a {{reporter}} to the American rhythmic <b>top</b> 40 <b>panel</b> on Mediabase and Nielsen BDS (and also reported on the Canadian <b>top</b> 40 <b>panel</b> on Nielsen BDS), but in 2005, CKEY-FM moved to the American <b>top</b> 40 <b>panel</b> on Mediabase and Nielsen BDS.

Another station, CKBT-FM in Kitchener, Ontario (which debuted as rhythmic top 40 in 2004, only to go top 40 in 2005), retains the rhythmic lean.

2500|$|If closed, the pustaha takes {{form of a}} beast {{standing}} on its four hooves. The <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> is surmounted with a carved representation of the serpent-like animal {{with the head of}} a singa. At the bottom panel is four legs or hooves. Achim Sibeth commented that the animal is the representation of the Naga Padoha, a primordial water serpent that rules the underworld. A Batak creation myth told that {{back in the days when}} there was only sea, the serpent stirred up sand from the ocean bed to create the first islands which create the islands of Indonesia. Other expert thinks that the figure represents the singa. The word singa, borrowed from Sanskrit singa meaning [...] "lion", dates back to contact with Hindu traders in the southern Batak area. In Batak culture however, the singa itself is a complicated mythical creature related to the female serpent. An example of the representation of a singa can be found in a wooden animal head that was collected by Tassilo Adam, a German planter who is also an enthusiast in Batak Toba culture.|$|E
