5|$|Astronomers have {{discovered}} nearly 500 planetary systems with multiple planets. Regularly these systems include a few planets with masses several {{times greater than}} Earth's (super-Earths), orbiting closer to <b>their</b> <b>star</b> than Mercury is to the Sun, and sometimes also Jupiter-mass gas giants close to <b>their</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{projections}} {{of the future of}} the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters gravitationally fling planets from <b>their</b> <b>star</b> systems, and star systems from galaxies.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} summer, the Jubilee Rink burned down, forcing the Canadiens to build Mount Royal Arena as a replacement. The team also lost <b>their</b> <b>star</b> player Malone, {{who had been}} on loan from the dormant Bulldogs as Quebec rejoined the league in 1919–20. Kennedy died in 1921; he had never recovered from the 1919 flu. His widow sold the team to Leo Dandurand, former player Joseph Cattarinich and Louis A. Letourneau.|$|E

5|$|Exocomets {{beyond the}} Solar System {{have also been}} {{detected}} and may be common in the Milky Way. The first exocomet system detected was around Beta Pictoris, a very young A-type main-sequence star, in 1987. A total of 10 such exocomet systems have been identified , using the absorption spectrum caused by the large clouds of gas emitted by comets when passing close to <b>their</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kepler-9c {{is one of}} {{the first}} seven extrasolar planets, exoplanets, {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, and one of at least two planets orbiting the star Kepler-9. Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were the first exoplanets confirmed to be transiting <b>their</b> <b>star.</b> The planet's discovery was announced by the Kepler Mission team on August 26, 2010 after its initial discovery by Kepler. At the time, it was one of 700 planetary candidates noted by Kepler.|$|E
5|$|New inductees are {{inducted}} annually at an unveiling ceremony where <b>their</b> <b>star,</b> {{a stylized}} maple leaf, is revealed. The first {{was held in}} 1998 and only four of the twelve living inductees attended: Karen Kain, Norman Jewison, Barbara Ann Scott and Rich Little. The 2007 ceremony was held at Toronto's Hummingbird Centre, was attended by all seven inductees and was hosted by Eugene Levy.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 and its planets were {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around <b>their</b> <b>stars.</b> The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness {{can be interpreted}} as planets whose orbits move in front of <b>their</b> <b>stars</b> from the perspective of Earth. Kepler-11 is the first discovered exoplanetary system with more than three transiting planets.|$|R

5|$|There are exoplanets {{that are}} much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, {{and there are also}} exoplanets {{that are much}} farther from <b>their</b> <b>star.</b> Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 AU, takes 88-days for an orbit, but the {{shortest}} known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. Kepler-70b. The Kepler-11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury's, all of them much more massive than Mercury. Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of AU from <b>their</b> <b>star</b> and take more than a thousand years to orbit, e.g. 1RXS1609 b.|$|E
5|$|After four largely injury-free seasons, {{the muscular}} {{injuries}} {{that had previously}} plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench {{in the second half}} and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on <b>their</b> <b>star</b> player.|$|E

5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross in front of <b>their</b> <b>star</b> as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than}} a degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E
5|$|As the {{cover-up}} begins, a copy-cat killing occurs, but McNulty quickly identifies and arrests the culprit. Pearlman tells McNulty and Freamon {{that they can}} no longer be allowed to do investigative work and warns of criminal charges if the scandal becomes public. They opt to retire. Haynes attempts to expose Templeton but the managing editors ignore the fabrications and demote anyone critical of <b>their</b> <b>star</b> reporter. Carcetti pressures Daniels to falsify crime statistics to aid his campaign. Daniels refuses and then quietly resigns rather than have his FBI file leaked.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>their</b> <b>Star</b> Search audition, Johnny and the Moondogs {{changed their}} name to Japage 3 (combining letters {{from each of}} the member's names: John, Paul, and George). Lennon had a friend from art school, named Derek Hodkin, who owned a tape recorder, and Lennon {{convinced}} him to record the group (along with McCartney's brother Mike on drums). The group then asked Hodkin to act as their manager, and he agreed. Despite Hodkin's management, bookings for the group dried up. Harrison began a stint as rhythm guitarist in the Les Stewart Quartet, who had a weekly club engagement. By May, Japage 3 was defunct, although the three continued to see each other socially, and Lennon and McCartney continued to write songs together.|$|E

5|$|In 1890, a {{labor dispute}} {{led to the}} {{formation}} of a new league, composed of most of the better players from the National League. Although he was invited to join the competing league, Sunday's conscience would not allow him to break his contract with Pittsburgh. Sunday was named team captain, and he was <b>their</b> <b>star</b> player, but the team suffered one of the worst seasons in baseball history. By August the team had no money to meet its payroll, and Sunday was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for two players and $1,000 in cash.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Tigers had an {{unexpectedly}} strong season. Their chief rivals, the Yomiuri Giants, lost <b>their</b> <b>star</b> player Hideki Matsui to the New York Yankees, while the Tigers saw {{the return of}} pitcher Hideki Irabu back to NPB after playing with the Texas Rangers. The Tigers won the Central League {{to qualify for the}} Japan Series, and many newspapers speculated that the Curse of the Colonel had finally been broken. The Tigers lost the Japan Series, this time to the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, so the curse is presumably intact.|$|E
5|$|In the 3000 m team race on {{the next}} day, Nurmi and Ritola again {{finished}} first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth. Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between <b>their</b> <b>star</b> runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the distance that was dearest to him. After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years. He now held the 1500 m, the mile, the 3000 m, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m world records simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|The IRFU {{continued}} {{under the}} larger {{auspices of the}} Canadian Rugby Union. Beginning in 1909, the CRU champion was awarded the Grey Cup, with the Big Four competing against university squads and eventually teams from Western Canada. The Argonauts first competed for the Cup in 1911, losing 14 to 7 to the University of Toronto {{in front of a}} then record 13,687 spectators at the newly opened Varsity Stadium. The team would claim their first championship in 1914, exacting revenge on U of T with a 14 to 2 victory. <b>Their</b> <b>star</b> runner and kicker in their first championship year was Jack O'Conner, who scored a league record 44 points.|$|E
5|$|There are {{types of}} planets {{that do not}} exist in the Solar System: super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of {{volatiles}} and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet. There are hot Jupiters that orbit very close to <b>their</b> <b>star</b> and may evaporate to become chthonian planets, which are the leftover cores. Another possible type of planet is carbon planets, which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.|$|E

40|$|Most known extrasolar planets (exoplanets) {{have been}} {{discovered}} using the radial velocity or transit methods. Both are biased towards planets that are relatively close to <b>their</b> parent <b>stars,</b> and studies find that around 17 – 30 % of solar-like stars host a planet.
