5|$|By 1985, Bobby and Pam {{realize that}} they want to be together. Bobby proposes, Pam accepts and they spend the night together. The next day, Bobby is tragically cut down by a car driven by her half-sister, Katherine Wentworth, and dies hours later, leaving Pam heartbroken. Pam goes on to make {{television}} history by dreaming Bobby's death. Pam awakes and finds Bobby in the shower, alive and well.

5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging {{her to come}} and see him so they can be together. The letter reaches her just before she can take the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that he wanted to give to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding. She must tell Charming she does not love him, or the King will kill him. Snow obeys because she loves Charming too much to let him die, but both are left heartbroken. Snow leaves and is soon joined by Grumpy and six other dwarfs, who offer her a place to stay. She considers the potion but Grumpy warns her that those feelings however painful, are part of her. Charming calls off the wedding to look for Snow and the dwarves hear about it from Red Riding Hood. Grumpy joyfully tells Snow <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> but she has forgotten about Charming. The pain was too great to bear and she drank the potion.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Döblin's 18-year-old son Stefan {{was called}} up for {{military}} service in the French army. That spring had brought <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance, and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead, having committed suicide five years earlier. In October 1945 Alfred and Erna arrived in New York, sailing aboard the Argentine back to Europe. They first settled in Baden-Baden, where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative {{for the office of}} public education; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication, and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism, such as Ernst Jünger or Gottfried Benn. In postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate, Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author, yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany's intellectual and cultural life, reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and fostering the growth of younger writers. Despite these efforts, Döblin was disappointed by the apparent continuity between the Nazi years and the postwar climate. His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of isolation and marginalization within the postwar German literary scene. In 1953 Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in East Berlin.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} into the neutrality of the narrative discussion of financial performance and position, as evidenced in 179 annual reports of UK listed companies. Neutrality of narrative discussion was determined by comparing the average proportions of <b>good</b> and bad <b>news</b> contained in the narrative and statutory accounts sections of the annual reports. The results of a comparison of <b>the</b> proportion of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> in <b>the</b> two sections of the annual reports suggest that the narrative sections contained a significantly higher proportion of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> than <b>the</b> statutory accounts sections. Comparison of proportions of bad news, however, indicates that the narrative sections contained a significantly lower proportion of bad news compared to the statutory accounts sections. Finally, the results also suggest that <b>the</b> proportion of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> as compared to bad news in the narrative sections is significantly higher than <b>the</b> proportion of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> compared to bad news in the statutory accounts section. The results are consistent with the suggestion that company management highlights <b>good</b> <b>news</b> in narrative discussions. Th...|$|R

When including news {{on a set}} of widely followed individual macroeconomic fundamentals in the cross-section of stock returns, estimates of their prices of risk are consistent with <b>the</b> explanation that <b>good</b> <b>news</b> on <b>the</b> economy is bad news for stocks during expansions. In contrast, during contractions, <b>good</b> <b>news</b> on <b>the</b> economy is <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for stocks as well.
