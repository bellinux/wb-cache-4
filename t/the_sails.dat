5|$|In 2009 <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> were {{replaced}} and the mill re-thatched and restored by local craftsmen {{at a cost}} of a £100,000; the mill was re-opened later that year. The work was funded by the Grantscape Community Heritage Fund. Although <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> do not rotate with the wind, they are moved 90 degrees four times per year for maintenance. Before the restoration work was undertaken surveys revealed that the mill was used as a roost for long-eared and lesser horseshoe bats. It was ensured that the bats would still have access after the restoration.|$|E
5|$|Work {{later in}} the year {{included}} the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail gearing. The brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> were cast.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating. It is quite possible that <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> or humps of these dinosaurs were used for courtship, in a way similar to a peacock's tail. Stromer speculated that males and females may have differed {{in the size of the}} neural spine.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> boat's <b>sail</b> {{is made of}} cotton, and {{is treated}} with tanbark oak which helps {{weatherproof}} <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> and gives <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> its distinctive tan colour. <b>The</b> <b>sail</b> has six wooden battens, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the yard}} {{in context with}} <b>the</b> modern junk <b>sail</b> is <b>the</b> {{supporting}} spar along the head of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> from <b>the</b> throat and peak. The yard is a stout spar relative to the battens because it supports {{the full weight of}} <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> when <b>the</b> halyard is hauled and <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is raised. It also elevates the peak of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> when trimmed.|$|R
5000|$|The yard {{exists to}} allow square sails {{to be set}} to drive the ship. The top edge of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is 'bent on' (attached) to the yard semi-permanently. Clewlines and buntlines are led along the yard {{and from there to}} the mast and down to the deck. These allow the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to be hoisted up to the yard, so <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is {{effectively}} folded in two. In this state <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is said to be [...] "in its gear", that is ready for setting or stowing. To set <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> <b>the</b> clewlines and buntlines are let go, and the sheets (attached to the bottom corners - clews - of <b>the</b> <b>sail)</b> are adjusted to shape <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to best catch the wind. A device called a [...] "tye", a [...] "tye chain", or a [...] "tye rope" [...] is used for lifting a given yard to the top of its travel to set <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sails</b> of Skidby Windmill {{can be seen}} {{providing}} the power to grind flour on certain days, and natural sites provide interest at Spurn, Bempton Cliffs, Hornsea Mere, Humber Estuary, River Hull, Watton Beck, River Derwent, River Ouse, River Aire, River Trent, and River Don, {{some of which are}} owned or run by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sails</b> {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether {{the wind is blowing}} from one side or the other. When the ships cast anchor, <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
5|$|The storm {{increases}} in force, breaking the mast, tearing <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> and flooding the hold. All four manage to survive by lashing {{themselves to the}} hull. As the storm abates, they find themselves safe for the moment, but without provisions. Over the following days, the men face death by starvation and thirst.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sail</b> can be {{strengthened}} by adding reinforcing {{material to the}} corners and stitching {{around the edges of}} <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> Adding grommets to the corners and edges will allow <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to be attached to the mast and spars. Because these grommets are placed through doubled material and behind the reinforcing line inside <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> edge, <b>the</b> resulting attachment points have tremendous strength.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the upper}} and lower spars provide a frame for <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> <b>the</b> camber of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is simply a {{function}} of how tightly the spars stretch <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> This means that lateen sails are often cut flat, without the complex cutting and stitching required to provide camber in Bermuda rig sails. Curved edges, when mated with the straight spars, provide all or nearly all of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> curvature needed.|$|R

5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Arbroath's economy {{expanded}} {{and the population}} of the town expanded, with new housing having to be constructed to house the influx of workers. Arbroath became moderately well known for jute and sailcloth production, with 34 mills employing 1,400 looms and producing over one million yards of osnaburg cloth and 450,000yards of sailcloth in 1875. Arbroath {{is believed to be the}} source of <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> used on the Cutty Sark. In 1867, the mills in Arbroath employed 4,620 people. Arbroath was also prominent in the manufacture of shoes and lawnmowers; local firm Alexander Shanks supplied mowers to the Old Course at St Andrews and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.|$|E
5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower <b>the</b> <b>sails.</b> To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of the lateen {{in the modern}} form described below {{is the fact that}} it has a [...] "bad tack". <b>The</b> <b>sail</b> is to <b>the</b> side of the mast, on one tack that puts the mast directly against <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> on <b>the</b> leeward side, where it can significantly interfere with the airflow over <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> On <b>the</b> other tack <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is pushed away from the mast, greatly reducing the interference. On modern lateens, with their typically shallower angles, this tends to disrupt the airflow over a larger area of <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Sailing</b> into <b>the</b> wind is {{possible}} when <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is angled {{in a slightly}} more forward direction than <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> force. In this aspect, the boat will move forward because the keel (centerline), of the boat acts to the water in as <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> acts to <b>the</b> wind. The heeling force of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is balanced {{by the force of}} the keel. This keeps the boat from moving in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> force. Although total sail force is to <b>the</b> side when <b>sailing</b> into <b>the</b> wind, a proper angle of attack moves the boat forward.|$|R
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|Captain Lawrence {{realised}} {{that his}} ship's speed {{would take it}} past Shannon and ordered a 'pilot's luff'. This was a small and brief turn to windward which would make <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> shiver and reduce the ship's speed. Just after Chesapeake began this limited turn away from Shannon, she had her means of manoeuvring entirely disabled as {{a second round of}} accurate British fire caused more losses, most critically to the men and officers manning Chesapeakes quarterdeck. Here the helmsmen were killed by a 9-pounder gun that Broke had ordered installed on the quarter deck for that very purpose, and the same gun shortly afterwards shot away the wheel itself. Surviving American gun crews did land hits on Shannon in their second round of fire, especially American carronade fire which swept Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannons nine pounder bow gun while one round shot demolished Shannons ship's bell.|$|E

5|$|Soleil's {{squadron}} departed Rochefort on {{the evening}} of 24 September, aiming to bypass Hood's squadron in the dark. However at 01:00 on 25 September, with the wind coming from the northeast, lookouts on HMS Monarch spotted sails to the east. Hood's squadron was spread out, tacking southeast towards the Chassiron Lighthouse at Saint-Denis-d'Oléron with HMS Centaur in the centre, HMS Revenge to the east (or windward) and Monarch to the west. HMS Mars was also close by, {{with the rest of the}} squadron spread out in the rear. Hood's immediate reaction was that <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> must belong to a squadron of French ships of the line, and ordered his ships to form a line of battle in anticipation. Even as the signal was raised however, lookouts on Monarch identified the strangers as frigates and Hood abandoned his previous orders and raised a new signal ordering a general chase, confident that his ships could destroy the convoy even without the power and defensive capability of a line of battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of Stegosaurus plates {{has been much}} debated. Initially thought of as some form of armor, {{they appear to have}} been too fragile and ill-placed for defensive purposes, leaving the animal's sides unprotected. The plates' large size suggests that they may have served to increase the apparent height of the animal, either to intimidate enemies or to impress other members of the same species, in some form of sexual display, although both male and female specimens seemed to have had the same plates. More recently, researchers have proposed that they may have helped to control the body temperature of the animal, in a similar way to <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> of the pelycosaurs Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus (and modern elephant and rabbit ears). The plates had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around the plates would have cooled the blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{explanation}} for the sinking among modern historians is that the ship was unstable {{for a number of}} reasons. When a strong gust of wind hit <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> at a critical moment, the open gunports proved fatal, the ship flooded and quickly foundered. Coates offered a variant of this hypothesis, which explains why a ship which served for several decades without sinking, and which even fought in actions in the rough seas off Brittany, unexpectedly foundered: the ship had accumulated additional weight over the years in service and finally become unseaworthy. That the ship was turning after firing all the cannons on one side has been questioned by Marsden after examination of guns recovered in both the 19th and 20th centuries; guns from both sides were found still loaded. This has been interpreted to mean that something else could have gone wrong since it is assumed that an experienced crew would not have failed to secure the gunports before making a potentially risky turn.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} has two objectives.

Second, it aims at finding out the influence of <b>the</b> difference of <b>sailing</b> period toward <b>the</b> professionalism competence of lecturers in Seamanship Polytechnic Makassar. This research was ex-post facto because lecturers in Seamanship Polytechnic Makassar, who were the subjects of this research, have individual characteristics which relate to <b>the</b> experience of <b>sailing</b> time of {{less than five years}}, between five years up to ten years and over 10 years. One-way analysis of variance results shows that <b>the</b> <b>sailing</b> period has a significant influence on the probability of 0. 00 on pedagogical competence. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is less than five years is 3. 32. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is between 5 years up to 10 years is 4, 09. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is over ten years is 4, 21. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>sailing</b> period has an influence on the professionalism competence with the probability value is 0. 00. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is less than five years is 4, 25. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is between 5 years up to 10 years is 3, 91. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is over ten years is 3, 24.

5000|$|<b>The</b> lug <b>sail,</b> or lugsail, is a fore-and-aft, four-cornered sail that is {{suspended}} from a spar, called a yard.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sails</b> {{belonged to}} a convoy of Indiamen which had {{gathered}} in Colombo on Ceylon before sailing together to China. By choosing to come up through the Bali Strait rather than through the Straits of Malacca, Farquharson had inadvertently led his fleet directly {{into the path of}} a French squadron whose six frigates were easily more powerful than his six East Indiamen. Farquharson was aware that he could not win a naval engagement with six frigates and so resolved instead to bluff the French into thinking his merchant convoy was a squadron of ships of the line. When he saw Cybèle approaching, Farquharson brought two ships forward to meet the frigate, gambling that in the low light Tréhouart might mistake the East Indiamen for warships. Farquharson compounded his ruse by raising Rainier's Blue ensign on Alfred and instructing the rest of the convoy to raise ensigns of their own.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, the British {{observed}} a {{fire on the}} lower decks of the Orient, the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the Orient, Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, Swiftsure, Alexander, and Orion, all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship {{in anticipation of the}} detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to soak <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships Tonnant, Heureux, and Mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the magazines, and the Orient was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.|$|E

40|$|The {{shape of}} a {{rotating}} electric solar wind <b>sail</b> under <b>the</b> centrifugal force and solar wind dynamic pressure is modeled to address <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> attitude maintenance and thrust vectoring. <b>The</b> <b>sail</b> rig assumes centrifugally stretched main tethers that extend radially outward from the spacecraft in <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> spin plane. Furthermore, {{the tips of the}} main tethers host remote units that are connected by auxiliary tethers at <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> rim. Here, we derive the equation of main tether shape and present both a numerical solution and an analytical approximation for the shape as parametrized both by the ratio of <b>the</b> electric <b>sail</b> force to <b>the</b> centrifugal force and <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> orientation with respect to the solar wind direction. The resulting shape is such that near the spacecraft, the roots of the main tethers form a cone, whereas towards the rim, this coning is flattened by the centrifugal force, and <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is coplanar with <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> spin plane. Our approximation for <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> shape is parametrized only by the tether root coning angle and the main tether length. Using the approximate shape, we obtain the torque and thrust of <b>the</b> electric <b>sail</b> force applied to <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> As a result, the amplitude of the tether voltage modulation required for the maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> attitude is given as a torque-free solution. The amplitude is smaller than that previously obtained for a rigid single tether resembling a spherical pendulum. This implies that less thrusting margin is required for the maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> attitude. For a given voltage modulation, the thrust vectoring is then considered in terms of the radial and transverse thrust components.
