5|$|In August 1863, {{as part of}} {{his duties}} as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named {{as a member of a}} board of {{military}} officers who would examine the defenses of Washington and suggest improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed to replace a civilian board that he had created in 1862. In a November 1863 meeting, this board recommended final allotments of guns and ammunition for the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number of guns <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{education}} system {{played a central}} part in the country's recovery and rapid {{economic growth in the}} decades following the end of World War II. After World War II, the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> effect for many decades: six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and two or four years of university. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program, in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years. In Japan, having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself. Highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more attractive in the workforce. The lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained. Furthermore, skills needed in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in Japan's highly technological economy.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral Lionel Tufnell, {{the head}} of a British naval mission to Greece, {{advocated}} purchasing another armored cruiser like Gerogios Averof, along with several smaller vessels and allocating funds to modernizing the Greek naval base at Salamis; this proposal was supported by Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who sought to control naval spending in the tight Greek budget projected for 1912. The plan came to nothing, as the Greek government waited for the arrival of British advisers for the Salamis project. In early 1912, the Greek Navy convened a committee <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> charge of acquiring a new capital ship to counter Reşadiye, initially conceived as a battlecruiser. The new ship would be limited to a displacement of , since that was the largest vessel the floating dry dock in Piraeus could accommodate. The program was finalized in March, and along with the new battlecruiser, the Greeks invited tenders for destroyers, torpedo boats, submarines, and a depot ship to support them.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{establishing}} a separate diplomatic service to handle the external activities of the Government of India originated from a note dated 30 September 1944, recorded by Lieutenant-General T.

When this note was referred to the Department of External Affairs for comments, Olaf Caroe, the Foreign Secretary, recorded his comments in an exhaustive note detailing the scope, composition and functions of the proposed service.

25|$|The last Melbourne Cup trophy {{manufactured}} in England {{was made for}} the 1914 event. It was a chalice centred on a long base which had a horse at each end. The trophy awarded in 1916, the first gold trophy, was a three-legged, three-armed rose bowl. The three-handled loving cup design was first awarded in 1919. In that year the Victorian Racing Club had commissioned James Steeth to design a trophy <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> keeping with {{the prestige of the}} race, little realising that it would become the iconic Melbourne Cup still presented today. In the Second World War years (1942, 1943 and 1944) the winning owner received war bonds valued at 200 pounds.|$|E
25|$|This was the {{beginning}} of the Manhattan Project, run as the Manhattan Engineering District (MED), an agency under military control that was in charge of developing the first atomic weapons. After World War II, the MED maintained control over the U.S. arsenal and production facilities and coordinated the Operation Crossroads tests. In 1946 after a long and protracted debate, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 was passed, creating the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) as a civilian agency <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> charge of the production of nuclear weapons and research facilities, funded through Congress, with oversight provided by the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. The AEC was given vast powers of control over secrecy, research, and money, and could seize lands with suspected uranium deposits. Along with its duties towards the production and regulation of nuclear weapons, it was also in charge of stimulating development and regulating civilian nuclear power. The full transference of activities was finalized in January 1947.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} vehicles, {{also known}} as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), {{and are expected to}} be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure—could reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades. This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of interstate teams into the {{expanding}} VFL and its eventual re-badging and change to a national league in 1990, the state leagues would undertake {{steps to ensure that}} representative football would not be reserved solely for those players in the Australian Football League. State League Representative matches would allow those players participating in competitions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> <b>in</b> later years, categorised as second-tier leagues, to be selected for interstate duties. While State of Origin would continue for several more years with pre-dominantly AFL-listed players, this format would for many players, become the pinnacle of their football careers outside of playing in a premiership. For the most part during the ensuing years between the inception of State League and the end of Origin, it was the South Australian and Western Australian leagues championing the concept with the two leagues facing off many times. The other state leagues did take part in the concept, but on a far more limited basis. The Queensland, ACT and Tasmanian competitions featured on several occasions, the New South Wales league made scattered appearances while the Northern Territory was far less featured on the interstate stage mainly due to their domestic league being played in {{a different part of the}} year. Meetings between those competitions and the SANFL or WAFL were a rare occurrence.|$|E

The major Western Allied contribution to the battle was the bombing of Berlin during 1945. During 1945 the United States Army Air Forces launched very large daytime raids on Berlin and for 36 nights in succession, scores of RAF Mosquitos bombed the German capital, ending on the night of 20/21 April 1945 just before the Soviets entered the city.|$|E

Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got into her head.

500|$|When The Fabulous Baker Boys was {{released}} in 1989, the idea of Pfeiffer portraying a sex worker who becomes a singer immediately garnered attention from the media. Pfeiffer's performance of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] was used heavily to promote the film; the attention garnered by this particular musical sequence rivaled those of every other film released that year. Pfeiffer continued to generate significant press even after the studio was forced to remove The Fabulous Baker Boys from most theaters to which it had initially been released due to financial concerns. In 1990, Empire magazine published an article entitled [...] "The Fabulous Pfeiffer Girl" [...] in homage to the actress' role. Ultimately, Pfeiffer's performance garnered widespread acclaim from nearly every critic who reviewed the film. The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin wrote that [...] "Pfeiffer is [...] unexpected... choice for this musical bombshell" [...] but ultimately admitted that she [...] "proves to be electrifyingly right." [...] According to Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel, [...] "Pfeiffer does as much for this movie as her Susie does for the Baker boys' act", praising all of her musical performances. Referencing one of her character's lines in which Susie negatively compares the song [...] "Feelings" [...] to parsley, Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers insisted, [...] "Michelle Pfeiffer... is not parsley. Take her out of this movie, and the movie would evaporate." [...] Travers credits the actress with resurrecting the film during its final moments, opining, [...] "The bounce goes out of the movie until Pfeiffer returns to wrap things up", concluding, [...] "the Bridges brothers are a winning pair. But make no mistake: It's Michelle Pfeiffer who puts the 'fabulous' into Baker Boys." [...] Steve Simels of Entertainment Weekly agreed that Pfeiffer [...] "saves Baker Boys from cliché", going on to hail the actress as [...] "a marvel... so funny and vulnerable that she almost makes her indifferently written bad-girl-with-a-heart-of-gold into something three-dimensional and believable." [...] Vanity Fairs Katey Rich concurred: [...] "The film is ostensibly about the Baker (and Bridges) boys, but Pfeiffer stole the show" [...] by [...] "endow her lounge-singer character {{with a lot more}} soul and vulnerability than she needed to." [...] Contributing to The Morton Report, Chaz Lipp agreed that [...] "Pfeiffer feels absolutely authentic in the role... put just the right spin on her line readings to sidestep cliche at every turn", appreciating the actress for interpreting Susie as more than simply a stock character. Despite lamenting that the three main actors [...] "become less interesting" [...] {{towards the end of the}} film, TV Guide agreed that although [...] "the Bridges boys give typically solid performances, it's Pfeiffer who deserves the most credit". The Independents David Thomson was particularly impressed with Pfeiffer's singing, opining, [...] "Anyone who can sing like <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> Las Vegas, not holding together a piano act in the bars and clubs of Seattle".
