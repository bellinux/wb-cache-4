40|$|BACKGROUND: Limonene and linalool {{are common}} {{fragrance}} terpenes. Both oxidized R-limonene and oxidized linalool {{have recently been}} patch tested in an international setting, showing contact allergy in 5. 2 % and 6. 9 % of dermatitis patients, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To investigate concomitant reactions between oxidized R-limonene and oxidized linalool in consecutive dermatitis patients. METHODS: Oxidized R-limonene 3. 0 % (containing limonene hydroperoxides 0. 33 %) and oxidized linalool 6 % (linalool hydroperoxides 1 %) in petrolatum were tested in 2900 consecutive dermatitis patients in Australia, Denmark, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients reacted <b>to</b> either <b>oxidized</b> R-limonene or oxidized linalool. Of these, 25 % had concomitant reactions to both compounds, whereas 29 % reacted only <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> R-limonene and 46 % only <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> linalool. Of the 152 patients reacting <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> R-limonene, 46 % reacted <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> linalool, whereas 35 % of the 200 patients reacting <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> linalool also reacted <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> R-limonene. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the patients (75 %) reacted to {{only one of the}} oxidation mixtures, thus supporting the specificity of the reactions. The concomitant reactions to the two fragrance allergens suggest multiple sensitizations, which most likely reflect the exposure to the different fragrance materials in various types of consumer products. This is in accordance with what is generally seen for patch test reactions to fragrance materials...|$|R

40|$|Terpenes {{are widely}} used {{fragrance}} compounds in fine fragrances, but also in domestic and occupational products.

This study aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of allergic reactions <b>to</b> selected <b>oxidized</b> fragrance terpenes other than limonene. In total 1511 consecutive dermatitis patients in 6 European dermatology centres were patch tested with oxidized fragrance terpenes and some oxidation fractions and compounds.

In the present study monocyte attachment on human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) that were preattached <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> or native laminin, was investigated. Intracellular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) expression by HUVEC was estimated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HUVEC attachment <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> or native laminin- 1 was examined using the Hemacolor kit. Anti-alphaL, anti-alphaM, anti-alpha 2 and anti-beta 2 integrin subunit antibodies were used in order to further investigate the above phenomena. HUVEC that were preattached <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> laminin expressed higher levels of ICAM- 1 and monocytes attached at a higher degree to these cells as compared to HUVEC that were preattached to native laminin. Incubation of monocytes with monoclonal antibodies against the alphaM and beta 2 integrin subunits equalized the above mentioned differences. Moreover, HUVEC attached <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> laminin at a higher degree as compared to native laminin. This difference was equalized after incubation with the antibody against the alpha 2 integrin subunit. These results indicate a modified interaction between HUVEC and the basement membranes in cases where laminin is oxidatively modified. This modified interaction results in increased ICAM- 1 expression by endothelial cells and consequently increased monocyte recruitment capacity...|$|R

5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends <b>to</b> <b>oxidize,</b> but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores.

5|$|Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens (archaea {{that produce}} methane {{as a result}} of metabolism) living in {{anaerobic}} environments, such as swamps.

A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor <b>to</b> <b>oxidize</b> hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling archaea. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by acetotrophic archaea.

5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of antimony is characteristic of a nonmetal. Antimony has some definite cationic chemistry, SbO+ and Sb(OH)2+ being present in acidic aqueous solution; the compound Sb8(GaCl4)2, which contains the homopolycation, Sb82+, was prepared in 2004. It can form alloys {{with one or more}} metals such as aluminium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, lead and bismuth. Antimony has fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Like arsenic, antimony generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. The +5 state is less stable than the +3, but relatively easier to attain than with arsenic. This is explained by the poor shielding afforded the arsenic nucleus by its 3d10 electrons. In comparison, the tendency of antimony (being a heavier atom) <b>to</b> <b>oxidize</b> more easily partially offsets the effect of its 4d10 shell. Tripositive antimony is amphoteric; pentapositive antimony is (predominately) acidic. Consistent with an increase in metallic character down group 15, antimony forms salts or salt-like compounds including a nitrate Sb(NO3)3, phosphate SbPO4, sulfate Sb2(SO4)3 and perchlorate Sb(ClO4)3. The otherwise acidic pentoxide Sb2O5 shows some basic (metallic) behaviour in that it can be dissolved in very acidic solutions, with the formation of the oxycation SbO. The oxide Sb2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Antimony has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoantimony chemistry).|$|E

40|$|Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory-fibrotic {{response}} to accumulation of cholesterol in the artery wall. In hypercholesterolemia, low density lipoproteins (LDL) accumulate and are <b>oxidized</b> <b>to</b> proinflammatory compounds in the arterial intima, leading to activation of endothelial cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes. We have studied immune cell activation and the autoimmune response <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> LDL in atherosclerotic apo E-knockout mice. Autoantibodies <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> LDL exhibited subclass specificities indicative of T cell help, {{and the increase}} in antibody titers in peripheral blood was associated with increased numbers of cytokine-expressing T cells in the spleen. In addition to T cell-dependent antibodies, IgM antibodies <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> LDL were also increased in apo E-knockout mice. This suggests that both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent epitopes may be present on oxidized LDL. In moderate hypercholesterolemia, IgG antibodies were largely of the IgG 2 a isotype, suggesting that T cell help was provided by proinflammatory T helper (Th) 1 cells, which are prominent components of atherosclerotic lesions. In severe hypercholesterolemia induced by cholesterol feeding of apo E-knockout mice, a switch to Th 2 -dependent help was evident. It was associated with a loss of IFN-gamma-producing Th 1 cells in the spleen, whereas IL- 4 -producing Th 2 cells were more resistant to hypercholesterolemia. IFN-gamma but not IL- 4 mRNA was detected in atherosclerotic lesions of moderately hypercholesterolemic apo E-knockout mice, but IL- 4 mRNA appeared in the lesions when mice were made severely hypercholesterolemic by cholesterol feeding. These data show that IFN-gamma-producing Th 1 cells infiltrate atherosclerotic lesions and provide T cell help for autoimmune responses <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> LDL in apo E-knockout mice. However, severe hypercholesterolemia is associated with a switch from Th 1 to Th 2, which results not only in the formation of IgG 1 autoantibodies <b>to</b> <b>oxidized</b> LDL, but also in the appearance of Th 2 -type cytokines in the atherosclerotic lesions. Since the two subsets of T cells counteract each other, this switch may have important consequences for the inflammatory/immune process in atherosclerosis...|$|R
