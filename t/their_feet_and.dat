5|$|The North American {{premiere of}} Hard Boiled was in September 1992 at the Toronto International Film Festival. At the premiere the {{audience}} response was very positive with people stomping <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> {{yelling at the}} screen. This reception surprised producer Terence Chang who did not expect such a positive reaction. Hard Boiled received wide release in the United Kingdom on 8 October 1993.|$|E
5|$|Many former {{adherents of}} the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and {{employment}} {{difficult to find}} because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, {{there were only two}} alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After the failure of the rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote with <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E
5|$|The Pipil used wooden weapons {{with stone}} blades. Their weapons {{included}} long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades {{similar to the}} Aztec macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, the horse and firearms. The Spanish described how the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, that extended down to <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> significantly encumbered them.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that glands on the lid secrete compounds that intoxicate visiting insects, such that they lose <b>their</b> <b>footing</b> <b>and</b> fall into the pitcher.|$|R
5000|$|When walking {{very close}} to someone a {{pedestrian}} may be liable to step on their heels. This can cause either of the pedestrians to lose <b>their</b> <b>footing</b> <b>and</b> take serious injury.|$|R
60|$|Hodder {{took her}} hand. He had often {{tried to imagine}} his {{feelings}} if he should meet her again: {{what he should do}} and say,--what would be <b>their</b> <b>footing.</b> <b>And</b> now he had no time to prepare....|$|R
5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had early {{chances in}} the second leg with midfielder Peter Thompson and defender Geoff Strong hitting {{the frame of the}} goal. The first half {{finished}} goalless, but Ajax opened the scoring in the 49th minute when Cruyff scored. Liverpool striker Hunt equalised a few minutes later, but Liverpool conceded again when Cruyff scored a second goal. Hunt scored {{towards the end of the}} match, but they were unable to beat Ajax and the match finished 2–2. They progressed to the quarter-finals courtesy of a 7–3 aggregate victory. During the early stages of the match, there was a crush on the Spion Kop. As fans struggled to see the match due to a low-hanging haze, people at the back pressed forward for a better view. This resulted in supporters at the front being swept off <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> spilling onto the pitch. Over 200 people were injured, with 31 taken to hospital.|$|E
5|$|The 1947 {{season was}} another strong one for Speedie. In {{a game against}} the Buffalo Bills, he tied a {{professional}} football record by catching a throw from Graham and running 99 yards for a touchdown. He finished the season as the league leader in receptions and receiving yards as the Browns won another championship. His 67 catches and 1,146 receiving yards, in fact, were the second-best in pro football history after Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers, who caught for 1,211 yards in 1940. Speedie was named by news outlets as a first-team All-Pro. Speedie's success in 1947 came as he, Graham and Lavelli gelled as a passing and receiving unit, having studied hours of tape and worked on their technique and coordination. Speedie studied how defensive backs moved <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> tried to break into the open by exploiting mis-steps. They experimented with screen passes and made modifications to common receiving routes to exploit the weaknesses of defenses.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Japanese {{occupation}} around December 1943, {{the prevailing}} socioeconomic conditions for the Indians were quickly going downhill. There was a severe food shortage due to the Japanese losing <b>their</b> <b>footing</b> <b>and</b> influence {{in many parts of the}} Southeast Asian region .|$|R
6000|$|After a few {{turns over}} on the lawn, the three men regained <b>their</b> <b>footing,</b> <b>and</b> made <b>their</b> {{way back to the}} house, while the stream, subsiding almost immediately, left us in peace {{to make the best of}} what James Dougall called a paad chob! ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Goodenough also {{advised the}} Abeokutans to erect {{flanking}} towers at short intervals round their walls, {{to dig a}} moat twenty <b>feet</b> wide <b>and</b> eight deep at {{a few yards from}} <b>their</b> <b>foot,</b> <b>and</b> to turn into it the water from the river in order that any future attack might be more easily repelled.|$|R
5|$|The {{infantry}} {{scrambled to}} <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> rushed forward while the sappers hurried {{to break down}} the sides of the antitank ditch with picks and shovels. They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians were inside it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} chorus, in a climatic sequence, the singer holds a gun up to Judas' mouth, and {{a stick of}} red {{lipstick}} bursts out and smears his lips. The scene portrays Gaga's choice to refuse to shoot Judas through the heart. As the breakdown ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, washing <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> cleaning it with her hair. The sequence is interspersed with Gaga standing lonely on a rock as waves engulf her, the scene being reminiscent of artist Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and Jesus marching towards his fatal destiny. The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next Jesus is shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York. Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to explain something to him, but he places his palm on her head as Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the fateful kiss upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls {{on the ground with}} a silent, anguished cry. The video ends with the death of neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's stoned to death by the crowd.|$|E
25|$|The {{participant}} does a handstand, {{returns to}} <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> turns the rope under them. A more advanced version turns the rope during {{the return to}} the ground.|$|E
2500|$|On March 22, 2013, two hikers {{tried to}} climb to the second waterfall, but decided against it mid-climb. As {{they made their way}} down, they both lost <b>their</b> <b>footing</b> <b>and</b> fell. [...] One hiker, a high school senior, fell to her death, and the other was airlifted for treatment.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} all three had regained <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> Pat <b>and</b> the Indian had come up.|$|R
60|$|Slinging {{their weapons}} behind them the scouts {{began to climb}} the crags. Sure <b>footed</b> <b>and</b> hardy as they were, {{it was with the}} {{greatest}} difficulty that they could make their way up. Many lost <b>their</b> <b>footing,</b> <b>and</b> rolling down were dashed to pieces; but the great majority succeeded in climbing the heights, and at once became engaged in desperate battle with the natives.|$|R
25|$|Exceptions {{may be made}} if a {{physician}} has determined that a dancer's feet have sufficiently ossified, {{and it is not}} uncommon for dancers to begin pointe work as early as age nine. Oftentimes dance studios require their dancers to get x-rays performed on <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> have their physician verify whether the dancer's feet are ready for pointe work.|$|E
25|$|Chaffinches {{can develop}} tumors on <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> legs {{caused by the}} Fringilla coelebs papillomavirus. The size of the papillomas range from a small nodule on a digit to a large growth {{involving}} both the foot and the leg. The disease is uncommon: in a 1973 study undertaken in the Netherlands, of around 25,000 chaffinches screened only 330 bore papillomas.|$|E
25|$|The first {{shots were}} {{performed}} during test Alpha utilizing 20 tons of HBX explosives detonated 200 feet under water. The {{purpose was to}} determine the effects of underwater shock on equipment in preparation for the larger surface shots. The crew reported the blast sounding like a large hammer hitting the ship that caused the floor to move out from under <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> paint to flake off of piping and bulkheads.|$|E
60|$|The bull was now {{angry and}} excited. The capadors had great game with him. He was very quick, and {{sometimes}} he turned with such sharpness that his hind legs lost <b>their</b> <b>footing</b> <b>and</b> he plowed the sand with his quarter. But he charged always the flung capes and committed no harm.|$|R
60|$|Both {{officers}} rose to <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> quickly, <b>and</b> {{looked for}} their side-arms {{which they had}} unbuckled. Almayer laughed harshly.|$|R
50|$|Nepenthes lingulata is also {{unusual in}} that the {{undersurface}} of the lid is completely devoid of glands, except for a small group concentrated {{at the end of}} the tongue-like appendage. This structure likely serves to lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth, where they may lose <b>their</b> <b>footing</b> <b>and</b> fall into the pitcher fluid, eventually drowning.|$|R
25|$|The {{conditions}} affecting {{homeless people}} are somewhat specialized and have {{opened a new}} area of medicine tailored to this population. Skin conditions, including scabies, are common because homeless people are exposed to extreme cold {{in the winter and}} they have little access to bathing facilities. They have problems caring for <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> have more severe dental problems than the general population. Diabetes, especially untreated, is widespread in the homeless population. Specialized medical textbooks have been written to address this for providers.|$|E
25|$|Footvolley {{was created}} by Octavio de Moraes in the 1970s. It {{is a mix of}} {{football}} and volleyball, where the players must use <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> head to get the ball over the net and into the opponent's side, and is played on the beaches. It {{is one of the most}} popular beach sports in Brazil. Footvolley started out with 5 players on each team but later got cut to 2 players on each team and is still so to this day.|$|E
25|$|The Tank is a gigantic, muscular {{infected}} {{that has}} the ability to swipe at survivors, knocking them off <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> incapacitating them; it can also throw rocks and knock cars and other debris into the survivors. The Tank looks like its lower jaw is missing, but it's actually hidden in its neck muscle. The Tank is the most durable of all the special infected, and requires the full support of all of the survivors in order to be killed. The Tank is accompanied by a booming orchestral score to signal his appearance.|$|E

50|$|Brontotheres retain four toes on <b>their</b> front <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> three toes on <b>their</b> hind <b>feet.</b> <b>Their</b> {{teeth are}} adapted to {{shearing}} (cutting) relatively nonabrasive vegetation. Their molars have a characteristic W-shaped ectoloph (outer shearing blade).|$|R
25|$|Common {{manifestations of}} sensory issues include {{numbness}} or painful sensations {{in the arms}} and legs, abnormal sensations like “pins and needles,” and heat intolerance. Pain experienced by individuals depends on {{the severity of the}} polyneuropathy. It may be dull and constant in some individuals while being sharp and lancinating in others. In many subjects, tenderness is seen upon the palpitation of muscles in the feet and legs. Certain people may also feel cramping sensations in the muscles affected and others say there is a burning sensation in <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> calves.|$|E
25|$|In the half-darkness, troops {{can be seen}} {{creeping}} {{along the}} ground. The surprise the guards and gradually near the King's tent. Then the enemy leap to <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> begin to destroy the tents. They are impressed by the splendour of the King's tent, which Gyges forbids them to enter. Nisia raises the flap and faces the enemy. Two of her assailants endeavour to capture the Queen, but Gyges cuts them down. Other soldiers attack Gyges, who is almost overcome when a party of Candaule's men come to the rescue, led by the King.|$|E
25|$|They {{arrive in}} Gibeah just at nightfall. The Levite {{and his party}} wait in the public square, but no one offers to extend the {{customary}} hospitality. Eventually, an old man came in from {{working in the field}} and inquired as to their situation. He, too was from the mountains of Ephraim, but had lived among the Benjaminites for some time. He invited them to spend the night at his house rather than the open square. He brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys; they washed <b>their</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> ate and drank.|$|E
5000|$|.....by {{this time}} the Yoma was well down by the stern {{and the next thing}} I knew she sank under my <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> I found myself in the water... as the boat rose I saw a lot of men on the foc’sle head: they would not jump into the water,... as the bow lifted a number of them lost <b>their</b> <b>footing</b> <b>and</b> fell onto the bridge, many others being dragged under by the ship." ...|$|R
