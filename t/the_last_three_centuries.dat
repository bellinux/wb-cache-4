25|$|The {{character}} and fortunes of Ronsard's works {{are among the}} most remarkable in literary history, and supply in themselves a kind of illustration of the progress of French literature during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>centuries.</b> It was long his fortune to be almost always extravagantly admired or violently attacked. At first, as has been said, the enmity, not altogether unprovoked, of the friends and followers of Marot fell to his lot, then the still fiercer antagonism of the Huguenot faction, who, happening to possess a poet of great merit in Du Bartas, were able to attack Ronsard in his tenderest point. But fate had by no means done its worst with him in his lifetime. After his death the classical reaction set in under the auspices of Malherbe, who seems to have been animated with a sort of personal hatred of Ronsard, though {{it is not clear that}} they ever met. After Malherbe, the rising glory of Corneille and his contemporaries obscured the tentative and unequal work of the Pléiade, which was, moreover, directly attacked by Boileau himself, the dictator of French criticism in the last half of the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|Cromwell's {{suppression}} of the Royalists in Ireland during 1649 still has a strong resonance for many Irish people. The siege of Drogheda and massacre of nearly 3,500 people — comprising around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and all {{the men in the}} town carrying arms, including civilians, prisoners, and Catholic priests — became one of the historical memories that has driven Irish-English and Catholic-Protestant strife during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>centuries.</b> However, the massacre has significance mainly {{as a symbol of the}} Irish perception of Cromwellian cruelty, as far more people died in the subsequent guerrilla warfare and scorched-earth fighting in the country than at infamous massacres such as Drogheda and Wexford. The Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland ground on for another four years until 1653, when the last Irish Confederate and Royalist troops surrendered. Historians have estimated that up to 30% of Ireland's population either died or had gone into exile by the end of the wars. The victors confiscated almost all Irish Catholic-owned land in the wake of the conquest and distributed it to the Parliament's creditors, to the Parliamentary soldiers who served in Ireland, and to English people who had settled there before the war.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{thousands}} of written fragments {{have been discovered}} in the Dead Sea area. They represent the remnants of larger manuscripts damaged by natural causes or through human interference, with the vast majority only holding small scraps of text. However, {{a small number of}} well-preserved, almost intact manuscripts have survived — fewer than a dozen among those from the Qumran Caves. Researchers have assembled a collection of some 981 different manuscripts – discovered in 1946/47 and in 1956 – from 11 caves. The 11 Qumran Caves lie in the immediate vicinity of the Hellenistic-period Jewish settlement at Khirbet Qumran in the eastern Judaean Desert, in modern Israel.

Ideas of human solidarity, thanks to Christianity, were far more widely diffused in the newer European world, political power was not so concentrated, and the man of energy anxious to get rich turned his mind, therefore, very willingly from the ideas of the slave and of gang labour to the idea of mechanical power and the machine.|$|E

Migration of adult Atlantic salmon may be limited by beaver dams during periods of low stream flows, but the presence of juvenile Salmo salar upstream from the dams suggests the dams are penetrated by parr. Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows.|$|R

60|$|By what we {{can only}} {{consider}} a series of fortunate accidents, {{the press and the}} book world have provided and do provide a necessary organ in the modern world state, an organ for swift general information upon matters of fact and for the rapid promulgation and diffusion of ideas and interpretations. The newspaper grew, as we know, out of the news-letter which in a manuscript form existed before the Roman Empire; it owes its later developments largely to the advertisement possibilities that came with the expansion of the range of trading as the railways and suchlike means of communication developed. Modern newspapers have been described, not altogether inaptly, as sheets of advertisements with news and discussions printed on the back. The extension of book reading from a small class, chiefly of men, to the whole community has also been largely a response to new facilities; though it owes something also to the religious disputes of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>centuries.</b> The population of Europe, one may say with a certain truth, first learnt to read the Bible, and only afterwards to read books in general.

6000|$|After copying some {{scores of}} inscriptions, {{we find that}} {{there has always been}} a {{convention}} or fashion in such things, and that it has been constantly but gradually changing during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>centuries.</b> Very few of the seventeenth century, which are the best, are now decipherable, out of doors at all events. In an old graveyard you will perhaps find two or three among two or three hundred stones, yet you believe that two to three hundred years ago the small space was as thickly peopled with stones as now. The two or three or more that have not perished are of the very hardest kind of stone, and the old letters often show that they were cut with great difficulty. We also find that apart from the convention of the age or time, there were local conventions or fashions. In some parts of the South of England you find numbers of enormous stones five feet high and nearly as broad. This mode has long vanished. But you find a resemblance in the inscriptions as well. Thus, wherever the Methodists obtained a firm hold on the community, you find the spirit of ugliness appearing in the village churchyard from the middle of the eighteenth century onwards, when the old ornate and beautiful stones with figures of winged cherubs bearing torches, scattering flowers or blowing trumpets, were the usual decorations, giving place to the plain or ugly stone with its square ugly lettering and the dull monotonous form of the inscription.

2500|$|One {{problem is}} {{in regard to}} the {{semantic}} difficulty of deciding the precise meaning of [...] "human". A population of, say, 4 million, with an average lifespan of, say, 10 years (see below), implies a birthrate of 0.4 million per year, which over a period of 100000 years represents 40000 million people. Also, robust population data only exists for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two or <b>three</b> <b>centuries.</b> Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in Ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire, the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service. Thus, there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations.|$|R

An analysis of the links between the social and economic structure of the study area and its housing characteristics reveals a distinct spatial pattern, and it implicitly demonstrates the differential responses to the opportunities of the 1970 s as depicted in a series of housing profiles.

60|$|Now, was a wand of {{this form}} used in {{classical}} times to discover hidden objects of value? That wands were used by Scythians and Germans in various methods of casting lots is certain; {{but that is not}} the same thing as the working of the twig. Cicero speaks of a fabled wand by which wealth can be procured; but he says nothing of the method of its use, and possibly was only thinking of the rod of Hermes, as described in the Homeric hymn already quoted. There was a Roman play, by Varro, called 'Virgula Divina'; but it is lost, and throws no light on the subject. A passage usually quoted from Seneca has no more to do with the divining rod than with the telephone. Pliny is a writer extremely fond of marvels; yet when he describes the various modes of finding wells of water, he says nothing about the divining wand. The isolated texts from Scripture which are usually referred to clearly indicate wands of a different sort, if we except Hosea iv. 12, the passage used as motto by the author of 'Lettres qui decouvrent l'illusion des Philosophes sur la Baguette' (1696). This text is translated in our Bible, 'My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them! Now, we have here no reference to the search for wells and minerals, but to a form of divination for which the modern twig has ceased to be applied. In rural England people use the wand to find water, but not to give advice, or to detect thieves or murderers; but, as we shall see, the rod has been very much used for these purposes within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>centuries.</b>|$|E
60|$|When {{we turn to}} {{the more}} civilised races, we find the use of numbers and the art of {{counting}} greatly extended. Even the Tongas of the South Sea islands are said {{to have been able to}} count as high as 100,000. But mere counting does not imply either the possession or the use of anything that can be really called the mathematical faculty, the exercise of which in any broad sense has only been possible since the introduction of the decimal notation. The Greeks, the Romans, the Egyptians, the Jews, and the Chinese had all such cumbrous systems, that anything like a science of arithmetic, beyond very simple operations, was impossible; and the Roman system, by which the year 1888 would be written MDCCCLXXXVIII, was that in common use in Europe down to the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries, and even much later in some places. Algebra, which was invented by the Hindoos, from whom also came the decimal notation, was not introduced into Europe till the thirteenth century, although the Greeks had some acquaintance with it; and it reached Western Europe from Italy only in the sixteenth century.[232] It was, no doubt, owing to the absence of a sound system of numeration that the mathematical talent of the Greeks was directed chiefly to geometry, in which science Euclid, Archimedes, and others made such brilliant discoveries. It is, however, during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>centuries</b> only that the civilised world appears to have become conscious of the possession of a marvellous faculty which, when supplied with the necessary tools in the decimal notation, the elements of algebra and geometry, and the power of rapidly communicating discoveries and ideas by the art of printing, has developed to an extent, the full grandeur of which can be appreciated only by those who have devoted some time (even if unsuccessfully) to the study.|$|E
6000|$|These {{alphabetical}} Indices will, however, be {{of little}} use, unless another, {{and a very}} different kind of Index, be arranged in the mind of the reader; an Index explanatory of the principal purposes and contents of the various parts of this essay. It is difficult to analyze the nature of the reluctance with which either a writer or painter takes it upon him to explain the meaning of his own work, even in cases where, without such explanation, it must in a measure remain always disputable: but I am persuaded that this reluctance is, in most instances, carried too far; and that, wherever there really is a serious purpose in a book or a picture, the author does wrong who, either in modesty or vanity (both feelings have their share in producing the dislike of personal interpretation), trusts entirely to the patience and intelligence of the readers or spectators to penetrate into their significance. At all events, I will, as far as possible, spare such trouble with respect to these volumes, by stating here, finally and clearly, both what they intend and what they contain; and this the rather because I have lately noticed, with some surprise, certain reviewers announcing as a discovery, what I thought had lain palpably on the surface of the book, namely, that [...] "if Mr. Ruskin be right, all the architects, and all the architectural teaching of the last three hundred years, must have been wrong." [...] That is indeed precisely the fact; and the very thing I meant to say, which indeed I thought I had said over and over again. I believe the architects of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>centuries</b> to have been wrong; wrong without exception; wrong totally, and from the foundation. This is exactly the point I have been endeavoring to prove, from the beginning of this work to the end of it.

40|$|Mt. Etna is {{the highest}} volcano in Europe, up today it reaches about 3320 m a. s. l. It {{is located in the}} eastern cost of Sicily (Southern Italy) which is {{characterized}} by intense tectonic activity and magmatism (Hirn et al., 1997). The Mt. Etna has a very intense degassing (Gerlach, 1991, Allard et al., 1991) which occurs both from top craters and along its flanks, mainly along the active structures (D’alessandro et al. 1995, Giammanco et al., 1998). In order to monitoring the volcanic activity, since 1989, several soil CO 2 flux measurements have been periodically carried out in some areas of the volcano characterized by high CO 2 emissions. In particular, the selected areas are located in the SW zone around the Paternò village and {{in the eastern part of}} the volcano, around the village of Zafferana Etnea. The measurements of CO 2 flux in the areas are performed in a regular grid of about 70 sites. In the past the highest values of CO 2 flux were recorded before the 1991 - 1993 eruption. This was the most important eruption of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>century</b> as regard of amount of erupted magma volume (Barberi et al., 1993). Generally till now the data about peripheral degassing have been considered only in term of total mean flux leaving aside any consideration about the spatial distribution in the single area. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two years, besides simply considered the variations of mean flux, an analysis of spatial distributions variations has been undertaken in order to better understand the relationships between volcano system modifications and diffuse degassing. During the same period two anomalous episodes were recorded one on May - September 2005 and the other, on May – July 2006. These two periods showed on the whole different characteristics. The first anomaly was more intense in the Zafferana area and was coupled with an intense seismic activity recorded, nearby this area. Otherwise the second episodes showed the greatest intensity in Paternò area and coincided with the occurrence of several earthquakes, with hypocentre placed about 10 km depth, few kilometers north of the Paternò. Furthermore both the episodes were associated with significantly modifications on spatial distribution of soil CO 2 with shapes and the extents quite different each other. The two anomalies were due to movement and/or arrive of magma batches. The differences being between them reflect inequality in the modality and/or type of the magma rising process. Regarding the occurrence of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> eruptive period (July – December 06) should be noted, that unlike of the almost all previous eruptions, the flux remain rather high in both the areas, also after the beginning of the eruptive event...|$|R
