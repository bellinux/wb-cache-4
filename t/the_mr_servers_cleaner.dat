6000|$|... "Fancy!" [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> {{explained}} with {{a charming}} smile at Long, who, still looking pleasantly competent {{and not too}} fatuous, amiably returned it.|$|R
6000|$|... "The very one!" [...] I laughed; and I {{left him}} under this simple and secure {{impression}} that my appointment was with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I let all my wonder come. [...] "But wasn't she {{chattering}} {{to you at}} luncheon?" [...] It {{forced him}} to meet my eyes at greater length, and I could already see that my experiment--for insidiously and pardonably such I wished to make it--was {{on the way to}} succeed. I had been right then, and I knew where I stood. He couldn't have been [...] "drawn" [...] on his wife, and he couldn't have been drawn, in the least directly, on himself, but as he could thus easily be on Lady John, so likewise he could on other women, or on the particular one, at least, who mattered to me. I felt I really knew what I was about, for to draw him on <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> was in truth to draw him indirectly on himself. It was indeed perhaps because I had by this time in a measure expressed, in terms however general, the interest with which he inspired me, that I now found myself free to shift the ground of my indiscretion. I only wanted him to know that on <b>the</b> question of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> I was prepared to go as far with him as he should care to move. How it came to me now that he was the absolutely safe person in the house to talk of her with! [...] "I was too far away from you to hear," [...] I had gone on; [...] "and I could only judge of her flow of conversation from the animated expression of her face. It was extraordinarily animated. But that, I admit," [...] I added, [...] "strikes one always as a sort of parti pris with her. She's never not extraordinarily animated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, what in {{the world}} does it mean?" [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> replied. [...] "One could call it--though that doesn't get one much further--the Mask of Death." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{left the}} three of us all the more confronted with the {{conundrum}} launched by Obert, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server's</b> curiosity remained. [...] "Do name," [...] she said to me, [...] "the flattered individual." ...|$|R
6000|$|I weighed it {{with the}} grimace that, I feared, had become almost as fixed as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server's.</b> [...] "It would have settled the {{question}} perhaps; but I should have lost this impression of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. But didn't we, {{a moment}} ago, {{think of them}} all and dismiss them? If Lady John's out of the question, how can <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> {{possibly}} not be in it? We want a fool----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{from the}} moment we met here yesterday--the moment of my first seeing you with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server.</b> <b>The</b> look you gave me then was really the {{beginning}} of everything. Everything"--and I spoke now with real conviction--"was traceably to spring from it." ...|$|R
6000|$|My interlocutress stared, and I had at this moment, I remember, {{an almost}} {{intolerable}} {{sense of her}} fatuity and cruelty. They were all unconscious, but they were, at that stage, none the less irritating. Her fine bosom heaved, her blue eyes expanded with her successful, her simplified egotism. I couldn't, in short, I found, bear her being so keen about <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> while she was so stupid about poor Briss. She seemed to recall to me nobly {{the fact that she}} hadn't a lover. No, she was only eating poor Briss up inch by inch, but she hadn't a lover. [...] "I don't," [...] I insisted, [...] "see in <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> any of <b>the</b> right signs." ...|$|R
6000|$|Delighted as I {{was that}} he should believe it, I was yet struck by the {{complacency}} of his confidence, which connected itself again with my observation of their so recent colloquy. [...] "Oh, {{for you to be}} so sure, has <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> squared you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I stood rebuked, {{and even}} more so than I showed her, for she need, obviously, only decline to take one of my {{counters}} to deprive it of all value as coin. When she pushed it across I had but to pocket it again. [...] "It is the weakness of my case," [...] I feebly and I daresay awkwardly mused at her, [...] "that any particular thing you don't grant me becomes straightway the strength of yours. Of course, however"--and I gave myself a shake--"I'm absolutely rejoicing (am I not?) in the strength of yours. The weakness of my own is what, under your instruction, I'm now going into; but don't you see how much weaker it will show if I draw from you the full expression of your indifference? How could you in fact care when what you were at the very moment urging on me so hard was <b>the</b> extravagance of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server's</b> conduct? That extravagance then proved her, to your eyes, the woman who had a connection with Long to keep the world off the scent of--though you maintained that in spite of the dust she kicked up by it she was, at a pinch, now and then to be caught with him. That instead of being caught with him she was caught only with Brissenden annoyed you naturally for the moment; but what was that annoyance compared to your appreciation of her showing--by undertaking your husband, of all people!--just the more markedly as extravagant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It proves in general," [...] I admitted, [...] "either some coldness or some warmth, and I quite {{understand}} that that's {{not the way}} you sit with your friends. You steer admirably clear of every extravagance. I don't see, at any rate, why <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> is a terror----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know {{perfectly}} you didn't. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> did--with her unutterable intensity; {{making me}} feel afresh, by the way, that I've never seen a woman compromise herself so little by proceedings so compromising. But though you saw her intensity, it never diverted you for an instant from your own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server,</b> you and I? You {{must act}} as to that, my dear fellow, quite {{on your own}} discretion. All the more that what on earth have we made out? I assure you I haven't a secret to confide to you about her, except that I've never seen a person more unquenchably radiant." ...|$|R
6000|$|He didn't laugh; I hadn't {{seen him}} laugh, at Newmarch, once; he was continuously, portentously grave, and I at present remembered how {{the effect of}} this had told for me at luncheon, contrasted as it was with that of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server's</b> desperate, {{exquisite}} levity. [...] "You know I decidedly have too much of that dreadful old woman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{received}} this wholly {{as a tribute}} to her acuteness, and was therefore proportionately gracious. [...] "That's only because it's catching. You've made me sublime. You found me dense. You've affected me quite as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> has affected <b>Mr.</b> Long. I don't pretend I show it," [...] she added, [...] "quite as much as he does." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] triumphed <b>Mrs.</b> Brissenden again--for <b>the</b> {{lady was}} unmistakably <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server.</b> Amusement was inevitable--the fact showed her as so {{correctly}} {{described by the}} words to which I had twice had to listen. She seemed really all over the place. [...] "I thought you said," [...] my companion remarked, [...] "that you had left her tucked away somewhere with M. de Dreuil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the theory}} {{with which we}} started? Why, our {{recognised}} fact. The change in the man. You may say," [...] I pursued, [...] "that I {{was the first to}} speak for him; but being the first didn't, in your view, constitute a weakness when it came to your speaking yourself for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server.</b> By which I mean," [...] I added, [...] "speaking against her." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{startled me}} {{almost as much}} as if he had asked me what was the matter with myself--for that {{something}} was, under this head, I was by this time unable to ignore. Not twenty minutes had elapsed since our meeting with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> on <b>the</b> terrace had determined Grace Brissenden's elation, but it was a fact that my nervousness had taken an extraordinary stride. I had perhaps not till this instant been fully aware of it--it was really brought out by the way Obert {{looked at me as if}} he fancied he had heard me shake. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> might be natural, and Gilbert Long might be, but I should not preserve that calm unless I pulled myself well together. I made the effort, facing my sharp interlocutor; and I think it was at this point that I fully measured my dismay. I had grown--that was what was the matter with me--precipitately, preposterously anxious. Instead of dropping, the discomfort produced in me by Mrs. Brissenden had deepened to agitation, and this in spite of the fact that in the brief interval nothing worse, nothing but what was right, had happened. Had I myself suddenly fallen so much in love with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> that <b>the</b> care for her reputation had become with me an obsession? It was of no use saying I simply pitied her: what did I pity her for if she wasn't in danger? She was in danger: that rushed over me at present--rushed over me while I tried to look easy and delayed to answer my friend. She was in danger--if only because she had caught and held the search-light of Obert's attention. I took up his inquiry. [...] "The matter with them? I don't know anything but that they're young and handsome and happy--children, as who should say, of the world; children of leisure and pleasure and privilege." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you know}} what I mean by your grievance!" [...] She had no intention, Mrs. Briss, of sinking. [...] "I was to give you time to {{make up your mind}} that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> was our lady. You so resented, for some reason, my {{suggesting}} it that I scarcely believed you'd consider it at all; only I hadn't forgotten, when I spoke to you a while since, that you had nevertheless handsomely promised me that you would do your best." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{observed}} {{that as a}} consequence of this Long looked neither at <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> nor at Obert; he looked only at me, and with quite a penetrable shade of shyness. Then again a strange thing happened, a stranger thing even than my quick sense, the previous afternoon at the station, that he was a changed man. It {{was as if he were}} still more changed--had altered as much since the evening before as during the so much longer interval of which I had originally to take account. He had altered almost like Grace Brissenden--he looked fairly distinguished. I said to myself that, without his stature and certain signs in his dress, I should probably not have placed him. Engrossed an instant with this view and with not losing touch of the uneasiness that I conceived I had fastened on him, I became aware only after she had spoken that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> had gaily and gracefully asked of Obert why in the world so clever a man should not have been clever. [...] "Obert," [...] I accordingly took upon myself to remark, [...] "had evidently laboured under some extraordinary delusion. He must literally have doubted if Long was clever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to {{what may}} go on even between others still. It's a jolly idea--a torch in the darkness; {{and do you}} know what I've done with it? I've held it up, I don't mind telling you, to just the {{question}} of the change, since this interests you, in <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server.</b> If you've got your mystery I'll be hanged if I won't have mine. If you've got your Brissendens I shall see what I can do with her. You've given me an analogy, and I declare I find it dazzling. I don't see the end of what may be done with it. If Brissenden's paying for his wife, for her amazing second bloom, who's paying for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server?</b> Isn't that--what do the newspapers call it?--the missing word? Isn't it perhaps in fact just what you told me last night you were on the track of? But don't add now," [...] he went on, more and more amused with his divination, [...] "don't add now that the man's obviously Gilbert Long--for I won't be put off with anything of the sort. She collared him much too markedly. The real man must be one she doesn't markedly collar." ...|$|R
6000|$|I stood {{long enough}} to see that it didn't in the least signify whether or no I explained, and during this {{interval}} I found myself--to my surprise--in receipt of still better assistance than any I had to give. I had happened to turn, while I awkwardly enough, no doubt, rested and shifted, to the quarter from which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> had arrived; and there, just {{at the end of the}} same vista, I gathered material for my proper reply. Her eyes at this moment were fixed elsewhere, and that gave me still a little more time, at the end of which my reference had all its point. [...] "I supposed you to have Brissenden in your head," [...] I said, [...] "because it's evidently what he himself takes for granted. But let him tell you!" [...] He was already close to us: missing her at the house, he had started again in search of her and had successfully followed. The effect on him of coming in sight of us had been for an instant to make him hang back as I had seen <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> hang. But he had then advanced just as she had done; I had waited for him to reach us; and now she saw him. She looked at him as she always looked at all of us, yet not at either of us as if we had lately been talking of him. If it was vacancy it was eloquent; if it was vigilance it was splendid. What was most curious, at all events, was that it was now poor Briss who was disconcerted. He had counted on finding her, but not on finding her with me, and I interpreted a certain ruefulness in him as the sign of a quick, uneasy sense that he must have been in question between us. I instantly felt that the right thing was to let him know he had been, and I mentioned to him, as a joke, that he had come just in time to save himself. We had been talking of him, and I wouldn't answer for what <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> had been going to say. He took it gravely, but he took everything so gravely that I saw no symptom in that. In fact, as he appeared at first careful not to meet my eyes, I saw for a minute or two no symptom in anything--in anything, at least, but the way in which, standing beside me and before <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server's</b> bench, he received the conscious glare of her recognition without returning it and without indeed giving her a look. He looked all about--looked, as she herself had done after our meeting, at the charming place and its marks of the hour, at the rich twilight, deeper now in the avenues, and at the tree-tops and sky, more flushed now with colour. I found myself of a sudden quite as sorry for him as I had been for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server,</b> and I scarce know how it was suggested to me that during the short interval since our separation something had happened that made a difference in him. Was the difference a consciousness still more charged than I had left it? I couldn't exactly say, and the question really lost itself in what soon came uppermost for me--the desire, above all, to spare them both and to spare them equally.|$|R
6000|$|I wondered, {{in spite}} of the comfort I took, as I had more than once in life had {{occasion}} to take it before, {{at the sight of the}} painter-sense deeply applied. My wonder came from the fact that Lady John had also found <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> all right, and Lady John had a vision as closed as Obert's was open. It didn't suit my book for both these observers to have been affected in the same way. [...] "You mean you saw nothing whatever in her that was the least bit strange?" ...|$|R
6000|$|My companion, on this, {{looked away}} for a little, turned about, fixed {{his eyes on the}} house, seemed, as with a drop of interest, on the point of leaving me. But instead of leaving me he brought out the next moment: [...] "I don't want anyone to back me. I don't care. I didn't mean just now," [...] he continued, [...] "that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> has said to me {{anything}} against you, or that she fears you because she dislikes you. She only told me she thought you disliked her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You certainly," [...] I {{replied with}} assurance, [...] "have, {{during the last}} five minutes, made me do so with some sharpness. I don't pretend that I don't now {{recognise}} {{that there must be}} something the matter. I only desire--not unnaturally--that there should be, to put me in the right for having thought, if, as you're so sure, such a freedom as that can be brought home to me. If <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> is beautiful and gentle and strange," [...] I speciously went on, [...] "what are those things but an attraction?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, done it." [...] And as even at {{this she}} didn't light I gave her {{something}} of a jog. [...] "You haven't, {{with the force of}} your revulsion, I hope, literally lost our thread." [...] But as, in spite of my thus waiting for her to pick it up she did nothing, I offered myself as fairly stooping to the carpet for it and putting it back in her hand. [...] "Done what we spent the morning wondering at. Who then, if it isn't, certainly, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server,</b> is <b>the</b> woman who has made Gilbert Long--well, what you know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I gave up by going, decidedly, to the smoking-room, {{where several}} men had {{gathered}} and where Obert, a little apart from them, was in charmed communion with the bookshelves. They are wonderful, everywhere, at Newmarch, the bookshelves, but {{he put a}} volume back as he saw me come in, and a moment later, when we were seated, I said to him again, as a recall of our previous passage, [...] "Then you could tell what I was talking about!" [...] And I added, to complete my reference, [...] "Since you thought <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> was <b>the</b> person whom, when I stopped you, I was sorry to learn from you I had missed." ...|$|R
6000|$|One of {{the first}} {{accidents}} was that, before dinner, I met Ford Obert wandering a little apart with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server,</b> and that, as they were known to me as agreeable acquaintances, I should have faced them with confidence had I not immediately drawn from their sequestered air the fear of interrupting them. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> was always lovely and Obert always expert; the latter straightway pulled up, however, making me as welcome as if their converse had dropped. She was extraordinarily pretty, markedly responsive, conspicuously charming, but {{he gave me a}} look that really seemed to say: [...] "Don't--there's a good fellow--leave me any longer alone with her!" [...] I had met her at Newmarch before--it was indeed only so that I had met her--and I knew how she was valued there. I also knew that an aversion to pretty women--numbers of whom he had preserved for a grateful posterity--was his sign neither as man nor as artist; the effect of all of which was to make me ask myself what she could have been doing to him. Making love, possibly--yet from that he would scarce have appealed. She wouldn't, on the other hand, have given him her company only to be inhuman. I joined them, at all events, learning from <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> that she had come by a train previous to my own; and we made a slow trio till, at a turn of the prospect, we came upon another group. It consisted of Mrs. Froome and Lord Lutley and of Gilbert Long and Lady John--mingled and confounded, as might be said, not assorted according to tradition. Long and Mrs. Froome came first, I recollect, together, and his lordship turned away from Lady John on seeing me rather directly approach her. She had become for me, on the spot, as interesting as, while we travelled, I had found my two friends in the train. As the source of the flow of [...] "intellect" [...] that had transmuted our young man, she had every claim to an earnest attention; and I should soon have been ready to pronounce that she rewarded it as richly as usual. She was indeed, as Mrs. Briss had said, as pointed as a hat-pin, and I bore in mind that lady's injunction to look in her for the answer to our riddle.|$|R
6000|$|I {{found myself}} once more, as we moved, with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server,</b> and I {{remember}} rejoicing that, sympathetic as she showed herself, she didn't think {{it necessary to}} be, like Lady John, always [...] "ready." [...] She was delightfully handsome--handsomer than ever; slim, fair, fine, with charming pale eyes and splendid auburn hair. I said to myself that I hadn't done her justice; she hadn't organised her forces, was a little helpless and vague, but there was ease for the weary in her happy nature and her peculiar grace. These last were articles on which, five minutes later, before the house, where we still had a margin, I was moved to challenge Ford Obert.|$|R
6000|$|I {{kept for}} a little this image in my eye. [...] "I can see of course that his whole {{situation}} must {{be something of a}} strain for him; for I've not forgotten what you told me yesterday of his service with Lady John. To have to work in such a way for two of them at once"--it couldn't help, I admitted, being a tax on a fellow. Besides, when one came to think of it, the same man couldn't be two red herrings. To show as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server's</b> would directly impair his power to show as Lady John's. It would seem, in short, a matter for his patronesses to have out together.|$|R
6000|$|Discretion, then, I finally felt, {{played an}} odd part when it simply left one more attached, morally, to one's prey. What was most evident {{to me by}} five o'clock in the {{afternoon}} was that I was too preoccupied not to find it the best wisdom to accept my mood. It was all very well to run away; there would be no effectual running away but to have my things quickly packed and catch, if possible, a train for town. On the spot I had to be on it; and it began to dawn before me that there was something quite other I possibly might do with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> than endeavour ineffectually to forget her. What was none of one's business might change its name should importunity take the form of utility. In resisted observation that was vivid thought, in inevitable thought that was vivid observation, through a succession, in short, of phases in which I shall not pretend to distinguish one of these elements from the other, I found myself cherishing the fruit of the seed dropped equally by Ford Obert and by Mrs. Briss. What was the matter with me?--so much as that I had ended by asking myself; and the answer had come as an unmistakable return of the anxiety produced in me by my first seeing that I had fairly let Grace Brissenden loose. My original protest against the flash of inspiration in which she had fixed responsibility on <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> had been in fact, I now saw, but the scared presentiment of something in store for myself. This scare, to express it sharply, had verily not left me from that moment; and if I had been already then anxious it was because I had felt myself foredoomed to be sure the poor lady herself would be. Why I should have minded this, should have been anxious at her anxiety and scared at her scare, was a question troubling me too little on the spot for me to suffer it to trouble me, as a painter of my state, in this place. It is sufficient that when so much of the afternoon had waned as to bring signs of the service of tea in the open air, I knew how far I was gone in pity for her. For I had at last had to take in what my two interlocutors had given me. Their impression, coinciding and, as one might say, disinterested, couldn't, after a little, fail in some degree to impose itself. It had its value. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> was [...] "nervous." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have said}} that I did many things on this {{wonderful}} day, but perhaps {{the simplest way to}} describe the rest of them is as a sustained attempt to avert that disaster. I succeeded, by vigilance, in preventing my late companion from carrying <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> off: I had no wish to see her studied--by anyone but myself at least--in the light of my theory. I felt by this time that I understood my theory, but I was not obliged to believe that Mrs. Brissenden did. I am afraid I must frankly confess that I called deception to my aid; to separate the two ladies I gave the more initiated a look in which I invited her to read volumes. This look, or rather the look she returned, comes back to me as the first note of a tolerably tight, tense little drama, a little drama of which our remaining hours at Newmarch were the all too ample stage. She understood me, as I meant, that she had better leave me to get at the truth--owing me some obligation, as she did, for so much of it as I had already communicated. This step was of course a tacit pledge that she should have the rest from me later on. I knew of some pictures in one of the rooms that had not been lighted the previous evening, and I made these my pretext for the effect I desired. I asked <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> if she wouldn't come and see them with me, admitting {{at the same time that}} I could scarce expect her to forgive me for my share in the invasion of the quiet corner in which poor Briss had evidently managed so to interest her.|$|R
6000|$|They came on, however, and I waved {{them from}} afar a greeting, to which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> alone replied. Distances were great at Newmarch and landscape-gardening on the grand scale; {{it would take}} them still some minutes to reach our place of vantage or to arrive within sound of speech. There was {{accordingly}} nothing marked in our turning away and strolling back to the house. We had been so intent that we confessed by this movement to a quick impulse to disown it. Yet it was remarkable that, before we went in, Mrs. Brissenden should have struck me afresh as having got all she wanted. Her recovery from our surprise was already so complete that her high lucidity now alone reigned. [...] "You don't require, I suppose, anything more than that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{really said}} {{it in a way}} that made me take refuge for an instant in looking at my watch. [...] "Are you going back to tea? If you are, I'll, in spite of my desire to roam, walk twenty steps with you." [...] I had already again put my hand into his arm, and we strolled for a little till I threw off that I was sure <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server</b> was waiting for him. To this he replied that if I wished to get rid of him he was as willing to take that as {{anything}} else for granted--an observation that I, on my side, answered with an inquiry, though an inquiry that had nothing to do with it. [...] "Do you also tell everything to Mrs. Brissenden?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] I returned, [...] "I fear, mostly, I think, {{to frighten}} any one. I'm not {{particularly}} brave. I haven't, at all events, {{in spite of}} my certitude, interrogated <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Server,</b> and I give you my word of honour that I've not had any denial from her to prop up my doubt. It still stands on its own feet, and it was its own battle that, when I came here at your summons, it was prepared to fight. Let me accordingly remind you," [...] I pursued, [...] "in connection with that, of the one sense in which you were, as you a moment ago said, talked over by me. I persuaded you apparently that Long's metamorphosis was not the work of Lady John. I persuaded you of nothing else." ...|$|R
