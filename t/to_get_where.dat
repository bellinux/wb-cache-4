25|$|On {{the day of}} the quake, the Metro stopped {{service and}} {{completely}} shut down for fear of electrocution. This caused people {{to get out of the}} tunnels from wherever they were and onto the street to try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>where</b> they were going. At the time, the Metro had 101 stations, with 32 closed to the public in the weeks after the event. On Line 1, there was no service in stations Merced, Pino Suárez, Isabel la Católica, Salto del Agua, Balderas or Cuauhtémoc. On Line 2, there was no service between stations Bellas Artes and Taxqueña. On Line 3 only Juárez and Balderas were closed. Line 4 continued to operate normally. All of the closed stations were in the historic center area, with the exception of the stations of Line 2 south of Pino Suárez. These stations were located above ground. The reason these stations were closed was not due to damage to the Metro proper, but rather because of surface rescue work and clearing of debris.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{enjoyed the}} film, noting its homages {{to the film}} serials of the 1930s–1950s. Although Ebert cited the visual effects as being state of the art, he {{described}} them [...] "as charmingly direct as those rockets in the Flash Gordon serials—the ones with sparklers hidden inside of them, which were pulled on wires in front of papier-mâché mountains." [...] Leonard Maltin wrote that the [...] "film captures {{the look of the}} '30s, as well as the gee-whiz innocence of Saturday matinée serials, but it's talky and takes too much time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>where</b> it's going. Dalton has fun as a villain patterned after Errol Flynn." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine also gave a positive review. [...] "The Rocketeer is more than one of the best films of the summer; it's the kind of movie magic that we don't see much anymore", he continued, [...] "the kind that charms us, rather than bullying us, into suspending disbelief." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its variety {{of weapons and}} enemies. Game Revolution said that each enemy is [...] "unique both in ability, structure, and behavior so that each requires a specific combat approach". Maximum PC reviewer Josh Norem praised the levels for their interesting objectives, stating that the missions [...] "vary widely, ranging from finding lost colleagues to defending strategic structures against enemy assaults". Computer Games Magazine praised {{the fact that the}} developers replaced the wire-frame automaps of previous Descent games with flat-shaded polygons because they [...] "provide more detail and make it easier to recognize where you are and how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>where</b> you want to go". The multiplayer was highlighted positively due to its replay value and variety of game types. Computer Games Magazine also credited its [...] "rock-solid performance on standard dialup modems and easy connectivity", while GameSpot praised it for being [...] "fun and stable". The game was a runner-up for GameSpy's Action Game of the Year and a nominee for GameSpot's PC Action Game of the Year. Despite the positive reviews, the game did not perform well in sales. As a result, Daily Radar awarded the game a [...] "System Shock Award", named after the Looking Glass Studios 1994 game of the same name, implying that Descent 3 is a [...] "game that the critics loved but is over-shadowed by lesser or greater games".|$|E

500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but has some very complex issues going on behind the scenes. She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>where</b> she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." ...|$|E

Slant Magazine listed [...] "Secret" [...] as the 42nd [...] "Best Singles of the 1990s", stating that its [...] "one of the most organic-sounding singles of Madonna's career, taking its sweet time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>where</b> it's going and not giving up too much along the way. The arrangement gets off on being withholding, and, at least for one glorious single, so does Madonna: When she sings, [...] "You knew all along/What I never wanted to say," [...] she sounds positively rapturous. Scott Kearnan of The Boston Globe included the track at number 30 on his list of [...] "Best Madonna Songs", stating [...] "its slinky R groove made 'Secret' something special, even if it's not remembered for an accompanying scandal or bawdy 'moment'. We {{like to talk about}} her ability to produce controversy and headlines, {{but at the end of}} the day, here's what Madonna makes best: pop music". Louis Virtel of The Backlot listed the song at number 14 on his list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs", calling it [...] "meditative, moving" [...] and [...] "sexy as hell". Rooksby concurred that [...] "its a good track" [...] but felt that the time could have been reduced from five minutes, which made it a little long. He also felt that the drums looping around the track made it a [...] "bit monotonous".|$|E

2500|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the 2008 [...] "minx" [...] version of Clare Bates {{is similar to the}} {{character}} Clare Devine from the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks, whom Bissix played during a break from EastEnders between 2005 and 2007. Despite them being entirely different characters, it was suggested in The Herald that Gemma Bissix actually reprised the role between the two soaps. Bissix has acknowledged the comparison between the two characters, but maintains that they differ: [...] "A lot of people ask me this. Clare Bates is a minx and dresses to impress, using her sexuality <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>where</b> she wanted [...] Clare Devine doesn't have the emotion Clare Bates does. Clare Devine kills people, she tells little children that they're the reason for their parents' death!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Frederick {{incorporates}} jargon {{from the}} est {{training in the}} work. He alternates between referring to the reader as [...] "an ass" [...] or [...] "baby". The book contains short segments on various themes titled: [...] "Total Acceptance and Responsibility", [...] "Winners and Losers", and [...] "The Game of Life". Chapter headings include: [...] "How to Get All the Cheese in Life" [...] and [...] "How <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Where</b> You Really Want to Go in Life". Frederick {{emphasizes the importance of}} self-awareness, writing: [...] "You are the Supreme being, in Spirit". He attempts to convince the reader that life should be considered a game, and that it is more desirable to win at a goal than it is to be right about it. Frederick's thesis is that individuals cause all events which occur in their lives, and that they should work to consciously control their circumstances.|$|E
