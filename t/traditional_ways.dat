5|$|People {{who kept}} more <b>traditional</b> <b>ways</b> had {{settlements}} along the Tamiami Trail {{and tended to}} speak the Mikasuki language. They later were federally recognized in 1962 as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. As metropolitan areas in South Florida began to grow, {{the two groups were}} closely associated with the Everglades. They struggled to maintain privacy while serving as tourist attractions. They earned money by wrestling alligators and selling craftworks. As of 2008, the Seminole Tribe of Florida had five reservations, and the lands of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians were collectively considered a sixth reservation. The two tribes have each developed casino gaming on some of their properties to generate revenue for support, services and economic development.|$|E
5|$|Ratanakiri's tourist {{industry}} has rapidly expanded in recent years: {{visits to the}} province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's tourism development strategy focuses on encouraging ecotourism. Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting <b>traditional</b> <b>ways</b> of life. A few initiatives have sought to address these issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|The century {{following}} 1750 {{was time}} of significant change. New forms of transport, industry and agriculture brought sweeping changes, {{and an end}} to <b>traditional</b> <b>ways</b> of life that had endured for centuries. The aftermath of the Battle of Culloden {{marked the beginning of the}} end for the clan system and whilst there were marked improvements in living standards for some, these transformations came at a cost for others. In the early 19th century Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on Arran's population. Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island dealt a terminal blow. A memorial to this early form of ethnic cleansing has been constructed on the shore at Lamlash, paid for by a Canadian descendant of the emigrants.|$|E

25|$|Indigenous {{peoples of}} the American {{continent}} are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region {{before the arrival of}} European colonizers and settlers (i.e., Pre-Columbian).

Agnon, Brenner's contemporary, fused his knowledge of Jewish heritage with the influence of 19th and early 20th century European literature. He produced fiction dealing with the disintegration of <b>traditional</b> <b>ways</b> of life, loss of faith, and the subsequent loss of identity. In 1966, Agnon was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.|$|E

25|$|The pace {{of change}} towards more modern {{literary}} styles gained momentum in the early 19th century. Kannada writers were initially influenced by the modern literature of other languages, especially English. Modern English education and liberal democratic values inspired social changes, intertwined {{with the desire to}} retain the best of <b>traditional</b> <b>ways.</b> New genres including short stories, novels, literary criticism, and essays, were embraced as Kannada prose moved toward modernisation.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{relocation}} were major {{changes to the}} displaced persons' way of life: until the mid-20th century, numerous Seneca tribe members, particularly those in the floodplain, had lived simply according to <b>traditional</b> <b>ways,</b> with no modern conveniences such as electricity. Two residential resettlement areas were constructed, Jimersontown and an area south of Steamburg, both of which included modern amenities. The forced modernization is one source of the still-simmering resentment that Seneca have toward the dam.|$|E
25|$|Those who {{had kept}} to <b>traditional</b> <b>ways</b> and spoke the Mikasuki {{language}} organized as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, gaining state recognition in 1957 and federal recognition in 1962. (See also Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, below.) With federal recognition, they gained reservation lands and {{worked out a}} separate arrangement with the state for control of extensive wetlands. Other Seminoles not affiliated with either of the federally recognized groups are known as Traditional or Independent Seminoles.|$|E

25|$|Some {{of these}} valleys {{historically}} were more accessible from Tibet than Nepal and are populated {{by people with}} Tibetan affinities called Bhotiya or Bhutia including the famous Sherpas in Kumbu valley near Mount Everest. With Chinese cultural hegemony in Tibet itself, these valleys have become repositories of <b>traditional</b> <b>ways.</b> Valleys with better access from the hill regions to the south are culturally linked to Nepal as well as Tibet, notably the Kali Gandaki Gorge where Thakali culture shows influences in both directions.|$|E
25|$|The fur trade benefited Indigenous {{people as}} well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Knives, pots and kettles, nets, {{firearms}} and hatchets made provided {{improvements in the}} general welfare. At the same time, while their everyday lives were made easier, some <b>traditional</b> <b>ways</b> of doing things were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar.|$|E
25|$|Like the {{mainland}} tribes, the Nooghie, Noonuccal and Goenpul people struggled when Moreton Bay was {{opened up to}} free settlers. The mainland Aboriginal people in particular were progressively deprived of the traditional hunting grounds and food. When they turned to killing domestic stock to survive, they were rounded up and shot. As their tribal groups {{and way of life}} disintegrated, many drifted towards towns and cities. Because of their isolation, the people of the islands, however, managed to keep a lot of their <b>traditional</b> <b>ways</b> alive.|$|E

25|$|The army's war {{strategy}} and fighting tactics generally remained fairly constant throughout the imperial era. The infantry battalions, {{supported by the}} cavalry and elephantry, engaged the enemy in the open battlefield. The arrival of European firearms {{did not lead to}} any major changes in battle techniques or transform traditional ideas of combat. Rather, the new weapons were used to reinforce <b>traditional</b> <b>ways</b> of fighting with the dominant weaponry still the war elephants, pikes, swords and spears. In contrast to European-style drill and tactical co-ordination, Burmese field forces generally fought in small groups under individual leaders.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{this view}} {{on the need for}} more {{stakeholder}} involvement can be framed within the movement in environmental governance calling for a shift from <b>traditional</b> <b>ways</b> of government to governance. The Climate & Development Knowledge Network is funding a research project that aims to help the GCF Board, by analysing how best to allocate resources among countries. The project will research and present four case studies of how federal or central government money is presently distributed to sub-national entities. Chosen for the diversity in their underlying political systems, these are: China, India, Switzerland, and the USA.|$|E
25|$|Many Māori {{migrated}} to larger rural {{towns and cities}} during the Depression and post-WWII periods in search of employment, leaving rural communities depleted and disconnecting many urban Māori from their <b>traditional</b> <b>ways</b> of life. Yet while standards of living improved among Māori during this time, they continued to lag behind Pākehā {{in areas such as}} health, income, skilled employment and access to higher levels of education. Māori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems.|$|E
