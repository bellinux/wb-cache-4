5|$|Most of {{the films}} {{directed}} by Umboh were romantic melodramas, a genre which had existed in Indonesia since the 1950s but was refined by Umboh. However, he preferred shooting films with a social message; he considered Pengemis dan Tukang Becak his favourite film. When shooting, Umboh minimised his use of master shots, instead preferring to use medium and close-up shots; his obituary in Kompas notes <b>that</b> <b>around</b> 80per cent of any given Umboh film used these latter two shots.|$|E
5|$|State schools teach {{students}} a second language, usually French, German or Spanish.

From the early 1990s, the population decline {{was estimated at}} more than 50% per decade, and the small, scattered populations now face high risks of inbreeding depression.

5|$|According to one estimate, emigrations {{from the}} Salcete {{district}} of Goa were around {{the rate of}} 2,000 annually. Jesuit priests estimated that 12,000 Christians emigrated from the Bardez district of Goa between 1710–12, most of them going southward. A Goa government report of 1747 presently in the Panjim archives records <b>that</b> <b>around</b> 5,000 Christians fled from the Bardez and Tiswadi districts of Goa during the Maratha invasion. During the Maratha raids on Goa, about 60,000 Christians migrated to South Canara. These new migrants were given lands at Shirva, Kirem, Mundkur, Pezar, and Hosabettu by the Chowta kings of Moodbidri and at Milagres, Bondel, and Cordel by the Banghel kings of Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated <b>that</b> <b>around</b> 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E

5|$|Before {{completion}} of the tunnel, in 2009, nearly 16,000 vehicles travelled to and from PortMiami through downtown streets each weekday. Truck traffic made up 28% (or 4,480) of this number (Source: 2009 PB Americas Traffic Study). In 2010 it was estimated <b>that</b> <b>around</b> 19,000 vehicles traveled to the port daily but that only 16% were trucks. Existing truck and bus routes restricted the port's ability to grow, drive up costs for port users and presenting safety hazards. They were also thought to congest and limit redevelopment of the northern portion of Miami's Central Business District.|$|E
5|$|Berger's evasion of Wehrmacht-imposed {{recruiting}} restrictions {{came to a}} head in June, {{when the}} Chief of the OKW Operations Staff, Generalmajor Alfred Jodl initiated an investigation of SS recruiting operations within the Reich. The result was <b>that</b> <b>around</b> 15,000 SS inductions were held up by various Wehrmacht military district headquarters. Berger became aware of Jodl's inquiry and advised Himmler that even their inquiries had underestimated his success, giving the example that the Wehrmacht believed he had exceeded the June quota for SS-Division-Totenkopf by 900 men, when in fact the true figure was 1,164. He boasted to Himmler that during the whole recruiting campaign, he had signed up 15,000 men for SS-Division-Totenkopf, when Hitler had only authorised the recruiting of 4,000 for the division in the same period. To justify his actions, Berger pointed to the fact that, just before the French surrender, Hitler had ordered the release of over-age SS reservists. In the SS-Division-Totenkopf, this meant 13,246 of the 20,000-strong formation.|$|E
5|$|By 17:35, Sydney {{was heading}} south and losing speed, wreathed in smoke from {{multiple}} fires. Her main armament was disabled (the two aft turrets had jammed on a port facing {{and could not}} be swung around), and her secondary guns were out of effective range. The cruiser continued to be hit by shells from Kormorans aft guns as the distance between the ships increased. The Germans reported <b>that</b> <b>around</b> 17:45, all four torpedoes from Sydneys starboard launcher were fired, but as Kormoran was manoeuvring to bring her port broadside to bear, they all missed. In fact, only two torpedoes from Sydneys port launcher were ever fired, which must have happened some time earlier. The raider's engines broke down after this turn, but she continued to fire on Sydney at a high rate despite being immobilised, although many of the shells would have missed as the distance between the two ships increased. Kormoran ceased fire at 17:50, with the range at , and launched another torpedo at 18:00, but missed Sydney.|$|E
