5|$|The right panel (220 × 97.5cm, 87 × 38.4in) {{illustrates}} Hell, {{the setting}} {{of a number of}} Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling qualityrendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterwaysand presents a tableau that has shifted from the paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution. In a single, densely detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, infernal taverns, and demons in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh in the foreground. The nakedness of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and many now attempt to cover their genitalia and breasts with their hands.|$|E

40|$|The {{role that}} meridional {{overturning}} circulation (MOC) patterns played in poleward heat transport during <b>the</b> extreme <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Early to Late Cretaceous {{is a fundamental}} and unresolved question in climate dynamics. In order {{to address this question}} we must determine where deep waters formed, and how they may have circulated during periods <b>of</b> extreme <b>warmth.</b> Here we present late Albian through Maastrichtian (105 to 65 Ma) Nd isotope records from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites in the proto-Indian Ocean and the tropical Pacific.

5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of a semi-permanent high-pressure area known as the North Pacific High in the eastern Pacific is a dominant factor against formation of tropical cyclones in the winter, as the Pacific High results in wind shear that causes environmental conditions for tropical cyclone formation to be unconducive. Its effects in the central Pacific basin are usually related to keeping cyclones away from the Hawaiian Islands. Due to westward trade winds, hurricanes in the Pacific nearly never head eastward, although several storms have defied the odds and headed eastward. A second factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the occupation of a semi-permanent low-pressure area designated the Aleutian Low between January and April. Its presence over western Canada and the northwestern United States contributes to the area's occurrences of precipitation in that duration. In addition, its effects in the central Pacific near 160°W causes tropical waves that form {{in the area to}} drift northward into the Gulf of Alaska and dissipate. Its retreat in late-April allows <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific High to meander in, bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it. The Intertropical Convergence Zone departs southward in mid-May permitting the formation of the earliest tropical waves, coinciding with the start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on May15.|$|E

25|$|Hot water {{suits are}} used in cold water {{commercial}} surface supplied diving. A hose in the umbilical line, which links the diver to the surface support, carries the hot water from a heater on the surface down to the suit.

Tubes inside the suit distribute the water to the limbs, chest, and back. Special boots, gloves, and hood are worn. These suits are normally made of foamed neoprene and are similar to wetsuits in construction and appearance, {{but they do not}} fit as closely by design. The wrists and ankles of the suit are open, allowing water to flush out of the suit as it is replenished with fresh hot water from the surface.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of the no-nit policy {{counter that}} only a {{consistently}} nit-free child can be reliably shown to be infestation-free. That is, the presence of nits serves as an indirect proxy for infestation status. Proponents argue that such a proxy is necessary because lice screening is prone to false negative conclusions (i.e., failure to find lice present on actively infested children). For example, a 1998 Israeli study found that 76% of live lice infestations were missed by visual inspection (as verified by subsequent combing methods). Although lice cannot fly or jump, they are fast and agile in their native environment (i.e., clinging to hairs near <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scalp), and will try to avoid the light used during inspection. Louse colonies are also sparse (often fewer than 10 lice), which can contribute to difficulty in finding live specimens. Further, lice populations consist predominantly of immature nymphs, which are even smaller and harder to detect than adult lice.|$|E

25|$|After the WSC splits {{off from}} the Norwegian Atlantic Current it begins to enter very cold {{atmospheric}} conditions. The cold atmosphere is able to cool the surface water, {{and in some instances}} this water cools so much that some of the WSC water actually sinks due to its density increase, all the while holding its salinity constant. This is one element of the formation of the Lower Arctic Intermediate Water. As the current continues to move northward and reaches the continental shelf of western Svalbard it begins to encounter sea-ice. The sea-ice melts due to <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WSC, and thus a surface layer of very freshwater begins to exist. Winds mix the freshwater and the warm salty water of the WSC mix, creating some Arctic Surface Water. This Arctic Surface Water is now less dense than the Atlantic Water in the WSC and thus the WSC begins to sink underneath the Arctic Surface Water. At this point the WSC is still relatively warm and very saline. Thus, this allows the Atlantic Water in the WSC to be completely isolated from the surface waters.|$|E

500|$|During cosmic {{nucleogenesis}} of the elements, {{large amounts}} of neon are built up from the alpha-capture fusion process in stars.

500|$|Heseltine's {{music was}} {{generally}} well received by public and critics. The first Warlock compositions to attract critical attention were {{three of the}} Dublin songs which Rogers published in 1918. William Child in The Musical Times thought these [...] "first rate", and singled out [...] "If Ever I Saw" [...] as having particular distinction. In 1922, in the same magazine, the short song cycle Mr Belloc's Fancy was likewise praised, especially [...] "Warlock's rattling good tunes and appropriately full-blooded accompaniment". Ralph Vaughan Williams was delighted with the reception accorded to the Three Carols, when he conducted the Bach Choir at the Queen's Hall in December 1923. Early in 1925 the BBC broadcast a performance of the Serenade for string orchestra written to honour Delius, a sign, says Smith, that the music establishment was beginning to take Warlock seriously.

500|$|The {{thoroughness}} of the muster {{was heavily}} dependent on the class of the passengers; the first-class stewards {{were in charge of}} only a few cabins, while those responsible for the second- and third-class passengers had to manage large numbers of people.
