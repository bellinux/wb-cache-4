5|$|As initial {{cause for}} glacier retreat {{in the alps}} since 1850, a {{decrease}} of the glaciers albedo, caused by industrial black carbon can be identified.

5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1828, however, it was {{suspended}} in June 1831 before {{the building has}} risen from its foundations. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been because the principal architect Harrison had died the previous year and Boffo working alone {{may not have been}} an option – his alterations to Harrison's plans for the Governor's residence in Odessa had been unfavourably received.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages, much of the quality {{breeding}} stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled breeding and had to be built up again over the following centuries. In the west, <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been {{due in part to the}} reliance of the British and Scandinavians on infantry-based warfare, where horses were only used for riding and pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' {{re-election}} {{was more}} difficult. In four months {{he had lost}} the temporary support of Thomas' allies in the General Assembly who had voted for him in 1818. He narrowly defeated Thomas partisan Michael Jones {{by a vote of}} 23–19. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been due to the influence of the powerful Secretary of State Elias Kane, a Thomas ally.|$|E

5|$|Five Percenter {{membership}} plunged after Clarence13X's death, but rebounded in 1970 {{after new}} leadership emerged and revitalized the group. After his death, {{the group was}} not dominated by a single leader. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been {{a result of their}} teaching that all black men are gods, which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Gustavus Hinrichs, a Danish born {{academic}} chemist {{based in}} America, published a spiral periodic {{system based on}} atomic spectra and weights, and chemical similarities. His work was regarded as idiosyncratic, ostentatious and labyrinthine and <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> militated against its recognition and acceptance.|$|E

5|$|No coins {{were issued}} {{with the name}} of Æthelred or Æthelflæd on them, but in the 910s silver pennies were minted in west Mercian towns with unusual {{ornamental}} designs on the reverse and <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> reflected Æthelflæd's desire to distinguish specie issued under her control from that of her brother. After her death, west Mercian coin reverses were again the same as those on coins produced in Wessex.|$|E
5|$|On the {{southwest}} of the palace courtyard there were some low platforms, possibly ritual dance platforms, and on the southeast side was a building with benches against three of the walls and hearths at each end. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been {{the room where the}} Ahpo Sotz'il held court and received visitors and tribute.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{question the}} poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating about how <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> influenced her poetry.
