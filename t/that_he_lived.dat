5|$|There are {{contradictory}} {{accounts of}} Abbe's last years in Japan. Morgan and Ellis (2006) state <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> {{with his family}} {{for the remainder of}} his life, while Cavalcanti (2004) and Bagot (2007) claim that there were problems and that he ended up living apart from his family. Sources appear to agree, however, that Abbe was in poor spirits and poor health towards the end of his life. He suffered a stroke on 17 November 1985, and was hospitalised.|$|E
5|$|After {{forfeiting}} {{his title}} as World Champion, Fischer became reclusive and sometimes erratic, disappearing from both competitive chess {{and the public}} eye. In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation led to a conflict with the U.S. government, which sought income tax on Fischer's match winnings, and ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. After <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> his life as an émigré. In 2004, {{he was arrested in}} Japan and held for several months for using a passport that had been revoked by the U.S. government. Eventually, he was granted an Icelandic passport and citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic Althing, allowing him to live in Iceland until his death in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration. They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that carries his name, {{there is evidence that}} he carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits which {{led to the development of}} a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence to suggest that this death might have been staged, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E

5|$|With Canadian {{industry}} reorganized {{to supply}} the British war effort, Howe decided he needed to journey to Britain to discuss matters with the customers. He embarked on the S.S. Western Prince in December 1940. This was an intensely dangerous trip; Germany was attempting to blockade Britain {{and there were many}} German submarines in the North Atlantic. One of those submarines sank the Western Prince on 14 December. Howe survived the sinking and eight hours in a lifeboat. Gordon Scott, his aide, was killed trying to climb from the lifeboat to the rescuing ship. Howe professed coolness in the incident, but later told the Manchester Guardian that he considered every hour <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> from that day onwards to be borrowed time.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 1993, Garza {{was arrested}} at the Cameron County office in Harlingen having {{surrendered}} after an arrest warrant was issued. He was charged with capital murder and held at a county prison with a US$500,000 bond. Garza {{refused to comment on}} the arrest, and officers stated that they could not release details of his involvement other than that they had evidence he was involved in Fischer's murder. Arrest warrants were issued for Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña the day before. They were believed to be in Mexico, and police said they were working with Mexican officials to arrest the two men. On July 21, 1993, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez, and his brother Alonso Bazaldúa Cepeda, in Matamoros on a December 1992 murder charge, and for the unauthorized use of a vehicle. However, both men were released at around 3:00a.m. the next day after Olivarez showed the police a writ of amparo (similar to a writ of habeas corpus), which protected his constitutional civil rights. Following their release, the Brownsville police said there were reports that the two suspects were seen in Matamoros, and in Monterrey, Nuevo León, and that next time they tried to cross the international bridge, U.S. border agents would arrest them. Police records show that Olivarez was once arrested in Brownsville on September 12, 1992, for possession of a criminal instrument, but was released on bond the following day. He wrote on his bond application <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> in Brownsville, though this information was false.|$|E

25|$|It {{is known}} that he wrote on Babylon and Meroe; he visited Egypt, and Diodorus Siculus states <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> there for five years.

25|$|He told detectives in December 2003 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> most of {{his life}} in a fog and that he had blacked out {{memories}} of murdering {{most of his}} victims.

25|$|At {{some point}} in the mid-1780s, {{probably}} 1783, he went to live with Tsutaya Jūzaburō. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> there for approximately five years.

Evidence of his prints {{for the next few years}} is sporadic, as he mostly produced illustrations for books of kyōka ("crazy verse"), a parody of the classical waka form. None of his work produced during the period 1790–1792 has survived.|$|E
