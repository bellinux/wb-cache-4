[...] Although the alleys in early ballcourts were open-ended, later ballcourts had enclosed end-zones, giving the structure an -shape when viewed from above.|$|E

Cytochrome P-450 is the terminal oxidase component of an electron transport chain.

2500|$|The Mesoamerican ballgame ritual was a {{symbolic}} journey between the underworld {{and the world}} of the living, and many ball courts are found in the mid-part of the city functioning as a connection between the northern and southern halves of the city.

2500|$|Christie, Wildstein, Samson and Baroni were photographed {{together}} {{at the site of}} the World Trade Center during a commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the terrorist attacks.

2500|$|For modern Disciples the one {{essential}} is {{the acceptance}} of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and obedience to him in baptism. There is no requirement to give assent to any other statement of belief or creed. Nor is there any [...] "official" [...] interpretation of the Bible. Hierarchical doctrine was traditionally rejected by Disciples as human-made and divisive, and subsequently, freedom of belief and scriptural interpretation allows many Disciples to question or even deny beliefs common in doctrinal churches such as the Incarnation, the Trinity, and the Atonement. Beyond the essential commitment to follow Jesus <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> freedom of belief and interpretation. As the basic teachings of Jesus are studied and applied to life, there is the freedom to interpret Jesus' teaching in different ways. As would be expected from such an approach, {{there is a wide}} diversity among Disciples in what individuals and congregations believe. It is not uncommon to find individuals who seemingly hold diametrically opposed beliefs within the same congregation affirming one another's journeys of faith as sisters and brothers in Christ.|$|E

It was not a mean store. But he never did that. Afraid of mosquitoes, very likely. Neither was he ever tempted by the silence to address any casual remarks to the {{companion}} glow of the volcano.
