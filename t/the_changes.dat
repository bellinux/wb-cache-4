The texts were prepared based on the Act of December 11. These concessions to the Germans created tensions among the council members. Four members – Mykolas Biržiška, Steponas Kairys, Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis – resigned from the Council in protest. Chairman Antanas Smetona, who supported the Act of December 11, stepped down. Jonas Basanavičius, who would later be called the patriarch of independence, was elected chairman.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in <b>the</b> manifest refractive error (ΔM), <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power (ΔACP) and initial corneal asphericity (Q) in overnight orthokeratology (ortho-K). Methods: One hundred and twenty-eight clinical records of children undergoing ortho-K from a university optometry clinic were reviewed. The refractive and topographical data at baseline and at two-week visit of 58 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and analysed. Results: Significant differences (p < 0. 001) between <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error and <b>changes</b> in <b>the</b> apical corneal power or <b>the</b> maximum <b>change</b> in corneal power (ΔMCP) within the treatment zone were found. Linear regression {{analysis was used to}} describe <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error and <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power, and <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error and <b>the</b> maximum <b>change</b> in corneal power, with the equations: ΔM = 0. 91 ΔACP + 0. 57 (r = 0. 78, p < 0. 001) and ΔM = 0. 93 ΔMCP + 0. 01 (r = 0. 79, p < 0. 001) respectively. On average, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power underestimated <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error by 0. 34 ± 0. 57 D; whereas on average, <b>the</b> maximum <b>change</b> in corneal power overestimated <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error by 0. 23 ± 0. 57 D (paired-t-tests, p < 0. 001). A low but significant correlation between initial corneal asphericity and <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error (Spearman r = - 0. 33, p = 0. 01) was observed. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power underestimates <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error in ortho-K, whereas <b>the</b> maximum <b>change</b> in corneal power overestimates this parameter. Compared with retinoscopy and autorefraction, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power is still useful for estimation of <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error. Although <b>the</b> maximum <b>change</b> in corneal power appears to give a closer estimation of <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error than <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power, there is no advantage in the use of maximum corneal power (manually located) instead of apical corneal power (a default given by the topographer) to estimate <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error, as there is {{no significant difference in the}} estimations by either parameter. Initial corneal asphericity measured by the Medmont E 300 corneal topographer has limited usage in predicting <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error in overnight ortho-K.
