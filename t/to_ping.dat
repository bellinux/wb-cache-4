Users could create a profile so their friends could see whom they were following, what they were listening to, and what concerts they were going <b>to.</b> <b>Ping</b> also showed users' top 10 lists of songs and albums among the people they followed. It also provided artist recommendations to follow based on one's library and preference options.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the series}} Wizards of Waverly Place, the episodes [...] "Wizard School Part 1" [...] and [...] "Wizard School Part 2" [...] {{features}} Alex and Justin Russo {{going to a}} wizarding summer school named Wiz-tech, where everyone wears glasses reminiscent of the scarred wonder and yellow and black robes. When Alex sees the similarities, she says, [...] "You remind me of someone. Terry something...Barry something...Larry something! Oh, forget it." [...] Dumbledore is parodied as Headmaster Crumbs, Draco Malfoy is parodied as Jerko Phoenix, and the villain is Dr. Evilini, who plans on taking Justin's powers. Quidditch is parodied through a game called 12-ball, which is similar <b>to</b> <b>ping</b> pong. To end the game, you [...] "hit the tattler"; tattler also being another name for a [...] "snitch." [...] In another episode of the same show, Alex, Justin and Max magically travel to an apartment where they meet author H. J. Darling, (a parody of J. K. Rowling) to inquire as to her reasoning for using stories from their lives in her series called [...] "Charmed and Dangerous", (a parody of the Harry Potter books themselves).|$|E

50|$|To achieve that, {{the code}} running in kernel must be minimal, with the file server, process server, and each device driver running as {{separate}} user-mode processes. Each driver is carefully monitored by {{a part of}} the system named the reincarnation server. If a driver fails <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>pings</b> from this server, it is shut down and replaced by a fresh copy of the driver.|$|R

50|$|Weblogs.com is {{a website}} created by UserLand Software and later {{maintained}} by Dave Winer. It launched in late 1999 as a free, registration-based web crawler monitoring weblogs, was {{converted into a}} ping-server in October 2001, and came {{to be used by}} most blog applications.(Web-services like Feedster and Technorati monitor Weblogs.com for its list of the latest blog posts, generated in response <b>to</b> <b>pings</b> via XML-RPC.) The site also provided free hosting to many early bloggers.|$|R
50|$|PUP also {{includes}} a simple echo protocol at the internetwork layer, similar <b>to</b> IP's <b>ping,</b> but operating at a lower level.|$|R
50|$|A special process, {{called the}} reincarnation server, {{periodically}} pings each device driver. If the driver dies or fails to respond correctly <b>to</b> <b>pings,</b> the reincarnation server automatically replaces {{it with a}} fresh copy. Detecting and replacing non-functioning drivers is automatic, with no user action needed. This feature does not work for disk drivers at present, {{but in the next}} release the system will be able to recover even disk drivers, which will be shadowed in random-access memory (RAM). Driver recovery does not affect running processes.|$|R

5000|$|Sping {{is short}} for [...] "spam ping", and is related <b>to</b> <b>pings</b> from blogs using {{trackback}}s, called trackback spam. Pings are messages sent from blog and publishing tools to a centralized network service (a ping server) providing notification of newly published posts or content. Spings, or ping spam, are pings that are sent from spam blogs, or are sometimes multiple pings in a short interval from a legitimate source, often tens or hundreds per minute, due to misconfigured software, or a wish to make the content coming from the source appear fresh.|$|R
5000|$|Using the ping command, {{monitoring}} nodes initiate transmissions {{to remote}} nodes, then measure {{and record the}} response times, {{or the lack of}} responses. [...] Each combination of monitoring node-remote node is called a pair. PingER is easy to implement, because little special software must be installed to make measurements. Almost any networked computer will respond <b>to</b> a <b>ping,</b> and require nothing added. [...] Monitoring nodes require only a script <b>to</b> issue <b>ping</b> commands and record results. In September 1999 there were 1977 pairs, consisting of 511 remote nodes in 54 countries.|$|R
50|$|Rather {{than using}} the {{traditional}} ICMP echo request and reply network packets <b>to</b> determine <b>ping</b> times, video game programmers often {{build their own}} latency detection into existing game packets (usually based on the UDP protocol) instead.|$|R

30|$|The Haskell {{benchmarking}} library Criterion [40] is {{used for}} all the tests and a garbage collection was performed after every test. The CMQ testbed was setup in a client-server model where at first the client and the server would alternately send and receive messages similar <b>to</b> the <b>ping</b> pong test of the INTEL MPI benchmarks (IMB) [41]. In order to investigate the benefits of asynchronous message exchange (fire-and-forget messaging) and queuing, CMQ itself was allowed to use asynchronous non-blocking send operations (which means CMQ was allowed to send the next message before a reply to the previous message had been received) similar <b>to</b> the IMB <b>ping</b> ping test.|$|R
