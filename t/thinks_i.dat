500|$|In 1909 Lasker drew a short match (two wins, two losses) against Dawid Janowski, {{an all-out}} attacking Polish expatriate. Several months later {{they played a}} longer match in Paris, and chess historians still debate whether this was for the World Chess Championship. Understanding Janowski's style, Lasker chose to defend solidly so that Janowski {{unleashed}} his attacks too soon and left himself vulnerable. Lasker easily won the match 8–2 (seven wins, two draws, one loss). This victory was convincing for everyone but Janowski, who asked for a revenge match. Lasker accepted and they played a World Chess Championship match in Berlin in November–December 1910. Lasker crushed his opponent, winning 9½−1½ (eight wins, three draws, no losses). Janowski did not understand Lasker's moves, and after his first three losses he declared to Edward Lasker, [...] "Your homonym plays so stupidly that I cannot even look at the chessboard when he <b>thinks.</b> <b>I</b> am afraid I will not do anything good in this match." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{sequence}} of {{events that led to}} Somerset's removal from power has often been called a coup d'état. By 1 October 1549, Somerset had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat. He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took possession of the king's person, and withdrew for safety to the fortified Windsor Castle, where Edward wrote, [...] "Me <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> am in prison". Meanwhile, a united Council published details of Somerset's government mismanagement. They made clear that the Protector's power came from them, not from Henry VIII's will. On 11 October, the Council had Somerset arrested and brought the king to Richmond. Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his Chronicle: [...] "ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my treasure, following his own opinion, and doing all by his own authority, etc." [...] In February 1550, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, emerged {{as the leader of the}} Council and, in effect, as Somerset's successor. Although Somerset was released from the Tower and restored to the Council, he was executed for felony in January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley's regime. Edward noted his uncle's death in his Chronicle: [...] "the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill between eight and nine o'clock in the morning".|$|E
