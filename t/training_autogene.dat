These forces were involuntary oscillations, exerted by muscle movements of the breathing-cycle and muscle movements of the arm on force sensors. We constructed a linguistic bio-mechanical system (Ablasmi), where in each arm of a padded relaxation chair contained special sensors that were specifically designed to detect the pressure forces of each forearm while participants listened to the specific recorded weight-related sentences. In this experiment we used some classic sentences, such as ‘‘your right/left arm is heavy,’’ inspired by Autogenic Training (Schultz in Le <b>training</b> <b>autogene.</b> Paris, PUF, 1974) and some sentences, such as ‘‘your right/left arm is made of lead,’’ inspired by Grossmann’s relaxation technique. We observed that when the recorded sentences were directed to the right arm {{there was a significant}} increase of involuntary pressure forces on the right forearm. Additionally, we observed the same effect on the left forearm for the sentences directed to the left forearm. Thus, we believe we have provided experimental evidence of a definite linguistic effect of weight-related sentences on the involuntary pressure forces of the forearms.

40|$|Autogenic <b>Training</b> (das <b>Autogenes</b> <b>Training)</b> is a {{procedure}} that has been proposed by J. H. Schultz in 1932, originally {{with the purpose of}} relaxation, but which over the decades extended its role and its applications for the most varied of enhancing human personal resources. His teaching is practiced by different professionals. In this paper we discuss the contribution of social and professional pedagogy in this context and the corresponding practice, considering the methodology, didactics, the conception of the helping and assistance relationship to the person and the contribution non therapeutic to health. Even the linguistic problems in the translation from German to Italian language require attention. In the AT the professional pedagogist, apical professional in educational problems find its field of scope and exercise which has many original and very interesting features...|$|R
