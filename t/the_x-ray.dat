5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and <b>the</b> <b>X-ray</b> results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of <b>the</b> <b>X-ray</b> wavelength λ.|$|E
40|$|In this letter, {{we report}} on a quasar that is violently {{variable}} in <b>the</b> <b>X-rays,</b> XVV. It is also a broad absorption line quasar (BALQSO) that exhibits both high ionization and low ionization UV absorption lines (LoBALQSO). It is very luminous in <b>the</b> <b>X-rays</b> (approximately 10 (exp 46) ergs s(sup -l) over <b>the</b> entire <b>X-ray</b> band). Surprisingly, this does not over ionize the LoBAL outflow. <b>The</b> <b>X-rays</b> vary {{by a factor of}} two within minutes in the quasar rest frame, which is shorter than 1 / 30 of the light travel time across a scale length equal to the black hole radius. We concluded that <b>the</b> <b>X-rays</b> are produced in a relativistic jet beamed toward earth in which variations in the Doppler enhancement produce the XVV behavior...|$|R

5|$|With seven {{different}} instruments on board, Granat {{was designed to}} observe the universe at energies ranging from X-ray to gamma ray. Its main instrument, SIGMA, was capable of imaging both hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray sources. The PHEBUS instrument was meant to study gamma-ray bursts and other transient X-Ray sources. Other experiments such as ART-P were intended to image X-Ray sources in the 35 to 100keV range. One instrument, WATCH, was designed to monitor the sky continuously and alert the other instruments to new or interesting X-Ray sources. The ART-S spectrometer covered <b>the</b> <b>X-ray</b> energy range while the KONUS-B and TOURNESOL experiments covered both <b>the</b> <b>X-ray</b> and gamma ray spectrum.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, <b>the</b> <b>X-ray</b> scattering {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray is much greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron.

5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of <b>the</b> <b>X-ray</b> absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E

With this method, Moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed the gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers 43, 61, 72, and 75.|$|E

5|$|The {{conformational}} {{mobility of}} serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, {{the function of}} inhibitory serpins can be regulated by allosteric interactions with specific cofactors. <b>The</b> <b>X-ray</b> crystal structures of antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted {{into the top of}} the A β-sheet. The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|Triazole-based carbenes are {{thermodynamically}} {{stable and}} have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 210–220 ppm for the carbenic carbon. <b>The</b> <b>X-ray</b> {{structure of the}} triphenyl substituted carbene above shows an N-C-N bond angle of ca. 101°. The 5-methoxytriazole precursor to this carbene {{was made by the}} treatment of a triazolium salt with sodium methoxide, which attacks as a nucleophile. This may indicate that these carbenes are less aromatic than imidazol-2-ylidenes, as the imidazolium precursors do not react with nucleophiles due to the resultant loss of aromaticity.|$|E

In 1900, Robert Kienböck produced a study based on a series of experiments that demonstrated that it was <b>the</b> <b>x-rays</b> themselves.
