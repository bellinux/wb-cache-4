5|$|Of the {{remaining}} listed buildings and structures, nine are in or {{very close to}} the market place in the centre of town. They include three former houses (all now shops), a former bank, a telephone kiosk and four stone market place structures. Three cottages, a house and the former Roman Catholic Chapel of St John, are situated within two miles of the town centre. The ages of the listed buildings and structures range from the market cross, probably built in the 17th century, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> kiosk, built in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Pressure from an {{increasing}} population {{led to the}} town being supplied with amenities such as sewers, which were built in 1875â€“1880; and Sale was connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> network in 1888. As in the late-19th century, the early-20th century saw {{a great deal of}} construction work in Sale. The town's first swimming baths were built in 1914, and its first cinema, the Palace, was opened during the First World War. The end of the war in 1918 resulted in a rush of marriages, which highlighted a shortage of housing. The local councils of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey took the initiative of building council housing, and rented it to the local population at below market rates. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Sale had 594council houses. The building programme was interrupted by the start of the war. additional private housing development brought the total of inter-war houses built in Sale to around 900, including large housing estates like Woodheys Hall estate in Ashton.|$|E
25|$|The {{first public}} police {{telephones}} in Britain {{were introduced in}} Glasgow in 1891. These tall, hexagonal, cast-iron boxes were painted red and had large gas lanterns fixed to the roof, {{as well as a}} mechanism which enabled the central police station to light the lanterns as signals to police officers in the vicinity to call the station for instructions. As with Chicago's boxes, the original intent was that trusted members of the public would be allowed access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> in case of emergency using a special key that was registered to them, which would remain trapped in the lock until released by a master key carried by a policeman. A newer, rectangular type of cast-iron police box was introduced in Glasgow in 1912, but with the signal light now powered by electricity rather than gas, and access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> now restricted solely to the police.|$|E

Critics {{dispute the}} claim that Meucci {{could not afford to}} file for a patent or renew his caveat, as he filed for and was granted full patents in 1872, 1873, 1875, and 1876, at the cost of $35 each, as well as one {{additional}} $10 patent caveat, all totaling $150, for inventions unrelated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Bell Telephone Company {{was created}} in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell Company {{engineers}} made numerous other improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone,</b> which {{emerged as one of}} the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the carbon microphone from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.|$|E

25|$|A {{cordless}} telephone is a telephone with a wireless handset that communicates via radio waves with a base station {{connected to a}} fixed telephone line, usually within a limited range of its base station. The base station is on the subscriber premises, and attaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> network {{the same way a}} corded telephone does. In 1965, an American woman named Teri Pall invented the {{cordless telephone}}. Due to difficulties of marketing, Pall never patented her invention. George Sweigert of Euclid, Ohio had more success, thus receiving a patent for the cordless telephone in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{authorities}} {{alleged that}} as Haneef left Britain he recklessly provided assistance to a terrorist organisation by leaving his relative, Sabeel Ahmed, a SIM card {{and the balance}} of a two-year mobile phone contract to use and pay off when he left Britain in July 2006. Relatives have said that he left the SIM card behind to save money by not surrendering the remaining value of the contract <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> company. The prosecutor claimed the SIM card was found inside the vehicle used in the Glasgow Airport attack. This allegation, central to the case, {{has proved to be}} false and investigating British police officers have concluded that the case is being driven by politics rather than policing.|$|E
25|$|Rectangular, wooden, {{garden shed}} style police boxes were {{introduced}} in Sunderland in 1923 by Chief Constable Frederick J. Crawley, and then in Newcastle in 1925 {{when he took over}} as Chief Constable there. Crawley was arguably the first proponent (at least in Britain) of the concept of the police box as a miniature police station rather than just a communications point, including unrestricted access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> by the general public for contacting police, ambulance, and fire services. His well publicised success with these boxes, and the revised policing methods they allowed, soon led to the adoption of similar police box systems in many of the larger cities in the north of England, including Manchester and Sheffield.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with the United States, online banking {{arrived in the}} United Kingdom. The UK's first home online banking services known as Homelink {{was set up by}} Bank of Scotland for customers of the Nottingham Building Society (NBS) in 1983. The system used was based on the UK's Prestel viewlink system and used a computer, such as the BBC Micro, or keyboard (Tandata Td1400) connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> system and television set. The system allowed on-line viewing of statements, bank transfers and bill payments. In order to make bank transfers and bill payments, a written instruction giving details of the intended recipient had to be sent to the NBS who set the details up on the Homelink system. Typical recipients were gas, electricity and telephone companies and accounts with other banks. Details of payments to be made were input into the NBS system by the account holder via Prestel. A cheque was then sent by NBS to the payee and an advice giving details of the payment was sent to the account holder. BACS was later used to transfer the payment directly.|$|E
25|$|The coxswain {{would then}} call, 'Boat manned,' <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> {{operator}} at the loading station, who, in turn, {{reported to the}} 'LC' Control Room. The coxswain would then warn the troops to mind the pulleys {{at the ends of}} falls fore and aft, which could wave freely about when the craft had been set in the water. The task of hooking on and casting off from the ship required skill and seamanship from the coxswain, bowman, and sternsheetsman. The snatch blocks used were heavy steel and difficult to handle. The bowman and sternsheetsman stood by his respective block, as the craft was lowered into the water. At a time when there was sufficient slack in the falls both had to cast off at the same instant, and the blocks had to be released while there was slack in the falls. If the boat was not freed at both ends at once {{the rise and fall of}} the sea could cause the boat to tip, swamp, and perhaps capsize with loss of life. Casting-off was done in all sorts of sea conditions, and the sea might be rising and falling a metre or more (6' swells were not uncommon on D-Day). A combination of skill and luck could redeem a failure to cast-off, nevertheless. On D-Day, an LCA of Royal Marine 535 Flotilla, LSI Glenearn, released all but its after falls, which were jammed, and the craft tilted alarmingly to 45 degrees. The coxswain kept his head, calming the passengers, while seamen worked to free the falls. Once free, the coxswain need to get the LCA away to prevent colliding with the towering side of the LSI as it rose and fell with the swells.|$|E
500|$|There {{followed}} a dramatic series of legislative debates and votes, {{in which many}} Liberals, including Cushing, frequently voted against their own government, even on motions of non-confidence. [...] In March, Rutherford invited Cushing to rejoin the cabinet; according to Cushing, he was assured {{that if he did}} so his rival, Attorney General Charles Wilson Cross, would resign. [...] He declined Rutherford's offer, both because he considered that he was no longer able to work with the premier and because his allies among the anti-Rutherford Liberals urged him to fight on. [...] Rumours began to circulate that Rutherford would resign, to be replaced by Cushing. [...] Lieutenant Governor of Alberta George Bulyea was indeed convinced that Rutherford would have to resign in order to save the Liberals, but he and other powerful Liberals did not view Cushing as capable of leading the government. [...] Bulyea instead invited provincial Chief Justice Arthur Sifton to form a government, though Cushing was reputed to have been [...] "sitting in his hotel room, his ear glued <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone,</b> waiting for the summons from the Lieutenant-Governor to assume the robes of Rutherford".|$|E

[...] Moore reflects its rural past with two farmhouses and a number of cottages. [...] Also in the village of Moore are a public house, a former school, and a bridge over the Bridgewater Canal. [...] Preston Brook stands on the junction of the Bridgewater and the Trent and Mersey Canals; other than one listed house, {{the structures}} are associated with the canals â€“ a former warehouse, a tunnel entrance, a milepost, and two air shafts. [...] Other listed buildings are in more isolated sites and include another farmhouse, another canal bridge, a swing bridge over the Manchester Ship Canal, and a railway viaduct over the Weaver Navigation and A557 road.|$|E
500|$|However {{federal judge}} William H. Pauley III in New York City [...] the U.S. government's global {{telephone}} data-gathering system {{is needed to}} thwart potential terrorist attacks, and that it can only work if everyone's calls are swept in. U.S. District Judge Pauley also ruled that Congress legally set up the program {{and that it does}} not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> companies. He further ruled that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment. He also concluded that the controlling precedent is Smith v. Maryland: [...] "Smith's bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties," [...] Judge Pauley wrote. The American Civil Liberties Union declared on January 2, 2014 that it will appeal Judge Pauley's ruling that NSA bulk phone record collection is legal. [...] "The government has a legitimate interest in tracking the associations of suspected terrorists, but tracking those associations does not require the government to subject every citizen to permanent surveillance," [...] deputy ACLU legal director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement.|$|E
500|$|On 30 April, the Soviets {{were less}} than [...] from the bunker. That afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun {{committed}} suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married. Misch witnessed {{the discovery of the}} bodies of Hitler and Braun. He followed Otto GÃ¼nsche and Hitler's chief valet Heinz Linge to the door of Hitler's private room. After the door was opened, Misch only took a quick [...] "glance". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left on the sofa. Her eyes were open and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it; his head [...] "had fallen forward slightly". Misch started to leave to report the events to SchÃ¤dle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. By then Misch observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped in a blanket. Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. Misch left and reported the events to SchÃ¤dle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange, Misch later recalled UnterscharfÃ¼hrer Retzbach proclaiming [...] "So they're burning the boss now!" [...] Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but Misch declined to go. Thereafter, GÃ¼nsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery.|$|E

500|$|The {{second is}} [...] "No Strings (I'm Fancy Free)". [...] On {{retiring}} {{to his hotel}} suite, Horton advises him to get married. Astaire declares his preference for bachelorhood and the song â€“ this number {{was the brainchild of}} scriptwriter Dwight Taylor and is found in his earliest drafts â€“ emerges naturally and in mid-sentence. Astaire sings it through twice and during the last phrase leaps into a ballet jump, accompanied by leg beats, and launches into a short solo dance that builds in intensity and volume progressing from tap shuffles sur place, via traveling patterns, to rapid-fire heel jabs finishing with a carefree tour of the suite during which he beats on the furniture with his hands. On his return {{to the center of the}} room, where he noisily concentrates his tap barrage, the camera cranes down to discover Rogers in bed, awake and irritated. As she makes her way upstairs, Horton fields telephone complaints from hotel management. Astaire incorporates this into his routine, first startling him with a tap burst then escorting him ostentatiously <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone.</b> As Horton leaves to investigate, Astaire continues to hammer his way around the suite, during which he feigns horror at seeing his image in a mirror â€“ a reference to his belief that the camera was never kind to his face. The routine ends as Astaire, now dancing with a statue, is interrupted by Rogers' entrance, a scene which, as in The Gay Divorcee and Roberta, typifies the way in which Astaire inadvertently incurs the hostility of Rogers, only to find her attractive and wear down her resistance.|$|E
