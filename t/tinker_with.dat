5|$|Huggins {{continued}} to <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> his roster during the offseason. He traded Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins, and acquired Lyn Lary from the Pacific Coast League. He tried Lary {{at third base}} and Leo Durocher at shortstop, while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases. The Yankees fell behind the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and as {{it became clear that}} the Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey about the future of the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel in left field. However, by August 1929 Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling ill.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to <b>tinker</b> <b>with,</b> chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Duke Nukem 3D in 1996, id Software {{released}} the much anticipated Quake. Like Doom, Quake was influential and genre-defining, featuring fast-paced, gory gameplay, but used 3D polygons instead of sprites. It was centered on online gaming and featured multiple match types still found in first-person shooter games today. It was the first FPS game to have a following of player clans (although the concept had existed previously in MechWarrior 2 (Netmech) with its Battletech lore as well as amongst MUD players), and would inspire popular LAN parties such as QuakeCon. The game's popularity and use of 3D polygonal graphics also helped to expand the growing market for video card hardware; and the additional support and encouragement for game modifications attracted players who wanted to <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> the game and create their own modules. According to creator John Romero, Quakes 3D world was inspired by the 3D fighting game Virtua Fighter. Quake was also intended to expand the genre with Virtua Fighter influenced melee brawling, but this was eventually dropped from the final game.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} Black Ice were {{generally}} favourable according to Metacritic, which provided a normalised rating of 69 out of 100 based on 24 reviews from mainstream critics. Most reviewers complimented the album's sound, with The Village Voices Richard Bienstock considering that Brendan O'Brien's production restored a sonority {{closer to the}} Vanda and Young produced 1970s albums and effective choruses like those with [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, and Aaron Burgess of The A.V. Club finding Black Ice the most inspired AC/DC album since The Razors Edge while sounding [...] "harder, hungrier, and more relevant than anything on contemporary radio." [...] A common argument was that Black Ice succeeded because AC/DC {{did not want to}} change the style that succeeded in previous albums, with Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald declaring that given [...] "almost all of [...] could have appeared on any AC/DC album of the past 28 years", and Chris Jones of BBC saying that the band's [...] "almost platonic form of rock 'n' boogie that was hand built to last" [...] remains because they [...] "have no reason to <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> a formula that was well-nigh perfect to begin with." [...] Writers such as Spins David Marchese and The Observers Peter Kimpton complimented the band's attempts at [...] "some new sonic tricks", such as the slide guitar of [...] "Stormy May Day" [...] and the quieter [...] "Decibel".|$|E
500|$|In this series, {{presented}} {{as an extension}} and continuation of the first, the Tom Swift of the original series is now the CEO of Swift Enterprises, a four-mile-square enclosed facility where inventions are conceived and manufactured. Tom's son, Tom Swift, Jr., is now the primary inventive genius of the family. Stratemeyer Syndicate employee Andrew Svenson described the new series as based [...] "on scientific fact and probability, whereas the old Toms were in the main adventure stories mixed with pseudo-science". Three Ph.D.s in science were hired as consultants to the series to ensure scientific accuracy. The younger Tom does not <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> motorcycles; his inventions and adventures extend from deep within the Earth (in Tom Swift and His Atomic Earth Blaster [...] ) [...] {{to the bottom of}} the ocean (in Tom Swift and His Diving Seacopter [...] ) to the moon (in Tom Swift in the Race to the Moon [...] ) and, eventually, the outer solar system (in Tom Swift and His Cosmotron Express [...] ). Later volumes of the series increasingly emphasized the extraterrestrial [...] "space friends", as they are termed throughout the series. The beings appear as early as the first volume of the series, Tom Swift and His Flying Lab (1954). The Tom Swift, Jr., Adventures were less commercially successful than the first series, selling 6 million copies total, compared with sales of 14 million copies for the first series.|$|E

500|$|The {{physicists}} at Aldermaston {{had plenty}} of {{ideas about how to}} follow up Grapple X. Possibilities were discussed in September 1957. One was to <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> the width of the shells in the Dick to find an optimal configuration. If they were too thick, they would slow the neutrons generated by the fusion reaction; if they were too thin, they would give rise to Taylor instability. Another was {{to do away with the}} shells entirely and use a mixture of uranium-235, uranium-238 and deuterium. Ken Allen had an idea, which Sam Curran supported, of a three-layer Dick that used lithium deuteride that was less enriched in lithium-6 (and therefore had more lithium-7), but more of it, reducing the amount of uranium-235 in the centre of the core. This proposal was the one adopted in October, and it became known as [...] "Dickens" [...] because it used Ken's Dick. The device would otherwise be similar to Round A, but with a larger radiation case. The safety limit was again set to [...] Keith Roberts calculated that the yield could reach , and suggested that this could be reduced by modifying the tamper, but Cook opposed this, fearing that it might cause the test to fail. Because of the possibility of a moratorium on testing, plans for the test, codenamed Grapple Y, were restricted to the Prime Minister, who gave verbal approval, and a handful of officials.|$|E
500|$|After its release, Born This Way: The Remix {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It earned an overall score of 57 out of 100, on review aggregator site Metacritic. Jason Lipshultz from Billboard {{commented that the}} album did not re-invent anything new in terms of remix composition, but instead [...] "gives less recognizable artists a platform to <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> these complex pop schemes." [...] He added that the album is not essential listening for non-Gaga diehards, [...] "but electronica fans who have yet to drink the Mother Monster kool-aid will find plenty of pristinely produced club tracks to groove to. The album is a great avenue for fans to digest new versions of their favorite songs of the year, as well as discover artists {{that are trying to}} command audiences the way Gaga so masterfully does." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "some remixes take considerable liberty, ditching verses or hooks, whatever catches their fancy. So, it’s a remix album not for fairweather travelers but rather the hardcore Little Monsters, the kind who love every gesture grand or small from Gaga, but it also displays enough imagination to appeal to those listeners who fall into neither camp and are only looking for some darkly elastic dance." [...] Harley Brown of Consequence of Sound website was impressed with the diversity of remixes on the album, prompting him to comment that [...] "just in time for the holiday season, there’s something for everyone on Born This Way: The Remix. And, unlike many remix albums featuring one song reworked again and again, this Remix comprises a diverse tracklist to match the diverse list of remixers." ...|$|E

Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track [...] "Waves" [...] at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper. He released the album exclusively on Tidal on February 14, 2016 following a performance on SNL.
