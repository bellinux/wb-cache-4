5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon.</b> Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (<b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon)</b> was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{detonation}} of {{the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds. Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with Stanislaw Ulam, he calculated that not only would the amount of tritium needed for Teller's model of a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> be prohibitive, but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium. Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.|$|E
5|$|For Green Granite, Penney {{proposed}} a design based on radiation implosion and staging. There would be three stages, {{which he called}} Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the primary stage, would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode a secondary, Dick, another fission service. In turn, it would implode Harry, a thermonuclear tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer to Tom, Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. Nor was there much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting thermonuclear fuel was best placed inside the hollow core, as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo. Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the detonation waves in a thermonuclear detonation, {{but there was an}} incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1956, a B-52B (52-0013) {{dropped a}} Mk-15 nuclear bomb over the Bikini Atoll {{in a test}} code-named Cherokee. It was the first air-dropped <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon.</b> From 24 to 25 November 1956, four B-52Bs of the 93rd BW and four B-52Cs of the 42nd BW flew nonstop around the {{perimeter}} of North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered 15,530miles (13,500nmi, 25,000km) in 31 hours, 30 minutes. SAC noted the flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours had the four inflight refuelings been done by fast jet-powered tanker aircraft rather than propeller-driven Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighters. In a demonstration of the B-52's global reach, from 16 to 18 January 1957, three B-52Bs made a non-stop flight around the world during Operation Power Flite, during which 24,325miles (21,145nmi, 39,165km) was covered in 45 hours 19 minutes (536.8 smph) with several in-flight refuelings by KC-97s.|$|E

5000|$|Virtually all <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> {{deployed}} today use the [...] "two-stage" [...] design described above, but it {{is possible}} to add additional fusion stagesâ€”each stage igniting a larger amount of fusion fuel in the next stage. This technique can be used to construct <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> of arbitrarily large yield, in contrast to fission bombs, which are limited in their explosive force. The largest nuclear weapon ever detonated, the Tsar Bomba of the USSR, which released an energy equivalent of over , was a three-stage <b>weapon.</b> Most <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> are considerably smaller than this, due to practical constraints from missile warhead space and weight requirements.|$|R
50|$|Fusion {{reactions}} do {{not create}} fission products, and thus contribute far {{less to the}} creation of nuclear fallout than fission reactions, but because all <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> contain at least one fission stage, and many high-yield thermonuclear devices have a final fission stage, <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> can generate at least as much nuclear fallout as fission-only weapons.|$|R

25|$|Castle Bravo was {{the first}} in a series of high-yield <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> design tests {{conducted}} by the United States at Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands, as part of Operation Castle. Detonated on March 1, 1954, the device was the most powerful nuclear device detonated by the United States and its first lithium-deuteride-fueled <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon.</b> Castle Bravo's yield was 15 megatons of TNT, 2.5 times more than the predicted 6 megatons, due to unforeseen additional reactions involving 7Li, which led to the unexpected radioactive contamination of areas to the east of Bikini Atoll.|$|E

25|$|The goal of China was {{to produce}} a {{thermonuclear}} device {{of at least a}} megaton in yield that could be dropped by an aircraft or carried by a ballistic missile. Several explosions to test <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> designs, characteristics and yield boosting preceded the thermonuclear test.|$|E
25|$|The first {{effort to}} exploit the {{symbiotic}} relationship between fission and fusion was a 1940s design that mixed fission and fusion fuel in alternating thin layers. As a single-stage device, {{it would have been}} a cumbersome application of boosted fission. It first became practical when incorporated into the secondary of a two-stage <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1953, {{shortly after}} the Americans tested a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> in 1952, {{followed}} by the Soviets with Joe 4, and before the UK government took a decision in July 1954 to develop a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon,</b> the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston {{was asked about the}} possibilities for a very large pure fission bomb with a yield of one megaton. This study referred to the Zodiak Mk.3 bomb, but progressed no further than a rudimentary study. At this time studies were also started that ultimately led to a decision in 1954 to develop a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon,</b> and the design studies were split into two tracks because the British at that time had not yet discovered the Teller-Ulam technique necessary to initiate fusion. One track led to an intermediate design, the so-called Type A thermonuclear design, similar to the Alarm Clock and layer cake hybrid designs of other nuclear powers; although these designs are now regarded as large boosted fission weapons, and no longer regarded as thermonuclear weapons that derive a very large part of their energy from a fusion reaction, designated by the British as Type B, but as hybrids. The British hybrid weapon was known as Green Bamboo, weighed approx 4,500lb (2,045kg) and its spherical shape measured approx 45inches diameter with a 72-point implosion system. This Green Bamboo weapon was intended as the warhead for all projected British strategic delivery systems of the period; the Yellow Sun Stage 1 air-dropped bomb, and the Blue Steel air-launched stand-off missile. The large girth of these weapons was designed to accommodate the diameter of Green Bamboo's implosion sphere.|$|E

25|$|The Los Alamos National Laboratory had {{continued}} research into fusion weapons {{for many years}} after Holloway's work in 1942 and 1943, and in 1951 the Atomic Energy Commission, which had replaced the Manhattan Project in 1947, ordered the Laboratory to proceed with designing, building and testing a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon,</b> popularly known as a hydrogen bomb. Laboratory director Norris Bradbury placed Holloway {{in charge of the}} hydrogen bomb program.|$|E
25|$|Information {{about the}} W88 has implied {{that it is}} a {{variation}} of the standard Tellerâ€“Ulam design for thermonuclear weapons. In a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> such as the W88, nuclear fission in the primary part causes nuclear fusion in the secondary part, which results in the main explosion. Although the weapon employs fusion in the secondary, most of the explosive yield comes from fission of nuclear material in the primary, secondary, and casing.|$|E
25|$|Knobkerry, alias Green Grass, alias Interim Megaton Weapon, alias Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1, had {{one other}} distinction. It {{was the last}} entirely British nuclear weapon {{deployed}} with the UK Armed Services. The British Operation Grapple <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> tests at Christmas Island in 1957-58 were the end of evolution. There were no more wholly home-grown designs. Britain never deployed a true <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> of wholly home-grown design. All the weapons tested at Operation Grapple were abandoned, because AWRE no longer needed them, although some of their features were undoubtedly incorporated into later weapons. These Granite-type devices were all experimental devices, needing to be developed further into reliable Service-engineered warheads at considerable cost in time and money. The U.S. designs offered after 1958 were fully tested and engineered, and cheap to produce. They were manufactured in Britain from British materials and U.S. blueprints. They were British property {{and there were no}} American political constraints on their use, they were a favourable deal for the Treasury, and Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1 bridged the gap until the American designs could be manufactured.|$|E

25|$|China {{successfully}} tested H-bomb on June 17, 1967 at Lop Nur Nuclear Weapon Test Base, in Malan, Xinjiang(also {{known as}} Test No. 6). China became the fourth country to have successfully developed a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> after the United States, Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. It was {{dropped from a}} Hong-6(Chinese manufactured Tu-16) and was parachute-retarded for an airburst at 2960 meters. The bomb was a three-stage device with a boosted U-235 primary and U-238 pusher. The yield was 3.3 megatons.|$|E
25|$|Uranium's {{most common}} isotope, U-238, is {{fissionable}} but not fissile (meaning that it cannot sustain {{a chain reaction}} by itself but {{can be made to}} fission with fast neutrons). Its aliases include natural or unenriched uranium, depleted uranium (DU), tubealloy (Tu), and 28. It cannot sustain a chain reaction, because its own fission neutrons are not powerful enough to cause more U-238 fission. The neutrons released by fusion will fission U-238. This U-238 fission reaction produces most of the energy in a typical two-stage <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
