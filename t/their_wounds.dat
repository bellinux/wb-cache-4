During the night the Viet Cong cleared many of <b>their</b> <b>wounded</b> and dead from the battle field. A number of the wounded Australians lay there all through the long terrifying night, as the Viet Cong moved around them.|$|R

5|$|During the war, the 20th Battalion and its successor, the 20th Armoured Regiment, lost 366 {{officers}} and men either {{killed in action}} or who later died of <b>their</b> <b>wounds,</b> including 30 men who died as prisoners of war. Nearly 750 personnel were made prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|In total, eighty-four {{men from}} the brigade were killed in action or died of <b>their</b> <b>wounds</b> and another 123 were wounded. Several {{memorials}} were erected to commemorate the brigade in the Middle East and in India. The anniversary of the brigade's most famous victory, the Battle of Haifa, is still celebrated today by its successors in the Indian Army.|$|E
5|$|Not {{required}} for {{service in the}} Pacific theatre of operations, the regiment was disbanded in December 1945. During the war, the 18th Battalion and its successor, the 18th Armoured Regiment, lost nearly 320 officers and men either killed in action or who later died of <b>their</b> <b>wounds.</b> Of the exactly 350 personnel made prisoners of war, a further 21 men died while in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Hipper hove to {{in order}} to rescue her man {{overboard}} and Glowworms survivors. The German sailor was not found, but 40 British sailors were recovered, although at least six later died of <b>their</b> <b>wounds.</b> Lieutenant Ramsay, the senior surviving officer, told his rescuers that neither the helm nor the emergency rudder were manned when the ships collided so the destroyer's turn towards Hipper was probably accidental. German accounts only mention four torpedoes fired by Glowworm, but British accounts say all ten were fired. This was confirmed by photographic evidence taken after the collision showing all of her torpedo tubes empty.|$|E
5|$|General Abercrombie {{reported}} 547 killed, 1,356 wounded, and 77 missing. Lévis in {{one report}} {{claimed that the}} French recovered 800 British bodies, implying that Abercrombie may have underreported the actual death toll. Chartrand estimates the number of British killed (or died of <b>their</b> <b>wounds)</b> at about 1,000 for the main battle, with about 1,500 wounded. The skirmish on July 6 cost the British about 100 killed and wounded, {{and the loss of}} General Howe.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the South Korean government's Committee for the Review and Restoration of Honor for the No Gun Ri Victims, after {{a yearlong}} process of verifying claims through family registers, medical reports and other {{documents}} and testimony, certified the names of 150 No Gun Ri dead, 13 missing, and 55 wounded, including some who later died of <b>their</b> <b>wounds.</b> It said that reports were not filed on many other victims because of {{the passage of time}} and other factors. Of the certified victims, 41 percent were children under 15, and 70 percent were women, children or men over age 61.|$|E

5|$|Prithu {{became the}} first true king. He became a Kshatriya after he healed the Brahmanas of <b>their</b> <b>wounds,</b> inflicted by Prithu's tyrannical father, Vena. After {{acquiring}} many presents from the gods, Prithu conquered and ruled the earth {{as well as the}} Devas, Asuras, Yakshas, Rakshasas and Nagas in all glory. It was where the Satya Yuga reached its pinnacle. Prithu liberated his father Vena, from the hell called Pūt, hence all sons are called Putras. Practicing detachment, Prithu ruled according to the Vedas and the Dandaneeti.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later as a result of <b>their</b> <b>wounds.</b> It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E
5|$|In the 9 days {{of battle}} almost 2000 Allied {{soldiers}} were killed (some of whom died of <b>their</b> <b>wounds</b> or in captivity after the battle). These included over 1174 men of the British 1st Airborne Division, 219 men of the Glider Pilot Regiment, 92 men of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, 368 men of the RAF, 79 re-supply dispatchers of the RASC, 25 men of XXX Corps and 27 men of US IX Troop Carrier Command. The exact number of German dead is unknown, but {{is believed to be}} at least 1300. Additionally it is believed 453 Dutch civilians were killed during the battle.|$|E

5|$|Reports on {{the number}} of killed and wounded aboard Chesapeake during the battle vary widely. Broke's after-action report from 6July states 70killed and 100wounded. Contemporary sources place the number between 48–61killed and 85–99wounded. Discrepancies in the number of killed and wounded are {{possibly}} caused by the addition of sailors who died of <b>their</b> <b>wounds</b> in the ensuing days after the battle. The counts for Shannon have fewer discrepancies with 23killed; 56wounded. Despite his serious injuries, Broke ordered repairs to both ships and they proceeded on to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Captain Lawrence died en route and was buried in Halifax with military honors. The British imprisoned his crew. Captain Broke survived his wounds and was later made a baronet.|$|E
5|$|The two men later reach {{a nature}} reserve {{as the third}} killer shows up. The trio meet their wives, their kids and Kwai's {{syndicate}} during a barbecue. After a tense standoff, they explain that they killed Costello's grandchildren because the children had seen their faces. Not wanting to start a shootout {{in front of the}} three attackers' wives and children, everyone waits until they have left. A moonlit gun battle ensues, with both sides suffering injuries. The three attackers flee, while Costello and Kwai's syndicate take refuge at a run-down apartment in Hong Kong to treat <b>their</b> <b>wounds.</b> Costello reveals that he is a former assassin and has had a bullet in his head for twenty years, which is affecting his memory.|$|E
5|$|White and {{his company}} saw combat from early 1864 through the early 1865. During the summer of 1865 alone, White's company participated in 56 battles and skirmishes, {{including}} picket fights, with two men killed, 26 men wounded (four of which later {{died as a result}} of <b>their</b> <b>wounds),</b> and ten men taken prisoner. By October 1, 1864, White's company had 15 serviceable horses and 70 that were not serviceable. Between 1863 and 1865, White received one severe wound (from June 21, 1864) and two minor wounds from various campaigns. White felt the effects of these wounds for the remainder of his life. Throughout his military service during the American Civil War, White served under the commands of Stonewall Jackson and Jubal Early.|$|E

5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of <b>their</b> <b>wounds</b> and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|As Bellerophon slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , {{approaching}} the centre. It was by now about 9 pm; {{in the darkness}} Swiftsures captain, Benjamin Hallowell, was unable to identify the dismasted ship and presumed {{that she was a}} damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to hold fire and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of Orient, close to Bellerophons original position. Darby had by this time recovered sufficiently to resume command, and at his order the battered Bellerophon came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on Bellerophon. Eight more died of <b>their</b> <b>wounds</b> in the following week.|$|E
5|$|Completely unskilled at combat, Quark {{stands to}} either lose Grilka or be killed. Worf again helps the Ferengi; using a special device {{implemented}} by Dax, Worf {{is able to}} control Quark's body movements from an adjacent holosuite and help Quark defend himself with a bat'leth. Although the device temporarily malfunctions, he ultimately defeats the bodyguard. The scene concludes with Grilka and Quark alone and enamored with one another. Worf opines to Jadzia that Quark is unworthy of such a great Klingon woman, and she counters that Worf's interest in Grilka is superficial, asserting that there are better options awaiting him. Observing that Worf still fails to see the subtext in her hints, Dax initiates an aggressive romantic encounter. In the next scene, both couples are shown in the infirmary; Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) treats <b>their</b> <b>wounds</b> and quickly deduces {{the source of their}} injuries.|$|E
60|$|British and Egyptian {{casualties}} on the Atbara included 20 officers and 539 men killed or wounded. The Dervish loss was officially estimated at 40 Emirs and 3,000 dervishes killed. No statistics as to <b>their</b> <b>wounded</b> are forthcoming.|$|R
