Factors affecting funding cost include the length of time an asset or liability is repaid (Liquidity <b>Term</b> <b>Premium),</b> the extent to which an asset has been or can be securitised (which affects its liquidity) and the *behaviour* of customers in particular product/customer niches such as customers' propensity to withdraw long-term deposits at a penalty or to repay obligations such as mortgages early, all which affect real funding cost. This behaviour factor complicates the calculation of FTP and has required significant and expensive changes to banking systems.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} dynamic {{behavior}} of the sovereign CDS <b>term</b> <b>premium</b> {{for a group of}} European countries. The CDS <b>term</b> <b>premium</b> can be regarded as a forward- looking measure of idiosyncratic sovereign default risk as perceived by financial markets in real time. Using a Markov-switching unobserved component model, we decompose the daily CDS <b>term</b> <b>premium</b> into two unobserved components of statistically different nature (stationary and nonstationary) and study the determinants of their short-term dynamics. Specifically, we link these components in a vector autoregression to various daily observed financial market variables. We find that decomposition into the two components is vital for understanding the short-term dynamics of the entire CDS <b>term</b> <b>premium.</b> The strongest impacts can be attributed to CDS market liquidity, local stock returns, and overall risk aversion. By contrast, the impact of shocks from the sovereign bond market is rather muted. Therefore, the CDS market microstructure effect and investor sentiment play the main roles in sovereign risk evaluation in real time. Moreover, our results suggest that the response of the CDS <b>term</b> <b>premium</b> to shocks to financial variables is regime-dependent and can be ten times stronger during periods of high volatility...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1970 s, an {{inverted}} yield curve {{has been a}} reliable signal of an imminent recession. One interpretation of this signal is that markets expect monetary policy to ease as the Federal Reserve responds to an upcoming deterioration in economic conditions.

We find that passive strategies which capture the spot-futures premium do not yield abnor-mal returns, in contrast to passive spreading strategies which isolate the <b>term</b> <b>premiums.</b> The <b>term</b> structure of futures yields has strong explanatory power for both spot and <b>term</b> <b>premiums,</b> which can be ex-ploited using active trading strategies that go long in low-yield markets and short in high-yield markets. The profitability of these yield-based trading strategies is not due to systematic risk. Furthermore, we find that spreading returns are predictable by net hedge demand observed in the past, which can be exploited by active trading. Finally, there is momentum in futures markets, but momentum strategies do not outperform benchmark portfolios. JEL classification: G 13...|$|R
