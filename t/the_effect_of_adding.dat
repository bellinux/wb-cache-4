25|$|The chicken {{has long}} been a model {{organism}} for studying vertebrate developmental biology. As the embryo is readily accessible, its development can be easily followed (unlike mice). This also allows the use of electroporation for studying <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> or silencing a gene. Other tools for perturbing their genetic makeup are chicken embryonic stem cells and viral vectors.|$|E
25|$|The flow bench tests {{using only}} air while a real engine usually uses air mixed with fuel {{droplets}} and fuel vapor, which is significantly different. Evaporating fuel {{passing through the}} port-runner has <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> gas to and lowering {{the temperature of the}} air stream along the runner and giving the outlet flow rate slightly higher than the flow rate entering the port-runner. A port which flows dry air well might cause fuel droplets to fall out of suspension causing a loss of power not indicated by flow figures alone.|$|E

500|$|The use {{of simple}} {{symmetrical}} exponential gas kinetics models has shown up {{the need for}} a model that would give slower tissue washout. In the early 1980s the US Navy Experimental Diving Unit developed an algorithm using a decompression model with exponential gas absorption as in the usual Haldanian model, but a slower linear release during ascent. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> linear kinetics to the exponential model is to lengthen the duration of risk accumulation for a given compartment time constant ...|$|E

2500|$|There were {{numerous}} German armed forces (Wehrmacht) posters asking {{for assistance in}} the Bandenkrieg, {{the war against the}} Soviet partisans, though, once again, German policy had <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> to their problems. Posters for [...] "volunteer" [...] labour, with inscriptions like [...] "Come work with us to shorten the war", hid the appalling realities faced by Russian workers in Germany.

2500|$|In early 1845 the {{political}} {{issue of the}} incorporation of Schleswig and Holstein with Denmark arose in the public eye, with a particular interest to democratically minded politicians who favored unity of all the German states as a core of their programme. On February 6 he gave a speech opposing this annexation in the Baden Second Chamber, which gave him much notoriety outside Baden. On March 9 his friend and liberal compatriot [...] died suddenly of a lung disease, marking the beginning an ever increasing tone of bitterness by Hecker toward the government. Later that year he and [...] conducted a campaign of democracy, one result of which was his expulsion from Prussia {{on the occasion of}} a journey to Stettin, which had <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> to his popularity. [...] During this time, even before the outbreak of the revolution, he also began to lean towards socialism.|$|E
2500|$|The Pedestrian Library is {{dedicated}} to simulating pedestrian flows in a physical environment. [...] It allows you to create models of pedestrian-intensive buildings (like subway stations, security checks etc.) or streets (large numbers of pedestrians). [...] Models support statistics collection on pedestrian density in different areas. [...] This ensures acceptable performance of service points with a hypothetical load, estimates lengths of stay in specific areas, and detects potential problems with interior geometry – such as <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> too many obstacles - [...] and other applications. [...] In models created with the Pedestrian Library, pedestrians move in continuous space, reacting to different kinds of obstacles (walls, different kinds of areas), {{as well as other}} pedestrians. [...] Pedestrians are simulated as interacting agents with complex behavior, but the AnyLogic Pedestrian Library provides a higher level interface for faster creation of pedestrian models in the style of flowcharts.|$|E

30|$|Given that <b>the</b> {{marginal}} <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>added</b> SO 2 in the U.S. {{should be}} similar to that found here, {{there are two main}} implications for the U.S. market. First, regardless of the type of eco-certification or wine color, the price of wines that are intended to be cellared {{for longer periods of time}} benefits from the addition of SO 2. Wineries producing such wines would likely benefit from the allowance <b>of</b> <b>added</b> SO 2 in wines labeled as “organic". Second, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>added</b> SO 2 for wines intended to be consumed immediately varies depending on wine color and type of eco-label.|$|R
60|$|Godfrey had not smoked {{until he}} arrived at Kara; but he found that in the dense {{atmosphere}} of the prison room it was almost necessary, and therefore took to it. Besides smoking being allowed as useful to ward off fevers and improve {{the health of the}} prisoners, it also had <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> to their contentment, rendering them more easy of management, as the fear of the smoking being cut off did more to ensure ready obedience than even the fear of the stick. Tea was not among the articles of prison diet; but a samovar was always kept going by Mikail, and the tea sold to the prisoners at its cost price, and the small sum paid to the convicts sufficed to provide them with this and with tobacco.|$|E
60|$|The reticences of men {{are often}} only less full of meaning than their most {{pregnant}} speech; and Mr. Carlyle's unbroken silence upon the modern validity and truth of religious creeds says much. The fact {{that he should have}} taken no distinct side in the great debate as to revelation, salvation, inspiration, and the other theological issues that agitate and divide a community where theology is now mostly verbal, {{has been the subject of}} some comment, and has had <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> one rather peculiar side to the many varieties of his influence. Many in the dogmatic stage have been content to think that as he was not avowedly against them, he might be with them, and sacred persons have been known to draw their most strenuous inspirations from the chief denouncer of phantasms and exploded formulas. Only once, when speaking of Sterling's undertaking the clerical burden, does he burst out into unmistakable description of the old Jew stars that have now gone out, and wrath against those who would persuade us that these stars are still aflame and the only ones. That this reserve has been wise in its day, and has most usefully widened the tide and scope of the teacher's popularity, one need not dispute. There are conditions when indirect solvents are most powerful, as there are others, which these have done much to prepare, when no lover of truth will stoop to declarations other than direct. Mr. Carlyle has assailed the dogmatic temper in religion, and this is work that goes deeper than to assail dogmas.|$|E
