5|$|Later, it was {{announced}} that should a sequel or reboot not start filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the Daredevil franchise would revert from Fox back <b>to</b> <b>Marvel.</b> In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade, who dropped out of the director's chair due to scheduling conflicts. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, for the job—however, Carnahan said on Twitter that his pitch, described as a hard-boiled '70s thriller, had gone up in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox had given up on the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights revert <b>to</b> <b>Marvel</b> and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned <b>to</b> <b>Marvel</b> Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix Daredevil television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role.|$|E

5|$|The low {{box office}} {{performance}} of 1983's Superman III made feature-film adaptations of comic book properties {{a very low}} priority in Hollywood until the 1990s. In 1985, after a brief option on Spider-Man by Roger Corman expired, Marvel Comics optioned the property to Cannon Films. Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of any film’s revenues. However, the rights would revert <b>to</b> <b>Marvel</b> if a film was not made by April 1990.|$|E

5|$|By July 2000, {{the film}} was being written for New Line by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and Tim McCanlies. McCanlies' script used {{the idea of a}} Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film. In June 2001, New Line entered talks with Joss Whedon, a fan of the character, to direct, and in December 2002, McCanlies had turned in a {{completed}} script.

5|$|In 1741, the Chamouny {{valley and}} its glaciers {{on the north}} side of the massif were {{discovered}} and written about by two aristocratic travelling Englishmen, named William Windham and Richard Pococke. The descriptions of their exploits were published across Europe, bringing the mountains of the Mont Blanc range to the attention of a wide audience for the first time. In 1760, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure offered a large financial prize to the first people who successfully ascended Mont Blanc. The summit was finally attained on 8 August 1786 by two Chamonix men, the guide Jacques Balmat and Dr. Michel Paccard. The decades that followed saw the gradual opening up of Chamonix to the world, as well as the rest of the Mont Blanc massif. The many published accounts of climbs and impressive sights amongst or around the mountain range attracted numerous wealthy and notable visitors, for whom a visit <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> at the Sea of Ice (the Mer de Glace) became a fashionable thing to experience.|$|E

5|$|Marvel Comics {{writers and}} chief editors Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas wrote an X-Men {{screenplay}} in 1984 when Orion Pictures held an option {{on the film}} rights, but development stalled when Orion began facing financial troubles. Throughout 1989 and 1990, Stan Lee and Chris Claremont were in discussions with Carolco Pictures for an X-Men film adaptation, with James Cameron as producer and Kathryn Bigelow directing. A story treatment was written by Bigelow, with Bob Hoskins being considered for Wolverine and Angela Bassett being considered {{for the role of}} Storm. The deal fell apart when Stan Lee piqued Cameron's interest on a Spider-Man film, Carolco going bankrupt, and the film rights reverting <b>to</b> <b>Marvel.</b> In December 1992, Marvel discussed selling the property to Columbia Pictures to no avail. Meanwhile, Avi Arad produced the animated X-Men TV series for Fox Kids. 20th Century Fox was impressed by the success of the TV show, and producer Lauren Shuler Donner purchased the film rights for them in 1994, bringing Andrew Kevin Walker to write the script.|$|E
