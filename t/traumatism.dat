5000|$|Lipotomy, or hypo-osmolar treatment, is a {{technique}} which claims to enable cellulite to be reduced and which claims to involve intra-cellular hyperhydration, membrane weakening or potassium tonicity of adipocytes in order to permit their destruction. That technique is claimed {{to be based on}} the principle of diluting the interstitial liquid in which the adipocytes lie in order to induce differences in osmotic pressure on each side of the adipocyte membrane. Those differences in osmotic pressure result in a flow of liquid from the compartment of lower osmolarity (the interstitial liquid) towards the compartment of higher osmolarity (the cytoplasm of the adipocytes). The lipotomy technique conventionally used comprises the intra-fatty administration of a so-called [...] "destruction" [...] solution, which is highly hypotonic and which is claimed to bring about hyperhydration of adipocytes. The increase in volume of the adipocytes is claimed to bring about a weakening of their membrane, and is also claimed to cause cell lesions.

40|$|In the {{situations}} of collective and severe distress one may {{raise the issue}} of mental health work. This question was raised for us in 1993, in the refugee's camp of ex-Yugoslavia. We gave up the idea of undertaking to detect the most severe situations, and chose to build our work on an extensive context of trust. Our practice was to disclose the residual relational resources and to support a training programm in family therapy and network practices for local social workers. To disclose the residual relational resources, one needs an extensive screening that enables one to detect the cues of these resources and whether they seem highly unexpectable. Seeking only deficiences or pathologies puts us at the risk of transforming the work of detection into a work of stigmatization, that is, a work that repeats at another level the <b>traumatisms</b> caused by the war and the ethnic purification. Moreover, {{we have to be very}} cautious about these risks, as long as all these <b>traumatisms</b> are already perpetuated as consequenCeS of the situation of refugees, i. e., a situation of dramatic exclusion. The significant interpersonal links are the essential resources of the therapeutic process: they form the therapeutic site, they not only define its end, but are the most important means to reach that end. The contextual approach of Boszormenyi-Nagy offers, in that respect, a frame that enables us to acknowledge on the one hand the extent of the harms and on the other hand the residual resources that remain despite the dramatic extent of the destruction and <b>traumatisms...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{system of}} {{managing}} occupational risks {{is now being}} implemented in the Russian Federation; it implies developing mechanisms of their assessment. The article presents an assessment procedure for assessing occupational <b>traumatism</b> risks {{as a part of}} methodology for complex occupational risks assessment. Occupational <b>traumatism</b> risk assessment is based on such criteria as predicted <b>traumatism</b> frequency caused by priority risk factors for examined groups (discrete criteria of <b>traumatism</b> risks) and frequency diagram depending on consequences of injuries caused by priority risk factors. They are integral criteria of <b>traumatism</b> risks (known as F–N curves). «Best practice code» means <b>traumatism</b> risks levels which exist now in countries with high occupational safety. Our research objects were cases and circumstances of <b>traumatism</b> occurring among such an occupational group as «drivers and operators of mobile equipment». We detected that increased risks levels occurred due to a limited number of factors from each group of variables and it, in general, corresponded to Pareto principle. We obtained a dependence of y = c×e–bх type (F–N curve analogue), which described correlation between relative frequency of injuries and gravity of damage caused by them as a median of temporary disability of workers from the examined occupational group (R² > 0, 9). The obtained equations for approximating curve can be criterial in assessing injuring circumstances significance and risk levels for workers from relevant occupational groups in industry and agriculture in the Russian Federation.

The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct and epidemiologic study of patients attended at the Buccomaxillofacial Surgery and Traumatology Service of a regional hospital in Goiania/GO, Brazil, between 2008 and 2010. Material and methods: 521 files of patients, who had suffered maxillofacial <b>traumatisms</b> that resulted in a total of 615 fractures, were evaluated. The files were used to analyze gender, age, etiologic agents and distribution of fractured bones. Results: About 80 % of patients were male, whereas 20 % of the affected individuals were women. The most frequently etiologic factor found in the two groups was automobile accidents, followed by physical aggressions and falls. Concerning to fractured bones, the zygomatic complex, followed by fractures of the mandible, the nasal bones themselves, condyle and Le Fort type fractures were the most prevalent ones, in both groups.

40|$|Abstract. Currently, a {{minimally}} invasive surgery called stenting is extensively used to increase the lumen of partially obstructed arteries. Unfortunately, restenosis, a postoperative phenomenon in which the lumen of the artery is reduced due to a <b>traumatism</b> of the artery, is still a concern. The most popular solution that has been adopted by stent manufacturers comprises drug-eluting stents. This paper presents a new stent concept in which the treatment of restenosis is carried out from a completely different angle. Indeed, instead of traumatizing the artery, {{and then trying to}} control restenosis with drugs, the new stent minimizes the <b>traumatism</b> of the artery by expanding itself, not instantaneously, but progressively, and in a controlled manner. To achieve this, a nitinol stent over which a series of polymer rings are installed tries to reach a fully deployed configuration, but the polymer rings, which act as a retainer, become soft over time due to creeping. Thus, after the initial deployment in the artery, the stent continues its expansion autonomously {{over an extended period of}} time (a few weeks). It is believed that the artery has enough time to adapt to the expansion, leading to minimum <b>traumatism.</b> This paper presents the stent design...|$|E

On the other hand, this kind of fixation method also has weak points: the exterior communication that predisposes for infections and <b>traumatisms,</b> the violation of the distal inter-phalangeal (DIP) joint, the lack of compression and rotational control and, finally, discomfort at removal [3, 7 – 10].|$|R

40|$|AIMS: This study classifies {{cases of}} {{traumatic}} diaphragmatic hernias (TDH) in patients {{admitted to the}} Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Coimbra University Hospitals (HUC) from 1990 to 2004. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 34 cases of TDH, studying anatomical location, place and time of diagnosis, complementary tests aiding diagnosis, herniated organs, associated <b>traumatism,</b> morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Twenty-eight male and six female patients {{with an average age}} of 40. 5 years +/- 20. 5, average SAPS score 38. 8. Average length of stay was 19. 1 +/- 13. 6 days, all suffered from closed <b>traumatism</b> and were put on artificial ventilation. The left-side diaphragm was more frequently affected (94. 1 %) then the right. Diagnosis in 19 cases was made up in the first six hours following the diagnosis of <b>traumatism,</b> in four cases within 12 hours and in the remaining cases between 48 hours and 16 years after <b>traumatism.</b> In 13 patients the diagnosis was established intra-operatively. The stomach was typically one of the herniated organs. The most frequently associated lesions at the thoracic level were pulmonary contusion, haemothorax and pneumothorax, and at the abdominal level, haemoperitoneum and splenic lesion. The rates for complications and mortality were 55. 8 % and 11. 7 % respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TDH mainly occurs on the left side through closed thoraco-abdominal trauma following road traffic accidents. This group of patients, on average younger than others admitted to ICU, presents a longer average hospitalisation period, but has lower rates of mortality and lower SAPS severity scores. The most commonly herniated organ was the stomach and the most frequently encountered lesions were cranial-encephalic, splenic and pleural traumatisms. Pre-operative diagnosis of diaphragmatic injuries is difficult and a high index of clinical suspicion is needed after thoraco-abdominal trauma. This diagnosis should always be considered a possibility in cases of closed thoraco-abdominal traumas...|$|E
