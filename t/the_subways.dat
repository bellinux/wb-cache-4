5|$|In late 2013, Improv Everywhere, the New York City {{initiative}} {{behind the}} annual No Pants Day in <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> and various flash-mob stunts, convened and filmed a re-enactment. While a look-alike couple performed the scene, 30 others joined {{as if it}} was contagious. Surprised staff and customers responded in appreciation. The film and follow-up interviews are public. In October of the same year, Katz Delicatessen invited Baron Von Fancy to display his ten-foot high mural quoting the famous line in its pop-up gallery next door, The Space.|$|E
5|$|Decades {{of efforts}} to {{eradicate}} or simply thin the rat population in the system have been unsuccessful. In March 2009, the Transit Authority announced a series of changes to its vermin control strategy, including new poison formulas and experimental trap designs. In October 2011, the MTA announced a new initiative to clean 25 subway stations, along with their garbage rooms, of rat infestations. Also in October 2011, the MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of garbage in <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> by removing all garbage bins from the subway platforms. The initiative is being tested at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main Street stations. As of March 2016, stations along the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and various other stations had their garbage cans removed due {{to the success of}} the program.|$|E
25|$|The City {{decided to}} issue rapid transit bonds outside of its regular bonded debt limit and build <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> itself, and {{contracted}} with the IRT (which {{by that time}} ran the elevated lines in Manhattan) to equip and operate <b>the</b> <b>subways,</b> sharing the profits with the City and guaranteeing a fixed five-cent fare later confirmed in the Dual Contracts.|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>subway,</b> <b>the</b> energy consumption of subway ventilation and air-conditioning systems is increasing rapidly. To solve this problem, this paper describes the environment of a subway station in Beijing subway line no. 2 from July to September, 2011, and uses numerical methods to quantitatively analyze and evaluate the contributions of <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> piston effect and natural outdoor cold sources to energy saving in the air-conditioning system and improvement of <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> environment. <b>The</b> {{results show that the}} piston effect can be used for ventilation in each area of <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> station. During summer, part of <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> air-conditioning season, a natural cold source can introduce a cold capacity of 5, 100 GJ to <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> station...|$|R
50|$|South of <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> platforms, underground, are {{the four}} tunnels that {{comprise}} <b>the</b> Vincent <b>Subway</b> Yard. This station {{is also home}} to <b>the</b> <b>Subway</b> Track Maintenance Office, located on the Mezzanine level.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of an extensive freeway system throughout Southern California ultimately led to the closure of <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> in <b>the</b> 1950s. As Angelenos became increasingly reliant on the personal automobile, ridership plummeted and forced the struggling Pacific Electric company to abandon their operation in 1955. <b>The</b> last <b>subway</b> car to carry passengers - carrying a banner reading [...] "To Oblivion" [...] - traversed <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> on <b>the</b> morning of June 19, 1955. Shortly thereafter, Pacific Electric removed the tracks from <b>the</b> <b>subway,</b> closed <b>the</b> <b>Subway</b> Terminal Building and Toluca Substation, and left the site abandoned.|$|R
25|$|Today, all of <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> {{are owned}} by New York City and leased to the Transit Authority for operation.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{the band}} played at the biggest open-air festival in Europe (400,000 – 500,000 rock fans every year) – Przystanek Woodstock in Poland. On 17 July they headlined and closed the fifth 2000 Trees Festival in the UK. On 31 July, <b>The</b> <b>Subways</b> headlined at the Y – Not Festival, near Matlock, Derbyshire. On 8 August 2010, they {{appeared}} at the Hevy Music Festival near Folkestone. In the same month, <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> played in Lithuania's rock/metal music festival, Rocknights, in Zarasai.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Subways</b> {{name comes}} from a time when Lunn, Morgan and Cooper used to hang around the local subway {{underpass}} which ran underneath a Welwyn Garden City roundabout.|$|E
50|$|On 7 September 1988, <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> Almaty Metro project started construction; <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> {{was opened}} on 1 December 2011 after 23 years.|$|R
50|$|After 18 {{months of}} {{construction}} and $1.25 million in expenditures, <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> officially {{opened to the}} public on December 1, 1925. Traveling a distance of slightly over one mile, <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> connected <b>the</b> intersection of Beverly and Glendale Blvds in Westlake with <b>the</b> <b>Subway</b> Terminal Building at the corner of Fourth and Hill Streets in downtown. <b>The</b> <b>subway</b> cars were powered by a new substation - Toluca No. 51 - which was constructed in the yard adjacent to the tunnel portal.|$|R

25|$|After Glastonbury, <b>The</b> <b>Subways</b> {{went on to}} play The Carling Weekend 2004 in both Reading and Leeds, {{and then}} {{proceeded}} to play their very first (self funded) tour of the UK consisting of 35 dates.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Subways</b> are an English {{rock band}} from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Their debut album, Young for Eternity, was {{released}} on 4 July 2005 in the UK and 14 February 2006 in the U.S. Their second album, All or Nothing, {{was released on}} 30 June 2008 and their third album Money and Celebrity debuted on 19 September 2011.|$|E
25|$|The Union has a {{tradition}} of hosting up-and-coming bands; recently it has seen bands such as Ash, Sugababes, Amerie, The Kooks, Reel Big Fish, The Departure, <b>The</b> <b>Subways,</b> Idlewild, The Rory McKenna Variety Show, Hell is for Heroes, The Automatic, The Dave Wright Experience, Boy Kill Boy, Amy Winehouse, The Killers, The Streets, Feeder, and Scouting for Girls.|$|E

50|$|Grand {{opened in}} 1951 {{as part of}} <b>the</b> Milwaukee-Dearborn <b>Subway.</b> <b>The</b> Milwaukee-Dearborn <b>Subway</b> was <b>the</b> second <b>subway</b> line in Chicago's Loop since <b>the</b> State Street <b>Subway</b> opened 8 years earlier in 1943.|$|R
25|$|The band {{released}} many demos and EPs {{in their}} early days when playing the London circuit in the UK. With every batch of new songs that <b>The</b> <b>Subways</b> would compose, Lunn would insist that the band record them. However, {{at such a young}} age the group had no money with which to go into a studio to record consistently, so they came upon the idea of buying their own cheap recording system at home. Eventually, the band had their own website, http://www.thesubways.net, which Lunn himself constructed and maintained, where they put all their new songs. Through the use of their own home recording system they now had roughly eight demos worth of songs both on the internet and being sent out to local and London promoters at various venues. <b>The</b> <b>Subways</b> then began touring in the local and London area playing regularly at the Buffalo Bar in Highbury and Islington.|$|E
25|$|Platforms 1 and 2 {{are used}} by the London Overground's North London Line. They {{comprise}} an island platform with a step-free link to platform 12 and <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> linking to platforms 3 to 11. The platforms can accommodate trains with up to six carriages, though at present, due to short platforms elsewhere, shorter trains are used.|$|E
25|$|As on Coney Island, Marsh {{captured}} {{the crowds of}} the bustling inner city life. Marsh {{spent a lot of}} his time on the sidewalks, <b>the</b> <b>subways,</b> the nightclubs, bars and restaurants finding the crowds. He also loved to single people out on the trains, in the parks, or in ballrooms to capture a single human figure in isolation {{from the rest of the}} city.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Glasgow <b>Subway</b> {{rolling stock}} serves <b>the</b> Glasgow <b>Subway,</b> <b>the</b> third-oldest {{underground}} metro {{system in the}} world. The first 33 cars of the current rolling stock was built by Metro Cammell between 1977 and 1979. Eight additional trailer cars were built in 1992. The rolling stock entered service when <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> re-opened after modernisation work on 16 April 1980. The rolling stock is being refurbished ahead of new rolling stock being acquired {{as part of the}} upgrade to <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b> Unlike other Metro systems in the United Kingdom, <b>the</b> <b>Subway</b> has a running gauge of 4 ft (1,219 mm).|$|R
50|$|Canyoneering groups {{acknowledge}} two popular routes {{for visiting}} <b>the</b> <b>Subway.</b> <b>The</b> through route, for advanced hikers, involves a one-way hike downstream from the Wildcat Canyon Trailhead. The easier route accesses the lower section of <b>the</b> <b>Subway</b> from downstream.|$|R
50|$|When the {{airplane}} is landed on its launching pad, its pilot can descend down to <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> tunnel. There {{he has to}} avoid <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> trains which can crush him on contact. On later levels, some aliens drop eggs which hatch upon landing on the ground, revealing a little blue alien which descends down to <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> tunnel and heads towards the buildings' basement. If the alien reaches the basement, it will start eating it, eventually causing the whole building to collapse. Killing this alien usually requires visiting <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> tunnel.|$|R
25|$|On June 25, 1923 {{two cars}} {{of a train}} coming from 65th Street Terminal derailed and fell towards Flatbush Avenue. Eight {{passengers}} died and many were injured. With increased use of <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> compared to the elevated lines, and {{the completion of the}} unification of the city's three subway systems, the Fifth Avenue Line was closed at midnight on June 1, 1940, and was demolished in 1941.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} September 11, 2001, attacks, the ferry {{was used to}} {{evacuate}} victims of the attacks at the World Trade Center before being temporarily closed for a week. Ferry service was restored by September 18. When it reopened, some ferries were diverted to Bay Ridge due to subway and road closures across the East River. This continued into 2002, with some 2,200 passengers per day using the ferry even though <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> and highways had been reopened. Also in 2002, the city proposed eliminating night service again and outsourcing nighttime operations to other ferry companies in the area.|$|E
25|$|Streetcar {{congestion}} {{in downtown}} Boston led to <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> in 1897 and elevated rail in 1901. The Tremont Street Subway {{was the first}} rapid transit tunnel in the United States. Grade-separation added capacity and avoided delays caused by cross streets. The first elevated railway and the first rapid transit line in Boston were built three years before the first underground line of the New York City Subway, but 34 {{years after the first}} London Underground lines, and long after the first elevated railway in New York City, its Ninth Avenue El started operations on July 1, 1868 in Manhattan as an elevated cable car line.|$|E

25|$|With a two-person crew, an {{on-board}} train {{guard is}} responsible for opening and closing <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> car doors, and making sure no one is trapped in a door as the train leaves a station. From <b>the</b> <b>subway's</b> inception in 1954 to 1991, the train guard notified patrons that <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> car doors were closing with two short blasts from a whistle.|$|R
25|$|The 1960s Bull Ring Centre had {{problems}} {{from the beginning}} and was very much a product of its era. At the time of its opening it was considered the height of modernity, but higher rentals within the shopping centre meant that traders turned away from it. The public were also less inclined to use <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> and escalators, which stopped working regularly. Also, it did not age well and soon became generally regarded as an unfortunate example of 1960s Brutalist architecture, with its boxy grey concrete design and its isolation within ringroads connected only by pedestrian subways. It was, by the 1980s, much disliked by the public and contributed to the popular conception that Birmingham was a concrete jungle of shopping centres and motorways.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, hijackers took control of four {{domestic}} U.S. commercial airliners. All of the planes crashed, none of them in New Jersey; however, two of them crashed into the two tallest towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, which collapsed within two hours (and was seen from the Gold Coast in New Jersey), and Todd Beamer, of New Jersey, {{is thought to have}} played a role in bringing down Flight 93 short of the terrorists' intended target. The destruction of the twin towers could be seen from New Jersey. The official count records 2,986 deaths in the attacks, including around 700 residents of New Jersey. Over 160,000 people were evacuated from the Manhattan area to New Jersey because <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> had been closed down and PATH station had been closed down and were eventually destroyed in the collapse.|$|E
25|$|The union did not, however, {{concede the}} last point. After winning a {{contentious}} strike against the privately owned bus companies in early 1941, during which La Guardia had {{announced plans to}} have the police guard strikebreakers {{in the event that}} the companies attempted to operate, the union made public preparations for a strike against the City if it challenged the union's right to represent these employees or to roll back their contract rights. La Guardia responded by directing the Police Department to develop plans to run <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> {{in the event of a}} strike and supporting legislation that made it a crime for workers to leave transit equipment unattended. La Guardia went further and announced that while workers could choose organizations to represent them, the City had no obligation to recognize those organizations as the exclusive representative of those workers or to engage in collective bargaining with them.|$|E
