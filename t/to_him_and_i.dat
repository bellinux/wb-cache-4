25|$|Mr. Ament left us {{this morning}} after a delay here of five days. The Mark Twain article in the North American Review cut him like a knife and weighs deeply on him, but he takes it in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think he goes back well prepared to set things right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling exactly what he has done. It will be a story worth telling, even if there were no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for those who know of it.|$|E

I want to be on this.’ I came up <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was like, ‘Man, are you working on this record? Are you working on this beat?’ He goes, ‘Yeah … do you got an idea for it?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, I might. I didn’t. I was lying like a motherfucker. I was like, ‘Yeah, man, I want to get on this joint.” ...|$|E
500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. My heart goes out <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope he recovers quickly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's one o' Bob Pretty's larks," [...] {{said the}} old man, flushing. [...] "I see you talking <b>to</b> <b>'im,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought as 'ow he warn't up to no good. Biggest rascal in Claybury, he is. I've said so afore, and I'll say so agin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, M. le Cure. If I {{had married}} M. Urmand, I know I should be wicked <b>to</b> leave <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would {{do my best}} <b>to</b> live with <b>him</b> <b>and</b> make <b>him</b> a good wife. But I have found out in time that I can't love him; <b>and</b> {{therefore}} <b>I</b> am sure that I ought not <b>to</b> marry <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> won't.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had never}} yet altered his old manner. <b>I</b> loved it <b>and</b> <b>him</b> {{so much that}} when I now went up <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> took my usual chair, which was always put at his side--for {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> read <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes <b>I</b> talked <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes <b>I</b> silently worked by him--I hardly liked to disturb it by laying my hand on his breast. But I found I did not disturb it at all.|$|R
500|$|Chinese {{was taught}} to Murasaki's brother as {{preparation}} {{for a career in}} government, and during her childhood, living in her father's household, she learned and became proficient in classical Chinese. In her diary she wrote, [...] "When my brother... was a young boy learning the Chinese classics, I was in the habit of listening <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> became unusually proficient at understanding those passages that he found too difficult to understand and memorize. Father, a most learned man, was always regretting the fact: 'Just my luck,' he would say, 'What a pity she was not born a man! With her brother she studied Chinese literature, and she probably also received instruction in more traditional subjects such as music, calligraphy and Japanese poetry. Murasaki's education was unorthodox. Louis Perez explains in The History of Japan that [...] "Women... were thought to be incapable of real intelligence and therefore were not educated in Chinese." [...] Murasaki was aware that others saw her as [...] "pretentious, awkward, difficult to approach, prickly, too fond of her tales, haughty, prone to versifying, disdainful, cantankerous and scornful". Asian literature scholar Thomas Inge believes she had [...] "a forceful personality that seldom won her friends".|$|E
500|$|When the 2000 Republican National Convention {{began in}} Philadelphia {{at the end}} of July, McCain took his Straight Talk Express to meet with his delegates and {{supporters}} before formally releasing them to Bush. [...] There were tears from McCain, his wife Cindy, and some of the campaign staff and delegates. [...] Many of McCain's supporters were vocally unhappy with his words of support for Bush, and the Times wrote that, [...] "Politics as usual with its compromises, cruelties and emotional costs — caught up with Senator John McCain this weekend." [...] McCain made a point of having Cindy McCain head the Arizona delegation at the convention, not his antagonist Governor Hull. [...] On August 1, the second night of the convention, McCain delivered a speech in praise of Bush, in particular trying to solidify Bush's national security and foreign policy credentials. In it, McCain connected his family to Bush's, making reference to former President George H. W. Bush's combat service as a naval aviator in the Pacific Theater of World War II under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., McCain's grandfather. [...] He said directly of the nominee, [...] "I support him. I am grateful <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> am proud of him." [...] The Almanac of American Politics called it [...] "a moving, elegiac speech that ended as if in a minor key." ...|$|E
2500|$|Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones {{said of the}} appointment: [...] "Raj isn’t only a {{personal}} friend to me but also to Wales. He’s been a tireless advocate for promoting our country {{as a place to}} invest and do business and travelled with me to India earlier this year to highlight what we have to offer to Indian companies. I know his appointment as Honorary Consul to Wales will be of great pride <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am sure he will do an excellent job." ...|$|E
60|$|I didn't care <b>to</b> meet <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't {{well get}} down, So I let the Waler have it, and {{we headed for}} the town.|$|R
60|$|So I told it <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> being alone, for he {{commanded}} his councillors and servants to retire out of hearing.|$|R
6000|$|... "But she doesn't want <b>to</b> marry <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{doubt whether}} he can be got to marry any one else. There is still a peck of difficulties." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hogg {{performed}} {{worse in}} the second test. He was no balled fourteen times and wound up arguing with the umpire and bowling a beamer. [...] "Both Rodney Hogg and (Australian captain Kim) Hughes apologised to the umpire concerned and that {{is as far as}} the matter will go", said manager Bob Merriman. [...] "However I will be talking <b>to</b> <b>him...</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will seek an assurance that nothing of this nature will happen again". He finished with figures of 0–118 – {{the first time he had}} failed to take a wicket in an innings – with 21 no balls. According to one journalist: ...|$|E
2500|$|Kimmel, however, was upfront with {{wanting to}} discuss the fiasco at hand, and upon his appearance, {{attempted}} to steer the questions that way: {{when asked about his}} favorite prank, he responded, [...] "I think the best prank I ever pulled was, I told a guy once, 'Five years from now I'm going to give you my show.' And then when the five years came, I gave it <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> took it back, almost instantly." [...] Another example came from when Leno asked, [...] "Ever order anything off the TV?" [...] Kimmel replied, [...] "Like when NBC ordered your show off the TV?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Martin Bashir {{interview}}ed Diana for the BBC {{current affairs}} show Panorama. [...] The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995. In reference to {{her relationship with}} Hewitt, the Princess said to Bashir, [...] "Yes, I adored him. Yes, I {{was in love with}} him. But I was very let down [...]" [...] Referring to her husband's affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, she said, [...] "Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded." [...] Of herself, she said, [...] "I'd like to be a queen of people's hearts." [...] On the Prince's suitability for kingship, she stated, [...] "Because I know the character I would think that the top job, as I call it, would bring enormous limitations <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't know whether he could adapt to that." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} I was very glad, as indeed I was, {{to have been}} no {{hindrance}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> hoped I should be none now.|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy not. I {{should be}} afraid lest I should become as nothing <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> yet <b>I</b> {{would not have}} you think that I am selfish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've made {{a fool of}} myself," [...] she said. [...] "Ginger, your cousin... Mr. Carmyle... {{just now}} he asked me <b>to</b> marry <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said I would." ...|$|R
2500|$|Vice President Joe Biden {{recalled}} Byrd's {{standing in}} the rain with him as Biden buried his daughter when Biden had just been elected to the Senate. He called Byrd [...] "a tough, compassionate, and outspoken leader and dedicated above all else to making life better {{for the people of}} the Mountain State." [...] President Barack Obama said, [...] "His profound passion for that body and its role and responsibilities was as evident behind closed doors as it was in the stemwinders he peppered with history. He held the deepest respect of members of both parties, and he was generous with his time and advice, something I appreciated greatly as a young senator." [...] Senator Jay Rockefeller, who had served with Byrd since 1985, said, [...] "I looked up to him, I fought next <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am deeply saddened that he is gone." [...] Former President Jimmy Carter noted, [...] "He was my closest and most valuable adviser while I served as president. I respected him and attempted in every way to remain in his good graces. He was a giant among legislators, and was courageous in espousing controversial issues." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I saw {{his wife}} signing <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> knew {{she wanted to}} be left alone with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{them get}} {{somebody}} else. I don't {{want to put}} myself in opposition <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> certainly {{do not want to}} oppose her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give my love to my uncle, <b>and</b> tell <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> am much obliged <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> {{know how}} good he is; but I can't--because of Tom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] exclaimed Dr. Tredway, heartily, [...] "that's good of you. Somebody {{who knows}} Hilary's {{situation}} ought <b>to</b> see <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{can think of}} no better messenger than you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean to be}} dramatic," [...] Evelyn {{answered}} quietly. [...] "Still, perhaps I {{was rather}} highly strung. Reggie asked me <b>to</b> marry <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told <b>him</b> I could not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no; I had rather not. You say young Fulmort attends <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{could not}} speak to him with patience. Five o'clock, Saturday?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "’What gal is that, Ned?’ ses Joe, {{who was in}} {{the next}} bunk <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw Bill’s eyes screw up tight, and ’e {{suddenly}} fell fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{perfectly}} shameless," [...] proclaimed Ethel Wing. [...] "I've lost {{my heart}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't care who knows it. Why {{in the world}} didn't you marry him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you so atrocious as <b>to</b> defend <b>him?</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> {{thought you}} had a heart--so handsome, too! When I saw you I said, Ah, had I married this man, what a happy life!" ...|$|R
6000|$|But Antony yet lived, {{though the}} power of speech had left him. Then <b>I</b> drew near <b>and,</b> kneeling, made pretence <b>to</b> {{minister}} <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> as <b>I</b> ministered I whispered in his ear: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary!" [...] I burst out, in {{the first}} heat of my enthusiasm, [...] "my father is coming home to-day. I will speak <b>to</b> <b>him</b> to-night. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> will marry you to-morrow!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Catherine {{knew nothing}} of the Captain's movements. [...] "Like you," [...] she told her mother, [...] "I have {{something}} to say <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't know where he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lodloe; [...] "I wish {{very much}} {{to speak to you}} in regard <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> cannot do it here where we may be {{interrupted}} at any moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I had no {{appointment}} wi' the Laird," [...] said Jeanie, drawing back; [...] "I want just {{to speak}} twa words <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wad rather do it standing here, Mrs. Balchristie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's my {{weakness}} to-day. I can say no {{to everybody}} in the world but <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> try <b>to</b> remember <b>him</b> as he used to come down those steps on Ransome Street....|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} shall save him! All I ask you {{is to say}} nothing of what I've done. It's been a {{pleasure}} to me <b>to</b> serve <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't deserve, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't want, gratitude." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, clear enough," [...] she {{repeated}} in a strained voice. [...] "And yet--yet--oh! Father, {{he had just}} asked me <b>to</b> marry <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't {{believe that he is}} dead before I had time to answer." ...|$|R
