25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the <b>trochoid</b> chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. Primary power transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.|$|E
25|$|Wankel engines run {{very hot}} on the {{ignition}} and exhaust side of the engine's <b>trochoid</b> chamber, whereas the intake and compression parts are cooler. Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water cooling system, with Garside reasoning that provided the power did not exceed , air-cooling would suffice. Garside cooled {{the interior of the}} rotors with filtered ram-air. This very hot air was cooled in a plenum contained within the semi-monocoque frame and afterwards, once mixed with fuel, fed into the engine. This air was quite oily after running through the interior of the rotors, and thus was used to lubricate the rotor tips. The exhaust pipes become very hot, with Suzuki opting for a finned exhaust manifold, twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings and silencers with heat shields. Garside simply tucked the pipes out of harm's way under the engine, where heat would dissipate in the breeze of the vehicle's forward motion. Suzuki opted for complicated multi-stage carburation, whilst Garside choose simple carburetors. Suzuki had three lube systems, whilst Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system which was fed to both the main bearings and the intake manifolds. Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth, however with rough patches at 4,000rpm; Garside opted for a turbine-smooth twin-rotor motor. Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame, but Garside put his rotors as low as possible to lower the center of gravity of the motorcycle.|$|E

2500|$|RE5 project chief Shigeyasu Kamiya {{stated that}} Suzuki had {{considered}} a rotary-powered motorcycle in the mid-1960s. Research and development continued {{till the end}} of that decade, leading to the signing of a technical licence with NSU in November 1970, Suzuki being the 20th firm to do so. As a pioneer of rotary development, Suzuki engineers designed and produced numerous special machines for the rotary production process. Of these, ten were particularly notable and included the machine to cut the <b>trochoid</b> block. Suzuki holds twenty patents in plating, as considerable research went into the composite electro-chemical materials (CEM) used to plate the rotor housing. Prototypes testing took two years. The bikes were launched in 1974. Suzuki enlisted astronaut Edgar Mitchell, to introduce and endorse the bike.

2500|$|Internally {{the rotor}} is cooled and {{lubricated}} by engine sump {{oil and the}} aforementioned <b>trochoid</b> pump. Engine oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower {{right side of the}} cases. The filter includes an internal bypass valve in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located under the seat. An engine-driven metering pump sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the throttle grip. The metering pump also provided lubrication for the final drive chain. A second line is routed from the metering pump and around the bike, ending just above the drive chain behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the [...] "A" [...] models by a simple blanking plug at the metering pump. The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rotary engine}} places severe thermal {{stresses}} on its cases, as {{two sides of}} rotor are constantly exposed to high ignition and exhaust temperatures, while the third side inducts cool fuel/air mixture. To cope with this, and probably capitalizing on their previous experience with water cooling, Suzuki opted for a liquid-cooled engine using two separate systems. Oil is used to lubricate and cool the internals of the rotor and water-cooled the external jacketing. Oil is fed from an engine sump by a <b>trochoid</b> pump at around [...] The oil is then circulated through an oil cooler mounted across the frame and below the radiator. A pressure regulator also acts as a bypass {{in case of a}} blockage in the cooler. A centrifugal pump sends coolant around the external rotor jacketing but via an intricate path in an attempt to even out the massive thermal stresses. Liquid enters at the point of highest temperatures (ignition), passing from the right side to the left, and then makes a 180° turn, returning to the right side and passing near the exhaust port. Most of the coolant is then routed to the very large radiator that sits across the frame in front of the bike. Some of the coolant that was not directed to the radiator is now sent around the inlet port and the left side housing. Its passage is once again reversed before flowing to the radiator. [...] The water cooling is thermostatically controlled, and a shrouded fan {{on the right side of}} the radiator takes care of excessive temperatures, switching on at [...] and cutting when the temperature falls below [...]|$|E

40|$|In the nocturnal stable {{boundary}} layer, regular disturbances {{occur with}} a period duration of several hours, the horizontal components of which exhibit a phase shift {{against each other}} so that the hodographs of the windvectors at an altitude represent an epitrochoid or hypotrochoid. These disturbances are superimposed upon the inertial oscillation or mean flow.

In at least 20 % of all cases disturbances are to be found with a period duration of a few hours, the phase positions of which exhibit broad variations. In more than 6 % of all cases, the formation of <b>trochoids</b> is possible due to the phase position. Two possible causes of this phenomenon are presented. One is that turning point instability also causes helical rolls in the thermally stable boundary layer, the horizontal components of which rolls have a phase shift in the wind velocity maximum.

40|$|High Speed Milling (HSM) {{machines}} are growing in mainstream manufacturing such as machining of dies and molds. The advantages of HSM include reduction in machining time and better surface finish. A typical HSM machine has a heavy tool-carrying spindle assembly with {{one to three}} degrees of freedom. Consequently, high inertial forces are generated as the spindle head moves to perform cutting. Machining path planning for HSM machines is {{the design of the}} motion of the cutter relative to the part such that the shape is cut n minimum time subject to several constraints. For example, finish cuts limit the thickness of the layer to be machined below a given value. Rough cutting constraints are often guided by the ability of the machine tool to achieve a desired feed rate and cutting speed, without increasing the likelihood of tool failure. Feed rate and cutting speed are related to machine power, chatter, and cutting forces. Tool failure can be induced due to sudden changes in the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE). Likewise, tool failure as well as machining accuracy is affected by inertial forces on the table as well as the spindle head assembly. All practical machining planning algorithms design tool paths by using some typical patterns of shapes (e. g. zigzag, contour offsets, spirals or <b>trochoids).</b> In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we perform an in-depth analysis of all existing path planning algorithms, and point out their strengths and weaknesses by applying them to a series of benchmark part shapes. The objective was to analyze different types of strategy of tool path joining in unit machining operations and their affect on the overall cutting time. In the second part of the thesis, the issue of designing optimized unit shape patterns, in particular spirals and generalized <b>trochoids</b> is examined. In-dept analysis of path patterns based on several common criteria is carried out, including: path length, curvature, and CWE. Two new pattern styles utilizing Cornu spirals (Clothoidal curve) and Spline interpolation are proposed and optimal methods to use them in path planning are introduced. The results show that path length can be minimized by the employing circular arc splines. In the view of curvature change, Bi-Clothoid had the best performance due to its G 2 property. On the other hand, Bspline curves are marginally better from the point of view of engagement analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{relationships of}} the freshwater snail family Melanosidae were studies through a detailed anatomical investigation of one population. Melanopsids {{may be related}} to ancient marine families now confined around Australia. Such lineage {{may be related to}} neogastropods. A common ancestry with <b>trochoids</b> seems also plausible. ^ Within the Melanopsidae, relationships were assessed with 35 allozyme loci and 33 populations collected throughout the Western Mediterranean region. Analysis were performed first on a representative subset of ten populations. The topologies of all trees were compared using the partition metric. The methods considered best were then applied to all populations. ^ Thirteen measures of genetic distance were calculated among the ten selected populations. For phenetic analysis, the choice of clustering algorithm was found to have a larger impact than that of genetic distance. Distance-Wagner trees appear to be more sensitive to changes in the data set. ^ Repeating the analysis deleting one population at a time shows that systematic deviations occur with all distance methods. Such deviations are caused by the pattern of shared alleles in the data set and the uneven distribution of unique alleles among populations. The computationally simplest measures of genetic distance performed best in terms of consistency. ^ Cladograms inferred taking the alleles as individual characters are extremely sensitive to changes in the data set. This is caused by an artifical {{increase in the number of}} characters. ^ A cladistic analysis based on the locus as the character has been implemented using an original modification of the functional outgroup method that operated in a hierachical manner. The trees obtained with ten and all populations are compatible. ^ Pylogenetic relationships appear to be strongly correlated with geographical proximity. Only one instance of sympatry has been found. A case of retriculate evolution is postulated. The congruence of geological and biological history suggests that tectonic events have played a major role in the diversification of melanopsids. Both vicariance and dispersal are considered as important, complimentary processes acting on melanopsid biogeography. ...|$|R
