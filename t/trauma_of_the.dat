5|$|While helping fix a woman's car engine on {{the side}} of the road in Middletown, Connecticut, Andrew Stockston (Adam Grupper) sees a {{sequence}} of red and green flashing lights and is hypnotized into a suggestive state. Upon 'waking up', he does not have any memory of what happened while hypnotized, but sees that the woman and his son Ben (Charlie Tahan), a young musical prodigy, are missing. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) reveals that similar cases have ended with the victims being returned, but left insane from the <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident. All the victims were academics and accomplished in their respective fields.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit the <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that}} the natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{about her}} role in voicing Saya, Mizuki said that she {{initially}} thought she would need to reimagine the entire character for her performance as Saya in the movie. It was later decided that the core character had changed little despite {{the events of the}} series finale, so Mizuki did not have to adjust her performance by much. Mizuki worked with the staff to help portray Saya's strained condition and deliberate isolation from others after the <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series' events, although the sense of love still formed a strong part of Saya's character. Hashimoto's role as Mana was her first role in an anime movie, which proved challenging as Hashimoto needed to adjust to a new work environment, in particular performing convincingly without acting physically. She accepted the part based on her liking for CLAMP's manga work, recording all her lines separate {{from the rest of the}} cast. Fukuyama voiced Watanuki, making a cameo appearance from CLAMP's manga series xxxHolic. For the character's role in The Last Dark, Fukuyama needed to portray Watanuki as a mature character despite not aging from his appearance in xxxHolic.|$|E
5|$|These {{troubles}} {{were followed}} in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe {{during the following}} three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, {{about one-third of the}} population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague {{throughout the rest of the}} 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Trauma</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most common}} health {{problems}} worldwide, {{which results in}} many cases of physical disability every year. Considering <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>trauma,</b> {{this study was conducted}} to determine its epidemiology in <b>trauma</b> patients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trauma</b> Center <b>of</b> Gorgan County, Golestan Province. Methods: This cross-sectional population-based study was conducted on 17941 Iranian trauma patients attending <b>the</b> <b>Trauma</b> Center <b>of</b> 5 Azar Educational Hospital, Gorgan County, from <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> 2013 through 2014 using the census method. The patients’ data were collected using a checklist designed by <b>the</b> Treatment Deputy <b>of</b> Golestan University of Medical Sciences on morning, evening, and night shifts by trained personnel. The data were analyzed with the STATA software version 12. Results: Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> patients were male and belonged to the age group 21 - 35 years. Alley, street, and house were the most common trauma locations. Injury, motorcycle accident, and falls from height were the most common types <b>of</b> <b>trauma.</b> As for <b>the</b> outcome, most trauma patients were “treated”. Conclusion: With advances in technology, due to {{the increase in the number}} and speed of vehicles and changes in the lifestyle, <b>trauma</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major causes <b>of</b> mortality and disability in <b>the</b> world. Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> in <b>the</b> world can help to lower its prevalence and incidence.  ...|$|R

500|$|Chest trauma, a {{major cause}} of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema, can cause air to enter the skin of the chest wall from the neck or lung. When the pleural membranes are punctured, as occurs in penetrating <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chest, air may travel from the lung to the muscles and subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall. [...] When the alveoli of the lung are ruptured, as occurs in pulmonary laceration, air may travel beneath the visceral pleura (the membrane lining the lung), to the hilum of the lung, up to the trachea, to the neck and then to the chest wall. The condition may also occur when a fractured rib punctures a lung; in fact, 27% of patients who have rib fractures also have subcutaneous emphysema. [...] Rib fractures may tear the parietal pleura, the membrane lining the inside of chest wall, allowing air to escape into the subcutaneous tissues.|$|E
