5|$|After the 1998 {{death of}} Ruby, the zoo's famous {{painting}} elephant, the zoo abandoned its elephant breeding program {{and began to}} focus on elephant behavior. The zoo is currently home to three Asian elephants that have a variety of behavioral issues, the most common being aggression <b>toward</b> <b>other</b> elephants. One elephant is a former performer at a circus and was subject to mistreatment, while the other two were captured in remote regions where they were never properly socialized.|$|E
5|$|The {{operational}} {{sex ratio}} in the {{poison dart frog}} family is mostly female biased. This leads to a few characteristic behaviors and traits found in organisms with an uneven sex ratio. In general, females {{have a choice of}} mate. In turn, males show brighter coloration, are territorial, and are aggressive <b>toward</b> <b>other</b> males. Females select mates based on coloration (mainly dorsal), calling perch location, and territory.|$|E
5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to turn <b>toward</b> <b>other</b> record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E

Patrick, who has attended Mrs. Puff's class multiple times, is treated with respect by her in spite of his slow-wittedness (Patrick is an expert driver and has passed every time he appears, usually re-appearing in the school after losing his license in some way). Of all the residents of Bikini Bottom, she is closest to SpongeBob. While she normally dreads having to drive with SpongeBob, she often acts as a motherly figure towards him.|$|E
5|$|The Varaha Upanishad, in Chapter 4, {{states that}} {{individuals}} gain knowledge through seven stages: First, one must have virtuous desire to learn, discover (Subh-echchha). The second stage is inquiry, investigation (Vichārana). Discernment and thinning of mind <b>toward</b> <b>other</b> objects (Tanumanasi) {{is the third}} stage, states the text. The fourth stage is harmony, creative union with the subject of knowledge (Sattva-patti). Detachment from everything else (Asamsakti) is the fifth stage. Conceptual analysis and gaining complete, correct meaning of the topic (Pad-artha-bhavana) is the sixth stage. The seventh or last stage is Turiya, complete consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} September {{and the end of}} December 1941, the Kozara Partisans {{conducted}} around forty {{military operations}} against the enemy. Stojanović helped plan and execute the major operations, including the battles of Podgradci, Mrakovica, and Turjak. Stojanović argued that the village of Podgradci should be captured because it was situated deep within Kozara, because the enemy could easily disrupt the Partisans' advance <b>toward</b> <b>other</b> villages of the district of Gradiška, and because there was a sawmill in Podgradci which supplied the NDH and Germans. On 23October 1941, Partisans under Stojanović's command took Podgradci after five hours of fighting. The sawmill and its stored productsincluding a large quantity of railroad ties, with which the Germans were allegedly planning to repair railways destroyed by Soviet partisans in occupied Ukrainewere burnt down. Stojanović saw this action as a symbolic collaboration with the Red Army. A number of Ustaše and Croatian Home Guards were captured in Podgradci. The Ustaše were promptly executed, and the Home Guards were given a speech by Stojanović before the Partisans gave them food and escorted them across the Una River.|$|E

5000|$|Peter Corning {{suggests}} that, [...] "Kant's {{objection to}} the Golden Rule is especially suspect because the categorical imperative (CI) {{sounds a lot like}} a paraphrase, or perhaps a close cousin, of the same fundamental idea.

Calling it a universal law does not materially improve on the basic concept." [...] Corning claims that Ken Binmore thought so as well.|$|R
