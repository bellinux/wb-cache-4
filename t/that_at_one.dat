5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point over 650,000 people were out {{of power in the}} Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which {{less than a year later}} would be struck by another tornado.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, reform {{movements}} in the U.S. (the so-called Progressive movement) made most forms of gambling illegal in most communities. Gambling continued illegally in many places, though, creating new opportunities for criminal enterprises. The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1919, outlawed the manufacture, transportation, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages and initiated the Prohibition era. The new law was widely unpopular, and bootlegging became rampant. Galveston's already lax social attitudes allowed this, as well as brothels and other illegal businesses, to blossom in the city. These institutions were so accepted <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point, the city required health inspections for prostitutes {{to ensure the safety}} of their clients.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} Han dynasty (202 BC â€“ 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep {{boreholes}} to transport natural gas from bamboo pipelines to stoves where cast iron evaporation pans boiled brine to extract salt.

Favre also understood the Chickasaw language, but at one point his translation was challenged by James Colbert (grandfather of Holmes Colbert), who had married into the Chickasaw tribe, replaced Favre as interpreter. which {{was not a problem}} earlier for Spain during the Treaty of Natchez in 1793, nor at any other time in the long history of his duties for France. Favre was said to be a confidante and personal friend of the celebrated Choctaw Indian chief Pushmataha. Genealogist Heitzmann relates <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point Favre acted as the interpreter between Pushmataha and the military commanders Andrew Jackson and General Thomas Hinds.|$|E
5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} pain, the short-term outcome is also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks but very little improvement after <b>that.</b> <b>At</b> <b>one</b> year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to have}} poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell's signs).|$|E
5|$|Pirate radio {{met with}} {{increasing}} opposition, {{especially from the}} authorities {{in the form of}} the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) Radio Regulatory Division (and later the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) after it became responsible for radio regulation) which had claimed since the late 1960s that pirate radio caused interference to licensed broadcasters and could interfere with frequencies used by emergency services. Nonetheless the growth of pirate radio in the 1980s was so rapid <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point pirate radio operators outnumbered legal broadcasters. Pirate stations such as Radio Invicta, JFM, and London Weekend Radio continued to gain popularity and increasingly operated openly. Pirate radio targeted music communities ignored by mainstream broadcasting, such as reggae, hip hop, jazz, indie rock, indie pop and rhythm and blues. Stations like London Greek Radio, which broadcast to the Greek and Greek Cypriot community, also catered to ethnic minorities.|$|E

5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> time or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, {{it is not to}} be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written {{over a period of several}} centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E
5|$|The Sociedad de Beneficencia (Society of Beneficence), {{a charity}} group {{made up of}} 87 society ladies, was {{responsible}} for most charity works in Buenos Aires prior to the election of Juan PerÃ³n. Fraser and Navarro write <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point the Sociedad had been an enlightened institution, caring for orphans and homeless women, but that those days had long since passed {{by the time of}} the first term of Juan PerÃ³n. In the 1800s, the Sociedad had been supported by private contributions, largely those of the husbands of the society ladies. But by the 1940s, the Sociedad was supported by the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{main house}} {{protected}} John McQueen's family and neighbors during attacks from invading Creeks in 1802; he wrote <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> time 26 people took refuge there. Following raids from Americans during the Patriot Rebellion in 1813, {{the house was}} gutted and vandalized. Plantations {{as far south as}} New Smyrna were destroyed by rebels fleeing into Georgia. When Kingsley arrived, there were no metal fixtures in the doors and the wooden slave quarters had been burned down. John Rollins added sections to the east and west sides of the house in between the pavilions in the 1890s and removed at least three of the fireplace chimneys from the pavilions. One of the clubs that owned the island in the 1920s added electricity.|$|E

5|$|Having been conscripted {{into the}} Confederate Ghost {{program as a}} child due to her psychic potential, Kerrigan is {{described}} in the manual for StarCraft as never having been given the chance for a normal life. Her rigorous training {{and the use of}} neural implants to control her mental abilities leave her withdrawn and introverted. Despite this, Kerrigan exhibits qualities of courage and daring, and is an effective tactician. She is also described as a moral character, exemplified in her opposition to Arcturus Mengsk using the Zerg against the Confederacy. However, after her transformation by the Zerg, Kerrigan is freed from her inhibitionsâ€”as well as her neural conditioningâ€”and indulges her darker traits (though Heart of the Swarm implies that at least part of her villainy was due to the influence of a fallen Xel'naga named Amon). Her attitude, combined with her natural intelligence, makes her extremely calculating and manipulative. A hint of her former moral sensitivity is to be noted when {{towards the end of the}} Zerg campaign of Brood War, she states how she feels weary of slaughter for the first time since her transformation. Kerrigan has also become far more physically aggressive, relishing close quarters combat so much <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point in the novel Queen of Blades, she begins absent-mindedly licking the blood of her victims from her fingers.|$|E
5|$|In February 1945, Walters was {{promoted}} to acting air commodore and took over from Air Commodore Lukis as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Northern Command, directing its operations in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville {{until the end of}} the war. Headquartered at Madang in Papua New Guinea, Northern Command had previously been a large mobile formation known as No.9 (Operational) Group but had evolved into a garrison force, its mobile function supplanted by No.10 (Operational) Group (later First Tactical Air Force). Northern Command's operational formations included No.71 Wing in northern New Guinea, No.74 Wing at Port Moresby, and No.84 Wing on Bougainville. No.71 Wing, commanded by Group Captain Val Hancock, supported the Australian 6thDivision during the Aitapeâ€“Wewak Campaign, despite ordnance deficiencies <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> stage led to its squadrons arming their Bristol Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs. No.84 Wing suffered shortages in pilots and equipment during the Bougainville Campaign, and morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation; as a result, the wing's commanding officer sent Northern Command headquarters a frank report, the tone of which earned a rebuke from Walters. In September, Walters represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender ceremonies in Wewak.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> time the manuscript {{was in the}} possession of Cardinal Bessarion, because the minuscule supplement has a text similar to one of Bessarion's manuscripts. T. C. Skeat believes that Bessarion's mentor, the patriarchal notary in Constantinople John Chortasmenos, had the book brought to Rome from Constantinople {{around the time of the}} fall of the Byzantine Empire. According to Paul Canart, the decorative initials added to the manuscript in the Middle Ages are reminiscent of Constantinopolitan decoration of the 10th century, but the poor execution gives the impression they were added in the 11th or 12th century, and likely not before the 12th century in light of the way they appear in connection with notes in a minuscule hand at the beginning of the book of Daniel. T. C. Skeat, a paleographer at the British Museum, first argued that Codex Vaticanus was among the 50 Bibles that the Emperor Constantine I ordered Eusebius of Caesarea to produce. The similarity of the text with the papyri and Coptic version (including some letter formation), parallels with Athanasius' canon of 367 suggest an Egyptian or Alexandrian origin.|$|E

5000|$|Working in the {{opposite}} direction again, the second expression asserts <b>that</b> <b>at</b> least <b>one</b> of [...] "not A" [...] and [...] "not B" [...] must be true, or equivalently <b>that</b> <b>at</b> least <b>one</b> of A and B must be false. Since <b>at</b> least <b>one</b> of them must be false, then their conjunction would likewise be false. Negating said conjunction thus results in a true expression, and this expression is identical to the first claim.|$|R
