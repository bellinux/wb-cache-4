5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|The only goal of {{the game}} {{followed}} shortly thereafter. Curtis went on a run for Cardiff, who passed it forward near the box to Ferguson. He shot the ball towards the goal, but it had little power and was easily picked up by Lewis. However, as he did so, the ball squirmed out of Lewis' hands and slipped in between <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left elbow and body. With a couple of Cardiff City forwards closing in, Lewis tried to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it into the net with his elbow. Arsenal sought to attack immediately after the kick off, but despite it looking promising, Brain was caught offside. Cardiff countered, and possibly {{could have had a}} second goal, but Curtis chose to shoot himself rather than pass to Davies, who would have been presented with an open goal had he received the ball as Lewis was out of position. The match ended with a victory for Cardiff City by one goal to nil. The King presented the trophy to Cardiff's captain Keenor, and medals to each of the players from both teams.|$|E

60|$|And {{already the}} last sea-fight of Carthage was coming swiftly {{to an end}} before them. Under their very eyes the two Roman galleys had shot in, one {{on either side of}} the vessel of Black Magro. They had grappled with him, and he, desperate in his despair, had cast <b>the</b> <b>crooked</b> flukes <b>of</b> <b>his</b> anchors over their gunwales, and bound them to him in an iron grip, whilst with hammer and crowbar he burst great holes in his own sheathing. The last Punic galley should never be rowed into Ostia, a sight for the holiday-makers of Rome. She would lie in her own waters. And the fierce, dark soul of her rover captain glowed as he thought that not alone should she sink into the depths of the mother sea.|$|R
60|$|Much mighty speech-making {{there has}} been, {{both in and}} out of Parliament, {{concerning}} Tom, and much wrathful disputation how Tom shall be got right.

In the midst of which dust and noise there is but one thing perfectly clear, to wit, that Tom only may and can, or shall and will, be reclaimed according to somebody's theory but nobody's practice.

Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said 'No', rather crossly, so she was going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with <b>the</b> <b>crooked</b> end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cane and held it out to her. She was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms, and thanked him over and over. He told her to 'go along and cook it', and she hurried off, so happy! Wasn't it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be 'aisy'." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{museum is}} named after Arthur Ray Bowman, a Prineville {{businessman}} and civic leader. Bowman was born in Kansas and came to Prineville in 1910 after receiving {{a law degree from}} the University of Washington. He established a successful title and insurance company in Prineville <b>the</b> county seat <b>of</b> <b>Crook</b> County. Bowman was active in civic affairs throughout his life. He served as the County Judge for Crook County from 1936 to 1942. He also helped establish the Ochoco Irrigation District and the Prineville Airport. Bowman helped bring U.S. Highway 26 through Crook County. He was particularly interested {{in the construction of the}} Prineville Dam on <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River. Because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dedication to the project, the dam was renamed the Arthur R. Bowman Dam in his honor. He died in 1970, leaving a legacy of business success and civic responsibility.|$|R

60|$|A gasp of relief, {{followed}} by an angry cry from Valentina, went up when they recognised those that came.

Behind him towered the bulk of Fortemani, his great face flushed with a strange excitement, a leather hacketon over his steel cuirass, girt, too, with sword and dagger, and carrying his shining morion in his hand. Last came Lanciotto and Zaccaria, both fully equipped and armed at all points.|$|E
60|$|The clerk {{wrote the}} number of a room against Lemuel's name in the register, and then glanced at the bag. It was a large bag of oil- cloth, a kind of bag which is by nature lank and hollow, and must be made almost insupportably heavy before it shows any signs of repletion. The shirt and pair of {{everyday}} pantaloons which Lemuel had dropped that morning into its voracious maw made no apparent effect there, as the clerk held it up and twirled it on <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thumb.|$|E

His cutter has a very neat little cabin, quite big enough for two men not only to sleep but to sit and smoke in. We left the scuttle wide open, of course. As to his provisions for supper, they were not of a luxurious kind. He complained that the shops in the village were miserable. There was a big village within a mile and a half.

60|$|Ospakar {{rushed to}} get the upper hold, but Eric was too swift for him and sprang aside. Again he rushed, but Eric dropped and gripped him round the middle.

Then of a sudden Eric put out his strength, and they {{staggered}} round the ring, tearing at each other till their jerkins were rent from them, leaving them almost bare to the waist. Suddenly, Eric seemed to give, and Ospakar put out his foot to trip him. But Brighteyes was watching. He caught the foot in <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left leg, and threw his weight forward on the chest of Blacktooth.

As she knew while he was still far off, it was Matthew Braile who, as long as he sat in the seat of the scorner, with his chair tilted against the wall, seemed a strong middle-aged man; but when he descended from his habitual place, with <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stick, worn smooth by use, in his hard palm, one saw that he was elderly and stiff almost to lameness. He carried himself with a forward droop, and his gaze bent ponderingly on the ground, as if he were not meaning to look her way, and would pass without seeing her.|$|E
