5|$|While {{the library}} {{building}} {{dates to the}} early 20th century <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> intellectual outreach in Oregon started years before. The first Oregon library was organized in 1872, though it had no building of its own. Before the library had its own building, library books were stored in a drug store {{and then in the}} County Treasurer's office. Eventually the Oregon Library occupied rented office space in the First National Bank building. This situation persisted until 1905 when Oregon voters voiced their collective opinion on the library's future.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} that Portal 2 {{would be available}} on PlayStation 3 {{came as a surprise}} to the industry because Gabe Newell had criticized that console in the past, citing difficulties in the port of The Orange Box. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> the PlayStation 3 was a result of growing frustration with Microsoft's policies for Xbox 360 content, including the difficulty of pushing patching and new content to players. Newell saw Sony's publication model as more open, allowing Steam-like features to be used on the console. Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks, including automatic updates, downloadable content, and community support. The game supports cross-platform play between the PlayStation 3, Windows, and OS X versions.|$|E

Themes that emphasize the dignity of the patient by promoting a respectful and caring attitude from nurses are also commonly seen.|$|E

25|$|Wraight {{has written}} that the three {{surviving}} Cristofori pianos appear to follow an orderly progression: each has heavier framing than its predecessor. Wraight suggests that {{this would have been}} intentional, in that the heavier framing permitted tenser, thicker strings. This in turn increased the volume with which treble notes could be played without pitch distortion, a limitation that Wraight observes when playing replica instruments. Thus, it appears that <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> heavier framing, a trend that dominates the history of the piano, may already have begun in Cristofori's own building practice.|$|E
25|$|In 1385, ZÃ¼rich, Zug and Lucerne {{attacked}} several Habsburg strongholds and in {{the following}} year Lucerne entered into alliances with several Habsburg cities in an attempt to pull those cities into Lucerne's sphere of influence. In response, Leopold III of Austria gathered an army and prepared to invade the Confederation. After a minor battle, a short-lived armistice was declared, but by early July 1386 the Habsburg army was on <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> the Lucerne city of Sempach. On 9 July 1386 a Confederation force from Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden met the Austrian army in the Battle of Sempach. While the Habsburg knights initially drove the lightly armored Swiss back, around mid-day the Swiss gained the upper hand and killed Leopold and forced his army to retreat. Much like the Battle of Morgarten, Sempach helped cement the Confederation into a further unified federation. While Schwyz gained no territory from the battle, both Bern and Lucerne gained significant territories {{at the expense of the}} Habsburgs.|$|E
25|$|Dr Michael Dixon was {{appointed}} the Foundation's medical director. From 2005 to 2007, FIH received {{a grant from}} the Department of Health to help organise the self-regulation of complementary therapies. There had been concern that with {{a large proportion of the}} public turning to complementary approaches, there were few safeguards in place to ensure that non-statutorily regulated therapists were safe, trained and would act in an appropriate way. FIH worked to bring together the representative bodies of many complementary professions to talk and agree standards. The result was the formation of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) which had hoped to register 10,000 practitioners of complementary medicine by the end of 2009 but which by September 2009 had succeeded in enrolling less than a tenth of that number due to lack of interest on the part of some of their professional associations. The Department of Health is currently continuing to fund the CNHC but future funding will be dependent on substantial progress being made towards the target (which has now been reduced to 2,000). Alternative medicine campaigners argued that <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> regulation conferred undue respectability on unproven and possibly unsafe CAM approaches.|$|E

[...] Arnold rechristened the schooner [...] [...] The prisoners had {{reported that the}} lone British warship on Lake Champlain was at Fort Saint-Jean, on the Richelieu River north of the lake. [...] Arnold, uncertain whether word of Ticonderoga's capture had reached Saint-Jean, decided to attempt a raid to capture the ship. [...] He had Liberty outfitted with guns, and sailed north with 50 of his men on May 14. [...] Allen, not wanting Arnold {{to get the full}} glory for that capture, followed with some of his men in bateaux, but Arnold's small fleet had the advantage of sail, and pulled away from Allen's boats. [...] By May 17, Arnold's small fleet was at the northern end of the lake. [...] Seeking intelligence, Arnold sent a man to reconnoiter the situation at Fort Saint-Jean. [...] The scout returned later that day, reporting that the British were aware of the fall of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and that troops were apparently on <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> Saint-Jean.

500|$|A {{significant}} {{moment in}} the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict {{between him and his}} father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a [...] "... callback to ..." [...] in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow. Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, [...] "... learned {{a little bit more about}} what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." [...] The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer. Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the band's success, a {{creative}} rift developed between Roth and Eddie Van Halen early on. The former was mainly interested in lighthearted songs about partying and sex (along {{the lines of}} Aerosmith and AC/DC), while the latter wanted more depth. Van Halen constructed his own recording studio at home during 1983, which led to an argument {{with the rest of}} the band as it allowed him to develop songs without their input. Furthermore, he began to move towards a more radio-friendly pop direction with keyboards and synthesizers while Roth opposed this and felt that the band should play straight hard rock with only guitars and drums. Their sixth album, 1984, was a critical and commercial success but continued <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> mainstream pop. Roth formally parted ways with his bandmates on April 1, 1985.

2500|$|Taken together, {{these trends}} {{resulted}} in a new American model for adoption. Following its Roman predecessor, Americans severed {{the rights of the}} original parents while making adopters the new parents {{in the eyes of the}} law. Two innovations were added: 1) adoption was meant to ensure the [...] "best interests of the child;" [...] the seeds of this idea can be traced to the first American adoption law in Massachusetts, and 2) adoption became infused with secrecy, eventually resulting in the sealing of adoption and original birth records by 1945. The origin of <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> secrecy began with Charles Loring Brace who introduced it to prevent children from the Orphan Trains from returning to or being reclaimed by their parents. Brace feared the impact of the parents' poverty, in general, and their Catholic religion, in particular, on the youth. This tradition of secrecy was carried on by the later Progressive reformers when drafting of American laws.|$|E
