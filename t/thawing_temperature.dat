40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether effects of repetitive freeze-thaw cycles, with various thawing temperatures, on human muscle tissue can be quantified using postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) technology. An additional objective was to determine the preferred <b>thawing</b> <b>temperature</b> for muscle tissue in this study. Human cadaver upper extremities were divided into two different <b>thawing</b> <b>temperature</b> groups and underwent a series of four freeze-thaw cycles in total. Axial CT scans were performed after each cycle. CT attenuation (in Hounsfield units, HU) was measured in four muscles of the upper extremities. HU values changed significantly with the introduction of each subsequent freeze-thaw cycle. Moreover, the changes in HU values were different for each thawing group. There was a significant increase of HU values in both groups between t 0 and t 1. Unfrozen tissue showed large variation of HU values in all samples. It was possible to distinguish between samples thawed at different thawing temperatures based on their respective HU values.

40|$|Serum exosomal {{proteins}} {{have great}} potential {{as indicators of}} disease status in cancer, inflammatory or metabolic diseases. The association of a fraction of various serum proteins such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) with circulating exosomes has been debated. The establishment of a method to measure the exosomal fraction of such proteins might help resolve this controversy. The use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to measure serum exosomal molecules, for example CEA, is rare in research laboratories and totally absent in clinical biology. In this study, we optimized a method for assessment of serum exosomal molecules combining a treatment by volume-excluding polymers to isolate the exosomes, their subsequent solubilization in an assay buffer and ELISA. One hundred sixteen consecutive patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled for this study between June 2015 and June 2016 at Wakayama Medical University Hospital (WMUH). Whole blood samples were collected from patients during surgery. Exosomes were isolated using the ExoQuick reagent, solubilized in an assay buffer and subjected to CEA detection by ELISA. The procedure of serum exosome isolation and the formulation of the assay buffer used for the ELISA were optimized {{in order to improve}} the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. A five-fold increase in the concentration of the exosomes in the assay buffer (using initial serum volume as a reference) and the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) resulted in more accurate measurements of the serum exosomal CEA. The <b>thawing</b> <b>temperature</b> of frozen serum samples before exosome extraction was also optimized. A validation study that included one hundred sixteen patients with colorectal cancer demonstrated that serum exosomal CEA from samples thawed at 25 °C exhibited a better AUC value, sensitivity, and specificity as well as a more correct classification than serum CEA. We optimized an easy and rapid detection method for assessment of serum exosomal CEA.

This paper aimed at the influence of freezing and thawing on the activities of Cu and Zn (exchangeable and carbonate) in black soil of Northeast China under pig manure fertilization according to the northeast climate characteristics through laboratory simulation. The results showed that the contents of exchangeable Cu and Zn significantly increased and that of carbonate Cu and Zn slightly decreased under pig manure fertilization initial stage comparing with the control without fertilizer. The contents of exchangeable Cu and Zn slightly increased and that of carbonate Cu and Zn decreased for the higher fertilization comparing with lower fertilization. The contents of exchangeable Cu and Zn decreased and that of carbonate Cu and Zn significantly increased with the extension of fertilization time (one month) compared with the early fertilization (one week). Moreover, the contents of exchangeable Cu and Zn under higher fertilization were all higher than that under lower fertilization, on the contrary, the contents of carbonate Cu and Zn under higher fertilization all were lower than that under lower fertilization.

High pressure caused significant increase in viscosity and consistency coefficients of model systems with and without guar addition. Significant decrease of initial freezing and initial <b>thawing</b> <b>temperature</b> was observed in all samples. With this research the direct influence of ultrasound and high-pressure treatment on the rheological and thermophysical properties of whey protein isolate and concentrate model systems with or without guar gum was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} describes {{research conducted}} to examine the feasibility of freeze concentration with small-scale, simple equipment; and research results on juice extraction and concentration from fruit held in frozen storage. When Grandmother made jelly the wonderful aroma of cooking fruit filled the house. That wonderful aroma was the delicate fruit flavors being evaporated and lost from the jelly. When volatile flavors are retained food has a much better flavor. Freeze concentration of fruit juices is a method of removing water from juices without heating and changing juice flavor. Freeze concentration is effective because a solute in solution has a lower melting point than pure ice, and can {{be separated from the}} water component (ice) as the temperature approaches the melting point of pure ice. To easily confirm this, remove a plastic jug of cider from the freezer, invert the jug in a suitable container, place the jug and container in a refrigerator and allow it to approach <b>thawing</b> <b>temperature.</b> Concentrated apple juice will collect in the container, leaving ice in the jug. Freeze concentration has many practical applications in food processing. It is effective in adding fruit solids to wine musts; in reducing the amount of cooking necessary to produce jellies, jams and, preserves; and in improving flavor and characteristics in many food products. Freeze concentration has been practiced in the food industry for over 30 years, but the equipment is too expensive for most small enterprises...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} the stability of doxorubicin and daunorubicin, both in the form of hydrochloride, in water, in a rabbit application solution (0. 9 % NaCl solution), and culture medium using HPLC with a fluorescence detector. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin belong to the group of anthracycline antibiotics used in the treatment of various types of cancer. The stability of the substances has been investigated in water and 0. 9 % NaCl stored in glass and plastic (polypropylene) at room temperature in light and dark for 24 hours, in a refrigerator (8 řC) for 3 months, in a freezer (- 80 řC) for 3 months, and repeatedly frozen (- 80 řC) and <b>thawed</b> (room <b>temperature),</b> totaling 3 times. The stability of the substances in culture medium has been investigated in glass and plastics (polypropylene) at room temperature in light and dark for 3 days Additionally, stock solutions were stored at 37 řC in thermomixers protected from light in plastics (polypropylene) and in an incubator in glass and plastics (polypropylene and polystyrene) and examined for 3 days. They were also examined for their stability at repeated frozen (- 80 řC) and <b>thawing</b> (room <b>temperature)</b> of undiluted solutions and solutions diluted with 90 % methanol...|$|R
