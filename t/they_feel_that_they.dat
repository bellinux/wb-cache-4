25|$|People with OCD {{understand}} that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in compulsive hoarding might be inclined to treat inorganic matter {{as if it had}} the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate {{as to whether or not}} hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Shelter {{employees}} are sometimes {{at risk from}} violence perpetrated by the clients they are serving. In order to address problems faced by employees {{who are trying to}} help the homeless in New York, the Department of Homeland Security increased security at some shelters and conducted security assessments of shelters in 2015. While many employees of shelters {{know that there is a}} risk when working in high-crime neighborhoods or with individuals who are mentally ill, they continue to work at homeless shelters because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are performing a public service akin to the police or firefighters.|$|E
25|$|In addition, in {{the recent}} decade a growing {{minority}} from within the Israeli Jewish conscripts have denounced the mandatory enrollment, and refused to serve (see also Refusal {{to serve in the}} Israeli military), many claiming that due to financial insecurities <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> need to be spending their time more productively pursuing their chosen studies or career paths. Some individual resentment may also be compounded by the typically low wages paid to conscripts—the current Israeli policies see National Service as a duty rendered to the country and its citizens, and therefore the Israeli army does not pay any wages to conscripts, but instead grants a low monthly allowance to the full-time national service personnel, {{depending on the type of}} their duty.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 Pew Center {{survey on}} Religion and Public Life {{indicates}} that 74 percent of U.S. Latter-day Saints church members lean towards the Republican Party. Some liberal members {{have stated that}} <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have to defend their worthiness due to political differences. In recent decades, the Republican Party has consistently won {{a majority of the}} LDS vote in most national and state-level elections. As a result, Utah, a state with a majority LDS population, {{is also one of the}} most heavily Republican states in the country. However, Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2014, became an LDS Church convert as a college student. James E. Faust (1920–2007), an apostle and member of the First Presidency, also identified himself as a Democrat prior to his full-time church service as a general authority (1972–2007).|$|E

Two {{of the last five}} UK gigs were canceled and a friend of the group, Matt Romano, flew to England to replace the injured drummer in the remaining concerts. In a press release, Gentles explained, [...] "They will only carry on if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are 100% after rehearsing with Matt, as they wouldn't offer anything less to their fans."

The Strokes headlined the T in the Park festival in Scotland on July7 after alternative rock group Weezer pulled out.

2500|$|In this study, the {{researchers}} wanted to test {{if they could}} manipulate a coin toss, and counter the gambler's fallacy by having the participant focus on the person tossing the coin. In contrast, they attempted to initiate the hot-hand fallacy by centering the participant's focus on the person tossing the coin {{as a reason for}} the streak of either heads or tails. In either case the data should fall in line with sympathetic magic, whereby <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can control the outcomes of random events in ways that defy the laws of physics, such as being [...] "hot" [...] at tossing a specific randomly determined outcome.|$|E
2500|$|Squirrels {{sometimes}} use deceptive {{behavior to}} prevent other animals from retrieving cached food. They will pretend {{to bury the}} object if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are being watched.

They also hide behind vegetation while burying food or hide it high up in trees (if their rival is not arboreal). Such a complex repertoire suggests that the behaviors are not innate, and imply theory of mind thinking.|$|E

Indulgent parents do not create proper boundaries for their children and provide them with positive reinforcement even though it is not applicable.

2500|$|While {{the church}} takes an apolitical {{approach}} to candidates, it encourages {{its members to}} {{play an active role}} as responsible citizens in their communities, including becoming informed about issues and voting in elections. It actively works to counter anti-Mormonism that may come up during political campaigns. A 2012 Pew Center on Religion and Public Life survey indicates that 74 percent of U.S. members lean towards the Republican Party. Some liberal members say <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have to defend their worthiness due to political differences.

2500|$|... 6% of the {{population}} was reported to live below the poverty line, when adjusted for taxes and transfers. Denmark has the 2nd lowest relative poverty rate in the OECD, below the 11.3% OECD average. The share of {{the population}} reporting that <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> cannot afford to buy sufficient food in Denmark is {{less than half of the}} OECD average. With an employment rate of 72.8%, Denmark ranks 7th highest among the OECD countries, and above the OECD average of 66.2%. The number of unemployed people is forecast to be 65,000 in 2015. The number of people in the working age group, less disability pensioners etc., will grow by 10,000 to 2,860,000, and jobs by 70,000 to 2,790,000; part-time jobs are included. Because of the present high demand and short supply of skilled labour, for instance for factory and service jobs, including hospital nurses and physicians, the annual average working hours have risen, especially compared with the recession 1987–1993. Increasingly, service workers of all kinds are in demand, i.e. in the postal services and as bus drivers, and academics.|$|E
2500|$|Most proxies for [...] "grievance"—the {{theory that}} civil wars begin because of issues of identity, rather than economics—were {{statistically}} insignificant, including economic equality, political rights, ethnic polarization and religious fractionalization. Only ethnic dominance, {{the case where}} the largest ethnic group comprises {{a majority of the}} population, increased the risk of civil war. A country characterized by ethnic dominance has nearly twice the chance of a civil war. However, the combined effects of ethnic and religious fractionalization, i.e. the greater chance that any two randomly chosen people will be from separate ethnic or religious groups, the less chance of a civil war, were also significant and positive, as long as the country avoided ethnic dominance. The study interpreted this as stating that minority groups are more likely to rebel if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are being dominated, but that rebellions are more likely to occur the more homogeneous the population and thus more cohesive the rebels. These two factors may thus be seen as mitigating each other in many cases.|$|E
40|$|A small people, {{surrounded}} on the American continent by an Anglo-Saxon civilization, the French Canadians {{have experienced}} the constant pressure of the forces of assimilation. These forces working silently, they have found a more serious threat to their national character than the more directly applied forces {{to which they were}} subjected immediately after the Conquest. <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> relax their vigilance momentarily they will fall victims. For this reason, as time has gone on, they have looked more and more to France for aid in rekindling the flame of French culture and keeping it alive. <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that,</b> unless <b>they</b> draw upon France, their own powers are not yet sufficient, considering their great numerical inferiority, to permit them to stand of themselves. In determining how the field of education should be shared, and in fixing the basic form of the school system of Quebec, French Canadians have been largely influenced by pre-Revolution France. These things having been determined, they look to modern France for much that is necessary to give the system effect in order to preserve their national character and develop it according to their traditions.
