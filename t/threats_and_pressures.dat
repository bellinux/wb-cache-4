40|$|The Great Barrier Reef Biodiversity Conservation Strategy 2013 {{provides}} a framework for improving biodiversity conservation in the Great Barrier Reef Region. It has been developed in consultation with Australian and Queensland government agencies, researchers, industry representatives and conservation groups. The strategy's approach includes continuing to foster industry and community stewardship of the Reef, building ecosystem resilience in a changing climate and improving our knowledge to make more informed decisions. This strategy establishes a process for determining and documenting the habitats, species and groups of species that are potentially at risk. Vulnerability assessments are being completed to identify actions to reduce the <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressures</b> facing at-risk biodiversity. Identifying priority habitats and species is vital when managing such a large, complex ecosystem as it allows resources to be directed where help is most needed. The habitats considered to be potentially at-risk are coral reefs, islands, the lagoon floor, mangroves, open waters and seagrass meadows. The species or species groups considered to be potentially at-risk are the dwarf minke whale, dugong, grey mackerel, humpback whale, inshore dolphins, king and blue threadfin salmon, marine turtles, seabirds, sea snakes, sharks and rays (including sawfish) and snapper...|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} decade, the main goals for {{biodiversity}} conservation {{and environmental protection}} {{at the level of}} the European Union are set in the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 : halting biodiversity loss and restoring ecosystem services. A key requirement for the implementation of the Strategy in terms of targeting measures and funds, and monitoring trends is the construction of a biodiversity knowledge base, including spatially explicit information on biodiversity distribution and ecosystem condition. The work presented in this report is based on the analysis of two primary datasets on biodiversity and habitat status. The first one is the Habitats assessment carried out by EU Members States under Art. 17 of the Habitats and Birds Directive. Information reported by Member States is analysed to derive the links between pressures and conservation status, showing that agriculture-related habitats have, on average, a worse conservation status when compared to other habitats. Consequently, <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressures</b> having most influenced the status of the agricultural-related habitats can be identified. The second one is the global dataset on species threat status elaborated by The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Spatially explicit representations of species distribution, status and richness across the EU 28 are provided, and most importantly the identification of wide geographic variables linked to ecological theory is presented, that explain to a large extent the continental trend in species richness. Finally, an example is presented of how the two exploited datasets can be jointly used by cross-tabulating data on habitats assessments and species threat status in a spatially explicit way at 10 km resolution, aiming at identifying hotspots were policy intervention is neede...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area (GLTFCA), {{the purpose of this study}} was to produce a classification of the woody vegetation of the Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe, and a map of its potential distribution. Cover-abundance data of woody species were collected in 330 georeferenced relevés across the Park. These data were used to produce two matrices: the first one using the cover-abundance values as collected in five height layers and the second one based on merging the layers into a single cover value for each species. Automatic classifications were produced for both matrices to determine the optimal number of vegetation types. The two classification approaches both produced 14 types belonging to three macro-groups: mopane, miombo and alluvial woodlands. The results of the two classifications were compared looking at the constant, dominant and diagnostic species of each type. The classification based on separate layers was considered more effective and retained. A high-resolution map of the potential distribution of vegetation types for the whole study area was produced using Random Forest. In the model, the relationship between bioclimatic and topographic variables, known to be correlated to vegetation types, and the classified relevés was used. Identified vegetation types were compared with those of other national parks within the GLTFCA, and an evaluation of the main <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressures</b> was conducted. Conservation implications: Vegetation classification and mapping are useful tools for multiple purposes including: surveying and monitoring plant and animal populations, communities and their habitats, and development of management and conservation strategies.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is about the}} problem of identifying key factors for corporate recovery of electric utilities in New Zealand and the Philippines. Its primary objective is to learn from the experiences of three regulated government utilities and one small private distributor that are involved in the three sectors of electricity business in power generation, transmission and distribution. How these firms survived their decline problems, and managed and sustained their turnaround efforts is the focus of this study. The results indicate the importance of change management, leadership, cost reduction and financial control in reversing the decline of these firms. Also underscored are the crucial role of efficiency improvement and achievement of profit together with winning employee commitment and broad stakeholder support in sustaining the recovery effort. These comparative case studies were undertaken at a time when crises and turbulence affected the management and organisation of electricity businesses in the Asia/Pacific region, particularly New Zealand and the Philippines. Electric utilities in both countries are regulated and less vertically integrated {{than anywhere else in the}} region. Significant changes to the ownership and control of these firms and their competitive relationships over the past decade have complicated the way strategic problems and issues have to be resolved. In the meantime, <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressures</b> from all stakeholders have made the management and operations of these utilities difficult. Thus, a critical review of their specific circumstances and predicaments is in order for similarly affected enterprises to avoid past errors and to replicate only the strategies that may suit them. In this regard, this work contributes to the enrichment of the existing body of knowledge in business policy and strategic management that has been fast evolving during the ++nineties in electric utilities around the world...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the moderating effects of spirituality at work on job stress and health (well-being and ill-being) amongst Australian academics based on a spiritual appraisal model of stress and well-being. It also explored whether spirituality at work moderated the relationship between job stress and work-life balance and work-life conflict amongst Australian academics. A sample of 139 academic staff members employed in Australian universities (higher education and TAFE) anonymously completed a self-report questionnaire containing quantitative measures of spirituality at work (individual, work-unit and organisation-wide spirituality), health (well-being and ill-being), work-life balance, work-life conflict and job stress (job <b>threat</b> stress <b>and</b> job <b>pressure</b> stress). At the bivariate level, spirituality at work (individual, work-unit and organisation-wide levels), well-being, ill-being, job <b>threat</b> stress <b>and</b> job <b>pressure</b> stress correlated with each other. At the multivariate level however, {{each of the three}} levels of spirituality at work did not moderate the influence of job <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> stress on both well-being or ill-being. Job threat stress significantly predicted decreased wellbeing and increased ill-being, but job pressure stress was not predictive of health. Age also significantly contributed to increased ill-being. At the bivariate level, all three levels of spirituality at work, job threat stress, job pressure stress, work-life balance and work-life conflict correlated with each other. Yet, at the multivariate level, spirituality at work unsuccessfully moderated the influence of job <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> job <b>pressure</b> stress on work-life balance and work-life conflict. Job <b>threat</b> stress <b>and</b> job <b>pressure</b> stress both significantly predicted decreased work-life balance and increased work-life conflict. The main effect of work-unit spirituality at work on work-life balance reached significance. Theoretical implications and practical implications for Human Resource Managers were discussed in terms of universities and businesses generally. Specifically, it was suggested that universities and businesses alike consider implementing stress management components into Human Resource Management employee well-being programs and initiatives. It was also suggested that HRM programs aimed at promoting work-life balance should integrate stress management and work-unit spirituality at work...|$|R
40|$|This is a refugee-centred {{study of}} the {{decision}} making process of Iraqis displaced after the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq in 2003. It investigates the pressures and influences that affected their decisions as well as who was involved and consulted. In doing so it sheds light on the under-theorised issue {{of what it means}} to be forced into a migration decision. The meaning of coercion is examined and applied to a forced migration context, considering the dynamics of cumulative causation in the process. The study also attempts to advance understandings of the relationship between state-formation and displacement. Narratives of Iraqis forced to migrate to Syria after 2003 were collected between June 2010 and April 2011 and form the primary data in this study. Narrative methods were used to elicit extended testimonies from Iraqis in Syria in order to explore conceptual issues. The research demonstrates the complex nature of forced migration and how displacement can be experienced as a process. Transformations of state which occurred in Iraq after the 2003 invasion led to purges which affected numerous groups perceived to belong to the old order. Iraqis who were perceived to be associated - rightly or wrongly - with the former regime experienced pressures and threats which resulted in some of them becoming migrants. The same transformations also manifested themselves as coercive alterations of spaces in Iraqis' daily lives. In a climate of generalised violence and insecurity, an array of <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressures,</b> including those resulting from the dynamics of cumulative causation, combined to form what the author calls a coercive landscape: a social world in which choices are diminished and life is heavily constrained by a multiplicity of threats – and which is likely to induce mass displacement. Although grounded in a specifically Iraqi context, it may be useful for scholars to test this concept in other contexts of mass displacement...|$|E

40|$|Human {{progress}} is stimulated by external <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressures.</b> Values distilled from long experience possess the essential knowledge and power needed for continuous development and evolution. Successive waves of foreign invasions following {{the collapse of}} the Roman Empire coalesced the tribes of England into a nation state. Centuries of incessant warfare finally compelled the countries of Western Europe to evolve a regional union within which war has become unthinkable. Most recently, the rising incidence of terrorism has compelled national security institutions to forge a network for global coordination unimaginable during the Cold War. Challenges met are converted into opportunities. Opportunities missed degenerate into problems. All crises are psychological in origin. The remedy always calls for a change of attitude and values. The greatest threats confronting human beings today do not come from external aggressors. They are the result of problems that affect humanity as a whole and can only be addressed collectively by the entire human race. International financial instability, unemployment, terrorism, proliferation of nuclear weapons and climate change are indications that humanity is entering a higher phase in social evolution that compels us to evolve more effective instruments for governance at the global level. No nation or group of nations acting on its own can protect itself from these threats. Effective action to address these issues is unlikely to come from governments whose source of power and very identity are based on national sovereignty and separateness. Mechanisms for global governance will not be effective unless founded upon universally accepted values in fact as well as in principle, a condition violated by the undemocratic character of the UN system. Power relents only in the face of greater power. Power that exceeds that of the five permanent members of the Security Council can only come from representatives of humanity as a whole.

It {{is one of the}} forests that are found along the Drakensberg mountain range in KwaZulu- Natal province in South Africa. It is a proclaimed forest of approximately 50 ha in extent. The Ntabamhlophe indigenous state forest was formerly called Monk’s Cowl State Forest, (Monk’s Cowl State Forest - iNtabamhlophe) situated in central uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This forest is located on communal land. In many parts of the world, indigenous forests face growing <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressures.</b> Internationally this has resulted in approximately 9. 4 million hectares being lost by 1990. Indigenous forests {{play an important role in}} ecosystem processes. They are associated with a range of products and processes that support the livelihood of millions of people around the world. Forests cover more than 3 000 km 2 or 0. 1 % of the land surface of South Africa. Furthermore, due to the lack of appropriate management programmes, South Africa has contributed its share to indigenous forest loss. Approximately 76 % (3240 ha) of the Drakensberg Montane forest is formally protected South Africa’s geographical positioning is such that it has historically had a smaller extent of forests. The future of South Africa’s remaining indigenous forests depends partly on the values ascribed to them by local communities. The study objectives were, (i) to understand the values and perceptions of the community towards the existence and future management of the Ntabamhlophe indigenous state forest, and (ii) to determine the different types of forest products and resources used by the community and their values to the users (cultural, spiritual or economic values). To understand Ntabamhlophe community’s indigenous forest resource use, values and perceptions, a qualitative survey method was used. This was conducted by using focus group techniques. The use of focus groups provided an insight into qualitative data. The technique combined both wise counsel and focus group workshops. The use of this technique aimed at drawing upon respondents’ attitudes, feelings, beliefs, experiences and reactions. The questionnaire design was based on the structures of other studies, on user attitudes and values relating to forest resources. The study revealed that the community ascribes high values to the indigenous forest, however they do not have a proper forest management system in place. The following were regarded as the major threats facing Ntabamhlophe forest resources: crime, uncontrolled and excessive burning, uncontrolled harvesting of indigenous medicinal plant and fuelwood, deforestation (clearing forests for plantations, e. g. vegetable crops and Cannabis sativa). Illegal hunting, soil erosion, and inappropriate forest management systems (nonexistence) were all considered by community representatives as serious threats to the survival of this indigenous forest. The findings also revealed that there is a lack of capacity and skills, appropriate stakeholder representation and coherent community leadership to pursue Ntabamhlophe Mountain and forest conservation initiatives. Given the circumstances, there is an apparent lack of confidence on the part of the community to confirm their natural resource conservation priorities. The community representatives recommended that the current uncontrolled activities be prohibited. They also had a strong belief that the forest should be protected through a cooperative management system involving Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, the Traditional Authority, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry and Imbabazane Local Municipality. The focus group indicated that they had a very high future benefit expectation of activities such as education, water, cultural, biodiversity, spiritual upliftment, tourism, craft and free access (Table 6). They also indicated that gathering medicinal plants and fuelwood was very common. Educational benefit was regarded as the most important of all, followed by tourism and biodiversity conservation...|$|E

But his life turned to a nightmare when he discovered {{that he was the}} son of a convicted murderer who was even then serving the fifteenth year of his life sentence. The suspense mounts as Paul's inquiries not only resurrect long-buried fears and hatred but also bring <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> from high places as he penetrates further into the mystery surrounding the crime and grows more and more convinced of his father's innocence. From then on the story is of Paul's desperate struggle for his father's release, supported only by a few loyal friends and by the girl he loves.|$|R
25|$|These {{were the}} first {{convictions}} {{anywhere in the world}} arising from the CIA's practice of abducting terror suspects and transferring them to third countries where torture occurred. The US had tried but failed to obstruct the prosecutions by Italy's independent Judiciary. Following the convictions the US used <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> diplomatic <b>pressure</b> to stop the Italian Executive branch from issuing arrest warrants and extradition requests for the Americans.|$|R

2500|$|Throughout {{negotiations}} for the Anschluss with Austria, Papen (with knowledge that both Catholic Rome and Mussolini were {{uneasy about the}} affair) urged Hitler to proceed cautiously {{so as not to}} disturb their relationship with the Italians. Though Papen was dismissed from his mission in Austria on 4 February 1938, Hitler drafted him to arrange a meeting between the German dictator and Austrian Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg at Berchtesgaden. [...] On 5 February, Hitler told Papen {{he was going to be}} reassigned elsewhere but ordered him back to Vienna to set up the summit with Schuschnigg. [...] The ultimatum that Hitler presented to Schuschnigg, at the meeting on 12 February 1938, led to the Austrian government's capitulation to German <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>and</b> paved the way for the Anschluss. On 13 March 1938, Hitler signed the [...] "Law concerning the Reunion (sic) of Austria with the German Reich" [...] making the Anschluss official. In the moments immediately following the union of Germany and Austria, Hitler sat motionless as tears of joy streamed down his face. Papen was not there to experience this moment, perhaps fortunately for him since this alleged [...] "aggression" [...] against Austria was later recalled during the Nuremberg Trials.|$|R
2500|$|... 1991: Following {{two and a}} {{half years}} of {{campaign}} work, the Rainforest Foundation's initial project succeeded in coordinating the first ever privately funded demarcation of indigenous land in the Amazon region. 17 000 square miles of traditional land, the Menkragnoti Indigenous Territory in Pará state in Brazil, next to Xingu National Park, was demarcated, and then legally titled to the Kayapo people by the Brazilian government in 1992. Rainforest Foundation Norway provided 25% of the finances for the campaign. According to the Norwegian Agency for Development Coordination, [...] "the demarcation and the putting in place of a boundary control and supervision by the Indian organization itself (but financed by RFN), has stabilized the <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> on the boundaries and stopped incursions and deforestation in those border areas. Thus, effective protection of this area of some 50 000 square km of tropical forest has been assured".|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Marine {{protected}} areas of multiple uses (MPA-MU), {{are an important}} management tool to protect biodiversity and regulate the use of coastal marine resources. However, robust conservation plans require an explicit consideration of not only biological but also social components, balancing the protection of biodiversity with a sustainable exploitation of marine resources. Here we applied the decision-making algorithm MARXAN to provide a zoning analysis at the Mejillones Peninsula MPA-MU in northern Chile, one of largest MPA’s of the Humboldt Current Marine Ecosystem. We set conservation goals for coarse and fine-filter conservation targets that were crossed out against different <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> factors from human activities across the area. We identified a portfolio of sites for conservation, within the Mejillones Peninsula MPA-MU, representing different ecological systems with different levels of human impacts and vulnerability. These results {{may serve as a}} foundational guideline for the future administration of the MPA-MU...|$|R
