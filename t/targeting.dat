5|$|A {{helmet-mounted sight}} (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator <b>targeting</b> pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of <b>targeting</b> pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with <b>targeting</b> pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centres, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved situation awareness.|$|E

40|$|Four sets of <b>targets</b> {{were used}} in this study: (1) Fe <b>targets</b> {{surrounded}} with 304 type stainless steel composed of mid-Z elements: Fe, Cr, Ni, and Mn (designated as Fe[304 SS] <b>targets),</b> (2) Fe <b>targets</b> surrounded with high-Z tungsten (designated as Fe[W] <b>targets),</b> (3) Cu <b>targets</b> surrounded with mid-Z copper (designated as Cu[Cu] <b>targets),</b> and (4) Cu <b>targets</b> surrounded with high-Z tungsten (designated as Cu[W] <b>targets).</b> The <b>targets</b> were exposed to low-energy (140 and 200 eV), high-flux (about 1022 D/m 2 s) deuterium (D) plasmas at various temperatures {{in the range from}} 355 to 740 K. The surface morphology of the Fe and Cu <b>targets</b> is found to be dependent strongly on atomic number of re-deposited species and on the exposure temperature. For the Fe[W] and Cu[W] <b>targets,</b> due to formation of the W-enriched nano-sized structures on the <b>target</b> surfaces, the sputtering erosion yield is lower than that for the Fe[304 SS] and Cu[Cu] <b>targets,</b> respectively.

50|$|In the 2011 {{version of}} TTD, <b>target</b> {{validation}} {{information has been}} integrated. <b>Target</b> validation normally requires the determination that the <b>target</b> is expressed in the disease-relevant cells/tissues, it can be directly modulated by a drug or drug-like molecule with adequate potency in biochemical assay, and that <b>target</b> modulation in cell and/or animal models ameliorates the relevant disease phenotype. Therefore, TTD collects three types of <b>target</b> validation data: experimentally determined potency of drugs against their primary <b>target</b> or <b>targets,</b> observed potency or effects of drugs against disease models (cell-lines, ex-vivo, in-vivo models) linked to their primary <b>target</b> or <b>targets,</b> and the observed effects of <b>target</b> knockout, knockdown, RNA interference, transgenetic, antibody or antisense treated in-vivo models.
