Angered by what NESTS did to him, K' betrays NESTS and decides to destroy them for using his body and deleting all his memories. Although he hates tournaments, K' uses the King of Fighters tournaments to find NESTS members and defeat them. In his search, he meets allies who have the same goal and joins forces with <b>them.</b> <b>Aside</b> from the main series, K' also appears in several other media series, such as spin-offs and crossover video games, as well as printed adaptations of the series.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 season had a minor hiccup at {{the very}} {{beginning}} with a two-point loss to the Blues. Their second round match against the Hurricanes was cancelled, and match declared a draw after the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February which caused 182 deaths. In their first match after the earthquake they played the Waratahs, a team that had only conceded six points in their previous two games. The Crusaders triumphed 33–18 in a convincing display in front of a sold-out stadium. They next played the Brumbies and brushed <b>them</b> <b>aside</b> in a 52–10 demolition. They next played the Highlanders who had previously only lost one match in the season, to the undefeated and table-topping Stormers. The Crusaders won comfortably 44–13 in Dunedin. The next team they played, the Sharks, had like the Highlanders previously only lost one match in the season before the Crusaders won 44–28 at Twickenham for a one off match due to earthquake damage at their own ground. They played the second match in Timaru Alpine Stadium against the Bulls in a sell out crowd winning 27–0. Round 9 they played the Chiefs in Mt Maunganui and gained four tries winning 34–16 with Richie McCaw returning after eight weeks off with injury.|$|E

25|$|The methodologies {{of liberal}} or {{progressive}} Islam {{rest on the}} interpretation and re-interpretation of traditional Islamic scripture (the Quran) and other texts (such as the Hadith), a process called ijtihad (see below). This can vary from the slight to the most liberal, where only {{the meaning of the}} Quran {{is considered to be a}} revelation, with its expression in words seen as the work of the prophet Muhammad in his particular time and context. As a consequence, liberal/progressive Muslims may then interpret verses from the Quran allegorically or even set <b>them</b> <b>aside.</b>|$|E

25|$|Wilson's {{men were}} {{initially}} pushed back in some confusion, but Gregg had concealed a heavy line of skirmishers armed with repeating carbines in a brushy ravine. His men poured forth a destructive fire, halting the final Confederate advances, assisted {{by some of}} Wilson's men who turned the flank of the attacking column. Federal horse artillery made sure that the Confederate infantry no longer was a threat, and three mounted cavalry regiments skirmished with approaching enemy cavalry, turning <b>them</b> <b>aside</b> and protecting the rear. Brig. Gen. Gordon was mortally wounded in the fighting and died on May 18.|$|E
25|$|The Cougars {{journeyed to}} Conway, Arkansas for a Wednesday night game at Central Arkansas {{with both sides}} riding three-game win streaks.

Despite playing a man down for over 96 minutes, the Bears defense repeatedly anticipated the Cougars' shots and turned <b>them</b> <b>aside.</b> SIUE's Dal Santo and UCA's Olsen are the two top goalkeepers in the MVC for save percentage, and both not only made at least one spectacular save, but both also made stops on penalty kicks that would have won the game. The Cougars unbeaten streak is now at eight games with the 11th ranked Loyola Ramblers next up at The Ralph on Saturday night.|$|E
25|$|The Holy Table {{may only}} be touched by ordained members of the higher clergy (bishops, priests and deacons), and nothing which is not itself consecrated or an object of veneration {{should be placed on}} it. Objects may also be placed on the altar as part of the process for setting <b>them</b> <b>aside</b> for sacred use. For example, icons are usually blessed by laying them on the Holy Table {{for a period of time}} or for a certain number of Divine Liturgies before {{sprinkling}} them with holy water, and placing them where they will be venerated. The Epitaphios on Good Friday, and the Cross on the Feasts of the Cross, are also placed on the Holy Table before they are taken to the center of the church to be venerated by the faithful.|$|E

25|$|The {{important}} role of language, however, {{is not confined to}} the taming plot. For example, in a psychoanalytic reading of the play, Joel Fineman suggests there is a distinction made between male and female language, further subcategorising the latter into good and bad, epitomised by Bianca and Katherina respectively. Language is also important in relation to the Induction. Here, Sly speaks in prose until he begins to accept his new role as lord, at which point he switches to blank verse and adopts the royal we. Language is also important in relation to Tranio and Lucentio, who appear on stage speaking a highly artificial style of blank verse full of classical and mythological allusions and elaborate metaphors and similes, thus immediately setting <b>them</b> <b>aside</b> from the more straightforward language of the Induction, and alerting the audience {{to the fact that they}} are now in an entirely different milieu.|$|E
25|$|When first published, The Lives of John Lennon was {{controversial}} {{because of}} its portrayal of Lennon in a highly critical light. Lennon was presented in the book as a talented but deeply flawed man who manipulated people and relationships throughout his life, flinging <b>them</b> <b>aside</b> when {{they were no longer}} useful to him. Goldman also suggested that Lennon was an anti-Semite and a heavy drug-user and that he had dyslexia and schizophrenia. The author even went into detail about the long-rumored homosexual affair between Lennon and The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein (previously discussed in both Pete Shotton's Lennon in My Life and Peter Brown's The Love You Make books), as well as alleging a number of liaisons by Lennon with other men, including a claim that he solicited underage male prostitutes in Thailand. This latter assertion greatly angered Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney. The book was criticized by Lennon fans for allegedly containing much unsubstantiated conjecture, and tending to present worst-case scenarios when doing so.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September 1777, Mathew's brigade {{was part}} of Lieutenant General Lord Charles Cornwallis' {{division}} which had reached {{a position on the}} American right rear before being detected. At 4:00 PM, the Guards Brigade took position on the right flank of the first line. Osborn commanded both the grenadier company on the right and the light company which deployed as skirmishers in front. They were opposed by the Maryland Division which was commanded by Major General John Sullivan. Since Sullivan was responsible for supervising the American right wing, he left the division under the leadership of Brigadier General Philippe Hubert Preudhomme de Borre. The Frenchman mishandled the Marylanders, throwing the division into confusion. With the Americans in disarray, the attack of the Guards easily swept <b>them</b> <b>aside.</b> At the end of the day, the entire brigade reported only one killed, five wounded, and two missing. Of these, one casualty was from Osborn's grenadiers and three from the light company. A few days after the battle Osborn and FitzPatrick caught two Guard grenadiers out plundering. The unfortunate soldiers were both sentenced to 500 lashes as punishment.|$|E

Then the St. Louis papers begun to talk a good deal about the balloon that was going to sail to Europe, and Tom sort of thought he wanted to go down and see what it looked like, but couldn't make up his mind. But the papers went on talking, and so he allowed that maybe if he didn't go he mightn't ever have another chance to see a balloon; and next, he found out that Nat Parsons was going down to see it, and that decided him, of course. He wasn't going to have Nat Parsons coming back bragging about seeing the balloon, and him having to listen to it and keep quiet. So he wanted me and Jim to go too, and we went.|$|R
