5|$|<b>The</b> <b>invisible</b> rail is superficially {{similar to}} the purple swamphen, Porphyrio porphyrio, which has {{recently}} been found in Halmahera, but that species is larger, with a short, thick red bill and a red forehead shield; it also has purple underparts and a white undertail. <b>The</b> <b>invisible</b> rail {{is different from the}} Calayan rail, Gallirallus calayanensis, in that it is larger and lacks the barred plumage of that species; there is no overlap between the ranges of the two species.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Invisible</b> Touch Tour was the band's largest {{world tour}} {{in its history}} which {{included}} 112 dates from September 1986 to July 1987. Genesis received some criticism in their decision to have Michelob beer as a sponsor. The tour concluded with four consecutive sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium in London. The shows were released in 1988 as <b>The</b> <b>Invisible</b> Touch Tour. When the tour ended, Genesis took a five-year break while each member committed to their solo projects. They performed twice during this time; on 14 May 1988, they performed a 20-minute set at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden.

5000|$|The {{first volume}} of <b>The</b> <b>Invisibles</b> {{introduces}} Dane McGowan, an angry teen from Liverpool, as he attempts to burn down his school. Abandoned by his father and neglected by his mother, Dane takes out his anger and frustration through destruction. In {{the first issue of}} the series, Dane is recruited by <b>the</b> <b>Invisibles,</b> a ragtag band of freedom fighters led by King Mob, a charismatic, cold-blooded assassin. The next arc, [...] "Down and Out in Heaven and Hell", shows Dane as he tries to survive on his own in London after being abandoned by <b>the</b> <b>Invisibles.</b> Dane is mentored by Tom O'Bedlam, an elderly homeless man who is secretly a member of <b>the</b> <b>Invisibles.</b> Tom shows Dane the magic in the everyday world and helps him realize that his anger prevents him from experiencing real emotions. While wandering with Tom, Dane has a partially remembered alien abduction experience and is transported into a different dimension. Eventually Dane returns to <b>the</b> <b>Invisibles,</b> taking <b>the</b> codename [...] "Jack Frost". The next arc, [...] "Arcadia", follows <b>the</b> <b>Invisibles</b> as they go back in time via astral projection to the French Revolution. Jack is almost killed by a demonic agent of the Outer Church, the Invisibles’ chief enemy. As the arc closes, Jack declares that he is leaving <b>the</b> <b>Invisibles.</b>|$|R

5|$|James Whale (22 July 1889– 29 May 1957) was an English film {{director}}, theater {{director and}} actor. He is best remembered for his four classic horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), <b>The</b> <b>Invisible</b> Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Whale also directed films in other genres, including {{what is considered}} the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936). He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, but many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|The band {{spent the}} first half of 2005 concentrating on the {{material}} for the new album Remagine, while Borgman received intensive treatment to cure his cancer.

5|$|The {{difficult}} {{habitat and}} retiring nature of <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> rail mean that information on its lifestyle is sparse, {{and there are}} few confirmed sightings. Recorded food items include sago shoots and insects. It also feeds at cut sago plants, although {{it is unclear whether}} it is eating the decaying plant or searching for other edible items. It swallows small stones, as do all rails, to help break up its food in the gizzard.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>invisible</b> rail {{is thought}} to be monogamous, but little else is known of its {{courtship}} behaviour prior to nesting. A report of 4–5 striped chicks was long thought to be incorrect, since such a plumage is not normal for rails. In this family, chicks are typically precocial, downy and black, with any ornamentation confined to the head, bare flesh, or specially modified plume feathers.|$|E
5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for <b>the</b> <b>Invisible</b> God and Soul Survivor.|$|E

She also claims that the wreckage has been identified as a downed Libyan fighter jet; Mulder dismisses this explanation. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> occupant of the UFO passes through an electronic fence set up around the crash site, escaping into the outside world.|$|E

5|$|In 1602 Frederico Spinola, {{younger brother}} of Ambrogio Spinola had {{distinguished}} himself greatly {{as a soldier}} in the Army of Flanders and had succeeded in 1599 going through the English Channel passing the straits of Dover unmolested; this led to a panic called <b>the</b> <b>Invisible</b> armada as it encouraged suspicions that the attempt might be renewed and on a larger scale. Buoyed by this achievement he had indulged Philip III of Spain, the Duke of Lerma and Martín de Padilla in a vision of a massive galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders. However the council brought him down to a mere eight galleys, provided at Spinola's expense. He was on his way from San Lucar to Lisbon but he was defeated by Sir Richard Leveson at Sezimbra Bay which cost him two galleys.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Antoine posted an {{advertisement}} in the Spiritist journal The Messenger (Le Messager), seeking doctors who would associate with him, but the attempt {{did not meet}} with success. At the same time, he was deeply influenced by Léon Denis' book In <b>the</b> <b>Invisible.</b> He began {{to give up his}} remedies, particularly because of his then recent trial, and gradually left Spiritism, as he was sometimes deceived by false mediums. In 1902, his group The Vine Growers of the Lord, although solicited, did not participate {{in the creation of a}} Spiritist Federation, then in 1905, the members did not attend the preparatory meeting of the Congress in Liège and refused the 0.25 franc contribution. In 1905, he consultated up to 400 patients per day. Around the same time, he published a four-page leaflet which commented passages of the Gospels without reference to Spiritism.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{does the}} autopsy on <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> body by {{covering}} it in powder. Mulder, meanwhile, researches {{the owner of}} the container. He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E

5|$|Smith, {{a philosopher}} who forged the new {{discipline}} of economics, is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, showing {{his concern for}} the practical matters of economic activity, a gown draped over his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia.

His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> hand. The life-and-a-half size statue of Smith, is cast in bronze from a plaster model by the sculptor and was unveiled in 2008.

As Mulder finds Max inside, the building is surrounded by Henderson's forces. Mulder tries to comfort Max, but is attacked and injured by the alien. Mulder then sees Max floating in a pillar of light before vanishing. When Henderson finds that Max is missing, he orders Mulder arrested.|$|E
