This paper takes a dome steel structure with a diameter of 52 m (type Kiewitt) designed by a petrochemical corporation of Lianyungang as an example. According to the People's Republic of China industry standard JGJ 61 - 2003, utilizing Arc-Length method of the finite element analysis software Abaqus to analyze <b>this</b> <b>example’s</b> overall non-linear geometry, and utilizing finite element increment iteration to analyze <b>this</b> <b>example’s</b> response during the whole loading, we obtain the instability critical loads eventually.

5|$|The {{fact that}} every {{configuration}} has a predecessor may be summarized {{by saying that}} Rule 90 is surjective.

In an injective rule, every two different configurations have different successors, but Rule 90 has pairs of configurations with the same successor. Rule 90 {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective but not injective. The Garden of Eden theorem of Moore and Myhill implies that every injective cellular automaton must be surjective, but <b>this</b> <b>example</b> shows that the converse is not true.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} some glyphs are {{modified}} with the “guiding star” dependent glyph, while others are not, supports the idea that rongorongo was used for calendrical purposes in addition to astronomy and navigation.

In the month of March, Rigel, Arcturus, and Sirius can be seen together, and the Milky Way appears in the north to the right of Arcturus. If one were sailing north, they would first see Arcturus on the horizon, and then Polaris. The arrangement of glyphs in <b>this</b> <b>example,</b> and the presence of 'guide modifiers' on Arcturus and Polaris, are consistent with these facts.|$|E

5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, chances are that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In <b>this</b> <b>example</b> the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
