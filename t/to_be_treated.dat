5|$|After unrelenting {{pressure}} from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. On 27 March, {{a military coup}} d'état overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under the VVKJ commander, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. A general mobilisation was not called by the new government until 3 April, {{out of fear of}} offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. On the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the invasion.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Rueda {{was treated}} at Washoe Medical Center for his wounds and {{released}} the same day, while Kenzie McKeon only needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> {{at the scene}} for superficial wounds. The school was placed on lockdown {{for an hour and}} then classes were canceled {{for the remainder of the}} day. The shooting was the second firearm-related incident on Pine Middle School grounds in two weeks, with the previous incident being a man brandishing a gun towards the campus. On that occasion school administrators sent students home as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{lesson from the}} Tunisia Campaign was that neuropsychiatric casualties had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> {{as soon as possible}} and not evacuated from the combat zone. This was not done {{in the early stages of}} the Sicilian Campaign, and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North Africa, with the result that treatment became complicated and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty. As the campaign wore on, the system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty.|$|E
5|$|At least 150 {{black women}} were lynched between 1880 and 1965 in the American South. Historian Kerry Segrave {{highlights}} 115 recorded cases between 1851 and 1946. Ninety of the 115 were black, 19 white, and six Hispanic or uncertain. Women were usually not lynched alone, but tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as accomplices {{of men who}} were being lynched. Of 97 incidents examined by Segrave, 36 were of women lynched alone.|$|E

5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} age of tournaments had ended, and {{physical}} crests largely disappeared. Their illustrated equivalents consequently began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as simply two-dimensional pictures. Many crests from this period are physically impossible to bear on a helm, e.g. the crest granted to Sir Francis Drake in 1581, which consisted of a disembodied hand issuing from clouds and leading a ship around the globe (representing God's guidance).|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, {{the city}} bought the two private systems. Some {{elevated}} lines ceased service immediately while others closed soon after. Integration was slow, but several connections were built between the IND and BMT; these now operate as one division called the B Division. Since the IRT tunnels, sharper curves, and stations {{are too small}} and therefore can not accommodate B Division cars, the IRT remains its own division, the A Division. However, many passenger transfers between stations of all three former companies have been created, allowing the entire network <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as a single unit.|$|E
5|$|In {{answering}} {{both questions}} in the negative, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test to determine if a differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Thio's {{point on the}} views of the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission, Shanmugam said that at the time the report was rendered the electorate was immature and unfamiliar with the importance of voting, a result of the country's history of colonial rule. In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they were unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as setting a precedent.|$|E

5|$|On 21 January, Bader {{dramatically}} altered {{his previous}} orders regarding {{the treatment of}} those encountered {{in the area of}} operations, directing that those who did not resist and surrendered or merely had weapons in their houses, were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as prisoners of war. It is likely that this change was intended to assist Chetniks in the area of operations to avoid destruction. By the end of January, Bader's chief of staff was attempting to negotiate a cooperation agreement with Dangić, and in turn Dangić ordered the 4,500–10,000 Chetniks under his command to avoid the Germans or surrender their weapons immediately if they were unable to do so.|$|E
5|$|On 3 May 2012, {{the club}} {{was taken over by}} DFC 1883 Ltd with the {{intention}} of moving into community ownership. Because it failed to agree a creditors voluntary agreement (CVA), and proposed to play at a ground without the required grading for the Northern Premier League, Darlington were relegated four divisions, to the Northern League Division One, on the recommendation of the Football Association. Martin Gray was appointed manager. An appeal was rejected, confirming that {{the club was}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as a new club and {{would not be able to}} play under the name Darlington F.C. The new owners opted to rename the new club Darlington 1883.|$|E

Defiantly, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall. By a strictly party-line vote, they adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices.|$|E

While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a lighter metal such as sodium, a few heavy metals, such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of lighter metals, and, lighter metals such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier metals.|$|E

5|$|Realising the {{potential}} public relations coup {{in having a}} star sportsman enlist, officers recommended that Nash be seconded to the Army School of Physical Training (where Don Bradman {{had been given a}} commission), which offered greater pay and rank and ensured that Nash would not be posted overseas, away from family. Additionally, a medical examination detected osteoarthritis in both his knees, derived from the number of injuries he sustained throughout his footballing career. Nash refused, stating that he did not wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> differently from ordinary recruits, and enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, gaining the rank of Trooper.|$|E
