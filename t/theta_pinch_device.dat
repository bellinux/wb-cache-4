40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA reflex arc nitrogen plasma in a longitudinal magnetic field {{has been investigated}} by means of cylindrical Langmuir probes. Magnetic fields varying from 2400 gauss to 6600 gauss were studied. A radial profile of electron temperature and space potential was obtained {{as an aid to}} understanding the inner and outer rotational fluctuations previously noted to be characteristic of the reflex arc column. The effect of crossed magnetic and electric fields resulting in an E x B particle drift has been proposed as the primary mechanism of the outer rotational fluctuation, while the inner rotation mechanism has been proposed to be the j x B force of the magnetohydrostatic equation of a plasma in equilibrium. Diagnostic measurements of a <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>device</b> on the plasma column were not successful due to circuit pick-up of electric signals due to the theta pinch current pulse.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1993 Plasma {{formation}} in a coaxial double <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>device</b> is analyzed. This device, called the Coaxial Slow Source (CSS), has demonstrated {{the formation of}} annular field reversed configurations on diffusive timescales. Three analytical models are developed and used to: characterize the coupling between the magnetic configuration and the driving circuit, predict a temperature limit due to impurity radiation, and reveal an instability due to localized radiation cooling. A comprehensive model incorporating the interactions of neutral and ionized particles is used to simulate the CSS experiment on a computer. This two-dimensional MHD two-fluid code called scCOAX is adapted from an earlier version used by Hahn (1). Simulations are compared to experimental data from the CSS to test the models, and quantify the physical processes involved. The slow forming plasma is strongly influenced by the surrounding neutral fill gas due to: the energy lost by ionization of these neutrals, and enhanced heat conduction from charge exchange collisions between neutrals and ions. The friction between the neutral and ionized fluids is important in modeling the formation dynamics. Impurities {{also play a role}} in the power balance of such plasmas by strongly emitting line radiation. Radiation from impurities appear unimportant unless the plasma contacts the vacuum chamber walls...|$|E
40|$|Ion-beam-plasma-interaction {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the field of Warm Dense Matter (WDM) and Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). A spherical theta pinch is proposed to act as a plasma target in various applications including a plasma stripper cell. One key parameter for such applications is the free electron density. A linear dependency of this density to the amount of energy transferred into the plasma from an energy storage was found by C. Teske. Since the amount of stored energy is known, the energy transfer efficiency is a reliable parameter for the design of a spherical <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>device.</b> The traditional two models of energy transfer efficiency are based on assumptions which comprise the risk of systematical errors. To obtain precise results, this paper proposes a new model without the necessity of any assumption to calculate the energy transfer efficiency for an inductively coupled plasma device. Further, a comparison of these three different models is given at a fixed operation voltage for the full range of working gas pressures. Due to the inappropriate assumptions included in the traditional models, one owns a tendency to overestimate the energy transfer efficiency whereas the other leads to an underestimation. Applying our new model to a wide spread set of operation voltages and gas pressures, an overall picture of the energy transfer efficiency results...|$|E

The work was mainly focused on development of a pulsed plasma source using <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> and coaxial plasma gun. This device, once completed, will have a possible application as a test stand for high voltage breakdown of an ICRF antenna in extreme events in a tokamak such as edge-localized modes or disruption.

The equation is valid for a one-dimensional slab geometry, assumes the plasma remains in quasi-equilibrium throughout its evolution and does not include thermal transport.

It is found that the magnetic free energy can be substantially larger than the particle drift energy and can be an important energy reservoir in driving plasma instabilities (e. g., the lower-hybrid-drift instability).

40|$|Results are {{presented}} demonstrating the e ect of inductive coil geometry and current sheet trajectory on the exhaust velocity of propellant in conical <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> pulsed induc- tive plasma accelerators. The electromagnetic coupling between the inductive coil of the accelerator and a plasma current sheet is simulated, substituting a conical copper frustum for the plasma. The variation of system inductance {{as a function}} of plasma position is obtained by displacing the simulated current sheet from the coil while measuring the total inductance of the coil. Four coils of differing geometries were employed, and the total inductance of each coil was measured {{as a function of}} the axial displacement of two sep- arate copper frusta both having the same cone angle and length as the coil but with one compressed to a smaller size relative to the coil. The measured relationship between total coil inductance and current sheet position closes a dynamical circuit model that is used to calculate the resulting current sheet velocity for various coil and current sheet con gura- tions. The results of this model, which neglects the pinching contribution to thrust, radial propellant con nement, and plume divergence, indicate that in a conical <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> ge- ometry current sheet pinching is detrimental to thruster performance, reducing the kinetic energy of the exhausting propellant by up to 50 % (at the upper bound for the parameter range of the study). The decrease in exhaust velocity was larger for coils and simulated current sheets of smaller half cone angles. An upper bound for the pinching contribution to thrust is estimated for typical operating parameters. Measurements of coil inductance for three di erent current sheet pinching conditions are used to estimate the magnetic pressure as a function of current sheet radial compression. The gas-dynamic contribution to axial acceleration is also estimated and shown to not compensate for the decrease in axial electromagnetic acceleration that accompanies the radial compression of the plasma in conical <b>theta</b> <b>pinches...</b>|$|R

40|$|A new {{simplified}} {{design is}} being developed for injecting and trapping Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs) into liners, which {{is compatible with the}} energetic liner implosions of interest for Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF). Conical <b>theta</b> <b>pinches</b> that inject from each end of the liner region are proposed. The conical angle can be chosen to make axial translation out of the conical <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> into the liner region occur on approximately the same time scale as radial compression. Thus no crowbar switch is needed for the high-voltage fast-rising current pulse. The toroidal field from conical theta-pinch injection and/or Z-pinch preionization should rapidly annihilate upon merging of the two oppositely directed FRCs. Two dc coils in a Helmholtz-like configuration are all that are needed to serve the functions of cusp, translation, and mirror fields for trapping in the liner. The mirror strength required for trapping is not as critical as when using onesided injection because the merging FRCs have no net momentum when they collide. Previously observed damping of axial kinetic energy suggests that viscous damping parallel to B 'is strong for FRCs with mfp comparable to FRC length, and conversion of directed energy to thermal energy should occur on a time scale comparable to the injection time. The electrical/mechanical details will be described, accompanied by numerical simulations of FRC formation using the MACH 2 numerical code...|$|R
