They continued <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> presence at the club, both being members of the committee. It was Creswick, however, who exerted more influence over the rules in his position of Honorary Secretary and Treasurer.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{association with}} the University of Toronto's Massey College as a continuing senior fellow and senior resident. Her many activities include encouraging young women to pursue careers in science, promoting peace and social justice, and speaking and writing about the social effects of science and technology. Many of her articles and speeches on pacifism, feminism, technology and teaching are collected in The Ursula Franklin Reader published in 2006. Franklin {{is also the author}} of The Real World of Technology which is based on her 1989 Massey Lectures broadcast on CBC Radio.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{generally}} impress {{and delight}} (5, 6, 7, 8), often by including unusual, colourful costumes (6, 7). Sometimes they also commemorate (5, 8) or celebrate (1, 4, 8, 9, 10). Sometimes {{they have a}} serious purpose, such as when the context is military (1, 2, 5), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or {{have a role to}} play (6, 7, 9). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away (10), it is likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.|$|E

5|$|Before 1854, {{the area}} based around Bridgeton {{was a strong}} {{business}} and legal section in Cape May County. The local residents there, however, wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> banking industry, but a local named Richard Holmes along with several other locals turned to the strong type of enterprise, a turnpike company. Holmes and the locals began a local turnpike syndicate with other businessmen and began the Cape May Turnpike Company upon incorporation in 1854. The turnpike company, upon incorporation, was to build a toll road along roughly the U.S. Route 9 corridor. Progress in constructing the toll road was slow at first, with subscribers from Cape May County being hesitant to buy stock from the turnpike company. A friend of Richard Holmes, Wilmon Whilldin, owned a steamboat company in Cape May and apologized for not buying stock in the company. Citing the Panic of 1857 {{made it hard to}} convert securities to cash, Whilldin suggested that a steamboat would be more profitable than the turnpike. The money from the steamboat would go ahead and helped the financially depressed businesses in local communities.|$|E
5|$|Italian pop rock has {{produced}} major stars like Zucchero, and {{has resulted in}} many top hits. The industry media, especially television, are important vehicles for such music; the television show Sabato Sera is characteristic. Italy was {{at the forefront of}} the progressive rock movement of the 1970s, a style that primarily developed in Europe but also gained audiences elsewhere in the world. It is sometimes considered a separate genre, Italian progressive rock. Italian bands such as The Trip, Area, Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM), Arti e Mestieri, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, New Trolls, Goblin, Osanna, Saint Just and Le Orme incorporated a mix of symphonic rock and Italian folk music and were popular throughout Europe and the United States as well. Other progressive bands such as Perigeo, Balletto di Bronzo, Museo Rosenbach, Rovescio della Medaglia, Biglietto per l'Inferno or Alphataurus remained little known, but their albums are today considered classics by collectors. A few avant-garde rock bands or artists (Area, Picchio dal Pozzo, Opus Avantra, Stormy Six, Saint Just, Giovanni Lindo Ferretti) gained notoriety for their innovative sound. Progressive rock concerts in Italy tended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> political undertone and an energetic atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{had begun}} his {{education}} at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, in 1888 {{but had to}} leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered {{a place in the}} Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere. The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas continued <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> influence on him for most of his life.|$|E
50|$|For females, nonsexual {{aggression}} <b>has</b> {{been found}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> impact on job satisfaction than sexual aggression. Also, nonsexual aggression <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> relationship with job satisfaction in females than in males.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{competitors}} {{who provided}} 5% profit margin, Ghari detergent provided a profit margin of 6-7% to its dealers. This enabled Ghari <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> dealer base <b>to</b> push sales while keeping its prices low.|$|R
25|$|Reforms of {{the provincial}} {{administration}} started in the 1870s under increased pressure from the colonial states of the United Kingdom and France.

5|$|Santos boxed for {{the vacant}} WBO light-middleweight title against Yori Boy Campas {{in a fight}} that took place at Bally's Event Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Santos won the fight when referee Joe Cortez intervened in the {{eleventh}} round. During {{the course of the}} fight numerous combinations hurt Campas and cut his face, in the eleventh round following one of Santos' punches Campas informed Cortez that his vision was not functioning properly. At the moment of the fight's conclusion the scores of the judges were 99–91, 97–93 and 99–90 in favor of Santos. On August 17, 2002, Santos defended this championship for a first time against Mehrdud Takaloo, in a fight that also involved the World Boxing Union Light middleweight championship. The event took place in the Cardiff Castle located in Cardiff, Wales. Takaloo began the fight by using his right hand often and on the fourth round he scored a knockdown. As the fight progressed Takaloo began to show signs of exhaustion and Santos managed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> performance {{in the second half of}} the fight. Takaloo received cuts around both of his eyes which made the referee consider stopping the fight twice in the tenth round. When the fight ended Santos won the contest by unanimous decision and the judges' scores were 116–111, 116–112, 117–110.|$|E

2500|$|By February 2016, the BSP {{started to}} {{circulate}} new 100-piso bills which were modified <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> mauve or violet color. This was [...] "in response to suggestions {{from the public}} {{to make it easier}} to distinguish from the 1000-piso bank note." [...] The public could still use the New Generation Currency 100-piso bills with fainter colors as they are still acceptable.|$|R
50|$|Homemade dashi, {{made from}} dried kombu and katsuobushi, is less popular today, even in Japan. Granulated or liquid instant dashi {{replaced}} the homemade {{product in the}} second half of the 20th century. Compared to the delicate nuanced taste of homemade dashi, instant dashi tends <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger,</b> less subtle flavor, due to the use of chemical flavor enhancers—glutamates and ribonucleotides.|$|R
25|$|A {{distinction}} can be {{made between}} older varieties of spinach and more modern ones. Older varieties tend to bolt too early in warm conditions. Newer varieties tend to grow more rapidly, but <b>have</b> less of <b>an</b> inclination to run up to seed. The older varieties have narrower leaves and tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> and more bitter taste. Most newer varieties have broader leaves and round seeds.|$|R

50|$|Bright {{lived in}} Bristol, England, {{one of nine}} {{children}} born to Richard Bright (1754-1840) and Sarah Heywood Bright. Her father was a wealthy merchant and banker, and he is known <b>to</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> interest in science. In 1823 {{he was one of}} the founders of the Bristol Institution for the Advancement of Science, Literature and the Arts. As of summer 2015, little else is known about Sarah Anne Bright's life.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of these strong {{socially}} conservative influences, the German Christian Democratic Union, the dominant political force in post-war West Germany, tended to ignore or oppose most Gay rights issues. While their frequent coalition partners, The Free Democratic Party tended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> belief in civil liberties, they were, as a smaller party, less likely to alienate the more socially conservative elements in the larger Christian Democratic Union.|$|R
30|$|Individuals {{with high}} {{uncertainty}} avoidance {{are more likely}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> need for clarity in consumer behaviors and organizational practices (Adler 1997; Lynn et al. 1993; Newman & Nollen 1996). In particular, people with high uncertainty avoidance {{were less likely to}} engage in nonobligatory consumer behaviors (e.g., tipping) (Lynn et al. 1993). Newman and Nollen (1996) found that the clarity of management practices produced high work-unit performances among individuals with high uncertainty avoidance.|$|R
25|$|Kenji's {{works were}} {{influenced}} by contemporary trends of romanticism and the proletarian literature movement.

40|$|We propose and {{characterize}} a {{generalization of}} the classical linear index of individual deprivation based on income shortfalls. Unlike the original measure, our class allows for increases in the income of <b>a</b> higher-income individual <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> impact on <b>a</b> person’s deprivation the closer they occur to the income of the individual whose deprivation is being assessed. The subclass of our measures with this property is axiomatized in our second result...|$|R
30|$|Conversely, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{plan for}} the future is {{positively}} associated with economic attachments to both country of origin (remitting every month) and the host country (own a home) and to the socio-cultural attachments (high degree of approval for Italian lifestyle, frequent use of Italian at home and (though only for men) <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> network with more Italians). Moreover, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> sense of belonging to Italy or equally strong for Italy and home is positively associated with <b>having</b> <b>a</b> plan.|$|R
50|$|As {{a senior}} in 1980, Courey won the No. 1 quarterback job and went 3-0 as a starter, {{including}} wins over ninth-ranked Purdue and fourteenth-ranked Michigan. But then coach Dan Devine, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> reputation for being fickle with his QBs, decided to give the starting job to freshman Blair Kiel, believing the underclassman <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> arm. Courey would later lead a tying touchdown drive against Georgia Tech, but would never start another game.|$|R
25|$|The river Glin {{comes from}} the valley between Kilmashogue and Tibradden Mountains, this valley is known as Kelly's Glen.

25|$|After {{the film}} became {{a huge hit}} for Nikkatsu, the studio wanted to follow it with a sequel. Oniroku Dan {{remained}} bitter and did not agree {{to participate in the}} next film, Wife to be Sacrificed (1974), which became even a greater success.

50|$|Created in 2002 {{along with}} Queens High School for the Sciences at York College, and High School of American Studies at Lehman College, HSMSE was founded with an {{emphasis}} on engineering and design, and was envisioned as a small school with approximately four hundred students. The relatively small population of the school allows students and teachers <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> relationship. Being <b>a</b> specialized high school not only draws students in, but also allows for a diverse student body.|$|R
50|$|About 90% of {{the city}} {{consists}} of Laguna Woods Village, a retirement community, formerly known as Leisure World. Incorporation efforts in the late 1990s were largely driven by the need for residents <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> voice against the prospective construction of an international airport at the nearby decommissioned Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. The airport proposal was defeated and the land in question has been tabbed for development as the Orange County Great Park.|$|R
30|$|Dividing {{the sample}} into subsamples {{according}} to immigrants’ origin {{shows that the}} relation between naturalisation and duration of residence is weaker for immigrants from Western European countries and immigrants from Turkey compared to immigrants from Eastern European and other countries. Furthermore, economic factors seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> influence on naturalisation of immigrants from non-Western countries. For them, the position in the job is positively and blue-collar employment is negatively correlated with the naturalisation probability. These determinants are not significant in the sample of Western European immigrants.|$|R
