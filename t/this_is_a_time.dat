Islamic texts also allude to the appearance of Ya'juj and Ma'juj (known also as Gog and Magog), ancient tribes which will disperse and cause disturbance on earth.

A vision is given {{of what will happen}} to the Church of England if it is not defended against the Dissenters. The pamphlet ends with a rallying call to action against the Dissenters in defence of the church ("Now let us Crutcifie the Thieves.") ...|$|E

Therefore nobody can say <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of high culture. If you eat poison you will die. If {{electricity}} hits the body you will die. If you oppose the Brahmin you will die. Gandhi did not advocate the eradication of Varnasrama Dharma structure but sees in it a task for the humanisation of society and social change possible within its structure. The consequence {{of this would be}} continued high-caste leadership. Gandhi adapted Brahmins to social change without depriving them of their leadership".|$|E

Vinnie Paz explained that it was [...] "always something that stuck in my head but I never applied it to anything.

2500|$|In November 1911, a {{group of}} Ohio Republicans {{endorsed}} Roosevelt for the party's nomination for president; the endorsers included James R. Garfield and Dan Hanna. This was notable, as the endorsement was made by leaders of President Taft's home state. Roosevelt conspicuously declined {{to make a statement}} requested by Garfield—that he flatly refuse a nomination. Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, [...] "I am really sorry for Taft... I am sure he means well, but he means well feebly, and he does not know how! He is utterly unfit for leadership and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when we need leadership." [...] In January 1912, Roosevelt declared [...] "if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve". Later that year, Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, openly identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms—even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions. In reaction to Roosevelt's proposals for popular overrule of court decisions, Taft said, [...] "Such extremists are not progressives—they are political emotionalists or neurotics".|$|E

2500|$|Twelve {{actors have}} headlined the series as the Doctor. The {{transition}} from one actor to another is {{written into the}} plot of the show with the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation – an idea introduced in 1966 to allow the show to continue after the departure of original lead William Hartnell who was becoming very ill at the time. The concept is that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> Lord trait through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and personality to recover from a severe injury or anything that would otherwise kill a normal person. Each actor's portrayal differs, but all represent stages {{in the life of the}} same character and form a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The current lead, Peter Capaldi, confirmed he would be leaving the show after the tenth series, with his final appearance being the 2017 Christmas special, [...] "Twice Upon a Time". In July, Jodie Whittaker was announced as the Thirteenth Doctor, the first woman to be cast in the role.|$|E
