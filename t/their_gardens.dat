5|$|Birdwatching {{has since}} {{the nineteenth century}} become a major leisure activity. Millions {{of people around the}} world, amounting to nearly half of all {{households}} in some developed countries, put out birdfeeders to attract birds to <b>their</b> <b>gardens</b> or windowsills, at a cost of billions of dollars each year.|$|E
5|$|The ANGAU Detachment {{reached the}} town of Mokerang on 9 March and found fifty inhabitants. The Detachment was {{relieved}} to find islanders had not been deliberately ill-treated by the Japanese. The retreating Japanese had stripped <b>their</b> <b>gardens</b> of food, leaving the civilian population hungry, so ANGAU arranged {{for them to be}} provisioned by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused {{as part of}} {{the post-war}} slum {{clearances}} in Manchester, to 16Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley. Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12Wardle Brook Avenue. Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to Saddleworth Moor to collect peat, something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in <b>their</b> <b>gardens,</b> which were full of clay and builder's rubble. She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.|$|E

5|$|Roman myth {{has it that}} Venus, {{the goddess}} of love, {{was born in the}} sea and emerged {{accompanied}} by fish and dolphins, with Botticelli depicting her as arriving in a scallop shell. The Romans revered her and erected shrines in her honour in <b>their</b> <b>gardens,</b> praying to her to provide water and verdant growth. From this, the scallop and other bivalve shells came {{to be used as a}} symbol for fertility. Its depiction is used in architecture, furniture and fabric design and it is the logo of Royal Dutch Shell, the global oil and gas company.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 1905, {{following}} lobbying by Ickenham Parish Council, the Metropolitan Railway {{opened a}} small halt on their line between Harrow and Uxbridge. The railway {{company had been}} reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of demand, and so a compromise was reached {{with the construction of}} the halt. The new stop brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Nearby villagers sold flowers from <b>their</b> <b>gardens</b> and served teas to the visitors. The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905, followed by a booking hut in 1910. The original platforms, too short to align with all train carriages, were extended in 1922. Ickenham Halt was rebuilt as a station in the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|During the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568–1600) stone {{lanterns}} were {{popularized by}} tea masters, who used {{them as a}} decoration in <b>their</b> <b>gardens.</b> Soon they started to develop new types according to the need. In modern gardens they have a purely ornamental function and are laid along paths, near water, or next to a building.|$|E
25|$|Coffee was {{initially}} used for spiritual reasons. At least 1,100 years ago, traders brought coffee across the Red Sea into Arabia (modern-day Yemen), where Muslim dervishes began cultivating the shrub in <b>their</b> <b>gardens.</b> At first, the Arabians made wine from the pulp of the fermented coffee berries. This beverage {{was known as}} qishr (kisher in modern usage) and was used during religious ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|The Choctaw {{regularly}} traveled {{hundreds of}} miles from their homes for long periods of time, moving to seasonal hunting grounds in the winter.

25|$|The Moghul {{emperors}} {{not only}} led a leisurely life but also pursued gardening and art. They decorated <b>their</b> <b>gardens</b> with their private zoos and hired artists to paint many subjects including plants and animals. Hunting and falconry were also extensively practised. They also employed scribes and {{were among the}} first to document their observations of nature in India. The foremost of the observers were Jehangir (1569–1627) and Babur (1483–1530) (See also Baburnama).|$|E
25|$|Women had {{charge of}} making do. They {{cut back on}} purchases, brought out old {{spinning}} wheels and enlarged <b>their</b> <b>gardens</b> with flax and peas to provide clothing and food. They used ersatz substitutes when possible, {{but there was no}} real coffee {{and it was hard to}} develop a taste for the okra or chicory substitutes used. The households were severely hurt by inflation in the cost of everyday items like flour and the shortages of food, fodder for the animals, and medical supplies for the wounded.|$|E
25|$|The {{strawberry}} fruit {{was mentioned}} in ancient Roman literature {{in reference to}} its medicinal use. The French began taking the strawberry from the forest to <b>their</b> <b>gardens</b> for harvest in the 14th century. Charles V, France's king from 1364 to 1380, had 1,200 strawberry plants in his royal garden. In the early 15th century western European monks were using the wild strawberry in their illuminated manuscripts. The strawberry is found in Italian, Flemish, and German art, and in English miniatures. The entire strawberry plant was used to treat depressive illnesses.|$|E

25|$|In Valle de Etla, {{one group}} of {{indigenous}} residents has taken to collecting old tires found on the highway and have begun converting them into handcrafts. The craft idea began with Esteban Perada, originally from Santiago Suchilquitongo. Originally he used them to support washers and retaining walls and car bumpers. Getting creative, he {{found a way to}} convert a tire into a toucan design to hang flowerpots, painting it bright colors. Others liked it and requested the item for <b>their</b> <b>gardens.</b> Since then he and others have created other figures such as parrots, squirrels and more, selling enough to supplement family income.|$|E
25|$|Religion, farming, fishing, weather prediction, out-rigger canoe (similar {{to modern}} catamarans) {{construction}} and navigation were highly developed skills because {{the population of}} an entire island depended on them. Trading of both luxuries and mundane items was important to all groups. Periodic droughts and subsequent famines often led to war. Many low-lying islands could suffer severe famine if <b>their</b> <b>gardens</b> were poisoned by the salt from the storm-surge of a tropical cyclone. In these cases fishing, {{the primary source of}} protein, would not ease loss of food energy. Navigators, in particular, were highly respected and each island maintained a house of navigation with a canoe-building area.|$|E
25|$|The friary of Blackfriars, Newcastle (Dominican) was {{established}} in 1239. These were {{also known as the}} Preaching Friars or Shod Friars, because they wore sandals, as opposed to other orders. The friary was situated in the present-day Friars Street. In 1280 the order was granted royal permission to make a postern in the town walls to communicate with <b>their</b> <b>gardens</b> outside the walls. On 19 June 1334, Edward Baliol, king of Scotland, did homage to king Edward III. for the kingdom of Scotland, in the church of the friary. Much of the original buildings of the friary still exist, mainly because, after the dissolution of the monasteries the friary of Blackfriars was rented out by the corporation to nine of the local trade guilds.|$|E
