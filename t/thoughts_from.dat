The original soundtrack and additional remixes {{of these songs}} are included. Wireless and social media features are also included: the Tin Pin Slammer can be played with other players via wireless connections, and the game can connect with the player's social media applications to display these as scanned <b>thoughts</b> <b>from</b> non-player characters within the game. The Solo Remix version features a remixed soundtrack from the original DS release. New assets {{at the conclusion of}} the iOS game hint at a possible sequel, but no confirmation has been made by Square Enix. The iOS version of the game was pulled from the iOS App Store in February 2015 due to an issue that prevented the game from working with the iOS 8 operating system launched in September 2014, though the Android version remains available. It returned to the App Store in June 2015.|$|E

25|$|A 2011 {{report by}} the Institute {{estimated}} that 4 million adults identify as gay or lesbian, representing 1.7% of the population over 18.

(Older estimates have varied depending on methodology and timing; see Demographics of sexual orientation {{for a list of}} studies.)

25|$|Additionally, Fles {{carried on}} correspondences with other leading thinkers of his day, {{including}} an extended debate with Henri Polak regarding {{the nature of}} socialism and Fles' determined opposition to Zionism. Fles felt himself to be Dutch, and saw Zionism as further separating Jews from their non-Jewish Dutch neighbors while reinforcing {{the image of the}} Jew as a foreigner. Instead, Fles favored assimilation into the cultures in which Jews found themselves. He endorsed mixed marriages to accelerate this process. Fles gathered many of his <b>thoughts</b> <b>from</b> this correspondence into the 1939 pamphlet Weg met het zionisme! (Down with Zionism!).|$|E
25|$|Many {{practitioners}} {{say that}} the scrying medium initially serves to focus attention, removing unwanted <b>thoughts</b> <b>from</b> the mind {{in much the same}} way as repetition of a mantra, concentration on a mandala, inducing the relaxation response, or possibly by hypnosis. Once this stage is achieved, the scryer may begin free association with the perceived images. The technique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images aloud, however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, attempts to deepen the trance state. In this state some scryers hear their own disassociated voices affirming what they see, in a mental feedback loop.|$|E

25|$|Pratyahara is {{fetching}} {{and bringing}} near one's awareness and one's thoughts to within. It {{is a process}} of withdrawing one's <b>thoughts</b> <b>from</b> external objects, things, person, situation. It is turning one's attention to one's true Self, one's inner world, experiencing and examining self. It is a step of self extraction and abstraction. Pratyahara is not consciously closing one's eyes to the sensory world, it is consciously closing one's mind processes to the sensory world. Pratyahara empowers one to stop being controlled by the external world, fetch one's attention to seek self-knowledge and experience the freedom innate in one's inner world.|$|E
25|$|WWE helped {{promote it}} through an {{on-screen}} angle (a fictional storyline used in wrestling). This involved the heel Chris Jericho criticizing legendary retired wrestlers such as Ric Flair, who he felt were embarrassing themselves, {{as well as}} Mickey Rourke for his portrayal in The Wrestler. At the 15th Screen Actors Guild Awards, Rourke announced he would be competing at WrestleMania XXV, specifically targeting Jericho. The announcement led to a confrontation between the two on Larry King Live, which showed signs of second <b>thoughts</b> <b>from</b> Rourke. On January 28, it was announced through Rourke's spokesperson that the actor would not compete at the event, and he was soon after announced instead as a guest.|$|E
25|$|Wilson was tutored at The King's School, Chester {{and entered}} Trinity College, Dublin as a sizar on 29 May 1682. His tutor was John Barton, {{afterwards}} dean of Ardagh. Jonathan Swift {{entered in the}} previous month, and other contemporaries included Peter Browne and Edward Chandler. He was elected scholar on 4 June 1683. In February 1686 he graduated with a B.A.. The influence of Archdeacon Michael Hewetson (died 1709), a prebendary of St Patrick's Cathedral, turned his <b>thoughts</b> <b>from</b> medicine to the church.

25|$|Nigamananda {{said that}} one should {{remember}} that death is coming. Before working on good or evil deeds one should also remember that death is not far off. Contemplating death drives away the desire for sensual pleasure and evil thoughts and stops acts of injustice. Attachment to wealth and relations will then diminish. Earthly matters remain even after departure from this world. Only spiritual wealth remains as an asset to the individual. Those who have puffed with pride on account of their accomplishments will submit to the God of death meekly when that hour comes. Drunk with pride, some persons ill-treat their brethren. They will {{be left in the}} deserted crematory ground with the beasts and birds joyously waiting to feast upon their flesh. Thinking of this will drive evil <b>thoughts</b> <b>from</b> the mind.|$|E
25|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a common}} term {{for all of the}} {{behaviors}} which relate to the promotion of good sleep. These behaviors are used as the basis of sleep interventions and are the primary focus of sleep education programs. Behaviors include the use of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage and daytime napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment. Exercise can be helpful when establishing a routine for sleep but should not be done close to the time that you are planning on going to sleep. The creation of a positive sleep environment may also be helpful in reducing the symptoms of insomnia. In order to create a positive sleep environment one should remove objects that can cause worry or distressful <b>thoughts</b> <b>from</b> view.|$|E
25|$|When an {{individual}} tries to suppress thoughts under a high cognitive load, {{the frequency of}} those thoughts increases and becomes more accessible than before. Evidence shows that people can prevent their <b>thoughts</b> <b>from</b> being translated into behavior when self-monitoring is high; this {{does not apply to}} automatic behaviors though, and may result in latent, unconscious actions. This phenomenon is made paradoxically worse by increasing the amount of distractions a person has, although the experiments in this area can be criticized for using impersonal concurrent tasks, {{which may or may not}} properly reflect natural processes or individual differences. Ironic process theory is one cognitive model that can explain the paradoxical effect seen above. However, given the mixed evidence and commensurate with the latest research, it is suggested that such a model needs to account for individual differences. It should also note possible neurological dynamics (see, for instance, obsessive–compulsive disorder), to be considered robust.|$|E
