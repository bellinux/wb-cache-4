40|$|<b>Tooling</b> <b>feature</b> size to minimum {{thickness}} becomes small in micro scale products and its ratio affects the deformation behavior and formability in micro sheet forming significantly. Hydroforming {{technology has been}} originated and utilized in macro scale sheet forming to enhance the formability. In this study, the effect of relative <b>tooling</b> <b>feature</b> size on drawing characteristics and effects to improve the drawability, such as friction holding effect, hydrodynamic lubrication effect and compression effect by blank edge radial pressure, in micro hydromechanical deep drawing (MHDD) are investigated using plasticity theory and numerical simulation. The {{results show that the}} micro drawing characteristics in MHDD can be improved by applying counterpressure. However, the required fluid pressures for friction holding and hydrodynamic lubrication effects increase as the relative punch diameter and/or die shoulder radius to thickness decrease, although the compression effect by radial pressure on blank edge is independent of the relative <b>tooling</b> <b>feature</b> size...|$|E

40|$|Originally devised as a {{notation}} {{to capture}} scenarios during analysis and design, sequence diagrams can also aid understanding of existing software through visualization of execution call traces. Reverse engineered sequence diagrams are typically huge and designing tools to help users {{cope with the}} size and complexity of such traces is a major problem. While preprocessing {{may be necessary to}} reduce the complexity of a sequence diagram, interactive tool support is critical to help the user explore and understand the resulting diagram. This thesis examines <b>tool</b> <b>features</b> necessary to effectively support sequence diagram exploration by reverse engineers.

40|$|Abstract. Open Source Software {{maintenance}} and reuse require identifying and comprehending the applied software licenses. This paper first characterizes software maintenance, and {{open source software}} (OSS) reuse which are particularly relevant in this context. The information needs of maintainers and reusers can be supported by reverse engineering tools at different information retrieval levels. The paper presents an automated license retrieval approach called ASLA. User needs, system architecture, <b>tool</b> <b>features,</b> and <b>tool</b> evaluation are presented. The implemented <b>tool</b> <b>features</b> support identifying source file dependencies and licenses in source files, and adding new license templates for identifying licenses. The tool is evaluated against another tool for license information extraction. ASLA requires the source code as available input but is otherwise not limited to OSS. It supports the same programming languages as GCC. License identification coverage is good and the tool is extendable. ...|$|R
