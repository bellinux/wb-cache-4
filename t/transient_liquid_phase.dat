50|$|Hot {{pressing}} is {{a popular}} method for obtaining densified UHTC materials that relies upon both high temperatures and pressures to produce densified materials. Powder compacts are heated externally and pressure is applied hydraulitically. In order to improve densification during hot pressing, diboride powders can undergo milling by attrition to obtain powders of <2μm. Milling also allows for more uniform dispersion of the additive SiC. Hot pressing temperature, pressure, heating rate, reaction atmosphere, and holding times are all factors that affect the density and microstructure of UHTC pellets obtained from this method. In order to achieve >99% densification from hot pressing, temperatures of 1800-2000 °C and pressures of 30 MPa or greater are required. UHTC materials with 20vol.% SiC and toughened with 5% carbon black as additives exhibit increased densification above 1500 °C, but these materials still require temperatures of 1900 °C and a pressure of 30 MPa {{in order to obtain}} near theoretical densities. Other additives such as Al2O3 and Y2O3 have also been used during the hot pressing of ZrB2-SiC composites at 1800 °C. These additives react with impurities to form a <b>transient</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> and promote sintering of the diboride composites. The addition of rare earth oxides such as Y2O3, Yb2O3, La2O3 and Nd2O3 can lower densification temperatures and can react with surface oxides to promote densification. Hot pressing may result in improved densities for UHTCs, but it is an expensive technique that relies on high temperatures and pressures to provide useful materials.|$|E

The method of <b>transient</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> bonding was originally developed in the 1970 ’s [1] and {{has been used in}} the joining of titanium and nickel based superalloy components. In this method, a bonding alloy containing a melting point suppressing element is sandwiched between the parent metals to be joined. The temperature is raised to a point where the bonding alloy melts but the parent metals remain solid.

It {{may be possible to}} develop such a processing method using liquid phase sintering; as long as the liquid phase does not remain in the final sample. AlPO 4 forms a liquid phase with Al 2 O 3 and AlN at the temperatures required to sinter AlON, and slowly decomposes into P 2 O 5 and alumina. Therefore, it was investigated as a possible <b>transient</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> for reaction-sintered AlON.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} finite-element {{model was}} developed to predict coupled transient flow and multicomponent transport of organic chemicals which can partition between nonaqueous <b>phase</b> <b>liquid,</b> water, gas and solid phases in porous media under the assumption of local chemical equilibrium. Gas-phase pressure gradients are assumed negligible and liquid flow equations are solved simultaneously using an upstream weighted solution method with time-lagged interphase mass-transfer terms and phase densities. Phase-summed component transport equations are solved serially after computation of the velocity field also by an upstream weighted finite-element method. Mass-transfer rates are evaluated from individual phase transport equations by back-substitution and corrected for mass-balance errors. A number of hypothetical one- and two-dimensional simulations were performed to evaluate {{the applicability of the}} model to predict the transport of slightly soluble and volatile organics in three-fluid-phase porous media. Results indicate that mass-transfer rate and fluid density updating have negligible effects during periods of highly <b>transient</b> nonaqueous <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> migration but become important for long-term simulations as cumulative dissolution to the water phase and volatilization to the gas phase account for longer proportions of the total mass.

Addition of a relatively high concentration (65 wt%) of catalyst particles is preventing the formation of macro-voids, improving both mechanical stability of the membranes as well as improving homogeneity of the liquid flow distribution through the membrane. The catalyst particles remain intact during the preparation procedure.

Both EL and PA powders were cold pressed at different pressures, ranging from 250 to 770 MPa, and sintered under vacuum in the range 580 - 640 °C for 30 - 120 min. and then under pure nitrogen atmosphere for comparison. Vacuum degassing of the PA powder provided better compressibility and thus higher green densities than those for the as received PA or the premixed EL powder compacts pressed at compaction pressures ¿ 340 MPa. Near full sintered densities of ~ 98 %TD were obtained for both EL and PA 6061 Al alloys. Degassed PA Al with 0 · 6 wt-% paraffin wax (PW) or with only 0 · 12 wt-%Pb addition as sintering aid and no lubricant, and premixed EL with only 0 · 12 wt-%Pb addition and no lubricant gave the best optimum properties. It became apparent that additions of some solid lubricants such as lithium stearate (LS) and acrawax to both the premixed EL and PA powders provided reasonable green densities, but had deleterious effect on sintered densities and microstructures, particularly under vacuum sintering.
