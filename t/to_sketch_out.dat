Unsure of what career step to take after selling the store, she took a six-month sabbatical from the culinary scene and built offices above the shop. There, she studied the stock market and attempted <b>to</b> <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> plans for potential business ventures.

500|$|Considered by {{many critics}} {{as one of}} Dylan's masterpieces, [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] proved {{difficult}} to capture on tape. Heylin places the writing {{in the fall of}} 1965, when Dylan was living in the Chelsea Hotel with his wife Sara. In the New York recording studio, on November 30, Dylan announced his epic composition: [...] "This is called 'Freeze Out'." [...] Gill notes that this working title captures the [...] "air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched... full of whispering and muttering." [...] Wilentz relates how Dylan guided his backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying <b>to</b> <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> how he wanted it played, saying at one point, [...] "it's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's hard is Robbie." [...] Wilentz notes that, as Dylan quiets things down, he inches closer to what will appear on the album.|$|E
500|$|Fellini's {{creative}} process for La Strada started with vague feelings, [...] "a kind of tone", he said, [...] "that lurked, {{which made me}} melancholy {{and gave me a}} diffused sense of guilt, like a shadow hanging over me. This feeling suggested two people who stay together, although it will be fatal, and they don't know why". These feelings evolved into certain images: snow silently falling on the ocean, various compositions of clouds, and a singing nightingale. At that point, Fellini started to draw and sketch these images, a habitual tendency that he claimed he had learned early in his career when he had worked in various provincial music halls and had <b>to</b> <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> the various characters and sets. Finally, he reported that the idea first [...] "became real" [...] to him when he drew a circle {{on a piece of paper}} to depict Gelsomina's head, and he decided to base the character on the actual character of Giulietta Masina, his wife of five years at the time: [...] "I utilized the real Giulietta, but as I saw her. I was influenced by her childhood photographs, so elements of Gelsomina reflect a ten-year-old Giulietta." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the complementarity between introducing {{into schools}} self-technologies spawned by positive psychology, {{on the one}} hand, and cognitive capitalism on the other. The approach taken <b>to</b> <b>sketching</b> <b>out</b> the lines of intersection is suggested by Besley and Peters (2007). Reflexive self-production is central to life under cognitive capitalism. At the same time, positive psychological discourse is seeping into pedagogical practice and encouraging self-work. Selftechnologies such as mindfulness meditation are inculcating in schoolchildren an emotionally reflexive stance. As a result, schools are becoming sites where subjects are acclimated to immaterial labor. This labor is cognitive capitalism 2 ̆ 7 s lifeblood...|$|R
500|$|After 17 {{months of}} development, Chahi {{was only about}} one-third {{finished}} with the game, and realized that this rate would have been impractical. He began {{to take steps to}} simplify the development, including reusing background graphics and creating building blocks that allowed him to focus more on the game's puzzles. At the same time, he began to seek a publisher for the game. He first spoke to his former employer, Delphine Software, but also sought other distributors. One, Virgin Interactive, was favourable to Chahi's game but had suggested that he change it to a point-and-click style adventure game. Chahi had considered changing the game in line with this request but realized [...] "the effort to do this would have been too huge, and some friends who played the game loved it." [...] Ultimately, he accepted Delphine's offer in June 1991, and set a tentative release date in November. To meet this deadline, Chahi used storyboards <b>to</b> <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> the rest of the game's plot, balancing the overall pacing of the game. One ending captured on these storyboards, but abandoned, was Lester becoming the leader of the alien world. The game was finished in 1991, which inspired the game's tagline: [...] "It took six days to create the Earth. Another World took two years"; Chahi noted his own exhaustion at completing this project is mirrored in the near-death of Lester {{at the end of the}} game.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to demonstrate}} that {{a new type of}} peace operation, here called "peace enforcement", has been recognized in theory and practice, and to describe its features in detail. As an analysis of UN documentation (chapter 1), selected cases (chapters 2 - 5) and national military doctrine shows, peace enforcement combines features of both traditional peace-keeping and the kind of large-scale enforcement action that has been mounted in cases of transboundary aggression (e. g. the Persian Gulf, 1990 - 91). The last three sections of the dissertation are devoted to elaborating a definition of peace enforcement - first from a political perspective (its operational characteristics, chapter 7), then from a legal one (its legal basis, chapter 8) - and <b>to</b> <b>sketching</b> <b>out</b> its role in relation to other types of peace operation...|$|R

2500|$|Also in 1908, {{with her}} Viața Românească articles, Sadoveanu turned her {{attention}} to the impact of Symbolism and the anti-traditionalist Romanian Symbolist branch. As she herself argued decades later: [...] "I was the only one to express the opinion that [...] we are dealing with an innovative movement, just like I was the first one in history <b>to</b> <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> Symbolism in articles for Viața Românească". According to various commentators of her work, cited by literary historian Paul Cernat, she was indeed the first Romanian to take an interest in the movement, and who therefore opened a channel of communication between the Poporanists and the Romanian Symbolists. This assessment is partly contradicted by researcher Angelo Mitchievici, who reviews earlier such essays written by Alexandru Bibescu and Elena Bacaloglu.|$|E

2500|$|Altman favored stories {{expressing the}} interrelationships among several characters, being more {{interested}} in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended <b>to</b> <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a [...] "blueprint" [...] for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an [...] "actor's director," [...] a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work {{as part of his}} large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because [...] "he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration," [...] notes Derry.

2500|$|The {{notion that}} the Third Age lasted [...] "about 3000 years" [...] was first written down when Tolkien began <b>to</b> <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> the history of Númenor and Westlands. Further on, he {{departed}} from {{the date of the}} foundation of the Realms in Exile, calculated at 3320 of the Second Age on the basis of average reigns of the Kings in Númenor; from the duration of the time of peace before the war of the Last Alliance, approximated at 100 years; and from the date of the failing of the Kings in Gondor, proposed as T.A. [...] "c.2000". Original drafts for the account of the rulers of South-kingdom are not preserved, and in the earliest extant manuscript, ascribed by Christopher Tolkien to 1949–50, many events of the final history are already present. The rest entered in early revisions, namely the constant conflicts with Umbar; the attacks of the Wainriders, which replaced original wars with the Ringwraiths; the Battle of the Field of Celebrant and the gift of Cirion; and the Long Winter. The depopulation of Osgiliath was first placed some 200 years later, the fall of Minas Ithil was moved back and forth in time, and the last king Eärnur was originally stated to have never returned from a war against Mordor, with the Witch-king challenging him [...] "to fight for the palantír of Ithil" [...] when this element first entered.|$|E
2500|$|Except for {{footage of}} him {{arriving}} {{at his new}} setting, and being retrieved {{at the end of}} the week, the content of each episode is taped entirely by Stroud himself using several DV cameras that he must carry with him everywhere that he goes (he later switched to a number of HDV cameras). The burden of having to carry, place, and retrieve the camera equipment for each shot adds to the challenge and difficulty of each survival situation, and in several episodes Stroud chooses to leave a camera behind, videotaping him as he departs the area (the camera is retrieved later), and in one episode taking place in the Amazon, Stroud is forced to flee his camp and abandon all but two of his cameras due to fear of a stalking jaguar. His camera and audio gear typically weigh about [...] in total. During the [...] "Behind the Scenes" [...] episode, Stroud explains that [...] "setting up or tearing down all of my camera gear takes about 65% of my time." [...] The episode also explains that Stroud and his team extensively scout their locations ahead of time and consult with survivalists and natives to the area. [...] The goal is both to ensure Stroud's safety and <b>to</b> <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> interesting scenarios and techniques that can be illustrated on the show.

60|$|Neither the scornful {{neglect of}} his opponents nor the dissensions of some who sat on his own side, could check the ardour with which Burke pressed on, as he said, to the relief of afflicted nations.

In 1780, for instance, the slave-trade had attracted his attention, and he had even proceeded <b>to</b> <b>sketch</b> <b>out</b> a code of regulations which provided for its immediate mitigation and ultimate suppression. After mature consideration he abandoned the attempt, from the conviction that the strength of the West India interest would defeat the utmost efforts of his party.

Writer Alan Moore would do something similar afterward, more simply in Watchmen (1985) and much more extensively in his League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen (1999). Starstruck can be considered one of comics premiere hypertext fictions, {{in the sense of}} using supplementary texts, adjunct stories, and ancillary art to expand, deepen, and even alter the narrative experience. Comics Journal praised this innovation in 1986: [...] "The (Space) Brigades origin in the Graphic Novels glossary section, is hilarious; in general, the Starstruck glossaries provide as much mirth as the series itself." [...] And The Comics Journal reiterated this supportive praise in 2011 by saying, [...] "Starstruck’s reputation as a confusing book unfairly implies that it is a confused book, which it emphatically is not. History, culture, family relationships, religions, vernacular speech, and all manner of written texts from this fantastic world accumulate and intersect with perfect consistency." [...] Also praising the innovation, critic W. Andrew Shepard wrote in 2011, [...] "These sub-texts were more than winking references; they foreshadowed major events in the main narrative and, in keeping with the theme of unreliable narrators, called attention to the ways people construct histories." ...|$|R
