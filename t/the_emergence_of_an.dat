5|$|Kenyatta {{was also}} an elitist and {{encouraged}} <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elite class in Kenya. He wrestled with a contradiction between his conservative desire for a renewal of traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace Western modernity. He also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on Kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his {{need to create a}} non-tribalised Kenyan nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} {{conspiracy}} theorists grossly overestimate {{the influence of}} ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad {{have a long history}} in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E

25|$|In {{the extreme}} left-wing scene, anti-Semitic remarks {{were to be}} found mainly {{in the context of}} pro-Palestinian and {{anti-globalisation}} rallies and in newspaper articles using anti-Semitic stereotypes in their criticism of Israel. Often this generated a combination of anti-Zionist and anti-American views that formed an important element in <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anti-Semitic mood in Europe.|$|E
25|$|After his {{retirement}} from the University of Manitoba and his move to Montreal, he became {{active in the}} emigre government of the Ukrainian People's Republic which had been forced from the territory of Ukraine in 1920 by its rival Soviet government.

25|$|The India–Pakistan cricket rivalry {{is one of}} {{the most}} intense sports rivalries in the world.

Samuel Hays associated such movements with <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> advanced consumer society. Unlike the pre-World War II elitist ideology of conservationist production, this emergent approach in North America was of grassroots consumers democratically engaging in environmental issues, and there was often tension {{between the public and}} managers of the environment.|$|E
25|$|The Port of Jaraguá is a Brazilian port {{located in}} Maceió. The {{commercial}} {{and economic development}} of the Port of Jaraguá, next to {{the margins of the}} Mundaú lagoon, was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> important settlement that received the name of Maceió and later became the present capital of Alagoas. The Port of Jaraguá is situated in a natural port area that facilitates the ships docking. During the Brazilian colonial period, the most important products exported from there port were sugar, tobacco, coconut and spices.|$|E
25|$|Giolitti's {{policy of}} never interfering in strikes and leaving even violent demonstrations {{undisturbed}} at first proved successful, but indiscipline and disorder grew {{to such a}} pitch that Zanardelli, already in bad health, resigned, and Giolitti succeeded him as Prime Minister in November 1903. Giolitti’s prominent role in the years {{from the start of}} the 20th century until 1914 is known as the Giolittian Era, in which Italy experienced an industrial expansion, the rise of organised labour and <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> active Catholic political movement.|$|E

25|$|The Russian Emperor was {{successful}} in his diplomatic endeavours. Having secured agreement to non-involvement by the other Great Powers, on 17 April 1877 Russia declared war upon the Ottoman Empire. The Russians were successful against the Turks and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 ended with {{the signing of the}} preliminary peace Treaty of San Stefano on 19 February (3 March N.S.) 1878. The treaty and the subsequent Congress of Berlin secured <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> independent Bulgarian state {{for the first time since}} 1396, and the tsar's nephew, Prince Alexander of Battenberg, was elected as the Bulgarians' first ruler.|$|E
25|$|Several {{projects}} of the municipality are underway {{in the downtown}} area, on the western shore of the lake as well as mainly to the south. This is to establish new areas of commercial activity to attract new business to the Aix economic area. The establishment of new residential areas is also scheduled. In collaboration with the municipalities of Méry and Drumettaz-Clarafond, through concerted urban development, the town of Aix-les-Bains contributes to <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> activity called the Savoie Hexapôle area and also enables {{the development of a}} commercial area serving all of the southern sector of the Aix area.|$|E
25|$|In this {{cities and}} villages <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{associative}} movement {{led to the}} creation of permanent city councils, and to the association of artisan in guilds or confrarías, which would in time acquire a religious hue just to avoid being banned or punished in their patrimonies. This new burgs also allowed a number of minor noble houses to consolidate power by occupying the new administrative and political jobs and offices, in open competence with the new classes: mayors, aldermen (regedores, alcaldes, justiças), agents and other officials (procuradores, notarios, avogados) and judges (juizes) of the town council; or mordomos and vigarios (leader and deputies) of the diverse guilds.|$|E

25|$|In , ElBaradei {{said that}} the {{changing}} landscape of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament may be defined by <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extensive black market in nuclear material and equipment, the proliferation {{of nuclear weapons and}} sensitive nuclear technology, and the stagnation in nuclear disarmament. To combat proliferation, ElBaradei has suggested keeping nuclear and radiological material {{out of the hands of}} extremist groups, tightening control over the operations for producing the nuclear material that could be used in weapons, and accelerating disarmament efforts. ElBaradei also stated that only one percent of the money spent to develop new weapons would be enough to feed the entire world and that, if we hope to escape self-destruction, nuclear weapons should have no place in our collective conscience and no role in our security.|$|E
25|$|Whipple also {{discloses}} that Japan {{has retained}} its militarism, {{with reference to}} its bushido code of conduct, while the United States vacillates against the Greater Soviet Union's ascendancy. Due to the Greater Soviet Union threat, the United States and Japan have moved towards a closer military and strategic alliance. Japanese militarist values are much admired in the United States. Japan and the United States {{are the only two}} major powers standing between the Greater Soviet Union and total control of the globe—yet most Americans seem unable to be roused to deal with the Soviet threat. Whipple wonders what <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American leader like Feric Jaggar, the hero of Lord of the Swastika, could accomplish. Finally, there is a casual mention that, while in this history Nazi Germany never came into being, it is the Soviets who have undertaken the systematic genocide of all Jews in Europe—and since this is perpetrated by the Soviets, there is no power left whose armies might stop it and save at least a remnant of the Jews from this version of the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Galicia's Ukrainians predominated {{in rural}} areas and were {{primarily}} peasants or priests. Historically, the Ukrainians of eastern Galicia had had an ideological rivalry between Ukrainophiles – people who considered themselves {{to be part of}} the Ukrainian nation – and Russophiles – those who believed that Ukraine was an artificial creation and that Ukrainians were part of the Russian nation. Russophiles dominated western Ukrainian society in the mid 19th century but by the beginning of the First World War had been eclipsed by the Ukrainophiles. No longer widely popular within their own community, the Russophiles depended on support from Russia (such as from the Galician-Russian Benevolent Society based in St. Petersburg) and from Polish aristocrats who used their movement to split Ukrainian society. This support notwithstanding, both Russophiles and Ukrainophiles were opposed to the Poles whom they considered to be historical oppressors. However, the Russophiles were loyal to Russia and hoped that the war would bring about the integration of eastern Galicia with Russia while the Ukrainophiles, in contrast, were loyal to Austria and hoped that the war would bring about a dismemberment of the Russian Empire and <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> independent Ukraine in its territory. Both factions within the Ukrainian community were bitterly opposed to each other.|$|E
