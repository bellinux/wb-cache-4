5|$|Vent: A thin tube on {{the near}} end of the cannon {{connecting}} the explosive charge inside with an ignition source outside and often filled with a length of fuse; always located near the breech. Sometimes called the fuse hole or the touch hole. On the top of <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> {{on the outside of}} the cannon is a flat circular space called <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> field where the charge is lit. If the cannon is bronze, it will often have a vent piece made of copper screwed into the length of <b>the</b> <b>vent.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> hole, and fill <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E
5|$|To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} {{is poured}} down the bore. This {{is followed by}} a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of windage allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through <b>the</b> <b>vent,</b> but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>vents</b> {{involved}} in <b>the</b> eruption on the southwestern {{side of the}} summit are arranged along a west-northwest to east-southeast axis, which is sub-parallel to the axis of <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> {{involved in}} <b>the</b> 1979 eruption.|$|R
50|$|The Lost City {{supports}} {{a variety of}} small invertebrates associated with the carbonate structures, including snails, bivalves, polychaetes, amphipods, and ostracods. Large animals, however, such as tube worms and giant clams that are abundant in typical black smoker vents are absent at Lost City. A variety of microorganisms live in, on, and around <b>the</b> <b>vents.</b> Methanosarcinales-like archaea form thick biofilms inside <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> where they subsist on hydrogen and methane; bacteria related to the Firmicutes also live inside <b>the</b> <b>vents.</b> External to <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> archaea, including <b>the</b> newly described ANME-1 and bacteria including proteobacteria oxidise methane and sulfur as their primary source of energy.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydrothermal}} field differs {{significantly from}} <b>the</b> black smoker <b>vents</b> found in <b>the</b> late 1970s. <b>The</b> <b>vents</b> {{were discovered in}} December 2000 during a National Science Foundation expedition to the mid-Atlantic. A second expedition mounted in 2003 used DSV Alvin to explore <b>the</b> <b>vents.</b> <b>The</b> details of the chemistry and biology of the Lost City hydrothermal field were published in March 2005.|$|R
5|$|The {{morphology}} (shape) {{of volcanic}} ash {{is controlled by}} a plethora of different eruption and kinematic processes. Eruptions of low-viscosity magmas (e.g., basalt) typically form droplet shaped particles. This droplet shape is, in part, controlled by surface tension, acceleration of the droplets after they leave <b>the</b> <b>vent,</b> and air friction. Shapes range from perfect spheres {{to a variety of}} twisted, elongate droplets with smooth, fluidal surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At {{a point where the}} bulk density of the column {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E
5|$|At the 8 August 1993 Fairchild air show, Holland {{once again}} {{commanded}} the B-52 demonstration flight. The demonstration profile once again included bank angles greater than 45°, low-altitude passes, and another high pitch climbing maneuver, {{this time in}} excess of 80° nose high. The climb was so steep that fuel flowed out of <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> holes from the aircraft's wing tanks. The new wing commander, Brigadier General James M. Richards, and the new DO, Colonel William E. Pellerin, both witnessed the demonstration, but neither took any action.|$|E
50|$|In this application, as {{the ambient}} {{temperature}} within the greenhouse increases, the wax melts, activating the plunger and opening <b>the</b> <b>vents.</b> When <b>the</b> greenhouse temperature has cooled sufficiently, the wax cools and solidifies, allowing <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> to close again.|$|R
40|$|In vented dust {{explosions in}} buildings, {{secondary}} hazards such as explosion flames, the ejection of debris and pressure phenomena occur {{in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>venting</b> openings. New data on such hazards were obtained by dust explosion tests in a vented 324 -m" 3 explosion room using dusts of dust explosion class St 1. Vented explosions in buildings with an unhindered flame and pressure propagation in front of <b>the</b> <b>venting</b> opening produced a maximum flame length of 16 [...] . 17 m for lignite dusts, at a flame speed of up to 36 m/s. By secondary explosions in front of <b>the</b> <b>venting</b> opening, <b>the</b> explosion pressures were reduced to an overpressure of < 0, 8 mbar in a distance of 40 m. In further tests, a mobile concrete wall of 6 m height (108 m" 2) was installed at distances of 21 m and 14 m from <b>the</b> <b>venting</b> opening, respectively. This protective structure {{did not lead to}} any measureable obstruction of <b>the</b> <b>venting</b> process in <b>the</b> building to determine its effects on <b>the</b> <b>venting</b> process inside <b>the</b> building and to obtain data on the dimensioning of protective structures.

5|$|In {{the first}} letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to the}} reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so {{it is more likely that}} the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|The steep conical cinder cones of Edziza {{were formed}} by lava {{fountain}} eruptions, emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava {{from a single}} vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinder around <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> to form a circular or oval cone. Edziza's cinder cones have bowl-shaped craters at their summits and rise {{more than a hundred}} metres above their surroundings. Cinder cones are widespread in British Columbia as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.|$|E
50|$|The {{terracotta}} horses of Bankura {{are turned}} out in two different colours. The normal terracotta red color is obtained by letting out the smoke through <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> of <b>the</b> kiln after firing, and the black colour is obtained by sealing <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> and not letting out the smoke.|$|R
5000|$|Explosion vent {{construction}} must {{balance the}} contradictory requirements [...] "low inertia" [...] and [...] "high strength". Inertia negatively affects an explosion vent's efficiency. High strength {{is required to}} endure the considerable forces that move <b>the</b> <b>vent's</b> venting element in order to open <b>the</b> <b>venting</b> orifice. Unintended disintegration must not cause disintegrating parts turning into a missile.|$|R

5|$|The steep-sided, {{symmetrical}} stratovolcanoes in {{the region}} were built by repeated eruptions of thick, slow-moving lava that have commonly flowed only a few kilometres from <b>the</b> <b>vent.</b> Explosive eruptions are often associated with these volcanoes, depositing alternating layers of volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and globes of molten rock called volcanic bombs or lava bombs, which are added to its slopes to create the stratovolcano. Edziza's stratovolcanoes contain a fine-grained silica-rich volcanic rock called trachyte; they have not erupted for thousands of years, allowing erosion to destroy the original cone, creating craggy ridges and rock outcrops of more resistant materials.|$|E
5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have a small white spot {{at the base of}} the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to <b>the</b> <b>vent.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to <b>the</b> <b>vent,</b> resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} bird families, {{pelicans}} {{are susceptible to}} a variety of parasites. Specialist feather lice of the genus Piagetella are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. Avian malaria is carried by the mosquito Culex pipens, and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. Leeches may attach to <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> or sometimes the inside of the pouch. A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks and nematodes. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the soft tick Ornithodoros capensis sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several lice are very host-specific.|$|E
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> with {{a thick layer of}} pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E
5|$|Edziza's rounded, steep-sided lava domes {{were built}} by eruptions of very thick light-coloured magma, {{including}} trachyte. Such magmas are typically too thick to move far from <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> it extrudes from, {{causing it to}} solidify quickly and build on previous volcanic extrusions, creating a characteristic dome-like shape. The thickness of the magma is attributed {{to high levels of}} silica, a naturally occurring silicon dioxide found in various crystalline and amorphous forms. Edziza's domes reach heights of several hundred metres, and grew slowly and steadily for months to years. The sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris. Due to the possibility of the building of gas pressure, the dome can experience more explosive eruptions over time. When part of a lava dome collapses while it still contains molten rock and gases, it can produce a pyroclastic flow, a super-heated mix of gas, ash, and pumice.|$|E

5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside <b>the</b> <b>vent.</b> The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.|$|E
5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the Sliver Box, an analogue of <b>the</b> <b>Vent</b> {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm {{on top of}} a gelatinous cone, on the substrate either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into <b>the</b> <b>vent.</b> The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.|$|E
50|$|Vented fins {{were first}} {{designed}} in 1964 by Georges Beuchat and commercialised as Jetfins.

A review and study by Pendergast et al in 2003 concluded that vented fins did not improve economy, implying that water does not pass through <b>the</b> <b>vents.</b> <b>The</b> study is only partially significant because it only considers the flutter kick, whereas the jetfin is mostly used with frog kick in the technical diving community.
