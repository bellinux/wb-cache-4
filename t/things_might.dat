25|$|Poincaré, {{following}} Gauss, Lobachevsky, Bernhard Riemann and others, viewed geometric {{models as}} mere conventions {{rather than as}} absolute. Euclidean geometry, upon which traditional perspective had been founded, was but one geometric configuration among others. Non-Euclidean geometry, with its hyperbolic or spherically curved space, was thus, at the very least, an equally valid alternative. This discovery {{in the world of}} mathematics overthrew 2000 years of seeming absolutes in Euclidean geometry, and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multi-dimensional worlds and perspectives in which <b>things</b> <b>might</b> look very different.|$|E
25|$|Buddy warns Phyllis that Sally {{is still}} in love with Ben, and she is shaken by how the past threatens to repeat itself. Sally is awed by Ben’s {{apparently}} glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he made the right choices and considers how <b>things</b> <b>might</b> have been ("The Road You Didn't Take"). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, trying to convince him (and herself) ("In Buddy’s Eyes"). But it is clear that Sally {{is still in}} love with Ben – even though their affair ended badly when Ben decided to marry Phyllis. She shakes loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched by the memory of the Sally he once cast aside.|$|E

The building is actually an iron smelter left over from the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 when the United States was forced into creating an economic independence to complement its political freedom.

It is currently fenced off by the Newark water department to prevent any entrance and the liability for injury that might result.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam {{repeatedly}} said in interviews {{that the character}} of Parnassus was meant autobiographically, a tale of an aging man with a vivid imagination {{in a world that}} doesn't listen any more. Still being caught in depression over the disruption of his last self-written project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, his constant struggle with the established studio system, as well as becoming aware of his progressing age, worried that he was going nowhere with his latest projects and that he might not have much time left, Gilliam put a number of references to sudden, tragic, and premature death into his script before the loss of Ledger became a reality. In fact, Gilliam felt compelled to emphasise time and again that upon the film's release many <b>things</b> <b>might</b> be mistaken as references to Ledger's fate but that the script wasn't changed apart from re-casting Tony with Depp, Farrell, and Law.|$|E
500|$|Ford became Vice President as the Watergate scandal was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig {{contacted}} Ford to {{tell him}} that [...] "smoking gun" [...] evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had {{been a part of the}} Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. However, [...] "Al Haig asked to come over and see me," [...] Ford later said, [...] "to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that <b>things</b> <b>might</b> change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.|$|E

500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes {{there are things that}} need to be done and they're not fun to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous <b>things</b> <b>might</b> happen to him. I think he is also a realist. He understands that even when you have friends that come back from the dead, not everything that you want to happen is going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|P.T.s ceaselessly looping hallway {{has been}} a source of {{critical}} discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced [...] "mild claustrophobia" [...] and [...] "a familiarity with your surroundings". He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to keep everything in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as [...] "the conduit for everything that it builds", along with saying that [...] "it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning is a moment of primal foreboding at how <b>things</b> <b>might,</b> and almost certainly will, escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before." [...] Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working [...] "within the realm of psychology". Polygon quoted a game player who said that [...] "P.T.s greatest asset is its looping hallway", elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also [...] "curiosity, or a desire to know what will happen next". Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability.|$|E
500|$|Sharing what he {{perceived}} to be [...] "key" [...] moments {{in each of the}} seventeen music videos, Walker of MTV identified one for [...] "No Angel" [...] where Beyoncé [...] "proves she comes 'with a side of trouble'". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse remarked how the video looked like the video game Grand Theft Auto and showed things that did not look [...] "angelic": [...] "Between the tough-looking gangbangers, fancy cars and flashy jewelry, strippers and dozens of 'In Loving Memory' tees and tributes, it seems like Bey's trying to say these aren't exactly the easiest streets to live... But like the song suggests, just because <b>things</b> <b>might</b> get rough sometimes doesn't mean it's not still home." [...] A mixed review came from an editor of Houston Chronicle who described the clip as [...] "somber, shocking" [...] and noted the omissions of many landmarks characteristic for the city such as Waterwall, the Houston Astrodome and The Galleria. The editor also noted that the video offered a glimpse in the town's sex industry and elaborated, Many Houstonians probably don't know that side of the city. They almost certainly don't see it as beautiful. ' culture' is what some pundits call it. But underneath is something complicated, and it has a way of influencing society unlike anything else Houston produces. Because of Beyoncé, that is the Houston that the world sees. It is a Houston that deserves a closer look.|$|E

500|$|The {{second half}} {{started off with}} Crayston briefly taking {{on the role of}} a forward, driving in a shot that Smith did well to save. Arsenal's {{forwards}} followed this with a flowing move from James, Hulme and Bastin, with the final move resulting in Bastin heading just wide of the post. Although play in the first half was relatively equal, in the second half Arsenal were the superior side, simply outclassing the Second Division Sheffield United. In the 74th minute a movement was started by James, who passed the ball to Bastin. Bastin dribbled the ball past Hooper before crossing the ball into the centre for Drake, who drove the ball into the roof of the net with his left foot. Moments after the goal United were on the attack, Barton broke down the right wing, crossing the ball in for Dodds who, finding his marker out of position, headed the ball against the bar. Dodds later said in an interview, [...] "I was just about to direct the ball down into the net when a wee fellow called Wilf Copping went up behind me and, in striving to get to the ball, punched me in the back. This had the unfortunate effect of knocking my head backwards so the ball thudded against the crossbar instead of nestling itself {{in the back of the}} net. But for that, who knows, <b>things</b> <b>might</b> have turned out different." [...] Arsenal won the game with a single goal, the match having been mostly full of positive play and relatively free of fouls, although Drake was penalised on five occasions for using his elbows too much.|$|E
500|$|Later in the 18th century, the French philosopher Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, one of {{the leading}} naturalists of the time, {{suggested}} that what most people referred to as species were really just well-marked varieties, modified from an original form by environmental factors. For example, he believed that lions, tigers, leopards and house cats might all have a common ancestor. He further speculated that the 200 or so species of mammals then known might have descended from as few as 38 original animal forms. Buffon's evolutionary ideas were limited; he believed each of the original forms had arisen through spontaneous generation and that each was shaped by [...] "internal moulds" [...] that limited the amount of change. Buffon's works, Histoire naturelle (1749–1789) and Époques de la nature (1778), containing well-developed theories about a completely materialistic origin for the Earth and his ideas questioning the fixity of species, were extremely influential. Another French philosopher, Denis Diderot, also wrote that living <b>things</b> <b>might</b> have first arisen through spontaneous generation, and that species were always changing through a constant process of experiment where new forms arose and survived or not based on trial and error; an idea that can be considered a partial anticipation of natural selection. Between 1767 and 1792, James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, included in his writings not only the concept that man had descended from primates, but also that, in response to the environment, creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals. Charles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, published Zoonomia (1794–1796) which suggested that [...] "all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament." [...] In his poem Temple of Nature (1803), he described the rise of life from minute organisms living in mud to all of its modern diversity.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the film}} were {{positive}} {{and focused on the}} novel methods used to attract the audience to the theater. The Moving Picture World stated, [...] "A burlesque picture which becomes more thrilling as it proceeds. The convict is supposed to have escaped and the way he is chased and surrounded bodes no good for him. But somehow he manages to elude the steadily increasing army of pursuers until they are gathered around him, when he calmly shows a motion picture announcement, and the reason for all this melee, in which the whole countryside took part, becomes apparent." [...] The requirement that the fleeing [...] "convict" [...] be continually assisted {{as a part of the}} plot may have been lost on The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer. The reviewer writes, [...] "Perhaps, in real life, <b>things</b> <b>might</b> not happen so luckily for the convict unless the carriage, the boat and the automobile were previously arranged for him. Even then, Fate might conceivably have some disagreeable card up her sleeve. In the film, at any rate, everybody bit nicely. They pursued the escaped convict in increasing crowds until he led them to the theatre he was advertising. There they all obligingly bought tickets to the show and, no doubt, enjoyed it hugely. They did if it was as good as the film is. The least interesting sections of the film are the telephone messages exchanged by agitated police officials; but they set off the livelier adventures of the convict with agreeable contrast." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News identified the set up and assistance to [...] "the convict" [...] and states,"In spite of the Thanhouser folk joining in the racket and the peculiar readiness of carriage and automobile and boat to help the gentleman in a costume, not used in this state for some two years, the audience did not 'catch on.' When the revelation came, at the door of the New Rochelle picture show, the theatre rang with laughter. We were all 'stung' and we enjoyed it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alone among Napoleon's marshals, Suchet won his baton by his {{victories}} in Spain.

Even so, General Arthur Wellesley, Marquess Wellington knew that if Suchet's forces intervened in the battles in central and northern Spain, <b>things</b> <b>might</b> go badly for the British army.

2500|$|Cherryh uses {{a writing}} {{technique}} she has variously labeled [...] "very tight limited third person", [...] "intense third person", and [...] "intense internal" [...] voice. In this approach, {{the only things}} the writer narrates are those that the viewpoint character specifically notices or thinks about. If a starship captain arrives at a space station, for example, the narration may not mention important features of the station with which the captain is already familiar, even though these <b>things</b> <b>might</b> {{be of interest to}} the reader, because the captain does not notice them or think about them due to their familiarity. This technique can offer a similar experience to that of reading the viewpoint character's mind—sometimes at great length—and thus it can resemble stream of consciousness narrative.|$|E
