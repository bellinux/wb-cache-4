25|$|The U.S. UPN network {{presented}} two one-hour {{episodes of}} Iron Chef USA hosted by William Shatner around Christmas 2001. These shows were neither a critical nor popular success, {{perhaps because the}} show focused little on cookinga {{major part of the}} Japanese programme. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.|$|E
500|$|Biden {{spoke of}} the fact that he had spent 34 years in the Senate and had been active in many congressional {{committees}} including being the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and formerly holding the post as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. On the campaign trail he touted his years of foreign policy experience particularly in regard to the conflict in Bosnia, which he feels he played a role in ending. Biden stated earlier in his campaign that [...] " [...] truly believe the American public is waiting for leaders to come along who have the experience <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will do to restore America's leadership in the world." [...] At times during his campaign he believed his experience would help him win the Democratic nomination, but when Barack Obama's campaign began to surge with the candidate's emphasis on change, Biden shifted his focus from his experience in politics to his ability for action. He stated during a November 2007 debate, [...] "This [...] is not about experience. It's not about change. It's about action. Who among us is going to be able to, on Day 1, step in and end the war?" ...|$|E

No doubt, they'll try this stunt again." [...] Likewise, Jean Marbella of The Baltimore Sun said, [...] "It's not even that the terrorists have won, it's that wannabe terrorists have won." [...] Margaret Wente of The Globe and Mail said the censorship of [...] "201" [...] could be [...] "the lowest point {{in the history of}} American TV", and that it represented a gravitation toward fear in a post-September 11 attacks world. Los Angeles Times columnist Patrick Goldstein said there were [...] "no easy answers" [...] and that he was not surprised Comedy Central took the threat seriously, but added, [...] "in a democracy, artists and political satirists should be allowed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believe, even if it offends some of its audience". Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant suggested Comedy Central actually drew more attention to the Muhammad controversy, not less, by censoring the episode. UCLA School of Law Professor Eugene Volokh said Comedy Central's actions risk empowering other extremists: ...|$|E

500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 26, 2009, Megan Parris {{argued that}} not only was the show scripted, but that {{producers}} bullied contestants into saying things to the camera that contestants did not want to say. [...] "There's nothing real about it," [...] she said of the show's trademark [...] "confessionals," [...] in which contestants talk to the camera about the latest goings-on. [...] "It is scripted," [...] she said. [...] "They basically will call you names, berate you, curse at you until they get you <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want you to say."

25|$|The {{underground}} {{scenes of}} various genres are very lively in Finland {{at the moment}} {{and a lot of}} bands and artists defy the genre-limits.

Of bands such as Profeetta ja UMU it is very hard <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>what</b> genre <b>they</b> represent.|$|R

Those who returned saw nothing of those unlucky enough to be left behind, only ruins, many water lizards, and most disturbingly, the missing idol. Ever since then, Bokrug remained the chief god in the land of Mnar.|$|R
2500|$|From this Letter {{we learn}} that Henry VIII sent Cromwell money while in the Tower and {{it appears to have}} given him more than a hope of life. Moreover, Thomas Cromwell was granted the {{extraordinary}} 'privilege' of being told of the charges against him and who his accusers were. When Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk was himself arrested in 1546, he [...] "prayed the lords to intercede with the king, that his accusers might be brought face to face, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had against him and he did not doubt but it should appear he was falsely accused. He desired to have no more favour than Cromwell had, he himself being present when Cromwell was examined." [...] He added that Cromwell [...] "desired, if he might not see his accusers, that he might at least know what the matters were and if he did not answer truly to every point, he desired not to live an hour longer. He had always been pursued by great enemies about the king so that his fidelity was tried like gold." ...|$|E
2500|$|In this book, hooks {{combines}} {{her personal}} life experiences, along with philosophical and psychological ideas, to shape her thesis and discuss her main concepts. She criticizes {{the way in which}} love is used in today's society. To further explain, how we use the word without much meaning, when referring to how much we like or enjoy our favorite ice cream, color, or game. Hooks is very disturbed by the fact that our culture has lost the true meaning of love, and believes it is because we have no shared definition. For this reason, the first chapter of her book primarily focuses on what she thinks the definition of love is, which she explains includes components such as care, affection, trust, respect, honesty, communication, and commitment. She proposes that if we all came to the agreement that love is a verb rather than a noun, then we would all be happier. Hooks believes love is more of an interactive process. It is not about what we just feel, but more about what we do. She states, [...] "So many people think that it's enough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> feel, even if their actions do not correspond to what they are feeling" [...] ("A Chat"). Bell hooks strongly clarifies why society needs to adopt a universal definition of love.|$|E

2500|$|Along with Poe, Baudelaire {{named the}} arch-reactionary Joseph de Maistre as his maître à penser and adopted {{increasingly}} aristocratic views. In his journals, he wrote, [...] "There is no form of rational and assured government save an aristocracy. A monarchy or a republic, based upon democracy, are equally absurd and feeble. The immense nausea of advertisements. There are but three beings worthy of respect: the priest, the warrior and the poet. To know, {{to kill and}} to create.

30|$|Without {{access to}} ICTs, {{women and girls}} lose the {{opportunity}} of having their voices heard especially on online platforms, as ICT promotes personal development and makes women feel safer and empowered. We should listen to women and girls and <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think is safe access to ICT and design ICT-facilitated programs based on their feedback rather than designing ICT tools and sharing them with communities without first considering safe access measures.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} foolishness was a {{frequently}} used trope in the pre-Reformation period to legitimise criticism, as also used by Erasmus in his Praise of Folly and Martin Luther in his [...] "An den christlichen Adel deutscher Nation von des christlichen Standes Besserung" [...] (Address to the Christian Nobility). Court fools were allowed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> much <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted; by writing {{his work in}} the voice of the fool, Brant could legitimise his criticism of the church.|$|R

40|$|In {{this book}} chapter, Professor Berger argues for {{thoughtful}} metaphor-making and storytelling in legal writing. Exploring legal rhetoric {{with an eye}} for gender justice, she argues metaphor and narrative shape perspective and ask the reader to join the writer in the imaginative work of seeing one thing as another. The same shift in perspective that leads to re-conception—a shift that takes advantage of metaphor and narrative’s ability <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> only <b>they</b> can say—is <b>what</b> writers aim to achieve when they use metaphor and narrative for feminist and social justice advocacy...|$|R

50|$|For {{the first}} time, the opening {{speakers}} noted, {{not a single}} official was present, whether from the local, republican or federal authorities. No Orthodox priests were in attendance and, another first, there was no solemn religious procession led by the cross. (The Ukrainians had ceased coming to Sandarmokh several years earlier.) This was an opportunity, suggested Dmitriev and Flige, for people <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just <b>what</b> <b>they</b> thought.

40|$|Intellectualists {{tell us that}} {{a person}} who knows how to do {{something}} therein knows a proposition.

When the two are considered together, a realistic conception of human agency can inform the understanding of some infinitives: the argument need not turn on what semanticists have had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about (<b>what</b> <b>they</b> call) ‘the subjects of infinitival clauses’...|$|R
