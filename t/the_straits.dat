5|$|It seems {{relatively}} {{certain that}} the Persian fleet was sent out to block the exit from <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> the evening before the battle. Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> at nightfall, planning to catch the Allies as they fled. However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting Herodotus's version. There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the Persians simply blocked the exit to <b>the</b> <b>Straits,</b> and then entered <b>the</b> <b>straits</b> in daylight; or that they entered <b>the</b> <b>straits</b> and positioned themselves for battle during the night. Regardless of when they attempted it, {{it seems likely that}} the Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east-west alignment (blocking the exit), they came round to a north-south alignment (see diagram). The Persian fleet seems to have been formed into three ranks of ships (according to Aeschylus); with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo, the Ionian contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre.|$|E

5|$|The {{status of}} a British outpost in Singapore seemed {{initially}} in doubt as the Dutch government soon protested to Britain for violating the Netherlands' sphere of influence. But as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 cemented the status of Singapore as a British possession, carving up the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers with the area north of <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> of Malacca, including Singapore, falling under Britain's sphere of influence. In 1826, Singapore was grouped by the British East India Company together with Penang and Malacca to form <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> Settlements, administered by the British East India Company.

5|$|After the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, {{coupled with the}} fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaiian to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> of Magellan in late April. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route. In October 1915, landslides closed the Panama Canal and all American-Hawaiian ships, including American, returned to <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> of Magellan route again.|$|E
5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring the}} Persian fleet to battle again, {{in the hope that}} a victory would prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. The Persian king Xerxes was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of <b>the</b> <b>Straits,</b> the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized.

5|$|At 9:50 {{and under}} heavy {{pressure}} from the Greek fleet, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, {{and headed for the}} safety of <b>the</b> <b>straits.</b> The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. Barbaros Hayreddin, Turgut Reis, and Mesudiye took several hits during the battle, though only Barbaros Hayreddin was significantly damaged. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles. When they approached <b>the</b> <b>straits,</b> Mesudiye and Âsâr-ı Tevfik took up positions to cover the withdrawal of the damaged pre-dreadnoughts. The ships reached port by 13:00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship Resit Paşa.|$|E

5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from <b>the</b> <b>Straits.</b> If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} exit from <b>the</b> <b>straits,</b> in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E

5|$|Herodotus recounts that, {{according}} to the Athenians, as the battle began the Corinthians hoisted their sails and began sailing away from the battle, northwards up <b>the</b> <b>straits.</b> However, {{he also says that}} other Greeks denied this story.

Another possibility (not exclusive of the former) is that the departure of the Corinthians triggered the final approach of the Persians, suggesting as it did that the Allied fleet was disintegrating.

5|$|The Balkan League, {{of which}} Greece was a member, {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire in October 1912. Two months later, the Ottoman fleet attacked the Greek navy, {{in an attempt to}} disrupt the naval blockade surrounding the Dardanelles. The Ottoman fleet, which included Turgut Reis, Barbaros Hayreddin, the outdated ironclad battleships Mesudiye and Âsâr-ı Tevfik, nine destroyers, and six torpedo boats, sortied from the Dardanelles at 9:30. The smaller ships remained at the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>straits</b> while the battleships sailed north, remaining near to the coast. The Greek flotilla, which included the armored cruiser Georgios Averof and Psara and her sisters, had been sailing from the island of Imbros to the patrol line outside <b>the</b> <b>straits.</b> When the Ottomans were sighted, the Greeks altered course to the northeast in order to block the advance of their opponents. In the ensuing Naval Battle of Elli, the Ottoman ships opened fire first, at 9:50, from a range of about 15,000yards; the Greeks returned fire ten minutes later, by which time the range had decreased significantly to 8,500yards. At 10:04, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, and steamed for the safety of <b>the</b> <b>straits</b> in a disorganized withdrawal. Within an hour, the routed Ottoman ships had withdrawn into the Dardanelles.|$|E

40|$|Distinct diurnal {{variation}} of precipitation around <b>the</b> <b>Strait</b> of Malacca was elucidated using The TRMM rainfall data and non-hydrostatic mesoscale model. The TRMM rainfall data shows {{the contrast of}} sea and land surface diurnal rainfall, in the early-morning and evening, respectively. The climatological model study in a typical season suggests the following mechanism of the diurnal precipitation system. 1) During daytime, a deep convections are induced by convergence of the up-slope winds caused by solar radiative heating over the mountains in the both side of <b>the</b> <b>Strait,</b> while divergence is clear above <b>the</b> <b>strait.</b> This convection should produce evening rainfall. 2) In evening, cold air mass caused by evaporation of rain-drop begins to blow toward <b>the</b> <b>strait</b> in lower atmos-phere. This cold flow transports water vapor to <b>the</b> <b>strait</b> associating with a down-slope wind. 3) In the midnight, these two cold moist air flows converge above <b>the</b> <b>strait,</b> making a precipitation along <b>the</b> <b>strait.</b> <b>The</b> shape of terrain, like a deep basin, should strengthen the convergence in a layer below 900 hPa above <b>the</b> <b>strait.</b> Thus, this diurnal rainfall is formed by the diurnal convective latent heat flux and the shape of <b>the</b> <b>Strait</b> of Malacca between these two mountainous islands. 2...|$|R

However, since Venice could not spare forces to occupy these places, these raids gained the Republic nothing of substance. On the Ottoman side, Köprülü Mehmed ordered the construction of two new forts, Sedd el Bahr ("Rampart of the Sea") and Kilid Bahr ("Key of the Sea"), at the European shore of the entrance of the Dardanelles, to prohibit the Venetians from entering <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> again.|$|E
