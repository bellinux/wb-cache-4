40|$|Once {{released}} to the environment, pesticides may be degraded by abiotic and biotic processes. While parent compounds are assessed in detail in many regulatory schemes, the requirements {{for the assessment of}} <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> are less well developed. This study was therefore performed to explore the relationships between the toxicity of <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> and their parent compounds and to develop a pragmatic approach for use in the risk assessment of <b>transformation</b> <b>products.</b> Data were obtained on the properties and ecotoxicity of <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> arising {{from a wide range of}} pesticides. Generally, <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> were less toxic to fish, daphnids, and algae than their parent compound. In instances where a product was more toxic, the increase in toxicity could be explained by either (1) the presence of a pesticide toxicophore; (2) the fact that the product is the active part of a propesticide; (3) the product is accumulated to a greater extent than the parent compound; or (4) the product has a more potent mode of action than the parent. On the basis of the findings, an approach has been proposed to estimate the ecotoxicity of <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> based on chemical structure and data on the toxicity of the parent compound. The assessments can be performed at an early stage in the risk assessment process to identify those substances that require further testing. ...|$|R
40|$|Even {{though the}} {{environmental}} occurrence of pesticide <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> is well established, ecotoxicological data for <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> are often lacking. Therefore, it {{remains an open}} question for regulators how to handle <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> in the process of authorization and risk assessment. <b>Transformation</b> <b>products</b> may (1) possess a similar mode of toxic action as the parent compound, (2) exhibit unexpected effects towards non-target organisms or (3) contribute to overall mixture toxicity through baseline toxicity even if the specific activity of the parent compound is lost. In the present study, a systematic and integrated approach is presented to differentiate between these three options with the goal of identifying <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> that significantly add to the risk posed by the parent compound. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and a toxic ratio (TR) analysis were used to evaluate the toxicity and mode of toxic action of the <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> relative to the parent compound. In addition, mixture toxicity experiments were used as diagnostic tools to underpin the mode of action analysis and to elucidate whether the <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> possess a similar risk potential as the parent compound. As an illustrative example, the phenylurea herbicide diuron was chosen since a sound basis of ecotoxicological data was available not only for diuron itself but also for most of its <b>transformation</b> <b>products.</b> Effects were investigated using the most sensitive species, algae, and the non-target organism Daphnia magna, for which a previous QSAR-analysis of literature data suggested a specific hazard. In the present study the primary <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> 1 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 3 -methlyurea (DCPMU), 3 -(3 -chlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (MCPDMU), and 1 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) urea (DCPU) were identified as specific toxicants in algae, but as baseline toxicants in daphnids. The subsequent loss of the methylurea group during degradation, which formed 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, led to a clear detoxification in algae but to an increase in toxicity in daphnids. It could be shown that 3, 4 -dichloroaniline acted as baseline toxicant in algae, but showed a specific mode of toxic action in daphnids. Mixture toxicity experiments confirmed this mode of action analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{application}} of pesticides during normal agricultural practice these compounds can degrade to form transformation products. When assessing the risks posed by pesticides {{it is important to}} include any additional risks posed by these compounds. Current guidance within the EU suggests that data requirements for transformation products during the risk assessment do not necessarily need to be addressed with experimental studies but alternative techniques can be explored and used. Therefore the aim of this research was to investigate and develop pragmatic approaches for assessing the fate and effects of transformation products in the absence of experimentally determined data. Approaches designed to provide information on the physico-chemical properties, environmental parameters, ecotoxicology and toxicology of pesticide transformation products are explored and evaluated, and recommendations made on how to obtain the most appropriate estimates of these factors. Hydrophobicity, dissociation constant, soil sorption, daphnid aquatic ecotoxicology and rat oral lethality can all be estimated with confidence. Moreover, approaches were developed to I) indicate whether a <b>transformation</b> <b>product</b> may exhibit pesticidal activity and subsequently estimate its acute aquatic ecotoxicity in the absence of experimental data, 2) combine well known techniques and experimental data to obtain estimates of <b>transformation</b> <b>product</b> mutagenicity with limited risk of obtaining false negatives and 3) prioritise transformation products of most concern to drinking water supplies and its consumers.

Hypostoichiometric Fe-Pd binary alloys (35 - 45 at % Pd) were {{severely}} deformed (> 90 %) {{and subsequently}} aged to induce concomitant recrystallization, precipitation, and ordering.

An application of SDZ together with manure resulted in lower peak values of the C- 14 BTCs slightly lower amount of eluted mass. In the experiments with manure, the C- 14 concentrations {{in the of the}} soil columns were higher, probably due to the filtration of manure particles onto which SDZ or its <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> were sorbed.

30|$|<b>Transformation</b> <b>products</b> {{can be as}} or {{even more}} {{persistent}} than their parent compounds and thus must be included in chemical assessment. However, the regulatory frameworks for substances differ {{with respect to the}} inclusion of metabolites or <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> in PBT identification. For PPPs, the consideration of metabolites in the context of PBT identification has been controversially discussed, as PPPs Regulation 1107 / 2009 [2] does not address this issue precisely and only refers to the relevance of metabolites in a general sense (Art. 3 (32) Annex II point 3.3). However, a current proposal envisages excluding metabolites in the process of PBT identification and in the identification of candidates for substitution (i.e. substances that meet two of the three criteria) [11]. REACH requires that registration documents for chemicals produced or imported in excess of 100  t/a include information about metabolites and <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> [54]. They are to be considered in PBT identification if they exceed 0.1 % of the substance weight [9, 26]. For both human and veterinary medicinal <b>products,</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> > 10 % are considered to be ‘relevant’ and thus included in risk assessment as well as in PBT assessment. In the assessment of biocides, major metabolites (≥ 10 % or ≥ 5 % at two consecutive sampling points or maximum not reached but ≥ 5 % of the active substance at the final time point) are considered in PBT identification and minor metabolites only if data are available or there is any reason for concern. It is questionable whether relevance can be defined in terms of any percentage. Since humans and the environment should be protected from exposure to PBT and vPvB substances, the same criteria should apply to metabolites or <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> as to the parent compounds. We suggest that in all regulatory frameworks, metabolites and <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> {{should be included in the}} assessment.|$|R

There was {{a dramatic change in}} the distribution of chl-a and its <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> between the pre-sinking period, when the average chl-a concentration integrated over the upper 50 m was 68 ± 36 mg m− 2, and the post-sinking period, when it was 30 ± 11 mg m− 2. Before the diatom bloom left the euphotic zone (pre-sinking), suspended particles contained a considerably higher percentage of pheophorbide-a and other chl-a <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> (27 %) than during the post-sinking period (10 %).
