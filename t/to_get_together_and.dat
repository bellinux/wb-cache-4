500|$|In 2009, Vig and Manson met at {{the funeral}} of Pablo Castelaz, the six-year-old son of Dangerbird Records founder Jeff Castelaz, and had a {{conversation}} where, according to Vig, [...] "we felt like we had some unfinished business, and we realized how precious life is and how important music has been in our lives." [...] Manson suggested calling guitarists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> write some songs. One week later, the group informally convened in Los Angeles, where they laughed, drank, and reminisced of the old days, leaving behind the tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup; they set up their equipment and [...] "started fucking around." [...] "We were all pleased to notice {{on the first day}} there just didn't seem to be any personal tensions," [...] Vig recalled. [...] "Enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated. So it was easy. There was no one telling us what to do. We weren't signed to a label. We were between managers. So we made this on our own terms." [...] In that session, the group wrote the song [...] "Battle In Me".|$|E
2500|$|While {{the origin}} of the term [...] "Claymates" [...] is unknown, Aiken trademarked the term. While in Los Angeles in September 2006 for a CD signing and {{appearance}} on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Aiken talked with Jann Carl of Entertainment Tonight about the names various sub-groups have given themselves: [...] "Claysians" [...] (Asian fans), [...] "Claynadians" [...] (Canadian fans), [...] "Clayropeans" [...] (European fans) and [...] "Claydawgs" [...] (male fans). She then teased him about having his own [...] "Clay Nation". At the CD signing, two young fans asked Clay to autograph their shoulderblades and then went to the local tattoo parlor to make them permanent; later that day on Jimmy Kimmel Live! they were brought on stage to show the tattoos. Although some of his fans have been criticized at times by the media as being obsessive, he defends the group as a whole. When Kimmel said to Aiken that his fans were [...] "crazy", Aiken stated that they were merely [...] "enthusiastic". In 2003, in anticipation of the release of Measure of a Man, fans all over the country decided <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> hold parties to celebrate the release of the CD and purchase copies at midnight. In 2006, for the release of A Thousand Different Ways, release parties were held in more than 80 cities in the United States, Canada, and Singapore.|$|E

60|$|The {{collectors}} will doubtless cry {{out that}} such a law would be a monstrous injustice, and an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject; that {{there is really no}} more harm in collecting birds and their eggs than in collecting old prints, Guatemalan postage stamps, samplers, and first editions of minor poets; that to compel them to give up their treasures, which have cost them infinite pains and thousands of pounds <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> to abandon the pursuit in which their happiness is placed, would be worse than confiscation and downright tyranny; that the private collectors cannot properly be described as law-breakers and injurious persons, since they count among their numbers hundreds of country gentlemen of position, professional men (including clergymen), noblemen, magistrates, and justices of the peace, and distinguished naturalists--all honourable men.|$|E
6000|$|This sharp raillery had {{no effect}} upon Fucarandono: he replied to the lord with so much impudence and haughtiness, that the king, whose {{patience}} was tired with so much insolence, caused him to be put out of the hall, saying, [...] "That his coat of a Bonza was the only protection of his life." [...] The affront which Fucarandono had received, was interpreted by the Bonzas as an injury done to the gods, and as such they declared it to the people, saying, [...] "That religion was profaned, and that the king, the court, and the whole nation, had incurred the wrath of heaven." [...] Upon which pretence they shut up the temples, and would neither offer sacrifice nor accept of alms. The multitude, which had already been disposed to rise, began <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> had certainly taken arms, if the king, by good management, had not somewhat calmed their spirits.|$|E
60|$|We {{see that}} we was making trouble, so we went up again about a mile, to the cool weather, and watched them from there.

We poked along, looking down at them with the glasses, and by and by we see a big sand mound, and something like people {{the other side of}} it, and there was something like a man laying on top of the mound that raised his head up every now and then, and seemed to be watching the caravan or us, we didn't know which. As the caravan got nearer, he sneaked down {{on the other side and}} rushed to the other men and horses--for that is what they was--and we see them mount in a hurry; and next, here they come, like a house afire, some with lances and some with long guns, and all of them yelling the best they could.|$|E

You've heard of Dwight Partridge, haven't you? Well, this guy's his son. Every one knows that Dwight Partridge was working on an {{explosive}} when he died, and here's his son comes along with a test-tube full of stuff which he says could blow this city to bits. What's the answer? The boy's been working on the old man's dope. From what I've seen of him, I guess there wasn't much more to be done on it, or he wouldn't have done it. He's pretty well dead from the neck up, as far as I can see. But that doesn't alter the fact that he's got the stuff and that you and I have got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> make a deal. If we don't, I'm not saying you mightn't gum my game, just as I might gum yours; but where's the sense in that? It only means taking extra chances. Whereas if we sit in together, there's enough in it for both of us. You know as well as I do that there's a dozen markets which'll bid against each other for stuff like that Partridgite. If you're worrying about Burke giving you a square deal, forget it. I'll fix Burke. He'll treat you nice, all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|We played robber now {{and then}} about a month, and then I resigned. All the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but only just pretended. We used to hop {{out of the woods}} and go {{charging}} down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs [...] "ingots," [...] and he called the turnips and stuff [...] "julery," [...] and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn't see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>together),</b> <b>and</b> then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand [...] "sumter" [...] mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut. I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn't we see them, then? He said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.|$|E
