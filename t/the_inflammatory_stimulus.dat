50|$|Upon {{contact with}} PAMPs, tissue macrophages and mastocytes release {{vasoactive}} amines such as histamine and serotonin, {{as well as}} eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 to remodel the local vasculature. Macrophages and endothelial cells release nitric oxide. These mediators vasodilate and permeabilize the blood vessels, which results in the net distribution of blood plasma from the vessel into the tissue space. The increased collection of fluid into the tissue causes it to swell (edema). This exuded tissue fluid contain various antimicrobial mediators from the plasma such as complement, lysozyme, antibodies, which can immediately deal damage to microbes, and opsonise the microbes {{in preparation for the}} cellular phase. If <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> is a lacerating wound, exuded platelets, coagulants, plasmin and kinins can clot the wounded area and provide haemostasis in the first instance. These clotting mediators also provide a structural staging framework at the inflammatory tissue site {{in the form of a}} fibrin lattice - as would construction scaffolding at a construction site - for the purpose of aiding phagocytic debridement and wound repair later on. Some of the exuded tissue fluid is also funnelled by lymphatics to the regional lymph nodes, flushing bacteria along to start the recognition and attack phase of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{natural history}} of Crohn's disease follows a path of {{progression}} from an inflammatory to a fibrostenosing disease, with most patients requiring surgical resection of fibrotic strictures. Potent antiinflammatory therapies reduce inflammation but {{do not appear to}} alter the {{natural history of}} intestinal fibrosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between intestinal inflammation and fibrogenesis and the impact of a very early “top‐down” interventional approach on fibrosis in vivo. Methods: In this study we removed <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> from the Salmonella typhimurium mouse model of intestinal fibrosis by eradicating the S. typhimurium infection with levofloxacin at sequential timepoints during the infection. We evaluated the effect of this elimination of <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> on the natural history of inflammation and fibrosis as determined by gross pathology, histopathology, mRNA expression, and protein expression. Results: Fibrogenesis is preceded by inflammation. Delayed eradication of <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> by antibiotic treatment represses inflammation without preventing fibrosis. Early intervention significantly ameliorates but does not completely prevent subsequent fibrosis. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that intestinal fibrosis develops despite removal of an inflammatory stimulus and elimination of inflammation. Early intervention ameliorates but does not abolish subsequent fibrosis, suggesting that fibrosis, once initiated, is self‐propagating, suggesting that a very early top‐down interventional approach may have the most impact on fibrostenosing disease.

50|$|Measurement of acute-phase proteins, {{especially}} C-reactive protein, is {{a useful}} marker of inflammation in both medical and veterinary clinical pathology. It correlates with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), however not always directly.

This protein will therefore remain higher for longer despite removal of <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimuli.</b> In contrast, C-reactive protein (with a half-life of 6-8 hours) rises rapidly and can quickly return to within the normal range if treatment is employed. For example, in active systemic lupus erythematosus, one may find a raised ESR but normal C-reactive protein. They may also indicate liver failure.|$|R
40|$|The {{articular}} cartilage lesions represent {{one of the}} major unsolved problems in the orthopaedic surgery. This is because {{articular cartilage}} has a limited capacity of self-repair following trauma. The biological response of cartilage to injury varies in the different traumatic events. When a lesion is confined in the superficial layer, the repair process does not occur, as <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> is too weak to stimulate the resident chondrocytes surrounding the lesion and, consequently, the defect persists. However, when a full-thickness lesion occurs reaching the vessels of the sub-chondral bone, <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> is more important, a bleeding from the bone marrow occurs allowing the access of growth factors and reparative cells in the lesion site. These cells are mainly fibroblasts and in a low percentage mesenchymal stem cells. As a result, the newly formed reparative tissue differs from the normal hyaline cartilage in term of morphology, biochemical composition and biomechanical properties. For these reasons it is called fibrocartilage. The aim of this chapter is to review the morphology, composition and biomechanical function of normal cartilage. Moreover, an analysis of the response of the cartilage tissue to the different traumas is presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Vascular calcification, long {{thought to}} result from passive degeneration, {{involves}} a complex, regulated process of biomineralization resembling osteogenesis. Evidence indicates that proteins controlling bone mineralization are also involved in the regulation of vascular calcification. Artery wall cells grown in culture are induced to become osteogenic by inflammatory and atherogenic stimuli. Furthermore, osteoclast-like cells are found in calcified atherosclerotic plaques, and active resorption of ectopic vascular calcification has been demonstrated. In general, soft tissue calcification arises in areas of chronic inflammation, possibly functioning as a barrier limiting the spread of <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Atherosclerotic calcification may be one example of this process, in which oxidized lipids are <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Calcification is widely used as a clinical indicator of atherosclerosis. It progresses nonlinearly with time, following a sigmoid-shaped curve. The relationship between calcification and clinical events likely relates to mechanical instability introduced by calcified plaque at its interface with softer, noncalcified plaque. In general, as calcification proceeds, interface surface area increases initially, but eventually decreases as plaques coalesce. This phenomenon may account for reports of less calcification in unstable plaque. Vascular calcification is exacerbated in certain clinical entities, including diabetes, menopause, and osteoporosis. Mechanisms linking them {{must be considered in}} clinical decisions. For example, treatments for osteoporosis may have unanticipated effects on vascular calcification; the converse also applies.

40|$|Negative Energy Balance (NEB) is {{considered}} to increase susceptibility to mastitis. The objective {{of this study was}} to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms by comparing transcriptomic profiles following NEB and a concomitant mammary inflammation. Accordingly, we performed RNAseq analysis of blood cells in energy-restricted ewes and control-diet ewes at four different time points before and after intra mammary challenge with phlogogenic ligands. Blood leucocytes responded to NEB by shutting down lipid-generating processes, including cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, probably under transcriptional control of SREBF 1. Furthermore, fatty acid oxidation was activated and glucose oxidation and transport inhibited in response to energy restriction. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to energy restriction, 64 genes were also differential in response to <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> challenge. Opposite response included the activation of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis during <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> challenge. Moreover, activation of glucose oxidation and transport coupled with the increase of plasma glucose concentration in response to <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> suggested a preferential utilization of glucose as the energy source during this stress.

Consensus is building that the therapeutic effects {{are due to}} anti-inflammatory, rather than anti-microbial activities, but the mode of action is likely complex. To gain insights into how the macrolide azithromycin (AZT) modulates inflammatory responses in airways, well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelia were exposed to AZT alone, an inflammatory stimulus consisting of soluble factors from cystic fibrosis airways, or AZT followed by <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus.</b> RNA microarrays were conducted to identify global and specific gene expression changes. Analysis of gene expression changes revealed that the AZT treatment alone altered the gene profile of the cells, primarily by significantly increasing the expression of lipid/cholesterol genes and decreasing the expression of cell cycle/mitosis genes. The increase in cholesterol biosynthetic genes was confirmed by increased filipin staining, an index of free cholesterol, after AZT treatment. AZT also affected genes with inflammatory annotations, but the effect was variable (both up- and downregulation) and gene specific. AZT pretreatment prevented the up-regulation of some genes, such as MUC 5 AC and MMP 9, triggered by <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus,</b> but the up-regulation of other inflammatory genes, e. g., cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin- 8, was not affected.

40|$|Inflammation is {{associated}} with every health condition, and {{is an important component}} of many pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases. Circulating levels of soluble endoglin {{have been shown to be}} higher in the serum of patients with cardiovascular diseases with a significant inflammatory component. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implication of circulating soluble endoglin in the inflammatory response. For this purpose, a transgenic mouse expressing human soluble endoglin (sEng+) was employed, and three different inflammatory approaches were used to mimic inflammatory conditions in different tissues. This study shows that control sEng+ mice have a normal inflammatory state. The lung and kidney injury induced by the inflammatory agents was reduced in sEng+ mice, especially the intra-alveolar and kidney infiltrates, suggesting a possible reduction in inflammation induced by soluble endoglin. To deepen into this possible effect, the leukocyte number in the bronchoalveolar lavage and air pouch lavage was evaluated and a significant reduction of neutrophil infiltration in LPS-treated lungs and ischemic kidneys from sEng+ with respect to WT mice was observed. Additionally, the mechanisms through which soluble endoglin prevents inflammation were studied. We found that in sEng+ animals the increment of proinflammatory cytokines, TNFα, IL 1 β and IL 6, induced by <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> was reduced. Soluble endoglin also prevents the augmented adhesion molecules, ICAM, VCAM and E-selectin induced by <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus.</b> In addition, vascular permeability increased by inflammatory agents was also reduced by soluble endoglin.

Migration of NPs was observed after injecting an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> into <b>the</b> area of the fimbria and transplanting enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) -labeled NPs into the dentate gyrus of cultured hippocampal slices. Three to 7 d after transplantation, EGFP–NPs in control slices showed little tendency to migrate and had differentiated into neurons and glia. In contrast, in slices injected with <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimuli,</b> EGFP–NPs migrated toward the site of the injection.

We showed that these <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> increased <b>the</b> synthesis of numerous chemokines and cytokines by hippocampal slices. When EGFP–NPs from CC chemokine receptor CCR 2 knock-out mice were transplanted into slices, they exhibited little migration toward sites of inflammation. Similarly, wild-type EGFP–NPs exhibited little migration toward inflammatory sites when transplanted into slices prepared from monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) knock-out mice. These data indicate that factors secreted by sites of neuroinflammation are attractive to neural progenitors and suggest that chemokines such as MCP- 1 {{play an important role in}} this process...|$|R

40|$|Macrophages are an {{important}} source of the lipid mediators, arachidonic acid metabolites and platelet-activating factor (PAF), produced during inflammation. Studies were undertaken to identify the phospholipid substrates that can serve as a source of arachidonic acid in human monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and opsonized zymosan (OpZ). Since PAF is derived from 1 -alkyl- 2 -acyl-glycerophosphocholine, it was of interest to determine if this phospholipid precursor could also serve as a source of arachidonic acid. The day- 5 macrophages incorporated 38 % of the available [3 H]arachidonic acid into lipid by 4 h, 54 % of which was in phospholipid [phosphatidylcholine (PC) greater than phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) greater than phosphatidylinositol (PI) ]. The proportion of label incorporated into ether-linked PC and PE increased with time. After prelabelling with [3 H]arachidonic acid, the effect of stimuli on the redistribution of label within phospholipids was followed. Without stimulus there was a loss of label from PC, PI and phosphatidic acid by 3 h, but an increase of label in PE. The [3 H]arachidonic acid that was lost from PC in the absence of stimulus was derived solely from the 1 -acyl-linked species of PC, whereas an increase in label occurred in the 1 -alkyl-linked species of PC. By contrast, LPS stimulation resulted in a preferential, dose-dependent loss of label from PC and PI, which was maximal between 1 and 3 h after adding the LPS. In addition, LPS induced a 35 % decrease in the molar quantity of PI in the macrophages but had no effect on the quantity of PC, PE or phosphatidylserine. Stimulation with OpZ also resulted in a loss of label, mainly from PC and PI. Of the total label lost from PC in response to LPS or OpZ, approx. 50 % was derived from the 1 -alkyl-linked species. The results suggest that phospholipase C- and phospholipase A 2 -mediated mechanisms for arachidonic acid release are activated in human macrophages exposed to <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> LPS and OpZ. In addition, 1 -alkyl-linked PC can serve as a source of arachidonic acid and as a precursor for PAF production in the stimulated macrophages...|$|R

The overall hypothesis was an inflammatory stimulus will alter the ontogeny of L-carnitine homeostasis pathways and this depends upon when <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> occurs in postnatal development. The objective {{was to investigate the}} potential effect of inflammation on carnitine transporter expression in different age groups of neonates and evaluation of effect of inflammation on ontogeny and activity of enzymes involved in carnitine biosynthesis and whether this differs depending upon when in postnatal development <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> occurs. Rat pups at postnatal day 3, 7, and 14 received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose known to cause a febrile reaction in rat neonates. L-Carnitine homeostasis pathways underwent significant ontogenesis during postnatal development in the rat. LPS administration caused a significant decrease in free L-carnitine levels in serum and heart tissue and a decrease in mRNA expression levels of the high affinity carnitine transporter, Octn 2, in kidney, heart and intestine at all postnatal ages. Furthermore, significant decreases in mRNA expression levels of key enzymes involved in carnitine biosynthesis was observed, while an increase in carnitine palmitoyltransferase mRNA levels were observed at all postnatal ages. Reductions in butyrobetaine hydroxylase mRNA expression were paralleled by reductions in enzyme activity only at postnatal day 3 and 7. Heart creatine phosphate levels were deceased significantly in LPS treated groups in all postnatal ages; however, ADP and ATP levels were unaffected. Collectively, this research provided experimental evidence for a significant effect of inflammation on changes in L-carnitine homeostasis maturation in early neonatal stages.

Forward simulation of the parameter ensembles successfully captured experimental features and predicted that systemically activated circulating neutrophils display impaired migration to the tissue and neutrophil sequestration in the lung, consequently contributing to tissue damage and mortality. Principal component and multiple regression analyses of the parameter ensembles estimated from survivor and non-survivor cohorts provide insight into pathologic mechanisms dictating outcome in sepsis. Furthermore, the model was extended to incorporate hypothetical mechanisms by which immune modulation using extracorporeal blood purification results in improved outcome in septic rats. Simulations identified a sub-population (about 18 % of the treated population) tha...|$|E
40|$|Pre-eclampsia {{is a major}} {{disorder}} of human pregnancy, which may have an immunological basis. It is a disease of two stages. The first stage concerns the relative failure of early trophoblast invasion and remodelling of the spiral arteries, leading to a poor blood supply to the placenta, exposing it to oxidative stress. The inadequate trophoblast invasion may result from decreased expression of human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) leading to an abnormal interaction with decidual natural killer (NK) cells, which are believed {{to play a major}} role in these processes through the production of immunoregulatory cytokines and angiogenic factors. Recent evidence suggests that the interaction between trophoblast human leukocyte antigen-C (HLA-C) molecules and decidual NK cell receptors may be the point at which the apparent partner specificity of the disease originates. The second stage is the maternal syndrome, which is characterized by a generalized systemic inflammatory response involving both leukocytes and endothelium. <b>The</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> is believed to come from the placenta. In pre-eclampsia, placental oxidative stress may lead to increased shedding of apoptotic and/or necrotic syncytiotrophoblast debris into the maternal circulation. There is evidence that such trophoblast debris interacts with maternal leukocytes and endothelial cells to stimulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which could then trigger the maternal disease...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to better {{understand}} the cellular origin of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and to investigate the effects of the CETP inhibitor anacetrapib on the development of atherosclerosis. First, we investigated the specific characteristics of hepatic macrophages that express CETP. Our data clearly indicated that in the liver, CETP is exclusively expressed by F 4 / 80 +Ly 6 C-Clec 4 f+Vsig 4 + macrophages that represent resident, rather than immature macrophages. Next, we showed that the HDL response to <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> lipopolysaccharide is mediated by hepatic macrophages via down regulation of CETP expression in the liver that causes an increase in the level of HDL-C. In the second part of this thesis, we examined the effects and mechanism of pharmacological inhibition of CETP by anacetrapib on the development of atherosclerosis. We concluded that anacetrapib mainly decreases atherosclerotic lesion development via a reduction of non-HDL-C. Finally, we concluded that anacetrapib reduces (V) LDL-C by increasing hepatic remnant clearance via two mechanisms: 1) inhibition of CETP activity, resulting in remodelled VLDL particles that are more susceptible to hepatic clearance, and 2) a CETP-independent reduction in plasma PCSK 9 level that has the potential to increase LDL receptor-mediated hepatic remnant clearance...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies using}} intravital {{microscopy}} in a {{sickle cell disease}} (SCD) mouse model suggest that adherent white blood cells (WBCs) {{play a key role}} in vaso-occlusion by capturing circulating red blood cells (RBCs) in venules. Commercial intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) given before <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> increased microcirculatory blood flow and survival. To mimic the clinical situation in which SCD patients seek medical attention after the onset of symptoms, we developed an in vivo model in which the therapeutic intervention (eg, IVIG) was administered after in <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> challenge. In this setting, IVIG rapidly (< 10 minutes) reduced adherent leukocyte numbers and dramatically inhibited interactions between RBCs and WBCs, resulting in improved microcirculatory blood flow and survival of sickle cell “Berkeley” mice. Longer survival correlated positively with blood flow (P =. 001) and negatively with the number of adherent leukocytes (P =. 001) and RBC-WBC interactions (P =. 002). Using multichannel digital fluorescence videomicroscopy, we found that IVIG affected specifically the recruitment of neutrophils. Moreover, further analyses of leukocyte behavior revealed that IVIG significantly increased rolling velocities, indicating that it alters adhesion pathways involved in slow rolling. These data suggest that the potential therapeutic benefits of IVIG in SCD crises should be evaluated in a clinical trial...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{treatment}} of chronic liver disease represents still now an open problem in medicine. The first objective of therapy {{has to be}} the causal agent removal; however, there are many cases (viral infections, autoimmunity, genetic disease) in which {{it is not possible to}} reach this issue; in these situations the secondary objective of the therapy is to inhibit the hepatic fibrogenesis, in attempt of easing or blocking the transformation of chronic liver disease in cirrhosis. The aim of this work is to review the various compounds which showed an antifibrotic activity, using a simple classification model, allowing a fast setting of different compounds. These last, on the basis of their main action, can be divided into two main groups: drugs with direct action, which interfere with collagen metabolism (for instance interferons, glucocorticoids, prolyl 4 -hydroxylase inhibitors, cyclosporin A, colchicine, D-penicillamine, phosphatidylcholine and so on) and drugs with indirect action, that decrease <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimuli,</b> capable of stirring up the fibrogenetic hepatic process (S-adenosylmethionine, malotilate, ursodeoxycholic acid, ribavirin and so on). There are drugs that have both mechanisms of action, without the prevalence of one or other mechanism (prostaglandins) ...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} is {{a hallmark}} of neurodegenerative disease and cytotoxic levels of nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines can initiate neuronal death pathways. A range of cellular assays {{were used to assess}} the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective action of resveratrol using murine microglial (C 8 -B 4), macrophage (RAW 264. 7) and neuronal-like (Neuro 2 a) cell lines. We examined the release of NO by Griess assay and used a Bioplex array to measure a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, in response to <b>the</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Resveratrol was a potent inhibitor of NO and cytokine release in activated macrophages and microglia. The activity of resveratrol increased marginally in potency with longer pre-incubation times in cell culture that was not due to cytotoxicity. Using an NO donor we show that resveratrol can protect Neuro 2 a cells from cytotoxic concentrations of NO. The protective effect of resveratrol from pro-inflammatory signalling in RAW 264. 7 cells was confirmed in co-culture experiments leading to increased survival of Neuro 2 a cells. Together our data are indicative of the potential neuroprotective effect of resveratrol during nitrosative stress and neuroinflammation...|$|R
