25|$|Further explanation: Speakers who {{use this}} {{intonation}} pattern {{do not do}} so categorically, but instead also end many questions with a rising pitch. Such speakers typically use falling pitch for yes/no questions for which they already are quite sure of the answer. So, a speaker uttering the above example is simply confirming what they think they already know, <b>that</b> <b>yes,</b> the person they're talking to is painting his/her garage.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, Yes {{toured the}} US which {{included}} their headline {{spot at the}} 2017 edition of Cruise to the Edge, continuing to play Drama and half of Tales from Topographic Oceans. They toured the US and Canada with the Yestival Tour from August to September 2017, performing at least one song from each album from Yes to Drama. Howe's son Dylan has joined the band as a second drummer, {{the first time since}} the Union Tour <b>that</b> <b>Yes</b> had two drummers playing simultaneously. The last seven shows were cancelled following the unexpected death of Howe's son and Dylan's brother Virgil.|$|E

25|$|After the Drama tour, Yes reconvened in England {{to decide}} the band's next step, {{beginning}} by dismissing Lane as their manager. Horn chose to leave Yes {{to pursue a career}} in music production, with White and Squire next to depart. Left as the sole remaining members, Downes and Howe opted not to continue with the group and went their own separate ways in December 1980. A live compilation album of Yes performances from 1976 to 1978, mixed in mid-1979 and originally intended for release in late 1979, was released as Yesshows, peaking at number 22 in the UK charts and number 43 in the US. An announcement came from the group's management in March 1981 confirming <b>that</b> <b>Yes</b> no longer existed.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Levine had {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Maroon 5 was reaching its peak and might make one more album before disbanding. He was quoted explaining: [...] "Eventually I {{want to focus on}} being a completely different person because I don't know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond". But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:"I love what I do and think <b>that,</b> <b>yes,</b> it might be tiring and complicated at times [...] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon". He has also turned down {{the idea of having a}} solo career, stating that [...] "there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band".|$|E
500|$|... "Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, describing it as [...] "gleefully grim". Handlen {{felt that the}} episode represented the series coming into its own, noting that [...] "Millennium, after weeks of hinting at possibilities without delivering much of anything, has finally started to give a real sense <b>that</b> <b>yes,</b> {{there is a lot}} of bad news happening, and it really does make a twisted kind of sense". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, noting that it shared similar themes with the direction the series would take in its second season. Gibron described the episode as [...] "spooky and somewhat surreal", adding that [...] "the entire installment [...] crackles with possibilities". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions" [...] four stars out of five, describing it as being [...] "surprising, intriguing, moody and pretentious". Shearman compared the episode thematically to Mann's earlier script for [...] "The Judge", and noted that while the story [...] "doesn't make for an especially comprehensible yarn, it does produce an episode that is genuinely uneasy viewing".|$|E

500|$|Chicago-based singer-songwriter Rickey Allen pushed {{allegations}} that [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{was inspired by}} a song he had composed with the same title and spelling, which was copyrighted in the mid-1990s and 2000 and performed locally during that time. He claimed he handed over a version to producer Maurice Joshua, who allegedly went on to cover the song with Destiny's Child. Joshua denied his claims, noting that he never held a copy of Allen's song. Allen filed a lawsuit against the group for compensation in a Chicago, Illinois court in 2006 where the trio was due to appear in December 10 for an eight-day trial. However, they managed to avoid any given court dates after their public split in 2005 and agreed to settle behind closed doors. In early December 2009 it was confirmed by Chicago Sun-Times that the group had reached a settlement with Allen. His attorney, Matthew Wildermuth, said in a statement, [...] "I can confirm <b>that</b> <b>yes,</b> [...] did settle. All of the issues have been amicably resolved and the case is going to be dismissed. [...] excited about being able to devote time to pursuing his musical career. All legal terms and agreement will not be released and the case will be dismissed by a judge".|$|E
500|$|Saadiq called The Way I See It [...] "the {{culmination}} of a lifetime of experiences informed by the music I grew up on." [...] Kristal Hawkins of The Village Voice said that he [...] "hit his artistic maturity" [...] with the album. Robert Christgau remarked on its place in his solo career, [...] "In 1996, Saadiq turned the climactic Tony! Toni! Toné! album into a virtuoso history lesson. Six years later, he tried to dazzle Maxwell in his own reflected glory. Six years later yet again, he outd himself with a fearless return to retro." [...] Elton John, a fan of Saadiq's music since his beginnings with Tony! Toni! Toné!, {{said that he was}} [...] "blown away" [...] by The Way I See It, citing it as [...] "my album of the year – a soul record of the highest quality." [...] He subsequently called Saadiq to congratulate him for the album and ask him to play at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2009. In an interview for Blues & Soul, Saadiq elaborated on the album's impact on his career: [...] "before that record – after I'd been in Tony Toni Tone! and Lucy Pearl – most people had thought 'Oh well, he's a producer now. He’s never gonna be an artist, he's not gonna put the time in' ... The Way I See It showed them <b>that</b> <b>yes,</b> I could put the time in still and be an artist!" ...|$|E
500|$|Hearst was {{reluctant}} to play a character similar to herself, commenting, [...] "I'd never gone in and done as cameo as myself or anything, and I wouldn't do <b>that.</b> <b>Yes,</b> the college is called Hearst…which I thought was funny, and it's certainly not related to publishing." [...] Hearst had never previously accepted roles where {{she was asked to}} play herself, stating that it was a [...] "pathetic attempt to get attention" [...] when other celebrities played themselves or characters similar to themselves. Hearst had heard of Veronica Mars and seen several episodes prior to her appearance; nevertheless, she still needed to talk to Thomas about the series and her character before agreeing to guest star, commenting that she discovered that the character's background was not exceedingly similar to her own life, as [...] "Selma's situation is nothing like anything I've had to deal with." [...] When reading the script for the first time, Hearst was amused by the fact that her character was the heiress to the [...] "Hearst Mart fortune", comparing it to Walmart; she stated, [...] "when I read that in the script, I burst out laughing. It was a spit-take kind of thing. I almost fell over." [...] When asked whether or not the character would become a recurring one, she responded that the idea had not come up in discussions with the crew. However, she stated that she would accept if given the opportunity, and she particularly enjoyed working with Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Ed Begley, Jr..|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff {{gave it a}} [...] "B", {{and wrote}} that he [...] "finally got a sense <b>that,</b> <b>yes,</b> this second season has been {{building}} toward something and {{has been trying to}} tell an emotional story, as well as a humorous one. 'Born This Way', {{for the first time in}} a long time, made me feel like I could say I was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers." [...] Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by [...] "focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, reminded us that these are supposed to be kids". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] "the show's best episode to date", and [...] "an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once scared him, and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends stared at him with love and awe." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode [...] "was a noble effort" [...] but [...] "it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode [...] "sounded just the perfect notes" [...] and called it [...] "the best episode yet". He continued: [...] "The night held wonderful gems: A clear message. Witty repartee (…). Great character build up. And tailored songs that carried emotional heft." ...|$|E
500|$|The next National Woman’s Rights Convention met in Cincinnati on October 17 and 18, 1855. It {{was here}} that Stone {{delivered}} impromptu remarks that became famous as her [...] "disappointment" [...] speech. When a heckler interrupted the proceedings, calling female speakers [...] "a few disappointed women," [...] Stone retorted <b>that</b> <b>yes,</b> she was indeed a [...] "disappointed woman." [...] "In education, in marriage, in religion, in everything, disappointment is the lot of woman. It shall be the business {{of my life to}} deepen this disappointment in every woman's heart until she bows down to it no longer." [...] The convention adopted Stone’s resolution calling for the circulation of petitions and saying it was “the duty of women in their respective States to ask the legislators for the elective franchise.” Following the convention, suffrage petitioning took place in the New England states, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska, with resultant legislative hearings or action in Nebraska and Wisconsin. Amelia Bloomer, recently moved to Iowa near the Nebraska border, took up the work in that area, while the Indiana Woman’s Rights Society, at least one of whose officers was at the Cincinnati convention, directed the work in Indiana. Stone had helped launch the New York campaign at a state woman’s rights convention in Saratoga Springs in August, and at the Cleveland convention recruited workers for it, {{as well as for the}} work in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. Stone took charge of the work in Ohio, her new home state, drafting its petition, placing it in Ohio newspapers and circulating it during lectures across southern Ohio while her recruit worked in the northern part of the state. Stone also lectured in Illinois and Indiana in support of the petition drives there and personally introduced the work in Wisconsin, where she found volunteers to circulate the petition and legislators to introduce them in both houses of the legislature.|$|E

Francesa and Russo maintained <b>that</b> <b>YES</b> did not censor them on-air. Both they and YES officials have commented that the simulcast likely would have been canceled quickly if YES forced them to not criticize Yankees or Nets management. [...] MSG Network also expressed interest in moving the show from YES.|$|E

But I {{want you to know that}} I've forgiven you and that you don't need someone to apologize in order to forgive somebody.

2500|$|Broadly speaking, {{the plays}} {{deal with the}} subject of despair {{and the will to}} survive in spite of that despair, {{in the face of an}} uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nell—one of the two {{characters}} in Endgame who are trapped in ashbins, from which they occasionally peek their heads to speak—can best summarize the themes of the plays of Beckett's middle period: [...] "Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you <b>that.</b> ... <b>Yes,</b> yes, it's the most comical thing in the world.

2500|$|After he was {{reported}} in the press as saying homosexuals should [...] "repent and be changed", he made further comments in which he clarified his remarks. He stated that he had initially said to the journalist from the Telegraph {{that he was going to}} say in his sermon that all people, particularly churches and Christians, should repent, because there was a need [...] "to refocus on the faith of the church from down the ages and an authentic mission to the nations." [...] When asked specifically about whether this included homosexuals, he had said <b>that</b> <b>yes,</b> it included everybody and went on to give his interpretation of the Christian view of human sexuality, marriage and the family, saying that we were all sinners and in continual need of repentance for our shortcomings.|$|E
