25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to make a time machine, you would want it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E

500|$|Drummer Chris Columbo, who {{conducted}} the club's orchestra for 34 years, [...] remembered that the early morning shows were the most vibrant because [...] the other clubs in town were closed {{and many of those}} who were appearing at them were now at Club Harlem jamming with the club's musicians. Johnny Lynch {{was in charge of the}} house band of 14 musicians, which was integrated. [...] The band was well-regarded among musicians. [...] It was said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in the Club Harlem band for the summer, you were a fine musician. [...] Young men who wanted to become professionals often quit their regular jobs in summer to play with the Lynch band.|$|E
2500|$|Rumours that Faith No More would reunite for {{shows in}} the UK {{in the summer of}} 2009 were {{circulating}} in late November 2008, but were originally dismissed by bassist Billy Gould. He explained: [...] "If anything like this were to happen, it would have to come from the band, and I haven't spoken with any of them in over a year. So as far as I know, there isn't anything to talk about, and I'm pretty sure <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to contact Patton, he would tell you the same thing." ...|$|E

This {{is the stuff of}} Kim Philby and Aldrich Ames.'" [...] Wilson has said: [...] "I felt that ... however abominable the decision might be, it was rational <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> an administration and did not want people talking about the intelligence or talking about what underpinned the decision to go to war, you would discourage them by destroying the credibility of the messenger who brought you the message. And this administration apparently decided the way to do that was to leak the name of my wife." ...|$|E

There are some others that we would have liked to have, but you are never going to get all of them. We put a lot of stock in trying to recruit the local-area kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Lynch {{moved with}} his wife and {{daughter}} to Los Angeles, where he began studying filmmaking at the AFI Conservatory, a place that he would later describe as being [...] "completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great... you quickly learned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing." [...] He began writing a script for a proposed work titled Gardenback, which had [...] "unfolded from this painting I'd done". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his Gardenback project, he became fed up with the Conservatory and quit after returning to start the second year and being put in first year classes. Dean of the AFI, Frank Daniel, asked Lynch to reconsider, believing {{that he was one of}} the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that Gardenback was [...] "wrecked", he instead set about on a new film, which he called Eraserhead.|$|E
