5|$|While Bhattacharyya's view {{is mostly}} undisputed, some {{scholars}} such as S.

Hindu literature first mentions Chhinnamasta in the upapurana Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana (c.950CE) and the Devi-Bhagavata Purana (9th–12th century). ElisabethA.

Though essentially agreeing with Bhattacharyya's view, Karel R. vanKooij, former Professor of South Asian art history at Leiden University, goes further and associates the iconography of Chhinnamasta with the Tantric goddesses Varahi and Chamunda.|$|E
