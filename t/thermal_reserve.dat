Reducing carbon dioxide emission and enhancing energy use is a common subject in steel industry. In the integrated steel plant, decreasing carbon dioxide emission must consider energy balance in the whole iron and steel works, and secondary energy must be actively utilized. As promising blast-furnaces, top gas recovery blast furnace (TGR-BF) and oxygen blast furnace have been investigated. In this paper, conceptual TGR blast furnace and oxygen blast furnace are proposed. Base {{on the idea of}} blast furnace gas de-CO(2) circulating as reducing agent and the idea of pure oxygen blast decreasing the <b>thermal</b> <b>reserve</b> zone temperature, process modeling is conducted with ASPEN Plus.

The {{evolution}} of {{physical and chemical properties}} of the centre-line coke samples were analysed by Light Optical Microscopy (LOM), BET N 2 absorption and SEM/XRF/XRD. Alkali distribution in the EBF cokes was examined by XRF/SEM and EDS. Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was used to measure isothermal and non-isothermal CO 2 reactivity of the cokes. The crystalline order of carbon and the concentration of alkalis were found to increase as the coke descended through <b>thermal</b> <b>reserve</b> zone to the cohesive zone of the EBF. The crystallite height (Lc) of EBF coke carbon displayed a linear correlation with the measured EBF temperatures demonstrating the strong effect of temperature on carbon structure of coke in the EBF. Alkali concentration of the coke was increased as it descended into the EBF, and was uniformly distributed throughout the coke matrix. The CO 2 reactivity of lower zone cokes was found to increase when compared to the reactivity of the upper zones cokes, and was related to the catalytic effect of increased alkalis concentration. The deterioration of coke quality particularly coke strength and abrasion propensity were related to coke graphitisation, alkalization and reactivity. Coke graphitisation is shown to have a strong influence on the coke degradation behaviour in the EBF. Validerad; 2005; 20061210 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|The {{iron ore}} based steel {{producers}} in Sweden and Finland operates mainly on pellets produced by LKAB. The {{introduction of new}} mining sites is believed to influence the future pellet chemistry. Furthermore, environmental and economic factors act as a driving force towards increasing the material- and energy efficiency by increasing the recirculation of in plant by products. All together this amounts to a realized change in feed chemistry. Therefore, it is of interest to study how trace elements behave in the process {{to be able to}} follow the material flow of trace elements within the integrated steel plant. In this thesis it was attempted to describe the distribution of trace elements between metal, slag and gas phase in the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process using thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. The work was focused on developing an approach to calculate the distribution of zinc in the blast furnace and chromium in the BOF. The same approach was then utilized for lead in the blast furnace and cobalt in the BOF to determine if it was applicable on other trace elements as well. The blast furnace calculations were divided into three different scenarios representing different parts of the furnace; namely, the hearth, <b>thermal</b> <b>reserve</b> zone and the section above the <b>thermal</b> <b>reserve</b> zone. The results showed that for elements having a cyclical behavior in the furnace, such as zinc and lead, the assumed recirculation rate is directly decisive for the calculated output through the tap hole. And, that more data is needed to confidently estimate a probable recirculation rate that fits the calculations. Furthermore, it was shown that, from a thermodynamic standpoint, no lead or zinc leaves the blast furnace through the top. To describe the output of these elements through the off gas it was argued that a thorough study of the connection between furnace operating parameters and the dust and sludge amount and zinc and lead contents of the dust and sludge is required. The BOF calculations were executed by adding the oxygen in increments to an open system, allowing the gas to leave between each calculation step. The calculations were carried out for and compared to results of a pilot plant scale converter and an industrial scale converter. From the results it was concluded that the distribution of chromium could be described for the pilot plant scale converter although the comparison of the overall composition of the slag and crude steel was not satisfactory. Furthermore, the distribution of chromium for the industrial scale converter could not be described using the method at hand. It was argued that the failure to describe the outcome resided in the fact that thermodynamic calculations were employed on a process where kinetics is known to play an important part. Cobalt could be described using the method. However, a simple mass balance with the assumption that essentially all cobalt reports to the crude steel phase would give the same results.

40|$|Non-pumped hydroelectricity-based {{energy storage}} in New Zealand has only limited {{potential}} to expand to meet projected growth in electricity demand. Seasonal variations of hydro inflows have {{also led to}} several 'dry-year' events {{over the last decade}} and dedicated fast-start 'peaker' capacity may also be required to support wind power as it approaches a 20 % generation share. In this research, the New Zealand electricity industry has been surveyed in regard to the feasibility of reducing CO 2 -e emissions through the introduction of pumped hydroelectricity and utility-scale batteries by 2025. A desk-based review of the economic costs of these technologies has also been performed and their drivers and barriers critically assessed. Most respondents to the survey projected that peak power demand will continue to increase and this will result in new-build centralised (~ 150 MW) <b>thermal</b> <b>reserve</b> power sources. In New Zealand, the costs of pumped hydro and batteries are seen to be prohibitive to their introduction, even though they are almost universally assumed to be technically capable of providing renewables support and peak power adequacy. The perception of the poor economic viability of pumped hydro may, in part, be due to the relatively high capital cost estimate associated with the Manorburn-Onslow proposal (~NZ$ 3 billion). This research has shown, however, that smaller, 'more-internationally-representative' pumped hydro schemes, if available in NZ with low associated environmental impact, are cost-competitive with thermal peakers, especially diesel peakers. Conversely, utility-scale batteries have very high storage costs per kWh and {{are most likely to be}} used only for very high value applications where there is a strong technical advantage, such as the six-second fast instantaneous reserve...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} European {{policy goals}} aiming towards a {{sustainable}} energy supply, the share of renewable energy sources in the electricity system is increasing. The two technologies driving this development in Europe, i. e. wind and PV, are characterised by a variable energy output, facing a limited predictability. These unexpected output variations challenge the real-time balance between electricity demand and supply and require appropriate operating reserve capacity. In the absence of large-scale storage or price responsive demand, the balancing of the power system is the main bottleneck for a large-scale deployment of renewable electricity generation in the power system. This dissertation deals with the management of operating reserves for balancing the power system with high shares of wind power. Firstly, a numerical model is developed to generate realistic time series of wind power generation and predictions over a region. This data is {{used to determine the}} short-term variations and prediction errors impacting the system balance. These are assessed by means of a flexibility assessment tool quantifying the operational thermal flexibility which is available for covering real-time system imbalances. Results show that without additional reserve requirements, this flexibility is insufficient to ensure a reliable integration of wind power. Particularly the upward fast-response flexibility is found to be scarce. Secondly, a statistical methodology is used to size and allocate additional reserve capacity to maintain stable reliability standards while integrating wind power. A strategy which minimises total capacity while maximising the allocation of reserve capacity towards slow-response reserves is put forward as a cost-efficient strategy. This is verified by means of a model simulating the day-ahead scheduling of power plants to meet the demand for power and reserve capacity. It is found that reserve requirements, and in particular the fast-response upward reserves, impact electricity generation cost. This cost increase is minimised when deploying slow-response reserve strategies. Results indicate the importance of peak power plants and base load flexibility to obtain a cost-efficient procurement of <b>thermal</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity. Finally, two reserve strategies are presented based on probabilistic wind power forecasting tools. Information concerning the uncertainty of the wind power forecast is used to obtain time-varying reserve requirements and enables the active participation of wind power in reserves. It is shown that both strategies achieve substantial cost savings without impacting system security. In particular the dynamic reserve strategy is particularly useful for reducing upward reserve capacity. In contrast, wind power participation remains a last-resort measure when facing low downward flexibility and elevated reserve requirements. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this review, ''Geothermal Energy and the Utility Market [...] The Opportunities and Challenges for Expanding Geothermal Energy in a Competitive Supply Market'', ties in {{directly}} with {{the subject of this}} session. That is, it follows immediately that the establishment, utilization and maintenance of the borehole for extracting energy and data are the first and continuing concerns of the geothermal industry in expanding that resource's role in the utility market. There is probably no portion of the utilization of the geothermal energy resource that more determines the cost competitiveness of that resource than the cost of reaching and delivering the heat energy. Therefore, there is probably no other area where advances in the state-of-the-art can be more directly and profitably applied to the {{theme of this}} review. The four subjects in this session feature the activities under the program conducted at the Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque). Specifically, an overview is presented, a discussion of advances in acoustic telemetry, the status of lost circulation technology development, and a description of downhole memory-logging tools. One of the points of emphasis in the overview concerned slimhole drilling. The cost advantages of a smaller diameter borehole are intuitively obvious. The possibility of cutting drilling costs by half opens up the possibility of conducting more detailed mapping of the <b>thermal</b> <b>reserves.</b> This is particularly attractive for the Pacific Northwest, where a power shortage looms in the future. There is substantial evidence of significant useful <b>thermal</b> <b>reserves</b> in the area. However, the capability of tapping them is, in many cases, dependent upon finding drilling locations not only advantageously related to the power grid, but suitably related to natural features and environmental considerations. These requirements demand a practical method of getting more accurate maps of the resource. Slimhole drilling could well provide the answer. As stated in the more comprehensive paper which follows, acoustic telemetry as a method of data retrieval {{from the bottom of the}} borehole has been a dream of the drilling industry for half a century. The problem up to now has been largely one of data rate. The result has been that the main practical use has been to provide directional data in offshore drilling, and limited use with gamma tools. These uses employed the drilling mud as the medium. The Sandia work has studied and developed the technique of using acoustic waves in the drill pipe, which, despite problems with wave reflections due to joints, etc., allows for substantial increases in the data rate. This technology is being transferred to industry. Working with industry, SNL is expecting to work with them to develop analysis codes, quantify attenuation, and prototype the critical hardware...|$|R

40|$|Air {{bubbling}} systems prevent {{ice formation}} {{on the surface}} of a body of water because the warm water at depth can be brought to the surface by rising air bubbles. The amount of heat available in the water must be known to calculate the <b>thermal</b> <b>reserve.</b> Lake temperatures are largely controlled by convection overturning, but fresh water has a maximum density at 39. 2 degrees F which affects circulation and the resulting temperature. Canada's lakes are mostly of the temperate type and therefore have two turnover periods, in spring and in fall. Wind action is also very important. River water temperatures are nearly the same throughout because of mixing. Although sea water air bubbling systems have been used, careful studies must be made to ensure ice can be melted by this method. Maximum density does not occur at 39. 2 degrees F, hence convection mixing may occur until ice forms at the surface. To design an air bubbling system to prevent ice formation the thermal regime of the fresh water body and its surroundings must be known. The area of influence of each jet {{and the size of the}} hole must also be known. Design studies so far have been mostly empirical. No engineering procedure has been developed. Some experimental studies have been reported and details are given of the flow patterns of various orifices for use in ice prevention at the Grand Coulee Dam. Work needs to be carried out on how the heat stored at depth under an ice surface can be used efficiently to prevent further ice growth.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{reactions}} in packed beds such as iron ore reduction or gasification of coke in a blast furnace involve {{various aspects of}} thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, chemistry and physics. Unfortunately, inaccessible and hostile process environments {{make it very difficult}} to gain insights into such reactors and to operate the industrial processes. To address this problem extensive research has been undertaken in the past to develop numerical methods and models. However, little effort has been made to describe the complex thermochemical processes inside such reactors starting from the particle and especially intra-particle scale. The objectives of this thesis are to introduce a coupled approach which allows for the physical and chemical interaction of a granular material with a surrounding gas phase and to apply it to the reduction processes in the upper shaft of a blast furnace. Furthermore, a suitable model to investigate the gas-solid thermochemical interaction within a single particle and within a packed bed of particles was to be established. Thus, the classical discrete element method (DEM) was extended by thermodynamic state variables such as temperature, composition and chemical reactions. In addition, a coupling between the particulate phase and a continuous gas phase for convective heat and mass transfer was implemented. It {{should be noted that the}} application of the presented methodology is not only restricted to the blast furnace, but rather represents a rigorous approach that can be applied to other packed bed reactors as well. A validation study on the particle scale using experimental results shows that the dis- crete particle model accurately predicts the progress of indirect reduction of a pellet. The particle model is shown to be capable of resolving radial gradients on the particle scale avoiding rigorous assumptions or mathematical fits to a specific experimental setup. These qualities of the model permit its usage in the presented analysis of indirect reduc- tion within the shaft of a blast furnace where each particle is subjected to time-varying boundary conditions. On the packed bed scale heat and mass transfer from the discrete to the continuous phase was validated using experimental data. Moreover, the model showed accurate results when compared to experimental reduction data from a lab scale bed of iron ore particles. Finally, the reduction processes in the upper shaft of a blast furnace were analysed: Firstly, isothermal reduction of a packed bed of pellets according to ISO standards were analysed in terms of heterogeneity in temperature and reduction degree inside the cylindrical reactor. Results indicate that radial gradients inside the packed bed are caused by the higher mass flow rate close to the reactor wall. Axial gradients develop due reduction reactions and the direction of the fluid flow. The formation of these axial gradients is found to be inherent to the process of indirect reduction of iron oxides due to the sequence of exothermic and endothermic reaction steps. Secondly, a complex packed bed with a layered structure of coke and iron ore particles is analysed under time-varying reducing gas conditions simulating the journey of a packed bed column through the upper shaft of a blast furnace. Results highlight that the gas and the solid phase are highly coupled in space and time during the process of indirect reduction. Axial gradients in temperature and composition form due to the heat and mass transfer between the packed bed and the streaming gas. Energy released or consumed by the indirect reduction provides an opposing trend to the gradients formed from the hot gas stream, thus reducing axial gradients within the bed and the gas phase. The results indicate the mechanisms involved during the formation of the <b>thermal</b> <b>reserve</b> zones inside the blast furnace shaft due to the complex interaction of convective heat and mass transfer in conjunction with energy consumption and release by the reactions. Considering the findings presented, this thesis is understood to contribute to the better understanding of heterogeneous {{reactions in}} packed beds and as a particular example of such the upper part of the blast furnace...|$|E

Thermal wadis are engineered sources of stored solar energy using modified lunar regolith as a thermal storage mass that can enable the operation of lightweight robotic rovers or other assets in cold, dark environments without incurring potential mass, cost, and risk penalties associated with various onboard sources of thermal energy.

40|$|Abstract]: Australia’s {{coal fired}} power {{stations}} {{are the most}} efficient form of providing bulk base load power generation (i. e. electricity) to consumers. This is due to Australia having an abundance of <b>thermal</b> coal <b>reserves,</b> which is the fuel used in coal fired power stations. Therefore it is extremely important that these power stations operate at maximum availability and reliability to ensure the consumer receives cost effective and uninterrupted electricity. Callide C Power Station in Biloela Queensland is a 900 Megawatt (MW) coal fired power station that was commissioned in 2001. Unfortunately Callide C Power Station has been plagued with continuous operational and reliability problems caused from the induced draft (ID) fans since initial commissioning. The ID fan problems have arisen from the bearing lubrication system which provides oil recirculation to the induction motor bearings and fan main shaft bearings. Consequently these issues have caused half-load unit (225 MW) run-backs and full unit (450 MW) trips over the past decade. This project’s aim is to analyse the ID fan lubrication system and then identify and define all root causes and their associated failure modes. Once all root causes are identified through Root Cause Analysis (RCA) process, effective design solutions can be researched and evaluated so a proposed modification design project can be finalised. This final design proposal {{will be used to}} justify capital expenditure so implementation can occur in the near future...|$|R
40|$|In Germany low {{enthalpy}} thermal waters (mainly {{with temperatures}} between 40 C and 100 C maximum temperatures partly above 100 C) are {{of great importance}} in the exploitation of hydrogeothermal energy. Large <b>thermal</b> water <b>reserves,</b> high realizable flow rates (50 - 100 m" 3 /h) and high productivity (> 50 m" 3 /hxMPa) are the main requirements for efficient economic exploitation. Thus usage is restricted to certain geologic conditions and special reservoir properties. One of the most favorable German areas for direct geothermal heat recovery is the North German Basin. Mainly Cretaceous-, Jurassic- and Triassic sandstone reservoirs in a depth range between 1000 and 3000 m can be utilized there. Detailed geologic and petrophysical investigations of the reservoir rocks, knowledge about their temperature conditions, chemical and microbiological analysis of the formation waters and the estimation of possible fluid-rock interactions are on {{the hand of the}} basis for an evaluation of the regional energy potential {{and on the other hand}} the main basis for a locally successful technical exploitation. Reliable and efficient geothermal heat supply requires proper management of the thermal water loop of the geothermal plant. This includes economic and energy as well as environmental aspects. The design of the geothermal loop has to be optimized according to the specific conditions of each site. Today reliable technical solutions exist even for the highly concentrated geothermal brines of the very permeable but sensitive sandstone aquifers in North Germany. Initial Fe" 2 "+ content of the reducing Na-Cl-brines and the possible precipitation of iron hydroxides induced by oxygen entry between production and re-injection well is of main technological importance there.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{electricity transmission}} network facilitates electricity trading between Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Currently most of the areas power generation is traded at NordPool, where the trading volumes have steadily increased since the early 1990 s, when the exchange was founded. The Nordic electricity is expected to follow the current trend and further integrate with the other European electricity markets. Hydro power is the source for roughly a half of the supply in the Nordic electricity market {{and most of the}} hydro is generated in Norway. The dominating role of hydro power distinguishes the Nordic electricity market from most of the other market places. Production of hydro power varies mainly due to hydro reservoirs and demand for electricity. Hydro reservoirs are affected by water inflows that differ each year. The hydro reservoirs explain remarkably the behaviour of the Nordic electricity markets. Therefore among others, Kauppi and Liski (2008) have developed a model that analyzes the behaviour of the markets using hydro reservoirs as explanatory factors. Their model includes, for example, welfare loss due to socially suboptimal hydro reservoir usage, socially optimal electricity price, hydro reservoir storage and thermal reservoir storage; that are referred as outcomes. However, the model does not explain the real market condition but rather an ideal situation. In the model the market is controlled by one agent, i. e. one agent controls all the power generation reserves; it is referred to as a socially optimal strategy. Article by Kauppi and Liski (2008) includes an assumption where an individual agent has a certain fraction of market power, e. g. 20 % or 30 %. In order to maintain the focus of this thesis, this part of their paper is omitted. The goal of this thesis is two-fold. Firstly we expand the results from the socially optimal strategy for years 2006 - 08, as the earlier study finishes in 2005. The second objective is to improve on the methods from the previous study. This thesis results several outcomes (SPOT-price and welfare loss, etc.) due to socially optimal actions. Welfare loss is interesting as it describes the inefficiency of the market. SPOT-price is an important output for the market participants as it often has an effect on end users electricity bills. Another function is to modify and try to improve the model by means of using more accurate input data, e. g. by considering pollution trade rights effect on input data. After modifications to the model, new welfare losses are calculated and compared with the same results before the modifications. The hydro reservoir has the higher explanatory significance in the model followed by thermal power. In Nordic markets, <b>thermal</b> power <b>reserves</b> are mostly nuclear power and other thermal sources (coal, natural gas, oil, peat). It can be argued that hydro and thermal reservoirs determine electricity supply. Roughly speaking, the model takes into account electricity demand and supply, and several parameters related to them (water inflow, oil price, etc.), yielding finally the socially optimal outcomes. The author of this thesis is not aware of any similar model being tested before. There have been some other studies that are close to the Kauppi and Liski (2008) model, but those have a somewhat different focus. For example, a specific feature in the model is the focus on long-run capacity usage that differs from the previous studies on short-run market power. The closest study to the model is from Californias wholesale electricity markets that, however, uses different methodology. Work is constructed as follows...|$|R
