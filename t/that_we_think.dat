So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go.

25|$|Furthermore, Gee {{also argues}} that reading and writing {{should be viewed as}} more than just “mental achievements” {{happening}} inside people’s minds; they should also be seen as “social and cultural practices with economic, historical, and political implications”. So, in Gee’s view, literacies are not only multiple but are inherently connected to social practices. In order to expand the traditional view of literacy as print literacy, Gee recommends <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> first of literacy in terms of semiotic domains. By this, he means “any set of practices that recruits one or more modalities (e.g., oral or written language, images, equations, symbols, sounds, gestures, graphs, artifacts, etc.) to communicate distinctive types of meanings”. There is a seemingly endless and varied range of semiotic domains, including (but certainly not limited to) cellular biology, first-person-shooter video games, rap music, or modernist painting. Most pundits would describe this conception of literacies as a key element in {{what has come to be}} known as the New Literacy Studies. In short, this theoretical and methodological orientation emphasizes studying language-in-use and literacies within their contexts of social practice. It includes work by colleagues such as Brian Street, Gunther Kress, David Barton, Mary Hamilton, Courtney Cazden, Ron Scollon, and Suzie Scollon, among others.|$|E

In {{order to}} show that mental {{properties}} like believing, desiring and intending are causally explanatory, I propose a nonreductive, materialistic account that identifies beliefs and desires by their content, and that shows how differences in the contents of beliefs and desires can make causal differences in what we do. Key-words: mental causation; causal explanation; intentional properties; supervenience; counterfactuals. It is a truism <b>that</b> what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> affects what <b>we</b> do. <b>We</b> all suppose <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can change the way that people act by changing their minds. Otherwise, people would not spend {{billions of dollars on}} education, propaganda, advertising, fund-raising drives, political campaigns, or market research. As obvious as this point is, there lurks a philosophical scruple that makes reflective people stand back and wonder how it is possible <b>that</b> what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> has any causal bearing on what we do. The problem is that deep-seated contemporary assumptions about the nature of reality seem to leave no room for our ordinary convictions such as “what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> affects what <b>we</b> do. ” This is th...|$|R

Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> satisfies both parties".

500|$|Disney {{has been}} accused of anti-semitism, {{although}} none of his employeesincluding the animator Art Babbitt, who disliked Disney intenselyever accused him of making anti-semitic slurs or taunts. The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons. Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities, he was named [...] "1955 Man of the Year" [...] by the B'nai B'rith chapter in Beverly Hills, and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions. Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence does not support accusations of anti-semitism and that Disney was [...] "not [...] in the conventional sense <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> of someone as being an anti-Semite". Gabler concludes that [...] "though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic , and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life". Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.|$|E

He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests. Albert replied angrily [...] "What has {{that got to do with}} you?...

Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match, but as he could find no alternative bride, he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter (and outside the realm of government) was [...] "the only way to prevent a break with Prussia and the only way to keep the game in our own hands, impose the conditions <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> necessary, and as far as we can, take off its political edge".

He considered the mysteries of Alien to be alien in nature, and said, [...] "all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey'... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?" [...] His solution was to link the alien mysteries {{to the past and}} future of humanity.

That story changes meaning within our own life, things of such significance <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> of our own lives differently." [...] Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float. By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft. Scott said about the script, [...] "we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?" [...] In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.|$|E

[...] Fenno said that [...] "The premise of this episode, 'Local Ad' — the Scranton staffers shoot a commercial — was strong, and allowed almost every ensemble member to shine."

[...] According to Edge, Ultra Street Fighter IVs addition of delayed wakeup, which lets one stay on the floor longer after being knocked down to put an opponent off their rhythm, was [...] "primarily designed to nerf characters like Cammy, Akuma and Ibuki who are at their most effective when an opponent is getting up off the ground." [...] Professional player Sakonoko, whose preferred character in Super Street Fighter IV was Ibuki, said in interview for Famitsu that Ibuki in Street Fighter X Tekken [...] "is ultimately based on her SSFIV Arcade Edition version" [...] and so it is easy for people familiar with this game [...] "to jump right in."
