5|$|As a {{classical}} singer, Turunen sings with classical vocal technique.

Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Scott {{left her}} former record label Hidden Beach Recordings. During the album's recording, she was sued by Hidden Beach, which claimed {{she had left}} without {{fulfilling}} a six-album contract. The lawsuit was settled in 2011, with Hidden Beach planning to release in August a compilation album The Original Jill Scott from the Vault, Vol. 1, {{the first in a}} planned album series of Scott's previously unreleased recordings. In 2010, Warner Bros. Records signed Scott to a deal <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> direct control over her marketing and promotion. In a strategy to re-establish Scott's presence with fans, she signed a multi-tour deal with Live Nation/Haymon Ventures to expand her concert touring.

5|$|The {{ship was}} based on cruiser designs from late in World War I, {{primarily}} due to personnel shortages in the design staff and {{the closure of the}} Navy's experimental institute. Nevertheless, the ship incorporated major advances over the earlier designs, including large-scale use of welding in her construction and a significantly more efficient propulsion system <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a cruising radius fifty percent larger than that of the older ships. Emden was laid down at the Reichsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven on 8 December 1921 and launched on 7 January 1925. She was commissioned into the fleet nine months later, on 15 October 1925.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, the United States Embassy in London chose Thatcher to {{take part}} in the International Visitor Leadership Program (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a {{professional}} exchange programme <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> the opportunity to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although she was not yet a Cabinet or Shadow Cabinet member, the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future Prime Minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with many prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and Nelson Rockefeller. In 1967, Heath appointed Thatcher to the Shadow Cabinet as Fuel and Power spokesman. Prior to the 1970 general election, she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education.|$|E

After the Act of Union, Ireland became {{severely}} impoverished and some of the family decided to emigrate. Most of the family came to work on a farm in West Virginia, however, her sister, Jeannie Healy went to a boarding school in Namur. Murphy, then only six, wanted to stay with her father {{who did not want to}} emigrate at the time. She did, and was enrolled in a school in Ireland <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a solid educational foundation.

25|$|Taeping {{arrived at}} Gravesend some 55 minutes before Ariel, but <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> no {{advantage}} as both ships {{then had to}} wait for the tide to rise sufficiently. Ariel then had the shorter distance to go - arriving outside East India Dock gates at 9:00 pm, but the tide was still too low for the gates to open. Taeping carried on up-river to London Docks. Here, unlike the entrance to the East India Dock, there was an inner and outer set of gates. Taeping's shallower draft allowed her through the outer gates, then they topped up the lock from the dock basin. She passed through at 9:47 pm. Ariel entered East India Dock at 10:15 pm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the British novelist Dennis Wheatley {{produced}} {{a range of}} influential novels in which his protagonists battled Satanic groups. At the same time, non-fiction authors like Montague Summers and Rollo Ahmed published books claiming that Satanic groups practicing black magic were still active across the world, although they provided no evidence {{that this was the}} case. During the 1950s, various British tabloid newspapers repeated such claims, largely basing their accounts on the allegations of one woman, Sarah Jackson, who claimed to have been a member of such a group. In 1973, the British Christian Doreen Irvine published From Witchcraft to Christ, in which she claimed to have been a member of a Satanic group <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> supernatural powers, such as the ability to levitate, before she escaped and embraced Christianity.|$|E
25|$|In August, the Talmadges {{left for}} California, where Norma's first role was in Captivating Mary Carstairs. The whole {{enterprise}} was a fiasco; the sets and costumes were cheap and the studio itself lacked adequate backing. The film was a flop, {{and the small}} new studio shut down {{after the release of}} Mary Carstairs. The demise of National Pictures Company left the family stranded in California after only one picture. Deciding it was smarter to aim high, they went to the Triangle Film Corporation, where D.W. Griffith was supervising productions. On the strength of The Battle Cry, Talmadge got a contract with Griffith's Fine Arts Company. For eight months, she starred in seven features for Triangle, including the comedy The Social Secretary (1916), a comedy written by Anita Loos and directed by John Emerson, <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> an opportunity to disguise her beauty as a girl trying to avoid the unwelcome attentions of her male employers.|$|E

25|$|In a {{burst of}} anger, Golightly {{transforms}} into the Vespiform and threatens the guests. Agatha grabs the necklace and lures him away while driving towards the nearby Silent Pool, with the Doctor and Donna close behind. When they catch up with Agatha, Donna grabs the necklace from her and throws it into the water, prompting the wasp to dive in after it and drown. Due to her own connection with the necklace, Agatha suffers as the wasp dies, but right before the end he severs the link, sparing Agatha but rendering her unconscious. The Doctor realises this is the event <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> the amnesia during her disappearance, and uses the TARDIS to quietly drop her off near the Harrogate Hotel ten days later. Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor shows Donna Agatha's novel Death in the Clouds, {{in which there is}} a giant wasp on the cover. The Doctor explains that his copy was printed in the year 5,000,000,000 and that Agatha Christie is the best-selling novelist of all time.|$|E
25|$|By tradition, a lady of {{the court}} was instantaneously {{recognizable}} by her panniers, corset and weighty silk materials that constructed her gown {{in the style of}} à la française or à l’anglaise. By doing away with these things, Marie Antoinette’s gaulle or chemise á la Reine stripped female aristocrats of their traditional identity; noblewomen could now be confused with peasant girls, confusing long standing sartorial differences in class. The chemise was made from a white muslin and the queen was further accused of importing foreign fabrics and crippling the French silk industry. The gaulle consisted of thin layers of this muslin, loosely draped around the body and belted at the waist, and was often worn with an apron and a fichu. This trend was quickly adopted by fashionable women in France and England, but upon the debut of the portrait of Marie Antoinette by Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, the clothing style created a scandal and increased the hatred for the queen. The queen’s clothing in the portrait looked like a chemise, nothing more than a garment that women wore under her other clothing or to lounge in the intimate space of the private boudoir. It was perceived to be indecent, and especially unbecoming for the queen. The sexual nature of the gaulle undermined the notions of status and the ideology <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> and kept her in power. Marie Antoinette wanted to be private and individual, a notion unbecoming for a member of the monarchy that is supposed to act {{as a symbol of the}} state.|$|E
