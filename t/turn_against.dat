A portion of the {{citizens}} of the city, demoralized and hungry, decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades for similar terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats in the harbor. The portion of the citizenry that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement {{in the midst of the}} fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to <b>turn</b> <b>against</b> the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, Popovac {{issued an}} appeal to Muslim Partisans, urging them to join the Chetniks and <b>turn</b> <b>against</b> the Ustaše.

5|$|Initially, the Ngô family {{claimed that}} the army had carried out the raids, {{something}} their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to <b>turn</b> <b>against</b> the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. As most of the students were from middle-class public service and military families, the arrests caused further upset among the Ngô family's power base.|$|E

5|$|The Defective Premises Act 1972 (c. 35) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} landlords' and builders' {{liability}} for poorly constructed and poorly maintained buildings, {{along with any}} injuries that may result. During the 19th century, the common law principle that a landlord could not be liable for letting a poorly maintained house was established, while a long-running principle was that, in practice, builders could not be sued for constructing defective buildings. The courts began to <b>turn</b> <b>against</b> the first principle during the 20th century, imposing several restrictions on the landlord's immunity, but the landlord was still largely free from being sued.|$|E

However, Weiss was able to overcome this control method, and the Tsviets wrenched control from the Restrictors. Although Weiss was successful in overthrowing the Restrictors, however, the leader of the Restrictors was able to implant a virus into Weiss' bloodstream.|$|E
