5|$|Herennianus and Timolaus: the {{two were}} {{mentioned}} in the Augustan History and are not attested in any other source; Herennianus might be a conflation of Hairan and Herodianus while Timolaus is most probably a fabrication, although Dietmar Kienast suggest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> Vaballathus.|$|E
5|$|Kehoe's {{neighbor}} A. McMullen {{noted that}} Kehoe had stopped {{working on his}} farm altogether {{for most of the}} preceding year, and he thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> planning suicide. Kehoe had given him one of his horses about April 1927, but McMullen returned it for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{suggested}} to Erwin Schrödinger <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able {{to reproduce the}} statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, {{which will be the}} number of particles in it.|$|E

5|$|In Canada's St. Elias Mountains, {{a frozen}} {{extraterrestrial}} body is discovered by an expedition team. Professor Arlinsky, the team's leader, sends ice core samples containing presumably alien DNA to Mulder. Scully has the samples tested and confirms the DNA's non-terrestrial origin, but is {{attacked by a}} man who steals the samples. Scully learns that her attacker is Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), a Defense Department employee. When she tracks down Kritschgau and holds him at gunpoint, he reveals <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> killed.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to bribe his way free of his guards, Rupert was imprisoned in Linz. Lord Craven, also taken in the battle, {{attempted}} to persuade his captors {{to allow him to}} remain with Rupert, but was refused. Rupert's imprisonment was surrounded by religious overtones. His mother was deeply concerned <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> converted from Calvinism to Catholicism; his captors, encouraged by Emperor Ferdinand III, deployed Jesuit priests in an attempt to convert him. The Emperor went further, proffering the option of freedom, a position as an Imperial general and a small principality if Rupert would convert. Rupert refused.|$|E
5|$|The novelist Matteo Bandello {{observed}} Leonardo at {{work and}} wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint {{for three or four}} days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> obliged to use the prior as his model.|$|E

5|$|By February 1968 Harrison {{decided to}} leave, as Cohen was showing {{no signs of}} abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and {{suggested}} Barry Malzberg to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg from {{his work at the}} Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> more amenable than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{case was}} unusual {{as he had}} a fungal infection, Penicillium marneffei, {{which at the time}} had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV {{developed}} into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.|$|E
5|$|Christian finds Aaron {{standing}} in the snow outside the airport terminal. Christian confesses his love, and despite his misgivings, Aaron admits his own feelings of love. With all flights canceled due to a snowstorm, Christian and Aaron spend an intimate night in a motel. When Christian awakes, he finds Aaron gone. Aaron's pocket watch, a family heirloom, has been left behind. Christian returns to Los Angeles. In Idaho, Aaron is excommunicated by the church elders, led by his own father, Farron, who is the stake president. Aaron is rejected by his father and scolded by his mother, who tells him {{that he needs to}} pray for forgiveness. When Aaron suggests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> gay, his mother slaps him. Overwhelmed by despair, Aaron attempts suicide. He is subsequently sent by his parents to a treatment facility to be cured of his homosexuality.|$|E

60|$|She wished so much {{he would}} {{fall in love with}} a girl equal to be his mate--educated and strong. But he would not look at anybody above him in station. He seemed to like Mrs. Dawes. At any rate that feeling was wholesome. His mother prayed and prayed for him, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> wasted. <b>That</b> was all her prayer--not for his soul or his righteousness, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> wasted. And while he slept, for hours and hours she thought and prayed for him.|$|R
5|$|In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a {{coalition}} of the Despensers' enemies across the Marcher territories. Edward and Hugh the Younger became aware of these plans in March and headed west, hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis. This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May. The Despensers' lands were quickly seized by {{a coalition}} of the Marcher Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances. Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers. Fearing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the Marcher Lords for their actions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Servetus, Calvin was {{acclaimed}} a defender of Christianity, but his ultimate triumph over the libertines was still two years away. He had always insisted that the Consistory retain the power of excommunication, despite the council's past decision to take it away. During Servetus's trial, Philibert Berthelier asked the council for permission to take communion, {{as he had been}} excommunicated the previous year for insulting a minister. Calvin protested that the council did not have the legal authority to overturn Berthelier's excommunication. Unsure of how the council would rule, he hinted in a sermon on 3 September 1553 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> dismissed by the authorities. The council decided to re-examine the Ordonnances and on 18 September it voted in support of Calvin—excommunication was within the jurisdiction of the Consistory. Berthelier applied for reinstatement to another Genevan administrative assembly, the Deux Cents (Two Hundred), in November. This body reversed the council's decision and stated that the final arbiter concerning excommunication should be the council. The ministers continued to protest, and {{as in the case of}} Servetus, the opinions of the Swiss churches were sought. The affair dragged on through 1554. Finally, on 22 January 1555, the council announced the decision of the Swiss churches: the original Ordonnances were to be kept and the Consistory was to regain its official powers.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> needed in the office {{if there is a}} crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E

60|$|Paulvitch {{licked his}} lips in anticipatory joy, and urged his tired legs to greater speed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> too late to the ship's {{anchorage}} {{to carry out his}} designs.|$|R
60|$|John gave {{only one}} piece of advice, namely, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should consign a fixed sum for {{household}} expenses into his wife's hands; so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> subject to continued applications.|$|R
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the marathon, all the {{entrants}} of {{the race}} except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted. Edström's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition. However, Finland maintained {{that as long as the}} athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially. Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier, Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes. The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote. However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm. Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status, and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden. A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international. After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{head coach}} Slavoljub Muslin brought Žigić into Red Star's senior squad for the 2003–04 First League season, {{and gave him}} his debut in the {{starting}} eleven on the opening day. That first game ended in defeat, and Žigić's physical appearance– a growth spurt {{from the age of}} 16 had brought his height to – provoked suggestions <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> better suited to basketball. He scored the second goal as they beat Hajduk Kula 2–0 in the next league match. In between, he produced a hat-trick against Nistru in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup qualifying round, and went on to contribute a further three goals as Red Star beat Odense 6–5 on aggregate in the first round. He scored twice in the 3–0 win in the Eternal Derby against Partizan, and celebrated by miming a basketball shot. By the mid-season break, he had 12 league goals as well as the 6 in the UEFA Cup, and was named Player of the Year for 2003, both by the captains of the First League teams voting via the Večernje novosti newspaper and by the Football Association. He finished the season as the league's top scorer, with 18, as Red Star won their 23rd title, and scored the winning goal in the cup final.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, {{and he had been}} talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> on the verge of transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E
