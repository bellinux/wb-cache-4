Shonda Rhimes spoke on Ramirez's abrupt departure, saying, [...] "This one was different because it wasn’t a big planned <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a different plan going and when Sara came in and said, ‘I really need to take this break,’ I was lucky that we’d shot {{the end of the season}} with her going to New York.” ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1999, Javie was {{the only}} one of fifteen referees to be acquitted of tax evasion charges as a result of not {{reporting}} income he received by downgrading airline tickets provided by the league. [...] Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. [...] He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. [...] Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, [...] "My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is the most important <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to fight for my name." [...] During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. [...] He later described the trial as [...] "the hardest two weeks" [...] of his life.|$|E
500|$|Ramsey joined Ipswich {{just after}} the club's relegation from the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1954–55 season, the team's only year above the third tier up to that point. To quote McKinstry, Ipswich had neither [...] "glittering {{pedigree}} or status" [...] nor [...] "strong footballing tradition"—the club had joined the Football League only in 1938, and its home ground at Portman Road was small and basic. One of the team's advantages was the patronage of the aristocratic Cobbold brewing family, to which the chairman and much of the club hierarchy belonged. [...] "I had no plan for Ipswich when I went there," [...] Ramsey later said. [...] "In fact the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do was to forget my set ideas on how football ought to be played. My experience had been in the First Division. I soon found that what I faced at Ipswich was very different." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{edition of}} October 1, 1990 of People {{included}} {{an interview with}} then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking {{at a picture of}} you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country.

500|$|Initially, Reitman {{had wanted}} to direct but had made only one film, Cannibal Girls, for $5,000. The film's {{producers}} approached Richard Lester and Bob Rafelson before considering John Landis, who got the director job based on his work on Kentucky Fried Movie. That film's script and continuity supervisor was the girlfriend of Sean Daniel, an assistant to Mount. Daniel saw Landis' movie and recommended him. Landis then met with Mount, Reitman and Simmons and got the job. Landis remembers, [...] "When I was given the script, it was the funniest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever read up to that time. But it was really offensive. There {{was a great deal}} of projectile vomiting and rape and all these things". There was also friction between Landis and the writers early on because Landis was a high-school dropout from Hollywood and they were college graduates from the East Coast. Ramis remembers, [...] "He sort of referred immediately to Animal House as 'my movie.' We'd been living with it for two years and we hated that". According to Landis, he drew inspiration from classic Hollywood comedies featuring the likes of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and the Marx Brothers.|$|E
500|$|Piller was {{disappointed}} with the following Ro episode, [...] "", as it {{put her in the}} position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of [...] "victories" [...] in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in [...] "". Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying [...] "When you have amnesia, you wonder if that brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out. Would you really be comfortable with that? It's an interesting <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a really good time with that episode." [...] Later in the season, [...] "The Next Phase" [...] was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode [...] "". This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times wrote, [...] "In glorifying {{those who}} are first, the second is often forgotten... Larry Doby {{integrated}} all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared. And {{he did it with}} class and clout." [...] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, [...] "Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear." [...] "Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it was the same <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. Nobody said, 'We're gonna be nice to the second Black,'" [...] Doby said.|$|E
500|$|Bowie met dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and {{enrolled}} in his dance {{class at the}} London Dance Centre. He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image [...] "really blossomed". [...] "He lived on his emotions, {{he was a wonderful}} influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus." [...] Studying the dramatic arts under Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, meanwhile, the Bowie-penned [...] "Over the Wall We Go" [...] became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie composition, [...] "Silly Boy Blue", was released by Billy Fury the following year. In January 1968, Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play The Pistol Shot in the Theatre 625 series, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale; the pair began dating, and moved into a London flat together. Playing acoustic guitar, Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime. Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway {{to take part in a}} film, Song of Norway; this affected him, and several songs, such as [...] "Letter to Hermione" [...] and [...] "Life on Mars?" [...] reference her, and for the video accompanying [...] "Where Are We Now?" [...] he wore a T-shirt with the words [...] "m/s Song of Norway". They were last together in January 1969 for the filming of Love You till Tuesday, a 30-minute film that was not released until 1984: intended as a promotional vehicle, it featured performances from Bowie's repertoire, including [...] "Space Oddity", which had not been released when the film was made.|$|E
500|$|Casting for {{the film}} began as soon as Madonna had signed up for it. Griffin Dunne was signed to play the part of Loudon Trott, a lawyer whose job was to help Nikki get on a bus, after she was released. Initially Madonna had thought of asking Penn to play the part of Detective Bellson, but Penn was serving a 60-day jail term, having {{violated}} the probation he received in 1986, for assaulting a friend of Madonna and attacking an extra {{on the set of}} At Close Range. The part went to Robert Swan, followed by the signing of John McMartin, Haviland Morris and Bibi Besch as Trott's father-in-law, fiancée, and mother-in-law [...] respectively. Madonna herself commented that she had a lot in common with the character Nikki. [...] "She's courageous and sweet and funny and misunderstood. But she clears her name in the last, and that's always good to do. I'm continuously doing that with the public. I liked Nikki's tough side and her sweet side. The toughness is only a mask for the vulnerability she feels inside." [...] Madonna was also offered the lead role in the Blake Edwards comedy film Blind Date opposite to Bruce Willis, but she refused it in favor of Slammer. She said, [...] "The <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> planned to do after Shanghai Surprise was Blind Date at Tri-Star. I was supposed to have the approval of the director and the leading man, but they didn't tell me they'd already hired Bruce Willis. That... just didn't work out. But I was really excited about doing a real physical, screwball comedy, so when Jamie brought this up, it was like my reward." [...] Coati Mundi, member of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and Madonna's long-time friend joined the cast {{to play the role of}} Raoul, Nikki's enemy. Costume designer Deborah Scott was signed to create the wardrobe {{for the film}}. Madonna, who visualized the character of Nikki as a dizzy screwball blond, started watching the screwball comedies of the sixties, especially the work of actors like Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and Judy Holiday. She asked Scott to create comical rah-rah and ballet tutu skirts for the character, with fishnet tights and loud make-up. Scott also designed a glamorous Monroe-esque dress for the love scene between her and Dunne.|$|E

Between 1994 and 1997, they released three albums under the label, Snuff the Punk, Brown and Payable on Death Live. Longtime manager Tim Cook was first introduced to the band when he booked them to play his club The Where-House in Bartlesville, Oklahoma following strong local word of mouth support.
