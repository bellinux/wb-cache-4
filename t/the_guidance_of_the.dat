5|$|Prior to 1966, air-pollution control {{had largely}} been the {{responsibility}} of states and political subdivisions of states like counties and municipalities (cities and towns). The federal government played little role in air-pollution control, {{and to the extent}} that it did, its actions supported the efforts of states and local governments. For example, federal law provided resources like research, training, grants to improve state and local programs, and a conference procedure to convene agencies and polluters under <b>the</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Direct regulations—such as, for example, setting emissions standards—were left to states.|$|E

A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E

5|$|The Athenians {{had also}} been {{preparing}} for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under <b>the</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Athenian politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians. However, the Athenians {{did not have the}} manpower to fight on land and sea; and therefore combating the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta. Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E

5|$|The Athenians sent 8,000 hoplites, led by Aristides, {{along with}} 600 Plataean exiles {{to join the}} Allied army. The army then marched in Boeotia across the passes of Mount Cithaeron, {{arriving}} near Plataea, and above the Persian position on the Asopus. Under <b>the</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commanding general, Pausanias, the Greeks took up position opposite the Persian lines but remained on high ground. Knowing that he had little hope of successfully attacking the Greek positions, Mardonius sought to either sow dissension among the Allies or lure them down into the plain. Plutarch reports that a conspiracy was discovered among some prominent Athenians, who were planning to betray the Allied cause; although this account is not universally accepted, it may indicate Mardonius' attempts of intrigue within the Greek ranks.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of Merseyside County Council (MCC) in 1974 brought new {{hope that the}} Albert Dock could be redeveloped, with the MCC placing a high priority on its development. They soon entered negotiations with the MDHC and in 1979 eventually negotiated a deal {{to take over the}} running of the south docks. Despite this seeming step forward political wrangling between the MDHC (the dock owners), Liverpool City Council (the local planning authority) and Merseyside County Council (the group now responsible for redeveloping the docks) continued to hinder any development plans. Fed up with the in fighting the newly elected Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher decided that the city was incapable of handling regeneration initiatives itself and under <b>the</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'Minister for Merseyside' Michael Heseltine, set up the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1981 to take over the responsibility of regenerating and redeveloping Liverpool's south docks.|$|E

In the past, Carre's has offered a range of {{clubs and societies}}, including ones for archaeology, aero-building, bird-watching, boxing, chess, cycling, drama, languages, geography, jazz and other music groups, a choir and orchestra, and student voice groups, like the student council.

Most pupils took part in its activities in World War II, under the lead of the History teacher, Major W. H. T. Walker; this included athletics competitions, shooting practice and trips to camp sites. It disbanded in c. 1963 when the two staff who ran it retired.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} wave of {{economic}} globalization began {{during the period}} of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of migration, enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers. During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them. The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under <b>the</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the United States, while most of the rest reached Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Brazil. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steam-powered boats over traditional sailing ships. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the telephone and wireless telegraphy (the precursor to radio) revolutionized telecommunication by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and Asia became connected through new landlines.|$|E
