50|$|William {{was also}} {{determined}} {{to create a}} unified people, even though the north and <b>the</b> <b>south</b> had drifted far apart culturally and economically since <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> reconquered by Spain after the Act of Abjuration of 1581.

5|$|The Home Farm {{buildings}} {{were built in}} the 1880s, split over two levels. To <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> a two-storey covered yard with a timber roof structure, used for the rearing of farm animals. On the upper level is the main yard, where to the east and west are two wings, one side of which housed the former piggery. The farm offices make up the north wing, to fully enclose the square but gently south-sloping yard.|$|E

25|$|Also, the {{political}} structure in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> not as {{organized in the}} north, so political groupings and parties from <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>were</b> not represented at the various conferences and talks that established the modern state of Sudan. As a result, many southerners do not consider Sudan to be a legitimate state.|$|R
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Twomile Run runs {{in approximately}} {{the same direction as}} the nearby Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline. To the north of the Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline is the Wellsboro Anticline and to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> the Hyner Dome. The Huling Branch valley is relatively straight and narrow.|$|E
5|$|Hillside Road, {{which runs}} {{parallel}} with South Road several hundred metres to <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>is</b> an arterial route connecting South Dunedin (at its eastern end) with Dunedin's southwestern suburbs. At its western end is Forbury Corner, a road junction linking Hillside Road with suburban arterial routes {{to the suburbs}} of Saint Clair (Forbury Road) and Corstorphine (Easther Crescent), as well as David Street, the major road link between Hillside Road and South Road. Numerous other small residential streets run parallel with David Street between Hillside Road and South Road. The suburb's other main roads include Caversham Valley Road, Playfair Street, Surrey Street, and Glen Road. The latter of these lies at the Glen at {{the eastern end of}} Caversham, providing a link between South Road and the hill suburbs of Maryhill, Balaclava, and Mornington.|$|E
5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} the Andean Central Volcanic Zone, {{which extends}} through the {{countries}} of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina and includes six or more Quaternary caldera or ignimbrite systems, about 44 stratovolcanoes, and over 18 smaller centres. One of these stratovolcanoes, Ojos del Salado, is the world's highest volcano. This zone also includes the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex and the Galan caldera farther south. Incapillo is the southernmost volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone with Pleistocene activity; the next such volcano to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> Tupungato in the Southern Volcanic Zone at 33° southern latitude.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>was</b> heavily rural {{as late as}} the 1940s, but now the {{population}} is increasingly concentrated in metropolitan areas. The following tables show the twenty largest cities, metropolitan, and combined statistical areas in <b>the</b> <b>South.</b> Houston <b>is</b> <b>the</b> largest city in <b>the</b> <b>South.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nearby is {{the former}} site of St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station. It opened in March 1884 but its close {{proximity}} to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938. It {{was used as an}} air raid shelter in the Second World War, but was destroyed by bombing in 1940. Opposite to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> the former Royal London Hospital building, built in 1740. The hospital suffered significant structural damage during the Second World War, but much of the 18th and 19th centuries architecture still remains. A new building now sits adjacent to the original.|$|E
5|$|On Election Day, Goldwater {{lost the}} {{election}} to Johnson by {{what was then the}} largest margin in history. Goldwater accumulated 52 electoral votes to Johnson's 486 and 39% of the popular vote (27,178,188) to Johnson's 61% (43,129,566). Goldwater carried six states: Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and his home state of Arizona. Goldwater's strong showing in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> largely due to his support of the white southern view on civil rights: that states should be able to control their own laws without federal intervention.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>is</b> overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).|$|E

25|$|The Patriot clergy in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>were</b> {{quick to}} find reasons to {{transfer}} their oaths to the American cause {{and prayed for}} the success of the Revolution. One precedent was the transfer of oaths during the Glorious Revolution in England. Most of the Patriot clergy in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>were</b> able to keep their churches open and services continued.|$|R
5|$|Patagonia, in <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>is</b> mostly arid or semi–arid {{except in}} the extreme west where {{abundant}} precipitation supports dense forest coverage, glaciers, and permanent snowfields. Its climate is classified as temperate to cool temperate with the surrounding oceans moderating temperatures on the coast. Away from the coast, areas on the plateaus have large daily and annual temperature ranges. The influence of the Andes, in conjunction with general circulation patterns, generates {{one of the strongest}} precipitation gradients (rate of change in mean annual precipitation in relation to a particular location) in the world, decreasing rapidly to the east. In much of Patagonia precipitation is concentrated in winter with snowfall occurring occasionally, particularly in the mountainous west and south; precipitation is more evenly distributed in the east and south. One defining characteristic is the strong winds from the west which blow year-round, lowering the perception of temperature (wind chill), while being a factor in keeping the region arid by favouring evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The bay's maximum deapth is , and in {{contrast}} to the Laguna Madre (aprx. 80 miles downcoast to <b>the</b> <b>south),</b> <b>is</b> not hypersaline. The Mission and Aransas Rivers are the main freshwater sources: small rivers with deep banks that carve through a landscape lined with hardwood trees. Their inflows increase during significant rainfall and reach their seasonal highs during the autumn. These rivers have not been dammed and thus flow free. At both mouths, marshes covering several square miles stretch from the confluences with Copano Bay and forming several saline lakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} owned and {{maintained}} by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, a conglomerate between Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. It has a main span of three lanes, which use a tidal flow arrangement to maximise traffic flow at rush hour, and two outer lanes. The north of these {{is used as a}} local access route from Saltash, while <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> used by cyclists and pedestrians, as it can no longer be used for vehicular traffic due to weight restrictions.|$|E
