5|$|POV (point of view) {{shots were}} done with the Tiger Moth biplane. During one such time {{at the end of}} summer, by which time the grass around Booker Airfield had turned brown, members of the effects team {{rectified}} the colour by applying green paint. Some time later, the production team received a message that a furious farmer's prize ram (an uncastrated sheep) had died, and when the animal was cut open, there was a large amount of green paint inside it. Concluding <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> but them were responsible for the death, the production team did a lot of explaining and funded the cost of the incident. Production manager Norman Foster gave the farmer's wife a big bunch of flowers.|$|E
25|$|These {{statements}} are in direct contradiction of Chief Walter Storm's assertion <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> but Heirens handled the note.|$|E
25|$|Her instinct, her mastery {{over the}} machine, was pure witchcraft. I cannot analyze this woman's acting. I only know <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> so {{effectively}} worked {{in front of}} a camera.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I!" [...] he answered. [...] "Nothing would every make {{a missionary}} of me, {{for good or}} for evil, {{for the simple reason}} <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else's</b> welfare except my own has the {{slightest}} concern for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you begin}} with that little sneer {{which has become}} so common with you. You {{must be aware of}} it. Amidst the {{troubles}} of your own life, which we all admit to be very grievous, there has come upon you a way of thinking <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else's</b> affairs can be of any importance." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{if indeed}} {{his eyes were}} touched with fire at <b>that</b> moment, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> in the world saw {{anything}} more of Miles Fentolin.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} argued <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> in history was as {{dedicated}} as Francis to imitate the life, and carry out the work of Christ, in Christ’s own way—Francis is sometimes even remembered as alter Christus, ("another Christ"). This is important in understanding Francis' character and his affinity for the Eucharist {{and respect for the}} priests who carried out the sacrament.|$|E
25|$|Linares {{received}} Mexico's National Arts and Sciences Award in the Popular Arts and Traditions {{category in}} 1990, {{two years before}} he died. This inspired other alebrije artists, and Linares’ work became prized both in Mexico and abroad. Rivera said <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> could have fashioned the strange figures he requested; work done by Linares for Rivera is now displayed at the Anahuacalli Museum in Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|Ben's {{truck was}} still in the parking lot the next morning, but with many summer {{visitors}} coming to enjoy the site's many water-based recreational opportunities and picnic grounds in addition to diving, the employees were (or later claimed to have been) too busy to notice. They did see the truck the next morning. After determining <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> had seen Ben, Taran called the Holmes County sheriff's office.|$|E
5000|$|President Barack Obama {{spoke to}} the debate between Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter. Obama said, [...] "I think that {{the reason that the}} {{organizers}} used the phrase Black Lives Matter was not because they were suggesting <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else's</b> lives matter ... rather what they were suggesting was there is a specific problem that is happening in the African-American community that's not happening in other communities." [...] He also said [...] "that is a legitimate issue that we've got to address." ...|$|R
60|$|But Ada had {{not held}} her tongue, and had {{declared}} <b>that</b> if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> were to know it--no one but Edith and the Captain himself--she {{would not be}} made miserable by it.|$|R
50|$|Liberty, therefore, is {{the right}} to do {{everything}} <b>that</b> harms <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else.</b> The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post.|$|R
25|$|When Ganthet duplicates {{the seven}} colored rings to deputize {{partners}} {{for each of}} the bearers, the violet ring chooses Wonder Woman as Carol's partner, deciding <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> has more love for the planet Earth. Wonder Woman was under the control of a black ring (from being one of numerous resurrected superheroes), but she and the violet ring's power are enough to break the black ring's hold, turning Wonder Woman into a Star Sapphire.|$|E
25|$|This {{icy water}} rescue {{is said to}} have {{exacerbated}} Peter's bladder problems and caused his death. The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler Jacob von Stählin is the only source for the story, and it seems unlikely <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> would have documented such an act of heroism. This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link.|$|E
25|$|Among the Timucua, a type {{of black}} drink was called cacina by the Spanish. The {{preparation}} and consumption of the drink were strictly limited to the community council house. Women (other than an occasional female chief) were normally excluded from the council house except for activities such as dances, but did prepare the cacina. In 1678 a bedridden cacica (a female chief) was given permission to brew and consume cacina in her house, on the condition <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> could be present while she did so.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, we were safely {{deposited}} {{in a particular}} drawer, {{along with a few}} other favorite articles, that, like our family, were reserved for the eyes of certain distinguished but absent customers. These specialites in trade are of frequent occurrence in Paris, and form a pleasant bond of union between the buyer and seller, which gives a particular zest to this sort of commerce, and not unfrequently a particular value to goods. To see <b>that</b> which <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> has seen, and to own <b>that</b> which <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> can own, are equally agreeable, and delightfully exclusive. All minds that do not possess the natural sources of exclusion, are fond of creating them by means of a subordinate and more artificial character.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have taken}} upon myself, sir," [...] Lisle said, [...] "to {{make all the}} {{arrangements}} for the funeral, seeing <b>that</b> there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> to do it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Báb {{eliminated}} {{any form}} of successorship or vicegerency from his religion and stated <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else's</b> writings would be authoritative after his death {{to the time of}} He Whom God shall make Manifest. [...] Some of the followers of Subh-i-Azal state that the Báb actually made Subh-i-Azal his vicegerent because the Báb in a tablet written to Azal stated that he should manifest the remaining paths of the Bayán if He Whom God shall make Manifest is made manifest during Azal's days. The Azalis interpret this to mean the Báb gave Sub-i-Azal the right to complete the unfinished text of the Bayán. [...] However, the Báb affirms to Subh-i-Azal himself that He Whom God shall make Manifest may appear in Subh-i-Azal's own lifetime, and thus eliminates any viceregency for Subh-i-Azal.|$|R
25|$|Hegel {{wanted to}} philosophize about Christianity {{but had no}} {{intention}} to ever become a Christian. For Climacus, the individual comes to {{know who he is}} by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will give meaning to his life. As an existing individual, who must come to terms with everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> will ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho-physical resources.|$|E
25|$|She {{goes with}} Brody to a {{memorial}} service for Walden at Langley, and tells him she wants to be with him. During the service, al-Qaeda operatives plant a bomb in Brody's car and detonate it, in an attack planned by Nazir in advance of his death. The blast kills Estes, Walden's family, and numerous senior government officials. Al-Qaeda also leaks Brody's confession video, thus framing him for the attack. Believing that Brody is innocent yet knowing <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> will, Carrie drives him over the Canada–US border and sets out to clear his name.|$|E
25|$|To give an example, two chess players {{might be}} engaged in a bitter {{struggle}} at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).|$|E
50|$|While Gerard {{is looking}} at a {{pictorial}} account of Napoleon's life on a magic lantern, Napoleon tells him {{the story of what}} really happened. It seems <b>that</b> Gerard, if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else,</b> believes Napoleon's story.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to Margaret being Oliver Hilditch's widow," [...] Francis replied, [...] "you were {{responsible}} for <b>that,</b> and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else.</b> He was your protege; you gave your consent to the marriage. As to your being her father, that again is not Margaret's fault. I should marry her if Oliver Hilditch had been three times the villain he was, {{and if you were}} the Devil himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I meant you!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I {{thought that}} you knew <b>that!</b> There is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else.</b> You are my friend, I know very well, for you came and spoke kindly to me when I was terrified--terrified to death." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{bridge is}} the subject of several local legends. Its {{construction}} was said to have been financed by the two Bellamont sisters. Both had become engaged and were to throw a joint celebration; their fiancés, however, had to meet with the local barons {{on the far side of}} the river. Following a storm the Trent became swollen. Eager to return to their brides-to-be and their party, the men tried to ford the river on horseback. Both were swept away and drowned. The Bellamont sisters commissioned the bridge so <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> would suffer the tragedy they had suffered. Neither sister married and both died in poverty having exhausted their fortune on building the bridge.|$|E
25|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} {{to get the}} film made, Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando were originally considered for the roles of Duke and Gonzo but they both grew too old. Afterward, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were considered for the duo, but that fell apart when Belushi died. John Malkovich was later considered {{for the role of}} Duke, but he grew too old too. At one point John Cusack was almost cast (Cusack had previously directed the play version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, with his brother playing Duke). However, after Hunter S. Thompson met with Johnny Depp he became convinced <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> could play him. When Cox and Davies started writing the screenplay, Depp and del Toro committed to starring in the film.|$|E
500|$|Aboard {{the ship}} Advenna Avis in 1711, {{a group of}} alchemists summon a demon {{in the hopes of}} gaining eternal life. The demon gives them an elixir of {{immortality}} and the method of ending their existence, by [...] "devouring" [...] one another, and grants the summoner Maiza Avaro the formula of the elixir. Maiza and most of the alchemists decide <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> must become immortal; only Szilard Quates opposes. That night, the alchemists begin to disappear, devoured by Szilard. Realizing the threat posed by staying together, they scatter across the globe.|$|E
60|$|Geraldine {{perceived}} and was secretly amused. Of course all the party dined at the castle on Saturday night, and heard some lamentations <b>that</b> there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> {{to meet the}} distinguished guests, for the young doctor was not thought worthy.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, {{when he was}} 76, {{he proved}} he still had his {{courtroom}} skills winning a $3.4 million jury verdict in an ATV case <b>that</b> virtually <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> in the country {{had been able to}} win despite numerous attempts. In 2014, at the age of 77, he won a $12.6 million jury verdict in an automobile accident case, and in 2016 (age 79), he was named national Trial Lawyer of the Year.|$|R
5000|$|Senor WencesSenor Wences {{forever changed}} the way people looked at ventriloquism. He often used a {{combination}} of ventriloquism, magic and juggling, having appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show {{a record number of}} times. Historian Tom Ladshaw stated, “So he had these various talents and he put them together in this bizarre mixture <b>that</b> probably <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> in the world ever would have come up with. And today we describe it as surrealist in nature.” ...|$|R
500|$|Although Nash's {{high school}} coach, Ian Hyde-Lay, sent letters of inquiry and {{highlight}} reels on Nash's behalf to over 30 American universities, Nash was not recruited by any university, until Santa Clara coach Dick Davey requested video {{footage of the}} young guard. After watching Nash in person, Davey said he [...] "was nervous as hell just hoping <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> would see him. It didn't take a Nobel Prize winner to figure out this guy's pretty good. It was just a case of hoping {{that none of the}} big names came around." [...] However, Davey also told Nash that he was [...] "the worst defensive player" [...] he had ever seen.|$|E
500|$|In March 1966, Smythe {{sold his}} {{remaining}} shares and {{resigned from the}} board of directors after a Muhammad Ali boxing match was scheduled for the Gardens. He found Ali's refusal to serve in the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War to be offensive, because, as he put it in his autobiography [...] "The Gardens was founded by men – sportsmen – who fought for their country. It is no place for those want to evade conscription in their own country. The Gardens was built for many things, but not for picking up things <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> wants." [...] He also said that by accepting the fight, Gardens owners had [...] "put cash ahead of class." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Henry {{played up}} front as a striker during his youth, {{he spent his}} time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger {{immediately}} changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp. During the 2004–05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to 4–5–1. This change forced Henry to adapt again {{to fit into the}} Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker. Still, Henry remained Arsenal's main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman: [...] "Thierry Henry could take the ball {{in the middle of the}} park and score a goal <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> in the world could score".|$|E
5|$|During these episodes, Stephen feels {{lonely and}} writes to Isabelle, feeling <b>that</b> there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> {{to whom he}} can express his feelings. He writes about his fears that he will die, and confesses that he has only ever loved her.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} for PopMatters John Garratt states [...] "Henry Threadgill {{may be in}} his early 70s, but he {{continues}} to make music <b>that</b> sounds like <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else.</b> Even when he branches out and doesn’t quite sound like himself, he remains inimitable to a startling degree." ...|$|R
2500|$|Curtis {{originally}} {{stated that}} his employer, Yang Enterprises, specifically {{told him that}} he had been asked to develop code not to test voting security, but in order to commit vote fraud. [...] "Her words were that it was needed to control the vote in West Palm Beach, Florida," [...] Curtis said. [...] "Once she said, 'We need to steal an election,' that put me back. I made it clear that I could not produce code that could do <b>that</b> and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> should." ...|$|R
