Airdried specimens of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. DON), hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa ENDL.), and hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla SARG.) were used in this study, and were cut by feeding a tool, which was set on the same experimental apparatus equipped with a three-dimensional elastic-ring dynamometer as used in the previous reports 3), 4). The lateral (Fx), main (Fy), and thrust (Fz) components of the cutting force acting on the tool were measured. Using the measured components mensioned above, <b>the</b> <b>resultants</b> (R and Ro) were calculated. In addition to the measurements of the components and <b>the</b> <b>resultants,</b> <b>the</b> deformation of the chip and the roughness of the workpiece cutting-surface were observed and measured.

5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E
