40|$|Background Emergency admissions <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> {{at night}} and {{weekends}} are distressing for patients and disruptive for hospitals. Many of these admissions result from referrals from GP out-of-hours (OOH) providers. Aim To compare rates of referral <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> for doctors working OOH {{before and after the}} new general medical services contract was introduced in Bristol in 2005; to explore the attitudes of GPs <b>to</b> referral <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> OOH; and <b>to</b> develop an understanding of the factors that influence GPs when they refer patients <b>to</b> <b>hospital.</b> Design of study Cross-sectional comparison of admission rates; postal survey...|$|R

Downtown Houston was inundated with flooding, causing severe damage <b>to</b> <b>hospitals</b> and businesses. Twenty-three people died in Texas.

The Anglican St. Lukes hospital and the National Hospital were built in 1900 and 1910 respectively. In addition <b>to</b> <b>hospitals,</b> Nablus contains the al-Rahma and at-Tadamon clinics, the al-Razi medical center, the Amal Center for Rehabilitation and 68 pharmacies.

40|$|Out-of-hospital {{cardiac arrest}} (OHCA) due to {{sustained}} ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is common and often lethal. Patient's co-morbidities may determine survival after OHCA, and be instrumental in post-resuscitation care, but are poorly studied. We aimed to study whether patients with obstructive pulmonary disease (OPD) {{have a lower}} survival rate after OHCA than non-OPD patients. We performed a community-based cohort study of 1172 patients with non-traumatic OHCA with ECG-documented VT/VF between 2005 and 2008. We compared survival to emergency room (ER), <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> admission, <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> discharge, and at 30 days after OHCA, of OPD-patients and non-OPD patients, using logistic regression analysis. We also compared 30 -day survival of patients who were admitted <b>to</b> <b>hospital,</b> using multivariate logistic regression analysis. OPD patients (n= 178) and non-OPD patients (n= 994) had comparable survival to ER (75 % vs. 78 %, OR 0. 9 [95 % CI: 0. 6 - 1. 3]) and <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> admission (56 % vs. 57 %, OR 1. 0 [0. 7 - 1. 4]). However, survival <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> discharge was significantly lower among OPD patients (21 % vs. 33 %, OR 0. 6 [0. 4 - 0. 9]). Multivariate regression analysis among patients who were admitted <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> (OPD: n= 100, no OPD: n= 561) revealed that OPD was an independent determinant of reduced 30 -day survival rate (39 % vs. 59 %, adjusted OR 0. 6 [0. 4 - 1. 0, p= 0. 035]). OPD-patients had lower survival rates after OHCA than non-OPD patients. Survival to ER and <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> admission was not different between both groups. However, among OHCA victims who survived <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> admission, OPD was an independent determinant of reduced 30 -day survival rat...|$|R

5|$|Cumulative {{friendly}} casualties for Operation Scotland, {{which began}} on 1 November 1967, were: 205 killed in action, 1,668 wounded, and 25 missing and presumed dead. These figures {{do not include}} casualties among Special Forces troops at Lang Vei, aircrews killed or missing in the area or Marine replacements killed or wounded while entering or exiting the base aboard aircraft. As far as North Vietnamese casualties were concerned, 1,602 bodies were counted, seven prisoners were taken, and two soldiers defected to allied forces during the operation. American intelligence estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 NVA troops were killed during the operation, equating to up to 90% of the attacking 17,200 men NVA force. The NVA acknowledged 2,500 men killed in action.

5|$|Owing to its {{international}} connections, Charing Cross {{played an important}} part in World War I as the main departure point for both the military and government towards the Western Front. All civilian and public boat services were suspended on 3 August 1914.

Over the course of the war, 283 journeys departed from the station. On 26 December 1918, shortly after the war, the US President Woodrow Wilson met King George V at Charing Cross. Commercial cross-Channel services resumed to Ostend on 18 January 1919, Bolougne on 3 February and Calais on 8 January 1920, but by this time, Victoria had been expanded to accommodate the strict wartime immigration and customs checks, and Charing Cross ceased to be important as an international terminal.|$|E

40|$|Background: In 1996 {{the number}} of deaths and admissions <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> in Canada that could be {{attributed}} to the use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs were esti-mated from 1992 data. In this paper we update these estimates to the year 1995. Methods: On the basis of pooled estimates of relative risk, etiologic fractions were calculated by age, sex and province for 90 causes of disease or death attribut-able to alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs; the etiologic fractions were then applied to national mortality and morbidity data for 1995 to estimate {{the number of}} deaths and admissions <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> attributable <b>to</b> substance abuse. Results: In 1995, 6507 deaths and 82 014 admissions <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> were attributed <b>to</b> alcohol, 34 728 deaths and 194 072 admissions <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> were attributed <b>to</b> tobacco, and 805 deaths and 6940 admissions <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> were due <b>to</b> illicit drugs.
