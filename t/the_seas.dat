5|$|The procellariids {{are present}} in all the world's oceans and most of <b>the</b> <b>seas.</b> They are absent from the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, but are present year round or {{seasonally}} in the rest. <b>The</b> <b>seas</b> north of New Zealand are the centre of procellariid biodiversity, with the most species. Among the four groups, the fulmarine petrels have a mostly polar distribution, with most species living around Antarctica and one, the northern fulmar ranging in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The prions are restricted to the Southern Ocean, and the gadfly petrels are found mostly in the tropics with some temperate species. The shearwaters are the most widespread group and breed in most temperate and tropical seas, although by a biogeographical quirk are absent as breeders from the North Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{potential}} for tropical cyclone development, Météo-France declared yellow cyclone alerts for Guadeloupe and Martinique, warning of imminent squally weather. Due {{to the presence of}} Emily, a state of emergency was declared for all of Puerto Rico. Officials ordered the preparation of over 400 storm shelters and ensured adequate water supply. The morning before the storm, government workers were dismissed, and national courtrooms remained closed. The United States Coast Guard issued a statement urging residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to avoid recreational boating and swimming until Emily had passed. JetBlue Airways waived fees for flights into the Dominican Republic because of the inclement weather conditions. Four cruise ships, Oasis of <b>the</b> <b>Seas,</b> Freedom of <b>the</b> <b>Seas,</b> Carnival Dream and Carnival Liberty altered their courses through the Caribbean to avoid the storm.|$|E
5|$|By 1700, the European {{states had}} enough troops and ships at their disposal, {{following}} {{the end of}} a number of wars, to begin better protecting their important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas, without relying on the aid of privateers.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the expected increase in cargo traffic, the Port of Miami recently stated that October 2010 was its busiest October ever for cruise vacations. The port had a record 346,513 cruise passengers that October, up 29% from October 2009. This follows a record year in cruise traffic, with 4.15 million cruise passengers in the 12 months that ended in September. This is partially due {{to the arrival of}} new cruise ships such as the Norwegian Epic, as well as the cruise line Costa Cruises. Despite this, the Port of Miami has recently been losing cruise and cargo traffic to nearby Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale. In 2010, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which is headquartered in Miami, chose Port Everglades as home for its new cruise ships, Oasis of <b>the</b> <b>Seas</b> and Allure of <b>the</b> <b>Seas,</b> currently the largest cruise ships in the world.|$|E
