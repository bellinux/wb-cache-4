Across two studies, subtle cues of both supernatural and earthly social support reduced <b>the</b> <b>envisioned</b> physical formidability of a violent criminal. These manipulations had no effect on the perceived likelihood of encountering non-conflictual physical danger, raising the possibility that imagined supernatural support leads participants to view themselves not as shielded from encountering perilous situations, but as protected should perils arise...|$|R

5000|$|The {{announcement}} {{about selling}} the Chinese-built vehicle to American consumers has drawn a backlash from the United Auto Workers, {{who had just}} finalized a contract agreement with GM and had wanted the automaker to build <b>the</b> <b>Envision</b> stateside: “Today’s announcement by General Motors that they are importing <b>the</b> <b>Envision</b> from China is {{a slap in the}} face to U.S. taxpayers and the men and women who worked so hard to save GM during its darkest time,” UAW President Dennis Williams and Vice President Cindy Estrada, who head the GM department for the union, said in a joint statement on December 4, 2015. On the other hand, Buick spokesman Stuart Fowle defended the decision to keep production in China and import it rather than having it built in the United States because it made sense from a business point of view: “We have production already going (in China) and adding a second manufacturing facility for the volumes that we would expect in the U.S. just wasn’t feasible,” he said. “We wanted to take advantage of the manufacturing already in place. We’re very confident in the vehicle.” ...|$|E
