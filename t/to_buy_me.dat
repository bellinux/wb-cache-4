[...] He complained of money men [...] "who want <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>me</b> piecemeal" [...] and that [...] "an illustration must be made practical, not only in its dramatic statement, but it must be a thing that will adapt itself to the engravers' and printers' limitations.

I've covered a lot in my 20 years. And I've uncovered a lot" [...] in its intro. The opening song, second single [...] "So Excited" [...] featuring rapper Khia, is a hip hop track which samples the drum break and turntable scratches from Herbie Hancock's 1983 song [...] "Rockit". In the song, Jackson promises submission for her lover, singing, [...] "If you like it then I’ll do it/I’ll go head to toe" [...] and [...] "I'm-a keep your body thumping, baby".

The fourth song, [...] "Get It Out Me", is a dance song which was noted to feature Jackson's vocals sounding like her brother Michael's ones. [...] The following song is [...] "Do It 2 Me". It marks a return to Jackson's conversational style; in the song, She is searching for her lover: [...] "My first and only call is to you, time after time, babe, throughout my life". Its music is punctuated by handclaps and by low swoops of a string section. Sixth song [...] "This Body" [...] lyrically is about men who have appreciation with Jackson's appearances in magazines. She addresses her fans in the line [...] "Just had <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>me,</b> had to try me, oooh, you're in love with the hottest girl in the magazine". The song brings sinuous and dark beats incorporating a rhythmic pattern of heavy breathing and the sound of a jet taking off, which was noted to be a metaphor.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Bourguiba {{settled in}} the bourgeois {{neighborhood}} of Tourbet el Bey, in the medina of Tunis, where his brother M'hamed rented a housing on Korchani Street. Interpreter at the State section, he was often off to work or studying in the Khaldounia, aiming to prepare {{the first half of}} the French baccalaureate. This left Habib with Dhaouia, M'hamed's servant who made Habib her domestic She made him do household chores or buy groceries and took him with her whenever she went visiting families in order to select a suitable wife for M'hamed. At the start of the 1907 school year, his brother enrolled him in the Sadiki elementary school. The superintendent described him as turbulent but studious. The young Habib had to perfect Quran learnings, that being the main lessons taught. That made him spend weekends studying and learning Quran with his brother Mahmoud, shouting and screaming being Mahmoud's teaching method. [...] "To go to school", he recalled, [...] "I had to go by foot. Leaving the house where I lived and which belonged to the grandfather of Tahar Lakhdar, I crossed the souks and climbed the hill of Sidi Ben Arous. I was poorly dressed. My shoes had holes which filled with water. By pride, I refused to ask my older brother <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>me</b> a new pair. That was my life throughout my primary education". The Husainid family members being the only ones allowed to take lunch inside the school, Bourguiba had to go home and eat Dhaouia's ratatouilles that did not put an end to his hunger. It was only during the 1911 epidemic of Cholera which killed M'hamed's wife, that he was able to eat his fill, thanks to the Couscous destined for guests, narrowly avoiding starvation.|$|E
