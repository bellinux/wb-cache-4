25|$|An {{important}} {{distinction between the}} southern Canadian seal hunt and the Inuit Canadian hunt is that Canadian Inuit typically hunt ringed seals, while the southern Canadian hunt targets the pelt of the harp seal. Greenlandic Inuit hunt and eat both ringed and harp seals. Unfortunately, protests surrounding the southern seal hunt in Canada have historically damaged the financial well-being of both Canadian and Greenlandic Inuit more than it has the hunting of harp seals. Because of the strongly emotional nature of the protest, profits surrounding the Inuit hunting of ringed seal fall with any ban on any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> product, regardless of exemption. For example, in 1963, prices for high-quality pelts of ringed seals could reach above $20.00 each; these same pelts in 1967, {{the year of the}} first major protests, would only sell for $2.50 each, which threatened the survival of Inuit in many areas. Several protests in other years have resulted in similar decreases in price.|$|E

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in Wisconsin from 1994 through 1996 in several boreholes using an ultrasonic method that was developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to assess the integrity <b>of</b> annular <b>seals.</b> Initially, three model boreholes simulating monitoring wells were installed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the ultrasonic method. Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> were placed around the casings and defects were purposely introduced in the seals to test the ultrasonic method.

50|$|Gap seals are {{generally}} used in bearings and other constructions highly susceptible to wear, for example, {{in the form}} of an O-ring. A clearance seal is used to close or fill (and join) spacing between two parts, e.g. in machine housings, to allow for the vibration of those parts. An example of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> is the so-called floating seal which can be easily replaced.

50|$|An {{end face}} {{mechanical}} seal, {{also referred to}} as a mechanical face seal but usually simply as a mechanical seal, is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> utilised in rotating equipment, such as pumps, mixers, blowers, and compressors. When a pump operates, the liquid could leak out of the pump between the rotating shaft and the stationary pump casing. Since the shaft rotates, preventing this leakage can be difficult. Earlier pump models used mechanical packing (otherwise known as Gland Packing) to seal the shaft. Since World War II, mechanical seals have replaced packing in many applications.|$|E

In chemical plants, pumps {{have traditionally been}} [...] "throw-away" [...] items as chemical attack limits life.

Unless the pump user upgrades the seal chamber, the pump only accommodates more compact and simple versions. Without this upgrading, lifetimes in chemical installations are generally around 50 to 60 percent of the refinery values.|$|E
50|$|The term bulla was {{eventually}} applied to seals {{made out of}} metal. Although the most typical form of bulla was made of lead, it was sometimes made of gold, as the ones affixed to the several Golden Bulls issued by the Byzantine Emperors, Holy Roman Emperors, and various other monarchs in the Middle Ages. A particularly famous type of lead bulla is the one affixed to important documents issued by the Pope, called Papal bulls for the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>seal,</b> where the bulla has an image of Saints Peter and Paul {{on one side and}} the name of the issuing Pope on the other.|$|E
50|$|This {{internal}} basal lamina of the EA is continuous {{with the}} external basal lamina between the junctional epithelium and the lamina propria at the apical {{extent of the}} JE. The EA is very strong in a healthy state, acting as a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> between the soft gingival tissue and the hard tooth surface. The deepest layer of the JE, or basal layer, undergoes constant and rapid cell division, or mitosis. This process allows a constant coronal migration as the cells die and are shed into the gingival sulcus. The few layers present in the JE — from its basal layer to the suprabasal, or superficial, layer — does not show any change in cellular appearance related to maturation, unlike other types of gingival tissue. Thus, the JE does not mature like keratinized tissue, such as the marginal gingiva or attached gingiva, which fills its matured superficial cells with keratin.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the possibility of using the Bleached Kraft wastewater sludges as a sealant to a permeable soil structure which could contain these liquids. The sludges used are either self-contained in wastewater, produced from treatment processes, or from the addition of chemical coagulant to the wastewater. The mechanisms <b>of</b> the sludge <b>sealing</b> phenomena which were investigated individually are divided into physical, physico-chemical, biophysical and bio-physico-chemical <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals.</b> Coarse sand # 24 was found suitable for this sealing study as a particle size cut. Among the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> sealings studied, the bio-physical <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> is the most effective. The physico-chemical <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> is effective in the initial stage <b>of</b> <b>sealing.</b> The coefficient <b>of</b> the permeability is reduced from an average of 6. 4 x 10 ('- 2) cm/sec to 1. 0 x 10 ('- 6) cm/sec in a period of 24 hours, with a risk of leakage of less than 1 % of the total effluent. A long-term stability of using sludges as a liner to the wastewater pond has become a substantial issue. Alum was originally chosen as an effective coagulant for forming a layer of sludge for physico-chemical <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>sealing.</b> However, after the stability analyses, one finds that alum sludge is not a stable material under commonly-found hydrostatic pressures and high pH ranges. The results of the research shows that one of the alumino-silicate sludges is much more stable than that of alum sludge. The relatively stable alumino-silicate sludge was obtained from one of the coprecipitations of sodium-silicate and sodium aluminate in a BKME solution. The economic impact of using alumino-silicate sludge is significant. The cost comparison study shows a cost ratio in the range of up to 1 : 10 as compared to conventional lining material. The results can be used for the implementation of field work in sludge sealing practice. In addition, this investigation could form an excellent foundation for further studies on other effluents with different parameters...|$|R

40|$|A {{functioning}} SOFC requires different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> such as metal-metal, metal-ceramic, and ceramic-ceramic. These {{seals must}} function at high temperatures between 600 [...] 900 {sup o}C and in oxidizing and reducing environments of the fuels and air.

40|$|The {{space station}} is being {{developed}} for a service life of up to thirty years. As a consequence, the design requirements for the seals to be used are unprecedented. Full scale testing to assure the selected seals can satisfy the design requirements are not feasible. As an alternative, a sub-scale test program (2) has been developed by MSFC to calibrate the analysis tools {{to be used to}} certify the proposed design. This research has been conducted in support of the MSFC Integrated Seal Test Program. The ultimate objective of this research is to correlate analysis and test results to qualify the analytical tools which in turn, are to be used to qualify the flight hardware. Seals are simple devices, in wide spread use. The most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> is the O-ring. O-ring seals are typically rings of rubber with a circular cross section.
