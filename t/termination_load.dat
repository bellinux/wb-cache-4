40|$|A quarter {{wavelength}} side branch resonator {{has been widely}} used as a reactive type silencer to attenuate pressure pulsation in hydraulic circuit. The structure of this conventional silencer is very simple and therefore it is a useful device in terms of cost efficiency. However, it {{is also known as}} a rather narrow frequency banded resonator that only attenuates the odd order harmonics of the pressure pulsation. In this study, the attenuation performance of side branch resonator in the hydraulic line is examined numerically by changing the parameters such as the insertion location of side branch and the length of connecting pipe between the side branch and <b>termination</b> <b>load</b> of circuits. The level of attenuation is accessed by insertion loss which is defined as the ratio of overall amplitude harmonics of pressure pulsation with and without the side branch.

40|$|Novel {{criteria}} are presented for small- and large-signal stability analysis of microwave circuits under output mismatch effects. They {{are based on}} concepts from bifurcation theory, which enable the derivation of general equations for the stability boundaries that depend on the <b>termination</b> <b>load.</b> The boundary calculation does not require any optimization of the circuit parameters. Instead, {{it is based on}} the direct calculation of an admittance function obtained through circuit linearization about either the dc solution, in the small-signal stability analysis, or the periodic solution, in the large-signal one, with low computational cost. As will be demonstrated both with homotopy and bifurcation concepts, the Hopf locus obtained in this way delimits a stable region and a potentially unstable one. In a large-signal stability analysis, the sidebands that influence the stability properties are identified, which depend on the particular amplifier topology and its filtering effects. The stability boundaries are then calculated with the conversion matrix approach for all load impedance values at the relevant harmonic and sideband frequencies. For the derivation of absolute stability conditions, a new scattering type matrix is proposed describing the circuit response from the output reference plane with respect to the two sidebands about the input carrier.

The main subject of the thesis is a sideband separating (2 SB) receiver for 85 - 115 GHz based on a quadrature scheme with two identical SIS mixer junctions pumped by a LO applied with 90 ° phase difference. The design {{is based on a}} layout where the quadrature scheme is implemented using waveguide based and integrated on chip components. This type of scheme requires balanced power division for both LO and RF channels. The key component in the mixer is a waveguide to microstrip double probe transition used as a power divider to split the input RF signal and to provide transition from waveguide to microstrip line. The double probe transition enables the integration of all mixer components on a single compact substrate. The design also involves coupled lines directional couplers to introduce the LO power to the mixer junctions with the required phase delay. Additional SIS junctions are used to provide <b>termination</b> <b>load</b> for the idle port of the couplers. The design of all mixer components is presented in detail together with different techniques used in the calculations. The measurement methods specific for the 2 SB mixer are described and illustrated with examples from real mixer measurements. Extensive mixer tests were carried out to characterize the mixer by measuring its single sideband noise temperature and sideband separation. The best single sideband noise temperature is below 40 K with a sideband suppression ratio above 12 dB for upper and lower sidebands.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{development}} was to validate {{the use of the}} external Rover Ultra High Frequency (RUHF) antenna for space under extreme thermal environments to be encountered during the surface operations of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. The antenna must survive all ground operations plus the nominal 670 Martian sol mission that includes summer and winter seasons of the Mars thermal environment. The qualification effort was to verify that the RUHF antenna design and its bonding and packaging processes are adequate to survive the harsh environmental conditions. The RUHF is a quadrifilar helix antenna mounted on the MSL Curiosity rover deck. The main components of the RUHF antenna are the helix structure, feed cables, and hybrid coupler, and the high-power <b>termination</b> <b>load.</b> In the case of MSL rover externally mounted hardware, not only are the expected thermal cycle depths severe, but there are temperature offsets between the Mars summer and winter seasons. The total number of temperature cycles needed to be split into two regimes of summer cycles and winter cycles. The qualification test was designed to demonstrate a survival life of three times more than all expected ground testing, plus a nominal 670 Martian sol missions. Baseline RF tests and a visual inspection were performed {{prior to the start of}} the qualification test. Functional RF tests were performed intermittently during chamber breaks over the course of the qualification test. For the RF return loss measurements, the antenna was tested in a controlled environment outside the thermal chamber with a vector network analyzer that was calibrated over the antenna s operational frequency range. A total of 2, 010 thermal cycles were performed. Visual inspection showed a dulling of the solder material. This change will not affect the performance of the antenna. No other changes were observed. RF tests were performed on the RUHF helix antenna, hybrid, and load after the 2, 010 qualification cycles test. The RF performance of the RUHF antenna, hybrid, and load were almost identical before and after the complete test. Therefore, the developed design of RUHF is qualified for a long-duration MSL mission. The RUHF antenna has not been used for long-duration missions such as MSL in the past. The state-of-the-art technology of the RUHF antenna is used to develop the antennas for MSL mission survivability.
