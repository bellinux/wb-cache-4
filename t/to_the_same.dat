5|$|In {{terms of}} the {{implication}} graph, two literals belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> strongly connected component whenever there exist chains of implications from one literal {{to the other and}} vice versa. Therefore, the two literals must have the same value in any satisfying assignment to the given 2-satisfiability instance. In particular, if a variable and its negation both belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> strongly connected component, the instance cannot be satisfied, because it is impossible to assign both of these literals the same value. As Aspvall et al. showed, this is a necessary and sufficient condition: a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if there is no variable that belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> strongly connected component as its negation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not only}} {{receptive}} fields that define the microzone structure: The climbing fiber input from the inferior olivary nucleus is equally important. The branches of a climbing fiber (usually numbering about 10) usually activate Purkinje cells belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> microzone. Moreover, olivary neurons that send climbing fibers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> microzone tend to be coupled by gap junctions, which synchronize their activity, causing Purkinje cells within a microzone to show correlated complex spike activity on a millisecond time scale. Also, the Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone all send their axons <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> small cluster of output cells within the deep cerebellar nuclei. Finally, the axons of basket cells are much longer in the longitudinal direction than in the mediolateral direction, causing them to be confined largely to a single microzone. The consequence of all this structure is that cellular interactions within a microzone are much stronger than interactions between different microzones.|$|E

50|$|Mussolini {{argued that}} {{although}} Italian Fascism {{did not support}} dynamic and heroic capitalism, he appreciated it for its contribution to industrialism and technical developments but claimed {{that he did not}} support or appreciate supercapitalism, which he claimed was incompatible with Italy's agricultural sector. Mussolini strongly criticized this stage of supercapitalism, saying:At this stage, supercapitalism finds its inspiration and its justification in a utopia: the utopia of unlimited consumption. Supercapitalism's ideal is the standardization of the human race from <b>the</b> cradle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grave. Supercapitalism wants all babies to be born exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> length so that the cradles can be standardized and all children persuaded <b>to</b> like <b>the</b> <b>same</b> toys. It wants all men <b>to</b> don <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> uniform, <b>to</b> read <b>the</b> <b>same</b> book, <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tastes in films, and <b>to</b> desire <b>the</b> <b>same</b> so-called labor-saving devices. This is not the result of caprice. It inheres in the logic of events, for only thus can supercapitalism make its plans.|$|R
