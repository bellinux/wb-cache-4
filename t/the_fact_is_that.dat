25|$|To this remark, the Buddha {{tells them}} that the Brahmins have indeed {{forgotten}} about their past if they said such things. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the women in the}} Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children. But the Brahmins still say that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue. The Buddha said that the Brahmins are not speaking truthfully and they will reap a bad result from their own deeds.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} change of command directly affecting the forts {{took place on}} October 17, 1861, when Brigadier General Thomas F.

25|$|It {{may seem}} a vast {{depletion}} of the downtown shopping area, it now having only one department store, the Hudson's Bay Company.

Reaching a balance between convenience for residents of Regina and the desire to make the city appealing and impressive is not a novelty.|$|E
25|$|The first British {{synchronizer}} gear {{was built}} by the manufacturer of the machine-gun {{for which it was}} designed: it went into production in December 1915. George Challenger, the designer, was at the time an engineer at Vickers'. In principle it closely resembled the first form of the Fokker gear, although this was not because it was a copy (as is sometimes reported): it was not until April 1916 that a captured Fokker was available for technical analysis. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both gears were based closely on the Saulnier patent. The first version was driven by a reduction gear attached to a rotary engine oil pump spindle, as in Saulnier's design; a small impulse-generating cam was mounted externally, on the port side of the forward fuselage, where it was readily accessible for adjustment.|$|E

Zelena is angry Regina decided to destroy the part of herself that was most like her, leaving the sisters with less in common; adding to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Regina didn't confide with Zelena, but Snow White instead.

25|$|Arrow's death-of-a-candidate example (1963, page 26) {{suggests}} that the agenda (the set of feasible alternatives) shrinks from, say, X = {a, b, c} to S = {a, b} because {{of the death of}} candidate c. This example is misleading since it can give the reader an impression that IIA is a condition involving two agenda and one profile. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> IIA involves just one agendum ({x, y} in case of pairwise independence) but two profiles. If the condition is applied to this confusing example, it requires this: Suppose an aggregation rule satisfying IIA chooses b from the agenda {a, b} when the profile is given by (cab, cba), that is, individual 1 prefers c to a to b, 2 prefers c to b to a. Then, it must still choose b from {a, b} if the profile were, say: (abc, bac); (acb, bca); (acb, cba); or (abc, cba).|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known poem in Malayalam, Ramacharitam, {{dated to}} the 12th to 14th century CE, was completed before {{the introduction of}} the Sanskrit alphabet. It shows the same phase of the language as in Jewish and Nasrani Sasanas (dated to mid‑8th century A.D.). But the period of the earliest available literary document cannot be the sole criterion used to determine the antiquity of a language. In its early literature, Malayalam has songs, Pattu, for various subjects and occasions, such as harvesting, love songs, heroes, gods, etc. A form of writing called Campu emerged from the 14th century onwards. It mixed poetry with prose and used a vocabulary strongly influenced by Sanskrit, with themes from epics and Puranas.Rama-charitam, which was composed in the 14th century A.D., may be said to have inaugurated Malayalam literature just as Naniah's Mahabharatam did for Telugu. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> dialectical and local peculiarities had already developed and stamped themselves in local songs and ballads. But these linguistic variations were at last gathered together and made to give a coloring to a sustained literary work, the Rama-charitam, thereby giving the new language a justification and a new lease on life.|$|E

25|$|Against the new calendar, the {{argument}} is made that inasmuch {{as the use of}} the Julian calendar was implicit in the decision of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea (325), no authority less than an Ecumenical Council may change this decision. However, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> that Council made no decision or decree at all concerning the Julian calendar. Its silence constituted an implicit acceptance not of the Julian calendar, but of the civil calendar, which happened to be, at that time, the Julian calendar (the explicit decision of Nicaea being concerned, rather, with the date of Easter). By virtue of this, defenders of the new calendar argue that no decision by an Ecumenical Council was or is necessary today in order to revise (not abandon) the Julian calendar; and further, that by making the revision, the Church stays with the spirit of Nicaea I by keeping with the civil calendar in all its essentials—while conversely, failure to keep with the civil calendar could be seen as a departure from the spirit of Nicaea I in this respect. Lastly, it is argued that since the adoption of the new calendar evidently involves no change in or departure from the theological or the ethical teachings of Orthodox Christianity, but rather amounts to a merely disciplinary or administrative change—a clock correction of sorts—the authority to enact that change falls within the competency of contemporary, local episcopal authority. Implicit acceptance of this line of reasoning, or something very close to it, underlies the decision to adopt the new calendar by those Orthodox churches which have done so.|$|E

Therefore, Licinius was prone to see the Church as a force more loyal to Constantine than to the Imperial system in general, as the explanation offered by the Church historian Sozomen.|$|E

Payne comments on their work together on the album Astral Weeks, which also included musicians Connie Kay, Warren Smith, Jay Berliner, and Richard Davis: [...] "Ironically, the image you have {{when you listen to}} the album now is of these guys who are all together, and they realise they are creating a monumental work of art. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was just another session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth and you would realize that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E
500|$|The two French sailors {{that reached}} Leander {{immediately}} began a systematic pillaging of the British officers' personal effects. Rather than tossing the men into the sea, as historian William James suggests {{they should have}} done, Thompson instead ordered one of the British boats to be repaired and launched to transport him to the French ship and bring back Captain Lejoille {{in the belief that}} he would end the looting. However, when the French captain arrived he immediately joined his officers, commandeering all but two of Captain Thompson's shirts and the wounded officer's cot. When Captain Berry complained that a pair of ornamental pistols had been stolen from him, Lejoille summoned the thief to the quarterdeck and took them for himself. The sailors who accompanied Lejoille were equally voracious: among the many things taken were the ship surgeon Mr Mulberry's operating tools, stolen {{in the middle of an}} operation. Without the correct equipment, the surgeon could not assist the many wounded, including Captain Thompson, who had a musket ball still embedded deeply in his arm. When Captain Berry complained, Lejoille replied [...] "J'en suis fâché, mais le fait est, que les Français sont bons au pillage" [...] ("I'm sorry, but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the French are good at plunder").|$|E
500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I {{felt that it was}} my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible {{that this is the way}} he remembered the occasion, because it was how he would have liked to behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. But <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E
