N-[(2 -Hydroxy- 3 - <b>trimethylammonium)</b> propyl] chitosan <b>chloride</b> was synthesized, followed by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde [85]. Crosslinked quaternized-PVA has a low mechanical strength; therefore, Xiong et al. blended this polymer with chitosan to improve their performance [86]. The obtained composite membranes have more compact structure and good mechanical strength. Wan et al. examined the ionic conductivity of different chitosan membranes, such as pure chitosan membranes with different degree of deacetylation and molecular weight, di-o-butyrylchitosan, epichlorohydrin or glutaraldehyde cross-linked chitosan and proposed that they are suitable for use in alkaline fuel cells [87 â€“ 90]. Polystyrene (PS) was introduced to form an interpenetrating network with quaternized chitosan. Polystyrene is more hydrophobic than quaternized chitosan and has good mechanical strength. It was found that introduction of PS improves tensile strength, and yet reduces elongation. The addition of PS enabled the quaternary ammonia-based membranes {{to have a higher}} tolerance to bases. However, the membranes with a higher PS exhibit lower ionic conductivity due to the PS are a nonionic conductor [91].|$|R

Grafting of acrylamide results in a decrease of the contact angle of the polymer surface with a water droplet from 80 to 25 Â°. After grafting of N-isopropyl acrylamide the contact angle measured at room temperature also drops to 25 Â° but remains 80 Â° when measured at 40 Â°C, i. e. above the L. C. S. T. of the grafted polymer. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
