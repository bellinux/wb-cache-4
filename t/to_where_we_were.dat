500|$|... "You're Gonna Love Tomorrow" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by Larry Shaw. Filming for the episode was scheduled to begin on July7,2008. The episode {{is the first to}} fully employ the five-year jump, which was introduced in the final two minutes of the fourth season finale. While developing the fifth season, Cherry began brainstorming ways to revamp the series. He stated: [...] "The soap tends to build up, and I wanted to get back <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> that very first season, where it's just the problems of some ordinary women and they were small and relatable." [...] Cherry credits the producers of Lost for the idea of the time jump. The writers hoped the time jump would also help them avoid repeating mistakes they made during the show's poorly received second season, during which they relied heavily on storylines from the previous season. Cherry said that the time jump would be permanent, with executive producer Bob Daily clarifying that some brief flashback scenes would be used to enhance the storytelling and provide context for current plot lines. [...] Cherry had originally wanted to do a ten-year jump, mostly to age the young characters into their teenage years in order to open up more storyline possibilities.|$|E
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E

40|$|I am very {{grateful}} to the editors for inviting me to provide a response to this important special issue critically examining the current popularity of mindfulness in counselling and psychotherapy. After the explosion of interest which has occurred {{over the last couple}} of decades, many key writers in this field have suggested that the time has come to pause and <b>to</b> attend <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> with mindfulness (Williams & Kabat-Zinn, 2011). Several authors in the current volume argue that, beyond pausing and attending <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> being mindful also requires critical reflection in order to gain a greater insight into what has brought us <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> as well as a commitment to moving forward from this point with wisdom and compassion. Therefore I hope, in this response, to offer some brief observations on the current state of mindful therapy, and to draw together the critical points which have been raised throughout this volume in order <b>to</b> consider <b>where</b> <b>we</b> might go next. I invite the reader to reflect, themselves, upon which aspects of this special issue have resonated most with them, and to ask - alongside me - what our therapeutic practice might look like if it was informed by these critical engagements with mindfulness. ...|$|R
60|$|While Jerry and I were grumbling {{because of}} what seemed to us unseemly haste, Jim Freeman, who had been lying down a short {{distance}} away, came over <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sitting, his eyes bulging {{as if he had}} seen two or three ghosts at the very least.|$|E
60|$|I asked Perry {{if he had}} {{any idea}} as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> or in what {{direction}} lay Hooja's island or the continent. He replied by producing his map, on which he had carefully marked the newly discovered islands--there described as the Unfriendly Isles--which showed Hooja's island northwest of us about two points West.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Micawber {{looking up}} at this {{juncture}} <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> standing, I had only time to repeat my caution. Traddles thanked me, and descended.

60|$|The door opened, and Staunton himself appeared. He looked {{years older}} than the strong, debonair man to whom I had told my story a few hours ago, but in his face was none of the despair which I had feared. He was pale, {{and his eyes were}} shining with {{suppressed}} excitement, but he had by no means the air of a beaten man. He came over <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> standing.|$|E
60|$|He {{came close}} <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> hidden, then entered {{the woods and}} circled silently about our camp to get our wind. In the morning his tracks, within five feet of my rear tent pole, showed how little he cared for the {{dwelling}} of man. But though he circled {{back and forth for}} an hour, answering Simmo's low call with his ridiculous little grunt, he would not show himself again on the open shore.|$|E

50|$|In an interview, {{one of the}} twins, Andrew, {{stated that}} the new album was “much more {{relevant}} <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now”.

6000|$|... "We found {{a street}} near the depot {{with a high}} hill behind it, and close to it. There were walls and {{terraces}} all the way up, and trees here and there. We looked up, and {{we could see the}} heads of some children over the topmost wall. They were looking down <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> Presently we came to an opening, and some flights of steps and steep walks, and so we thought we would go up.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{nearly two}} hours we drove without my having the least clue as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going. Sometimes the rattle of the stones told of a paved causeway, and at others our smooth, silent course {{suggested}} asphalt; but, save by this variation in sound, there was nothing at all which could in the remotest way help me to form a guess as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> The paper over each window was impenetrable to light, and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front. It was a quarter-past seven when we left Pall Mall, and my watch showed {{me that it was}} ten minutes to nine when we at last came to a standstill. My companion let down the window, and I caught a glimpse of a low, arched doorway with a lamp burning above it. As I was hurried from the carriage it swung open, and I found myself inside the house, with a vague impression of a lawn and trees on each side of me as I entered. Whether these were private grounds, however, or bona-fide country was more than I could possibly venture to say.|$|E

When you said, Job Arthur, that you think of others besides yourself, didn't you mean, as a matter of fact, the office men? Didn't you mean that the colliers, led--we won't mention noses--by you, were going to come out in sympathy with the office clerks, supposing they didn't get the rise in wages which they've asked for--the office clerks?

60|$|Our {{plan was}} this. The tide, {{beginning}} {{to run down}} at nine, and being with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned, and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we could choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all night. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at what time to expect them, according <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and would hail the first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we should have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.|$|E
60|$|We {{had left}} the salt-marsh behind us, and for some time I had felt the soft springy turf of the downland beneath my feet, and our path had risen and dipped over the curves of the low coast hills. In spite of the {{darkness}} my companion walked with great assurance, never hesitating for an instant, and keeping up a stiff pace which was welcome {{to me in my}} sodden and benumbed condition. I had been so young when I left my native place that it is doubtful whether, even in daylight, I should have recognised the countryside, but now in the darkness, half stupefied by my adventures, I could not form the least idea as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> or what we were making for. A certain recklessness had taken possession of me, and I cared little where I went as long as I could gain the rest and shelter of which I stood in need.|$|E
60|$|We waited here {{near the}} guns {{for half an}} hour, and {{meanwhile}} the Boers searched amid the wreckage for dead and wounded. A few of the wounded were brought <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and laid on the ground, {{but most of them}} were placed in the shelter of one of the overturned trucks. As I write I do not know with any certainty what the total losses were, but the Boers say that they buried five dead, sent ten seriously wounded into Ladysmith, and kept three severely wounded in their field ambulances. Besides this, we are told that sixteen severely wounded escaped on the engine, and we have with the prisoners seven men, including myself, slightly wounded by splinters or injured in the derailment. If this be approximately correct, it seems that the casualties in the hour and a half of fighting were between thirty-five and forty: not many, perhaps, considering the fire, but out of 120 enough at least.|$|E
