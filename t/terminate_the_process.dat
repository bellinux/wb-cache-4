40|$|One of the {{classical}} problems in stochastic processes is characterization of the first-passage time (FPT), the stochastic variable equal to the time that a Markov process takes to meet a particular final condition for the first time. The full characterization[2] is the probability distribution of this FPT. A popular measure is its mean value, the MFPT[1]. Since the probability distribution of the FPT has a power law tail, the MFPT is not for all purposes the relevant quantity. The FPT has many applications, such as the question how {{likely it is that}} I will be affected by a particular transmittable disease in my life time, that the Dow Jones index decreases by 30 % in 2008, or the time it takes for droplet to grow beyond a critical size.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{development}} of multimedia technologies {{and the demand for}} three-dimensional video systems, multiview video coding (MVC) has attracted great attention from industries and research institutes. A joint multiview video model (JMVM) with multi-reference frame technology had beendeveloped, in which motion and disparity estimation for eliminating temporal and inter-view redundancies are employed in multi-reference frame technology to enhance the coding efficiency. However, the process of searching blocks with variable sizes for motion and disparity estimation in multi-reference frames significantly requires much more memory bandwidth and computational complexity relative to mono-view video coding systems. On the study of the statistical features of multi-reference frames in MVC, in this paper we propose a new fast multi-reference frame selection algorithm based on an adaptive threshold technology. The proposed algorithm can <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of searching multi-reference frames early. An adaptive threshold technique is given and correlated with the types of frames. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can promote the encoding speed by 2. 01 ~ 3. 60 times without noticeable quality degradation compared with the JMVM 7. 0.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an efficient, scalable, and op-timal slack-driven shaping algorithm for soft blocks in non-slicing floorplan. The proposed algorithm is called SDS. SDS is specifically formulated for fixed-outline floorplanning. Given a fixed {{upper bound on}} the layout width, SDS minimizes the layout height by only shaping the soft blocks in the design. Iteratively, SDS shapes some soft blocks to minimize the layout height with the guarantee that the layout width would not exceed the given upper bound. Rather than using some simple heuristic as in previous work, the amount of change on each block is determined by systematically distributing the global total amount of available slack to individual block. During the whole shaping process, the layout height monotonically reduces and eventually converges to an optimal solution. Two optimality conditions are presented to check the optimality of a shaping solution for fixed-outline floorplanning. In practice, to <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of convergence early, we propose two different stopping criteria. We also extend SDS to handle other floorplanning problems, e. g., classical floorplanning. To validate the efficiency and effectiveness of SDS, comprehensive experiments are conducted on MCNC and HB benchmarks. Compared with previous work, SDS achieves the best experimental result with a significantly faster runtime. Index Terms—Block shaping, fixed-outline floorplanning, very large scale integration physical design. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{procedure}} for automatic extraction {{of the road}} surface from geo-referenced mobile laser scanning data. The basic assumption of the procedure is that the road surface is smooth and limited by curbstones. Two variants of jump detection are investigated for detecting curbstone edges, one based on height differences the other one based on histograms of the height data. Region growing algorithms are proposed which use the irregular laser point cloud. Two- and four-neighbourhood growing strategies utilize the two height criteria for examining the neighborhood. Both height criteria rely on an assumption about the minimum height of a low curbstone. Road boundaries with lower or no jumps will not stop the region growing process. In contrast to this objects on the road can <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>process.</b> Therefore further processing such as bridging gaps between detected road boundary points {{and the removal of}} wrongly detected curbstone edges is necessary. Road boundaries are finally approximated by splines. Experiments are carried out with a ca. 2 km network of smalls streets located in the neighbourhood of University of Applied Sciences in Stuttgart. For accuracy assessment of the extracted road surfaces, ground truth measurements are digitized manually from the laser scanner data. For completeness and correctness of the region growing result values between 92 % and 95 % are achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel technique for safe partial or complete process network termination. The {{idea is to}} have two types of termination messages / poison: LocalPoison and GlobalPoison. Injecting GlobalPoison into a process network results in a safe termination of the whole process network. In contrast, injected LocalPoi-son only terminates all processes until it is filtered out by Poison-Filtering Channels. This allows the creation of termination domains inside a process network. To make handling of a termination message easy, it is delivered as an exception {{and not as a}} normal message. The necessary Poisonable- and Poison-Filtering-Channels have been modelled in CSP and checked using FDR. A proof of concept implementation for Communicating Sequential Processes for Java (JCSP) has been developed and refined. Previously, JCSP offered no safe way to <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> network. When the user terminated the program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) simply stops all threads (processes), without giving the processes the chance to perform clean up operations. A similar technique is used to perform partial termination of process networks in JCSP, making it unsafe as well. The technique presented in this paper is not limited to JCSP, but can easily be ported to other CSP environments. Partial process network termi-nation can be applied in the area of Software Defined Radio (SDR), because SDR systems {{need to be able to}} change their signal processing algorithms during runtime...|$|E
