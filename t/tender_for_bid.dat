40|$|This paper {{presents}} a genetic algorithm (GA) -based economic contracting strategy for optimal selection of tenders in the England and Wales standing reserve market. The {{aim of the}} contracting strategy is three fold-first, to identify potential tenders to be contracted, second, to determine the volume of electric power that each tender should supply, and thirdly how often they should provide the service. The third issue is easy to deal with using a contracting strategy where all <b>tenders</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> a full service window (fixed tenders); however, it becomes troublesome if tenders are allowed to <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> a flexible, partial service window (flexible tenders). In this paper, a GA strategy with a special encoding scheme, order-based crossover and mutation operators (OBGA), has been developed to deal with flexible tenders within the tender selection process. The proposed method has been investigated using four test cases, with different tender flexibility and constraints. The test results clearly demonstrate that the OBGA performs {{as well as the}} conventional GA when all <b>tenders</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> fixed contracts; however, OBGA gradually outperforms the conventional GA as the number of flexible tenders progressively increases...|$|R

40|$|The {{earthing}} {{of electric}} installations {{plays an important}} part as regards the behaviour of the network and personal safety when there are disturbances. Presently all earthing designs are performed by contractors and submitted to Ceylon Electricity Board for approval. But {{due to lack of}} information at the tender stage majority of the contractors are unable to bid the earthing design part accurately resulting deviations to the contract during the implementation stage. To minimize this problem Transmission Design Branch and the Transmission Maintenance Branch of the Ceylon Electricity Board jointly decided to do the Earthing Design and submitted with the <b>tender</b> <b>for</b> <b>bidding.</b> After the initial soil resistivity measurements, {{it was found that the}} resistivity values were very high compared to other Grid Substation locations. Therefore it was decided to do an earthing design for Horana Grid Substation to identify the suitabil ity of proposed land and identify the land to be developed to construct an additional earthing mat to transfer the earth fault current. Without a properly designed grounding system large potential differences can exist between different points within the substation itself. Under normal circumstances, the current flow through the grounding grid from line - to - ground faults that constitutes the main threat to personnel. The earthing design for Horana Grid Substation has the following objectives. 1. Ensure such a degree of human safety that a person working or walking in the vicinity of grounded facilities, is not exposed to the danger of a critical electric shock. The touch and step voltages produced in a fault condition have to be at safe levels. A safe value is one that will not produce enough current within a body to case ventricular fibrillation. 2. Provide means to carry and dissipate electric currents into earth under normal and faulty conditions without exceeding any operating and equipment limits or adversely affecting continuity of service. 3. Provide grounding for lightning impulses and the surges occurring from the switching of substation equipment, which reduces damage to equipment. 4. Provide a low resistance to protective relays to see and clear ground faults, which improves protective equipment performance, particularly at minimum faults. I...|$|R

The reluctance of some contractors to include a price for risk in their <b>tenders</b> when <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> work competitively may also not be a useful approach. Here, instead, we first define the meaning of contractor contingency, and then we develop a facile quantitative technique that contractors can use to estimate a price for project risk.
