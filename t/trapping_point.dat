40|$|JMP {{was funded}} by Disney's Animal Programs, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and University of St Andrews. The Key Largo woodrat (Neotoma floridana smalli) is an {{endangered}} rodent with a restricted geographic range and small population size. Establishing an efficient monitoring program of its abundance has been problematic; previous trapping designs have not worked well because the species is sparsely distributed. We compared Key Largo woodrat abundance estimates in Key Largo, Florida, USA, obtained using <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> transects (TPT) and spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) based on statistical properties, survey effort, practicality, and cost. Both methods combine aspects of distance sampling with capture–recapture, but TPT relies on radiotracking individuals to estimate detectability and SECR relies on repeat capture information to estimate densities of home ranges. Abundance estimates using TPT {{in the spring of}} 2007 and 2008 were 333 woodrats (CV[*]=[*] 0. 46) and 696 (CV[*]=[*] 0. 43), respectively. Abundance estimates using SECR in the spring, summer, and winter of 2007 were 97 (CV[*]=[*] 0. 31), 334 (CV[*]=[*] 0. 26), and 433 (CV[*]=[*] 0. 20) animals, respectively. <b>Trapping</b> <b>point</b> transects used approximately 960 person-hours and 1, 010 [*]trap-nights/season. Spatially explicit capture–recapture used approximately 500 [*]person-hours and 6, 468 [*]trap-nights/season. Significant time was saved in the SECR survey by setting large numbers of traps close together, minimizing time walking between traps. <b>Trapping</b> <b>point</b> transects were practical to implement in the field, and valuable auxiliary information on Key Largo woodrat behavior was obtained via radiocollaring. In this particular study, detectability of the woodrat using TPT was very low and consequently the SECR method was more efficient. Both methods require a substantial investment in survey effort to detect any change in abundance because of large uncertainty in estimates. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The loadability of a pulp refiner was studied using refiner data such as gap movement, total power, no-load power, and net {{refining}} power. Two {{different types}} of pulp and three {{different types of}} refiner filling {{were used in the}} study. The floc formation and floc size of each pulp was studied in a flow channel simulating filling grooves. The loadability of the pulp refiner was linked to refining effects such as fiber shortening, and internal and external fibrillation. The <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> of the refiner, and therefore refiner loadability, was found to be more related to fiber characteristics such as fiber length and coarseness, while being less dependent on refining consistency in the range of 2. 0 - 5. 5 %. The data on the formation of flocs and floc size was used to explain the trapping of fibers between refiner bars and the refiner gap width. Filling design characteristics such as groove width and cutting speed affect the gap width and trapping of flocs inside the refiner. Fillings with high cutting speed tend to break flocs composed of long and short fibers at the same rate and therefore both types of floc maintain the same gap width. On the other hand, wide-groove fillings with lower cutting speed have a gentler effect and the differences in fiber characteristics are easily reflected in the gap width and <b>trapping</b> <b>point.</b> Fillings with low cutting speed have a greater straightening effect than fiber cutting, whereas narrow-bar fillings have a more noticeable effect on fiber cutting, external fibrillation, and fiber swelling...|$|E

The fluctuation is induced by a multiplicative colored noise that can be identified as the the particle number density fluctuations and the dissipation is a new effect that {{may play a role in}} the trapping with a strong coupling. In the weak coupling regime, we calculate the power spectrum of the noise-driven inflaton fluctuations for a single <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> and studied its variation with the trapping location.

It was found that the reorganization energy of a radical cation of Se(n) from a vertical hole <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> to its relaxed structure is significantly small. Also, the reorganization energy decreased gradually with increasing n, indicating that Se(n) has an effective intramolecular hole transport property.

40|$|International audienceElectron {{beams and}} {{betatron}} X-ray radiation generated by laser wakefield acceleration in long plasma targets are studied. The targets consist of hydrogen filled dielectric capillary tubes of diameter 150 to 200 microns and length 6 to 20 mm. Electron beams are observed for peak laser intensities {{as low as}} 5 × 1017 W/cm 2. It is found that the capillary collects energy outside the main peak of the focal spot and contributes to keep the beam self-focused over a distance longer than in a gas jet of similar density. This enables the pulse to evolve enough to reach the threshold for wavebreaking, and thus trap and accelerate electrons. No electrons were observed for capillaries of large diameter (250 μm), confirming that the capillary influences the interaction and {{does not have the}} same behaviour as a gas cell.

40|$|Optical traps {{offer the}} promise of being used as noninvasive micromanipulators for {{biological}} objects. We have developed an analytical model that accurately describes the forces exerted on dielectric microspheres while in a single-beam gradient force optical trap. The model can be extended to the trapping of biological objects. The model predicts {{the existence of a}} stable <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> and an effective trapping range. A minimum trapping power of — 5 mW and an effective trapping range of 2. 4 um have been measured for 10 um diameter dielectric microspheres, and are in reasonable agreement with expected results. In cell biology, we have used the optical trap to alter the movement of chromosomes within mitotic cells in vitro and to hold motile sperm cells. Results for the mitotic cells indicate that chromosome movement was initiated in the direction opposite to that of the applied force. Chromosome velocities as high as 48 um/min were observed, and are 24 times faster than normal during cell division. In sperm trapping experiments, mean sperm velocities were unchanged following short (< 30 s) exposures in the trap, while longer exposures resulted in a decrease in mean sperm velocities. Given its noninvasive nature, optical traps should prove to be useful tools in the study of biological processes. © 1990 IEE...|$|E

40|$|Estimates {{of animal}} {{abundance}} or density are fundamental quantities in ecology and conservation, {{but for many}} species such as rare, small mammals, obtaining robust estimates is problematic. In this thesis, I combine elements of two standard abundance estimation methods, capture-recapture and distance sampling, to develop a method called <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> transects (TPT). In TPT, a "detection function", g(r) (i. e. the probability of capturing an animal, given it is r m from a trap when the trap is set) is estimated using a subset of animals whose locations are known prior to traps being set. Generalised linear models are used to estimate the detection function, and the model can be extended to include random effects to allow for heterogeneity in capture probabilities. Standard point transect methods are modified to estimate abundance. Two abundance estimators are available. The first estimator {{is based on the}} reciprocal of the expected probability of detecting an animal, ^P, where the expectation is over r; whereas the second estimator is the expectation of the reciprocal of ^P. Performance of the TPT method under various sampling efforts and underlying true detection probabilities of individuals in the population was investigated in a simulation study. When underlying probability of detection was high (g(0) = 0 : 88) and between-individual variation was small, survey effort could be surprisingly low (c. 510 trap nights) to yield low bias (c. 4...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to answer}} the {{question}} whether differences exist in microhabitat preferences of the yellow-necked mouse and the bank vole between the natural forest and close-to-nature managed forest in the phase of stand regeneration. The two species were live-trapped during two periods in 2006 and 2007 on a square trapping grid established in a managed forest and a natural one. Ten microhabitat variables of each <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> were measured to analyse their influence on the spatial distribution of the two species. At trapping points, the number of capture records for each species as a dependent variable was modelled using Generalised Linear Models. The herbal cover and a distance to the nearest woody debris were the most important measured microhabitat variables which affect the spatial distribution of both species. In the natural forest, the number of captures in both species increased significantly (p < 0. 05) with a decreasing number of trees, increasing undergrowth coverage and decreasing distance to the nearest woody debris. In the managed forest, an increasing distance to the nearest tree and increasing herbal cover had a negative effect on the yellow-necked mouse occurrence (p < 0. 001), while in contrast, the increase in values of the same variables increased frequency of occurrence of the bank vole (p < 0. 001). Moreover, the bank vole was more frequent in the presence of woody debris (p < 0. 002). The study demonstrated clearly that these species modify their spatial activity depending on the management of the woodland. </p...|$|E
40|$|NASA Glenn {{has been}} {{involved}} in developing optical trapping and optical micromanipulation techniques in order to develop a tool {{that can be used to}} probe, characterize, and assemble nano and microscale materials to create microscale sensors for harsh flight environments. In order to be able to assemble a sensor or probe candidate sensor material, it is useful to know how far an optical trap can reach; that is, the distance beyond/below the stable <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> through which an object will be drawn into the optical trap. Typically, to measure the distance over which an optical trap would influence matter in a horizontal (perpendicular to beam propagation) direction, it was common to hold an object in one optical trap, place a second optical trap a known distance away, turn off the first optical trap, and note if the object was moved into the second trap when it was turned on. The disadvantage of this technique is that it only gives information of trap influence distance in horizontal (x y) directions. No information about the distance of the influence of the trap is gained in the direction of propagation of the beam (the z direction). A method was developed to use a time-of-flight technique to determine the length along the propagation direction of an optical trap beam over which an object may be drawn into the optical trap. Test objects (polystyrene microspheres) were held in an optical trap in a water-filled sample chamber and raised to a pre-determined position near the top of the sample chamber. Next, the test objects were released by blocking the optical trap beam. The test objects were allowed to fall through the water for predetermined periods of time, at the end of which the trapping beam was unblocked. It was noted whether or not the test object returned to the optical trap or continued to fall. This determination of the length of an optical trap's influence by this manner assumes that the test object falls through the water in the sample chamber at terminal velocity for the duration of its fall, so that the distance of trap influence can be computed simply by: d = VTt, where d is the trap length (or distance of trap reach), VT is the terminal velocity of the test object, and t is the time interval over which the object is allowed to fall...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{instrumental}} advances in microfluidics-based capillary electrophoresis systems for achieving various goals. Microfluidics systems and purpose-made scientific instruments in general may consist {{of many different}} hardware units, often made by different companies. This presents a challenge for system builders who want to efficiently build and use purpose-made instruments for conducting scientific experiments. As this challenge was relevant {{for all of the}} projects described in this thesis, it {{was the first one to}} be tackled by the development of the software package Instrumentino. The package allows system builders to build a useful graphical user interface (GUI) for their experimental setups, allowing automation of multiple components controlled by separate microcontrollers. A Code could be reused between projects using the same hardware units. Instrumentino was eventually used in all of the projects in this thesis, and while it required a lot of invested time for its development, it saved a lot of time in running experiments afterwards. The first CE systems built for this thesis were for a collaborative project about the use of a C 4 D cell array for following after separation processes, and comparing them to computer simulations. It was first (using 16 detectors) employed for CZE separations of inorganic anions and cations for the sake of demonstration, and later (using 8 detectors) for investigating CZE and ITP separations in linear polyacrylamide (LPA) coated silica capillaries, exhibiting a very low EOF. Another issue discussed in this thesis is the implementation of concurrent CZE separations for anions and cations in portable systems. Two multi-channel portable CE instruments were built in collaboration with others and two review publications were written on the subject of concurrent determination of anions and cations (also a collaboration). Relying on the experience gained from building the previous systems, a new approach for building electrophoretic separation systems was developed, based on a commercial breadboard system for miniaturized microfluidic parts, offering high design flexibility and small size as in lab-on-chip systems, yet using standard silica capillaries and obtaining comparable results to commercial CE instruments. The applicability of this method was exemplified by the implementation of various electrophoretic experiments using the same building blocks. This approach proved to be very useful and was later employed for all following projects, enabling a quick realization of new designs in a miniaturized way. A third multi-channel portable CE system was developed, offering a thermostated chamber in which separations took place and a new microfluidic design which employed a syringe pump for pressurization, enabling, among other things, a special semi- automatic mode for analyzing volume-limited samples. It was used to determine concentrations of target ions in groundwater and mine water samples in an abandoned mining site in Argentina, as well as the determination of inorganic ions in sediment porewater from Lake Baldegg in Switzerland. In parallel, another desktop system was developed for the semi-automatic analysis of volume-limited samples, employing a micro syringe for sample introduction. Finally, a novel fully automated pre-concentration approach for CE was developed, employing a purpose-made microfluidic trapping block in which a hydrodynamic flow can be applied in a channel alongside an electric field that induces electrophoretic flow of the target ions in the opposite direction. A discontinuity in the target ions’ electrophoretic flow in the channel results in a <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> for these ions, to which their net flow is directed to from both sides (upstream and downstream). This is achieved by applying the trapping voltage through ion-exchange membranes, which only pass ions of opposite charge than that of the target ions. This trapping block was coupled to a capillary inlet, so that it could be injected and be separated in it, automatically. This approach was found to be applicable also for high conductivity samples (up to 0. 1 M), which is unique as most pre-concentration approaches that are based on electrokinetic phenomena are limited to low conductivity samples. Furthermore, the system allows selectively trapping ions with mobilities over a certain level, determined by the relative strengths of the applied hydrodynamic flow and electric field...|$|E
