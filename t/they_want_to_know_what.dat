I hate his short sentences, like a dog barking; we want a word-painter here, sir. My description of the wedding sold one hundred and fifty thousand, and it is selling now. If the proprietors were gentlemen, they would have sent me an unlimited credit, instead of their paltry fifty pounds a day and my expenses; but you never meet a liberal man now,--no such animal known. What I want you to do for me, Lord Waldershare, is to get me invited to the Villa Aurea when the court moves there. It will be private life there, and that is the article the British public want now.

A metaphor is, literally, a false statement. Think of Romeo's declaration, 'Juliet is the sun!'

However, {{he has been a}} motivation and role model for many young minorities, encouraging them to enter science and engineering. Williams has helped to set up programs that allow pre-college students and undergraduates to meet and talk with mathematicians, scientists and engineers, most notably at a summer camp run at MIT. [...] "All that many of these youngsters see is different courses," [...] he says, [...] "but <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> mathematicians do from 8 am to 5 pm.

5000|$|Since {{at least}} 2006, Slate {{has been known}} for {{publishing}} contrarian pieces arguing against commonly held views about a subject, giving rise to the #slatepitches Twitter hashtag in 2009.

In 2014, Slates editor-in-chief Julia Turner acknowledged that a reputation for counterintuitive arguments forms part of Slate's [...] "distinctive" [...] brand, but argued that the hashtag misrepresents the site's journalism: [...] "We are not looking to argue that up is down and black is white for the sake of being contrarian against all logic or intellectual rigor. But journalism is more interesting when it surprises you either with the conclusions that it reaches or the ways that it reaches them." ...|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{criticism}} is [...] "criticism {{for the sake}} of criticism", or criticism which voices an objection. The term was made famous by a polemical text written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels entitled The Holy Family. The most popular modern form of critical {{criticism is}} contrarianism. The highest positive value of the critical critic is to be critical. To be critical, or to be a dissident is, in this case, a way of life, the highest good. Such a position is itself often criticized for its motivation. People often feel {{that there should be a}} good reason for being critical, and that being critical simply {{for the sake of}} being critical is not a good reason. Instead, it is seen as a nuisance that can lead to blithe cynicism without constructive result. If everything is demolished by criticism, there may nothing of value left. If people's only stance is to be critical, they can be accused of only negating things, without affirming anything, which provides no positive orientation for behaviour informing people about [...] "what to do". People don't need talk about what is not possible, <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is possible.|$|E
5000|$|In a February 2010 interview, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie {{called the}} show [...] "negative for New Jersey" [...] {{because most of}} the cast members are not from the state. According to Christie, the program [...] "takes a bunch of New Yorkers and drops them at the Jersey Shore and tries to make America feel like this is the real New Jersey". Governor Christie took action against the series by trying to {{encourage}} people to experience the real Jersey Shore for themselves rather than watch it through MTV: [...] "I can tell people: <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time." [...] A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll released in February 2010 showed that 59% of Americans who had seen the show had a favorable view of New Jersey compared to only 44% of those that had not seen the show. The FDU poll repeated the national telephone survey in 2011 and showed similar results. Consequently, poll director Peter Woolley concluded that “These measures... suggest the show isn’t hurting the nation’s view of the state. In fact, it may be promoting one of the state’s best features--not Snooki, but the shore itself." ...|$|E

5000|$|This is {{the summary}} as noted on the {{publishers}} website {{from the hardcover}} edition of Love is a Mixtape:What Is love? Great minds have been grappling with this question throughout the ages, and in the modern era, they have come up with many different answers. According to Western philosopher Pat Benatar, Love is a Battlefield. Her paisan Frank Sinatra would add the corollary that love is a tender trap. Love hurts. Love stinks. Love bites, love bleeds, love is the drug. The troubadours of our times agree: <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> love is, and they want you to show them. But the answer is simple: Love is a mix tape. In the 1990s, when alternative was suddenly mainstream, bands like Pearl Jam and Pavement, Nirvana and R.E.M.--bands that a year before would have been too weird for MTV- were MTV. It was the decade of Kurt Cobain and Shania Twain and Taylor Dayne, a time that ended all too soon. The boundaries of American culture were exploding, and music was leading the way. It was also when a shy music geek named Rob Sheffield met a hell-raising Appalachian punk-rock girl named Renee, who was way too cool for him but {{fell in love with him}} anyway. He was tall. She was short. He was shy. She was a social butterfly. She was the only one who laughed at his jokes when they were so bad, and they were always bad. They had nothing in common except that they both loved music. Music brought them together and kept them together. And it was music that would help Rob through a sudden, unfathomable loss. In Love Is a Mix Tape, Rob, now a writer for [...] "Rolling Stone," [...] uses the songs on fifteen mix tapes to tell the story of his brief time with Renee. From Elvis to Missy Elliott, the Rolling Stones to Yo La Tengo, the songs on these tapes make up the soundtrack to their lives. Rob Sheffield isnt a musician, hes a writer, and Love Is a Mix Tape isnt a love song- but it might as well be. This is Robs tribute to music, to the decade that shaped him, but most of all to one unforgettable woman." ...|$|E
