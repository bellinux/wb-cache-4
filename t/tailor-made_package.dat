They may {{be served by}} an 'encryption-on-demand ' (EoD) service which {{will enable them to}} communicate securely with no prior preparations, and no after effects. We delineate a possible EoD service, and describe some of its theoretical and practical features. The proposed framework is a website which could tailor-make an encryption package to be downloaded by both Alice and Bob for their ad-hoc use. The downloaded package will include the cryptographic algorithm and a unique key, which may be of any size, since Alice and Bob will not have to enter, or regard the key per se, they would simply use the downloaded page to encrypt and decrypt their data. After their secure exchange both Alice and Bob may ignore, or discard the downloaded software, and restart the same procedure, with a different <b>tailor-made</b> <b>package,</b> exactly when needed. This framework allows for greater flexibility in managing the complexity aspects that ensures security. Alice and Bob will not have to know what encryption scheme they use.

40|$|This paper regards {{cultural}} heritage {{as a strategic}} development tool for urban tourist policy. It highlights the use of e-services as a central instrument in a competitive tourist sector. The appropriate choice of e-services - and packages thereof - depends on the various strategic considerations of urban stakeholders (agents) and may differ for each individual city. The paper offers a systematic analysis framework for supporting these choices and deploys multi-criteria analysis as a systematic evaluation methodology, in particular the Regime method. The evaluation framework is exemplified through an application to three field cases in Europe, viz. the cities of Amsterdam, Genoa and Leipzig. Our analysis concludes that <b>tailor-made</b> <b>packages</b> of e-services that {{serve the needs of}} the stakeholders can be made with the help of our evaluation tools. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that the {{restructuring}} following the stiffer competition stemming from increased global integration will trigger a race between countries to attract inward foreign direct investment (FDI). It is further argued that this race consists of last minute efforts and <b>tailor-made</b> <b>packages</b> designed by governments and their agencies to temporarily improve their country 9 ̆ 2 s otherwise inferior profile. This race is non-transparent and the factors used to compete for inward FDI (the 'elements' of the race) deviate from those of long-term efforts to develop a favourable investment climate and improve productivity, as well as medium-term efforts, such as lowering corporate taxes. The paper elaborates on the research problem of properly understanding the drivers of inward FDI in the absence of data on the elements of the non-transparent race. It also addresses the economic policy problem following from this race with a scenario where a large share of global FDI ends up in China, putting the cohesion of the EU at stake and triggering a regional race within China...|$|R
40|$|The {{collaboration}} between Fordotosan and Open Education Faculty (OEF) {{in the framework}} of the e-learning began with the need and willingness on the side of Fordotosan to get over limitations of face-to-face education. Fordotosan took on its agenda, using opportunities of open and distance education methods, in order to reach increasing number of the Sales and Post- Sales Service Points (S&PsSP) personnel. The target was responding to staff s education needs and increase the quality of the services given at the service points. In this framework, the dialogue initiated for better knowing the technical and man-power capabilities of the OEF, led to a university-industry collaboration. The cooperative model for this project was based on two teams: (1) Fordotosan instructors that determined the educational content of the project and were trained in instructional design, by OEF academic staff (2) OEF team that was composed of instructional design and computer assisted learning experts. The components of the e-Learning platform were decided as: (1) e- Book (2) e- Television (3) e-Exercise (4) e- Exam (5) e- Moderating Design, Production and Application Services simulated from virtual class.

40|$|Abstract – Among {{other sectors}} such as trade, {{financial}} affairs, economics, shipment, and IT appliances, Shanghai {{has become one}} of the fastest growing and largest international metropolises in the world. With its 500 thousand foreign residents, Shanghai has been ranked as the city with the highest rate of international residents in China. Unfortunately, there are no appropriate or <b>tailor-made</b> service <b>packages</b> within China’s mobile telecom services allocated to foreign users of the mobile communication industry in Shanghai. The current paper aims to find out about the key factors of the mobile telecommunication industry, which are strongly correlated to customer satisfaction in China. The exploratory study is primarily based on data collected among China Mobile’s foreign users in Shanghai. The sample consists of 259 foreign residents randomly selected from the population frame offered by the ones who have settled down in Shanghai. Although the findings of this study are specific to China Mobile, they can also be generalized to other companies operating in this business area in China.

40|$|On-demand {{resource}} provisioning in {{cloud computing}} provides <b>tailor-made</b> resource <b>packages</b> (typically {{in the form}} of VMs) to meet users' demands. Public clouds nowadays provide more and more elaborated types of VMs, but have yet to offer the most flexible dynamic VM assembly, which is partly {{due to the lack of}} a mature mechanism for pricing tailor-made VMs on the spot. This work proposes an efficient randomized auction mechanism based on a novel application of smoothed analysis and randomized reduction, for dynamic VM provisioning and pricing in geo-distributed cloud data centers. This auction, to the best of our knowledge, is the first one in literature that achieves (i) truthfulness in expectation, (ii) polynomial running time in expectation, and (iii) (1 -ϵ) -optimal social welfare in expectation for resource allocation, where ϵ can be arbitrarily close to 0. Our mechanism consists of three modules: (1) an exact algorithm to solve the NP-hard social welfare maximization problem, which runs in polynomial time in expectation, (2) a perturbation-based randomized resource allocation scheme which produces a VM provisioning solution that is (1 -ϵ) -optimal, and (3) an auction mechanism that applies the perturbation-based scheme for dynamic VM provisioning and prices the customized VMs using a randomized VCG payment, with a guarantee in truthfulness in expectation. We validate the efficacy of the mechanism through careful theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulations...|$|R

Knowledge of sexual behaviour in these areas is limited, but constitutes essential information for a combination prevention approach of behavioural change and biomedical interventions. Methods This descriptive {{study was conducted in}} rural Mopani District, South Africa, {{as part of a larger}} study on STI. Women of reproductive age (18 – 49 years) who reported sexual activity were included regardless of the reason for visiting the facility. Questionnaires were administered to 570 women. We report sexual behaviour by age group, ethnic group and self-reported HIV status. Results Young women (34  years); there was no difference for condom use during last sex act (36  % overall). Sotho women were more likely to report concurrent sexual partners whereas Shangaan women reported more frequent intravaginal cleansing and vaginal scarring practice in our analysis. HIV-infected women were older, had a higher number of lifetime sexual partners, reported more frequent condom use during the last sex act and were more likely to have a known HIV-infected partner than women without HIV infection; hormonal contraceptive use, fellatio, and a circumcised partner were less often reported. Conclusions This study provides insight into women’s sexual behaviour in a rural South African region. There are important differences in sexual behaviour by age group and ethnicity and HIV status; these should be taken into account when designing <b>tailor-made</b> prevention <b>packages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{problems}} encountered by clothing merchandisers in managing fabric sample resources, and analyses their expectations of and requirements for a desirable management solution. It then aims to consider the architectural design of an intelligent fabric sample management system prototype, and the development of a construction and implementation plan for a fashion enterprise to install the system. Design/methodology/approach: A three-stage methodological approach is adopted. The first stage is a preliminary study using in-depth interviews with potential system users; the second involves the architectural design of a five-component system prototype; and the third develops a multi-phase construction and implementation plan using a case study. Findings: Four categories of problems in the management of fabric sample resources are identified, the system architecture is designed, and a construction and implementation plan is proposed. Managerial and theoretical implications are also discussed. Practical implications: The design process of the research and development (R&D) framework enables fashion enterprises to obtain a deeper understanding of their operations in managing fabric samples and to make wiser decisions in resource allocation. By taking the specific needs of system users into consideration, system solution developers are able to design <b>tailor-made</b> software <b>packages</b> that are intelligent, user-friendly and user-oriented. Originality/value: Through a logical and systematic process of designing the R&D framework, the paper identifies some "technological rules" which links up the practice of solving an industrial problem with the formulation of substantive theories.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{a segment of the}} hidden economy, i. e. on {{unofficial}} (unreported) economic activities of registered medium and large enterprises in Hungary. First we place the problem into a broader context, then we delimit those segments of unofficial economic activities our surveys are able to catch. The data from our 1996, 1998 and 2001 enterprise surveys put us into a unique position: we are able to analyse the dynamics of some components of the hidden economy during the transition. Our surveys focus on the everyday practice of tax evasion and tax avoidance (including some of the various methods and techniques enterprises use to diminish their tax liabilities). These methods include underreporting activities and revenues, exaggerating (over-reporting) costs, using outsourcing to small subcontractors in order to provide “tax-efficient” labour, <b>tailor-made</b> remuneration <b>packages</b> to take advantage of loopholes, etc. While some of the tax planning methods clearly remain within the realm of legality, others may include tax dodging of the illegal kind. The borderlines between avoidance and evasion are necessarily blurred. We also deal with some other aspects of fiscal discipline and tax compliance and enterprise behaviour (tax delays, tax litigation, etc.). Our data unanimously support the hypothesis that the importance of unofficial economic activity of registered medium and large enterprises radically diminished since 1996. As we also have information about the selected enterprise group’s opinion on the unofficial activities of their business partners and main domestic competitors, our data enable us to generalise this finding to the whole registered business sector. ...|$|R

The article assesses the presence of several motivations, like: (i) Guilt; (ii) Interest in national history; (iii) Revival of a glorious Past; (iv) Economic benefits; (v) Display of sympathy; and (vi) Dark tourism development. The analysis {{is based on a}} qualitative research method and incorporates: (a) Qualitative data analysis, by conducting interviews in June 2016 with key stakeholders from central and local governments as the main policy makers; and (b) Analysis of secondary data sources, achieved by reviewing literature, historical, and statistical data related to Jewish history in Macedonia. Generally, the results point to the presence of strong iconic connection among Macedonians and the Jews that lived in Macedonia. The general findings indicate that by establishing and maintaining JH sites, stakeholders reflect sentiments of sympathy and even admiration to the perished Jewish community and a strong desire to revive a glorious past. Only in the case of Bitola, the potential economic benefits were surfaced as the main motive for initiating activities and investments in JH sites. Finally, the study recommends design and development of JHT product and <b>tailor-made</b> tourist <b>packages</b> as key elements that may boost tourism development in Macedonia alongside with commemoration of the Jews and their ties with the Macedonian people...|$|R

40|$|The {{world we}} live in today is greatly {{influenced}} by mass media. In fact, it would not be wrong to say that mass media is the most powerful force in our contemporary life that has an unstoppable force and capacity to drive the behaviour of people, influence the policies of a government, cause business empires to rise or fall and dictate the technologies that takes us to the future. The evolution of mass media from its inception to the recent past has been restricted by technology to be largely a uni-directional media. The newspapers and the television, which had as its potential target audiences scaling from a large province in a country to an ultimate global viewership, delivered to the mass market what the majority of the audience would be receptive of. Advances in technology have changed this scenario and the wide availability of interactive television allows operators to offer <b>tailor-made</b> program <b>packages</b> to selected customer segments and subscribers to customize their program selections based on a completely individual preferences list. With interactive television becoming available in Sri Lanka, it is pertinent to study the interplay between market potential and sociocultural impact of this very important mass media technology. The research presented in this thesis is an in-depth study of factors affecting adoption of interactive television in Sri Lanka from the dual perspectives of subscriber and operator. One of the most noteworthy findings presented in this research thesis is the fallacy of the conventional wisdom of content driving the market. In respect of interactive television programming in Sri Lanka, the research clearly indicates this often repeated belief to be wrong. The researcher also found the local interactive television industry to be misguided in its assessment of affordability of consumers. While entry costs to the technology remains relatively affordable, the belief of operators that consumers are within an affordability range for costs in terms of selective programming is proven to be false. The research also highlights the impact on adoption of interactive television in Sri Lanka due to limited knowledge possessed by consumers on the technology. Thisscenario is further aggravated as operators have limited knowledge on the consumer attitudes to interactive television. This has led to a negative feedback structure wherein consumer uptake of interactive television is further retarded due to limited offerings while on the supply side, the operators await further expansion of customer base before investing in more services. The research presented in this thesis empirically proves the need for operators to have greater focus on cultural issues in programming instead of variety of programming to overcome adoption barriers...|$|R
