25|$|The second volume, I Am Spock (1995), saw Nimoy {{communicating}} that {{he finally}} realized {{his years of}} portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely, Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> {{in a way that}} he never would have thought if he had not portrayed the character. As such, in this autobiography Nimoy maintains that in some meaningful sense he has merged with Spock {{while at the same time}} maintaining the distance between fact and fiction.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} said that few, if any, First Ladies worked as {{consistently}} before marrying as did Pat Nixon. As she told the writer Gloria Steinem during the 1968 presidential campaign, [...] "I never had time to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> like that—who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work." ...|$|E

[...] "I feel happier than I {{have done in the past}} few years. I'm seeing things in a positive light and I hope the lyrics will be more uplifting" [...] In an interview with James Spence about the early writing process and how the lyrics have an essence of self-reflection as a common theme in the band's work, [...] "it's not something people normally look at or focus on; self-reflection as a theme, but if you ignore what's happening to you and how it's making you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> then I don't think that's good." ...|$|E

500|$|Roberts {{performed}} [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] for {{the first}} time at the 2011 T4 on the Beach in the United Kingdom. After her performance, the singer was asked how she felt it went, saying she had [...] "forgotten what a crowd like that feels and looks like. I try not to get nervous – I don't like to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> too much beforehand, otherwise I worry too much. I like to deal with the situation when it happens." [...] A beatboxer from Norfolk, Tom Povey, was picked to perform with her on stage after he was seen performing in a London pub. Povey, who performs with the stage name Intensi T, said it was the highlight of his career. Roberts also performed the song on British chat-shows Daybreak and Paul O'Grady Live.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, One by One won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, {{while one}} year earlier at the 45th Grammy Awards [...] "All My Life" [...] {{was chosen as}} Best Hard Rock Performance. While the band had a {{positive}} opinion about the record following release, as Grohl said the songs were [...] "the best we've ever written", he {{and the rest of}} the Foo Fighters eventually grew distasteful about the results. Grohl stated that he was frustrated at himself for rushing on the album: [...] "four of the songs were good, and the other seven I've never played again in my life." [...] Hawkins said that [...] "if you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> too much, they kinda get sterile, as we found out there", and Shiflett declared that [...] "there are great songs , and then there are... parts of great songs".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the American film Jaws, a {{proposition}} came from the [...] Toho film studio for Nobuhiko Obayashi to develop a similar script. To find inspiration for the story, Obayashi discussed ideas with his pre-teen daughter Chigumi Obayashi. Nobuhiko sought her ideas, believing that adults [...] "only <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> they understand ... everything stays on that boring human level" [...] while [...] "children can come up with things that can't be explained". Several of Chigumi's ideas were included in House such as a reflection in a mirror attacking the viewer, a watermelon being pulled out of a well appearing like a human head, and a house that eats girls. Other themes Chigumi suggested drew upon her own childhood fears. These fears included a pile of futons falling on her that felt like a monster attacking her, a large loud clock at her grandparents home, and getting her fingers caught in between her piano keys. Nobuhiko shared these story ideas with screenwriter Chiho Katsura. These ideas reminded Katsura of a short story by Walter de la Mare about an old woman who is visited by her granddaughters who then puts them in a trunk.|$|E

500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I try not to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> like that when writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, {{said he would like to}} try to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E
2500|$|For the film, Lynch {{decided to}} include pop {{songs from the}} 1960s, {{including}} [...] "In Dreams" [...] by Roy Orbison and [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] by Bobby Vinton, the latter of which was largely inspirational for the film, with Lynch stating that [...] "It was the song that sparked the movie... There was something mysterious about it. It made me <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>things.</b> And the first things I thought about were lawns – lawns and the neighborhood." [...] Other music for the film was also produced, this time composed by Angelo Badalamenti, who {{would go on to}} produce the music for most of Lynch's subsequent cinematic works. Dino de Laurentiis loved the film, and it achieved support from some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to a mainstream audience were instead highly negative, with most of the audience hating the film. Although Lynch had found success previously with The Elephant Man, Blue Velvets controversy with audiences and critics introduced him into the mainstream, and it became a huge critical and moderate commercial success. The film earned Lynch his second Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Woody Allen, whose film Hannah and Her Sisters was nominated for Best Picture, said that Blue Velvet was his favorite film of the year.|$|E
2500|$|The use {{of social}} {{technologies}} (blogs, wikis, RSS) {{allow students to}} shift from simply consuming media to creating it on their own. Pundits argue that student-produced podcasting can promote several powerful ideas that students can use over a lifetime. These include a hands-on and reflective approach to copyright and fair use in creating digital media. That is, they can create original content as they ethically and effectively collect and remix the work of others. Thus, it is argued, podcasting becomes a tool for students {{to think about the}} balance between individual rights and community benefits. In addition, some argue that podcasts help students learn 21st century literacy skills. [...] Students, for example, can use digital audio recording and editing software to create audio dramas, news shows or audio tours. Within Social Studies contexts, for example, podcasting offers a means for encouraging students to question their world, [...] to explore their intuitions about relationships between history, people and to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> in relation to larger contexts, rather than simply focus on dates and facts. Educators who use podcasting with students argue that it offers learners and teachers flexibility and learner control, opportunities for learner motivation, clarity of instruction, novelty of engagement, widening of 'locations' in which learning is situated – an expansion of the temporal and spatial, engagement with and collaboration around dialogue, and opportunities for learners to get involved in construction of learning for others.|$|E
