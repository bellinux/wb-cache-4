5|$|The Ormulum or Orrmulum is a twelfth-century work {{of biblical}} exegesis, {{written by a}} monk named Orm (or Ormin) and {{consisting}} of just under 19,000 lines of early Middle English verse.

5|$|During the Tudor {{conversion}} of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes <b>tracing</b> <b>the</b> monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the warming house where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat {{to rise to the}} refectory or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house Fountains Abbey, the chamber above the warming house was the muniment room, where the abbey's charters, records and title deeds, {{as well as those of}} local lords, were kept.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of <b>tracing</b> <b>the</b> effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E

5|$|Located on {{the site}} of a 10th-century wooden church, the cathedral was built in the 12th and 13th centuries when the Romanesque style was {{influenced}} by Gothic trends from northern France. It was the first Gothic cathedral in Scandinavia to be built of brick, resulting in the spread of this style throughout northern Europe. With its 39 royal tombs, the cathedral is to this day the burial site for Danish monarchs. Since 1995, it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, encouraging some 100,000 tourists to visit it each year. The cathedral houses a museum on its upper floor, <b>tracing</b> <b>the</b> building's history. A working church, it also hosts concerts throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Receiving a {{broadcast}} of CIA agent Daniels being interrogated by the 33rd, the team chooses to interfere. <b>Tracing</b> <b>the</b> signal's origin, they find Daniels already {{dead and the}} broadcast was a trap set for fellow CIA agent, Gould.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the idea that plants could {{synthesise}} almost all their tissues from atmospheric gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would take many more years. Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between the pigment chlorophyll and starch production was finally made in 1864 but <b>tracing</b> <b>the</b> precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915.|$|E
