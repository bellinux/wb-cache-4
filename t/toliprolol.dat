50|$|<b>Toliprolol</b> is a beta {{adrenergic}} receptor antagonist.|$|E
40|$|Five potent, {{lipophilic}} beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (carvedilol, pindolol, <b>toliprolol</b> and fluorinated analogs of bupranolol and penbutolol) {{were labeled}} with either carbon- 11 or fluorine- 18 and evaluated for cerebral beta-adrenoceptor imaging in experimental animals. The standard radioligand for autoradiography of beta-adrenoceptors, [I- 125]-iodocyanopindolol, was {{also included in}} this survey. All compounds showed either very low uptake in rat brain or a regional distribution that {{was not related to}} beta-adrenoceptors, whereas some ligands did display specific binding in heart and lungs. Apparently, the criteria of a high affinity and a moderately high lipophilicity were insufficient to predict the suitability of beta-adrenergic antagonists for visualization of beta-adrenoceptors in the central nervous system.
