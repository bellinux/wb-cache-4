5|$|The joke in {{the episode}} about Fox Mulder's {{predicted}} death being by autoerotic asphyxiation {{was inspired by}} previous jokes in the series about Mulder's interest in pornography. It was also inspired by a book Morgan had read on homicide investigations. While Morgan noted that he hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> way that Mulder would die, the line was meant as a joke.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus is {{not known}} well from non-vertebral material, {{currently}} only consisting of partial ribs and a fragment of a pelvis. One of the ribs attached to the cervicals, and is quite fragmentary. It is elongated, although <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> feature of distortion. Also undescribed by Bonaparte & Mateus are a set of thoratic ribs. Two ribs are {{from the left side}} of the animal. They are T-shaped in cross section, and display plesiomorphic features, although their incomplete state makes their identification uncertain. Multiple right ribs are preserved, including both the shafts and heads. They are similar to the left ribs, which also show that they lack pneumtization. Other appendicular (non-vertebral) material includes a very incomplete and fragmentary shaft of the pubis, and over one hundred gastroliths. The pubis displays practically no anatomical features, and the gastroliths were not described in detail by Mannion et al. in 2012.|$|E

Programmed factors follow a biological timetable, perhaps one <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> continuation of the one that regulates childhood growth and development. This regulation would depend on changes in gene expression that affect the systems responsible for maintenance, repair and defence responses. Damage-related factors include internal and environmental assaults to living organisms that induce cumulative damage at various levels.|$|E

I think <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great Christmas gift to reinvigorate the game". Ed Boon said on his Twitter account that the plan for DLC had been scrapped, which occurred because, as clarified by 1UP, Midway had filed for bankruptcy and was purchased by Warner Bros.

500|$|Observing Wenger's {{transfer}} policy in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson commented that it lacked balance and needed defensive players to solidfy the Arsenal team. The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested {{it was because the}} manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes you need someone to galvanise and <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> shouter and bawler. It may not be Arsene's way, but I think they lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every time you have an injured player. You know I have the wrong reputation. I'm not scared to spend money. The job of a manager is not to spend as much money".|$|E
500|$|Produced by Madlib, [...] "The Healer" [...] is an ode to hip hop {{culture and}} a {{proclamation}} of its scope. It {{opens with a}} brief snippet from a song by Malcolm McLaren featuring the World's Famous Supreme Team. Frere-Jones notes [...] "bells, unidentifiable knocks, a lonesome instrument <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sitar, or a guitar, and lots of empty space" [...] in the musical backdrop, adding that [...] "the music flirts with total stasis, though it still has an audible beat." [...] Badu's lyrics, delivered in an incantation style, make reference to various names of God, including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Jah, and Rastafari, while asserting hip hop to be [...] "bigger than" [...] social institutions such as religion and government. She explained the lyrics and religious references, saying [...] "to me, hip-hop is felt in all religions - it has a healing power. I've recently been to Palestine, Jerusalem, Africa {{and a bunch of}} other places, and everyone is listening to hip-hop. There's something about that kicking snare sound that all kinds of people find meaning in." [...] The autobiographical song [...] "Me" [...] discusses Badu's thoughts and feelings about her life, including the struggle of growing as a public figure. She mocks others' perception of her, which she has explained as [...] "everything you can see of Erykah Badu — the Ankhs, the powers, the 5 Percenters, the mysteries, it’s all true. The lies; it’s all true. Had two babies with different daddies. Thirty-six years old and addicted to a variety of spending." [...] The song's jazz conclusion has Badu singing about her mother's life and resilience in unison with a muted trumpet.|$|E

2500|$|Perugino's {{scene of}} Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter [...] is {{remarkable}} for the clarity and simplicity of its composition, {{the beauty of}} the figurative painting, which includes a self-portrait among the onlookers, and especially the perspective cityscape which includes reference to Peter's ministry to Rome by the presence of two triumphal arches, and centrally placed an octagonal building <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Christian baptistry or a Roman Mausoleum.|$|E
2500|$|Grant's {{objective}} following Spotsylvania was the North Anna River, about [...] south, and {{the important}} railroad intersection just south of it, Hanover Junction.

He designated Hancock's II Corps to head southeast from Spotsylvania to Milford Station, hoping that Lee would take the bait and attack this isolated corps.

[...] The story was included in Tales of the Unexpected #16, from 1957; and although the character had a different design, some details would be reused by Kirby when he created the Marvel Comics version.

2500|$|Grant's {{objective}} following Spotsylvania was the North Anna River, about [...] south, and {{the important}} railroad intersection just south of it, Hanover Junction (the modern village of Doswell, Virginia). By seizing both of these, Grant could not only interrupt Lee's supply line, he could deny the Confederates their next logical defensive line, forcing them to attack his army in the open, under more favorable terms. Grant knew that Lee could probably beat him in a straight race to the North Anna, so he devised a stratagem <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> successful alternative.

[...] In January 2015, after Orci's departure, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung were hired to rewrite the screenplay, with Pegg saying on the previous draft, Paramount [...] "had a script for Star Trek that wasn't really working for them. I think the studio was worried that it might have been a little bit too Star Trek-y." [...] Pegg had been asked to make the new film [...] "more inclusive", stating that the solution was to [...] "make a western or a thriller or a heist movie, then populate that with Star Trek characters so it's more inclusive to an audience <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little bit reticent." ...|$|E
5000|$|First of all, it must {{be stated}} that the name [...] "Shoshenq" [...] {{originates}} in an ancient Libyco-Berber language, perhaps related to the Numidian Berber language used {{during the time of}} the Roman Empire.

2500|$|Many of {{his later}} {{paintings}} and {{works on paper}} shifted toward [...] "romantic symbolism", and their titles can be interpreted visually through shapes and forms and words.

In a 1994 retrospective, curator Kirk Varnedoe described Twombly's work as [...] "influential among artists, discomfiting to many critics and truculently difficult not just for a broad public, but for sophisticated initiates of postwar art as well." [...] After acquiring Twombly's Three Studies from the Temeraire (1998–99), the Director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales said, [...] "Sometimes people need a little bit of help in recognising a great work of art <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bit unfamiliar."
