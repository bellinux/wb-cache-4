5|$|In 1761 John Griffin {{published}} {{a letter in}} the London Chronicle recommending methods for entering the Camel estuary during rough weather, particularly while north-northwest winds were blowing and described <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> and rings he had fixed to the cliffs to assist ships trying to enter the harbour. Mooring rings were still there in 1824, and around 1830, three capstans {{at the base of}} the cliffs and bollards along the cliffs, by which means boats could be warped safely past the bar were installed.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{arrived at}} 05:30 on 30 September {{to take over}} the {{position}} and the care of the 534 sick, as well as collecting the 14 guns, 35 machine guns, two automatic rifles, three railway engines, 25 railway trucks, lorries and large amounts of ammunition and stores. After assurances by Brigadier General Ryrie commanding the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, that the sick and wounded Ottoman soldiers would be cared for, the Ottoman force concentrated at dawn near Ziza railway station while the light horsemen took <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> from the Ottoman rifles. Two Anatolian battalions remained armed in case the Beni Sakhr attacked during the march. The 5th Light Horse Regiment marched between 4,068 and 4,082 prisoners, including walking wounded, north to Amman. They were followed by 502 sick.|$|E
25|$|At this point, <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> {{is locked}} into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier backward a short distance. As <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of <b>the</b> gun, <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> cam pin, riding in a slot on <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier, forces <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier. <b>The</b> <b>bolt's</b> rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as {{the neck of the}} case clears the barrel extension, <b>the</b> <b>bolt's</b> spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|R
5000|$|In Spool-valve-based {{electropneumatic}} markers, <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> also {{acts as the}} valve. This {{eliminates the}} need for a stacked tube construction; spool valve markers have a more compact profile. Instead of a cycling hammer or ram that strikes a pin valve, the movement of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> is controlled by the routing of air into small chambers in front of or behind <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b> An air reservoir behind <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> contains <b>the</b> air that is to fire the paintball. When the marker is at rest, air is routed to the front of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to prevent <b>the</b> air in the reservoir from escaping. In an [...] "unbalanced spool valve" [...] design, when the trigger is pulled, that air is exhausted from the marker, allowing the air in the reservoir to push <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> forwards. In a [...] "balanced spool valve" [...] design, the air in the reservoir cannot force <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> open; instead, <b>the</b> air from the front of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> is rerouted to a small chamber behind <b>the</b> <b>bolt,</b> separate from <b>the</b> reservoir, which then pushes <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> forward. In either case, the movement of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> forward exposes pathways in <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> or <b>the</b> marker that allow the air in the reservoir behind <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to surge forward and fire the paintball. Afterwards, airflow to the front of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> is restored, pushing <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> back into its resting position.|$|R
50|$|CMMG {{introduced}} the Mk 45 Guard rifle incorporating a radial-delay in 2017. This system uses {{the rotation of}} <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head to accelerate <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier of an AR-15 pattern rifle. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> locking lugs are adapted to incorporate angles that rotate <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> as it travels rearward under conventional blowback power. As <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> rotates, it must accelerate <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier to <b>the</b> rear through an adapted cam-pin slot. This acceleration amplifies the effective mass of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier, slowing <b>the</b> speed of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head. This delay allows pressure to drop prior to extraction without the penalty of a heavier <b>bolt</b> carrier assembly. <b>The</b> system is similar to roller and lever-delayed blowback in that it uses the mass of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier moving {{at a faster rate}} than <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head to delay the action from opening.|$|R
5|$|On February 18, 2011, Brewer {{was traded}} to the Tampa Bay Lightning for Brock Beukeboom and Tampa Bay's third-round {{selection}} in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. In 22 games with Tampa Bay, he notched a goal and an assist. He also led the Lightning in average ice time per game, with 21:34. At the end of the 2010â€“11 season, Brewer recorded a career-high nine goals and also amassed 81 penalty minutes, good for the second-highest total of his NHL career. He also appeared in a career-high 18 post-season contests with the Lightning in the 2011 playoffs, registering three goals and 17 points, helping <b>the</b> <b>Bolts</b> in their first playoff appearance in four seasons. During the 2011 playoffs, he set a career-high with three points in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Quarter-finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins and ranked third among all post-season skaters with 51 blocked shots. On June 24, 2011, Brewer signed a four-year, $15.4 million contract extension with the Lightning.|$|E
25|$|Slip bolts {{may be used}} to hold scenery wagons in {{position}} when high lateral strength is required and it is permissible to drill holes in the stage. <b>The</b> <b>bolts</b> are mounted to the wagon base and, when the wagon is {{in position}}, <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> are lowered into their designated, predrilled holes.|$|E
25|$|The {{second quarter}} was {{relatively}} quiet as 2 Kaeding Field goals (23-yards & 29-yards) gave <b>the</b> <b>Bolts</b> a 16-point lead going into halftime.|$|E
50|$|Another unique {{feature is}} <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> lock. Since {{blowback}} guns of these calibers require heavy <b>bolts,</b> <b>the</b> inertia of dropping the gun can cause <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to come partially open, rendering the gun unfirable until <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> is manually closed all the way. To prevent this, the Carbine uses a lock that locks <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> securely closed {{so that a}} fall will not dislodge it. A slight pressure on the trigger or on <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> handle, however, will disengage <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> {{so that it can}} move for firing or clearing the action.|$|R
50|$|The delay {{results from}} {{the amount of time}} it takes for enough recoil energy to be {{transferred}} through to <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier and <b>the</b> forward pressure exerted against <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> by <b>the</b> recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier to <b>the</b> rear. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head since <b>the</b> cartridge remains in the chamber {{for a short period of}} time during the initial recoil impulse. After <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier has traveled rearward 4 mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head and <b>the</b> rollers are compressed into <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head. Only once the locking rollers are fully cammed into <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head can <b>the</b> entire <b>bolt</b> group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.|$|R
50|$|The single-piece frame/receiver is molded from ABS {{plastic and}} largely {{unmachined}} {{with the exception}} of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> guides which <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> rides on. A stamped steel receiver cover rests over the top of <b>the</b> <b>bolt,</b> sandwiching it in place. The receiver cover hinges {{at the front of the}} frame and latches onto the rear of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> assembly. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> assembly consists of a cast steel bolt that rides on a spring and follower; a thin firing pin channel runs down the center of <b>the</b> <b>bolt,</b> allowing <b>the</b> stamped firing pin to be struck by the hammer and impact the cartridge at the front of <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter the defense stepped up for <b>the</b> <b>Bolts</b> on 2 fourth down plays and a San Diego CB Quentin Jammer {{interception}} sealed the victory for San Diego.|$|E
25|$|Incorrect fitting can distort (warp) discs; {{the disc}}'s {{retaining}} bolts (or the wheel/lug nuts, if the disc is simply sandwiched {{in place by}} the wheel, as on many cars) must be tightened progressively and evenly. The use of air tools to fasten lug nuts can be bad practice, unless a torque wrench is also used for final tightening. The vehicle manual will indicate the proper pattern for tightening as well as a torque rating for <b>the</b> <b>bolts.</b> Lug nuts should never be tightened in a circle. Some vehicles are sensitive to the force <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> apply and tightening should be done with a torque wrench.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of the two}} aft {{external}} tank umbilical plates {{mate with}} a corresponding plate on the orbiter. The plates help maintain alignment among the umbilicals. Physical strength at the umbilical plates is provided by bolting corresponding umbilical plates together. When the orbiter GPCs command external tank separation, <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> are severed by pyrotechnic devices.|$|E
50|$|The G3A3 (A4) is a selective-fire {{automatic}} weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. <b>The</b> two-piece <b>bolt</b> assembly {{consists of a}} breech (bolt head) and <b>bolt</b> carrier. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> is held in battery by two sliding cylindrical rollers that engage locking recesses in the barrel extension. The breech is opened when both rollers are compressed inward against camming surfaces driven by the rearward pressure of the expanding gases upon <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head. As <b>the</b> rollers move inward, recoil energy is transferred to the locking piece and bolt carrier which begin to withdraw while <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head slowly moves rearward in relation to <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier. As <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier clears <b>the</b> rollers, pressure in the bore drops to a safe level, <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head is caught by <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier {{and moves to the}} rear as one unit, continuing the operating cycle. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> also features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> while <b>the</b> lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by <b>the</b> recoiling <b>bolt).</b>|$|R
50|$|The CZ 550 system {{consists}} of a receiver {{that serves as the}} systems shroud and a bolt group of which <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> body has three locking lugs, two large main lugs at <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head and <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> handle serves as a backup in case the primary locking lugs failed. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> handle is permanently attached to <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> and is turned-down and backwards for use with optical sights.|$|R
2500|$|Behind <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier is {{a plastic}} or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier and <b>bolt</b> back toward <b>the</b> chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> cam pin and prevents it and <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> from rotating into a closed position. <b>The</b> <b>bolt's</b> locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> moves forward. <b>The</b> round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As <b>the</b> <b>bolt's</b> locking lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R
25|$|A selfbolting door {{has special}} hinges that permit the panel leaf to move laterally, {{so that the}} door itself becomes a giant bolt for better security. The selfbolting door {{principle}} can be used both for hinged doors as for rotating doors, as well as up-and-over doors (in the latter case, <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> are then placed at top and bottom {{rather than at the}} sides).|$|E
25|$|The basic Bensen Gyrocopter {{design is}} a simple frame of square {{aluminium}} or galvanized steel tubing, reinforced with triangles of lighter tubing. It is arranged so that the stress falls on the tubes, or special fittings, not <b>the</b> <b>bolts.</b> A front-to-back keel mounts a steerable nosewheel, seat, engine, and a vertical stabilizer. Outlying mainwheels are mounted on an axle. Some versions may mount seaplane-style floats for water operations.|$|E
25|$|Three inch (7.5cm) {{diameter}} bolts connect {{portions of}} the bridge deck mounting bosses to several concrete columns. There are 288 such bolts of various lengths. <b>The</b> <b>bolts</b> were tested in place by overtightening their retaining nuts. In the two weeks subsequent to this tightening, 30 of the first 96 bolts loaded failed. These bolts vary in length from 9 to 17 feet and failure was initially attributed to hydrogen embrittlement, with hydrogen introduced during either manufacturing or electroplating. Some of <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> can be replaced while others cannot be removed and load transfer will require more complex remediation methods. Repairs were initially not expected to delay the opening, but later it was believed it would delay the opening until December. The fix could cost up to five million dollars. A temporary fix was announced on August 15, 2013, with the opening revised back to its original date. The solution selected was to add a tendon-secured saddle at each deck boss location. It was suggested internally that issues with tensioning the main cable {{may have led to}} the bolt failures.|$|E
50|$|While {{it would}} be simpler and easier to shorten <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to fit {{completely}} behind <b>the</b> breech, <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> must have {{a certain amount of}} mass in order to operate reliably with a given caliber. <b>The</b> telescoping <b>bolt</b> moves some of that mass forward of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> face, resulting in a bolt which is longer overall, but is shorter behind <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> face.|$|R
50|$|As the {{recoil spring}} returns to its {{uncompressed}} state, it pushes <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> body backward with sufficient force to cycle <b>the</b> action. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> body unlocks and retracts <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head, extracts and ejects the cartridge, cocks the hammer, and compresses the return spring. Once <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> reaches <b>the</b> {{end of its}} travel, the return spring provides the force to chamber the next round from the magazine, and lock <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> closed.|$|R
5000|$|Compressed air in {{the dump}} chamber overcomes the force of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> spring, pushing <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> forward. As <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> travels forward it seals off the feed port and 'uncorks' from the dump chamber. The {{compressed}} air from the dump chamber passes through <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> and propels a paintball down the barrel.|$|R
25|$|B-52C 53-0406, which {{crashed on}} Elephant Mountain, {{was the second}} high-tailed B-52 to suffer such a fatal {{structural}} failure. After extensive testing and another three similar failures (two with fatal crashes) within 12 months of the Elephant Mountain crash, Boeing determined that turbulence would over-stress the B-52's rudder connection bolts, causing first a rudder and subsequently a tail failure. <b>The</b> <b>bolts</b> were strengthened throughout the fleet, fixing the problem.|$|E
25|$|On October 1, 2015, the Lightning {{announced}} that Brayden Point had been reassigned to the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League. Point played {{in two games}} for the Lightning this preseason, recording three shots. Point also skated in {{all three of the}} team's prospect tournament games in Estero last month, recording a goal and three points. He was tied for third on <b>the</b> <b>Bolts</b> for points during the tournament.|$|E
25|$|The Tampa Bay Lightning are a {{professional}} ice hockey team based in Tampa, Florida. It {{is a member}} of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Lightning have one Stanley Cup championship in their history, in 2003â€“04. The team is often referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Bolts,</b> and the nickname was used on the former third jerseys. The Lightning plays home games in the Amalie Arena in Tampa.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "spool valve" [...] ("spoolie") {{typically}} uses <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> {{itself to}} hold {{air in a}} filling chamber. This high-pressure air is either self-balancing {{so there is no}} net force to open <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> (a [...] "balanced" [...] spool valve), or is kept in check by additional air from the solenoid pushing backward on <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> (an [...] "unbalanced" [...] or [...] "dump-valve" [...] spool). When the trigger is pulled, the solenoid of a balanced system pushes <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> forward, or in a dump-valve vents the air from the forward pressure chamber. As <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> moves forward, it seals off the inlet allowing high-pressure gas into the filling chamber, and then releases the stored charge of air through <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> into <b>the</b> main chamber to launch the ball. The solenoid then resets <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> by allowing air to re-enter the forward chamber and pushing <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> backwards to re-seal the filling chamber and open the inlet. Spool valves are typically valued for their quieter and smoother operation, and their reduced mechanical complexity (often the only major moving part is <b>the</b> <b>bolt),</b> but are often less gas-efficient than poppet valves due to the large charge of air behind <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> and <b>the</b> single operating pressure used both to move <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> and launch <b>the</b> ball.|$|R
2500|$|Typically, a bolt is {{tensioned}} (preloaded) by {{the application}} of a torque to either <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head or <b>the</b> nut. The applied torque causes <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to [...] "climb" [...] the thread causing a tensioning of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b> <b>The</b> preload developed in a bolt is due to the applied torque and is a function of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> diameter, <b>the</b> geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under <b>the</b> torqued <b>bolt</b> head or nut. The stiffness of the components clamped by <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> and <b>the</b> clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> experiences as <b>the</b> tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> {{handle on}} <b>the</b> right side is engaged {{only when the}} large, round knob is pushed in, and {{functions}} only to retract <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b> Forward movement of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> comes from a mainspring behind <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b> There is a long, narrow flat plate {{on the top of}} the receiver, which has slight fore-and-aft movement.|$|R
25|$|After Ulysses {{had been}} at sea for only six hours, <b>the</b> <b>bolts,</b> plates, and {{turnbuckles}} holding the pontoons in place began {{to show signs of}} bending under the stress of the ocean voyage, and the ship was ordered back to San Francisco, for additional work on the pontoon mounts. At noon on 6 July, she again got underway and set her course, via Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, for the Marianas. She arrived at Saipan, on 6 August, (just over a week before Japan capitulated) and reported to Commander, Service Division 103.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 8, the Cupola was {{successfully}} moved from its launch location to its permanent {{location on the}} earth facing side of Tranquility. Cupola was moved by the space station robot arm (SSRMS), which was operated by Kay Hire and Terry Virts. ISS commander Jeff Williams assisted them by releasing <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> and hooks that held the Cupola in place and then securing it to its new home. The process was slightly delayed due to some bolts that were torqued tighter than expected on the ground, but flight controllers were able to increase the torque to release <b>the</b> <b>bolts.</b> Once the move of the Cupola was complete, outfitting continued to get the cupola ready. The crew {{will be able to}} ingress it tomorrow, but the window covers will not be opened until after the third and final spacewalk. While the Cupola relocation was going on, some of the crew members participated in transferring items between the shuttle and station. Also during this time Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick prepared the tools that they will use during the final spacewalk scheduled for flight day 10. During this time the pair re-sized another spacesuit on station for use by Behnken. This was done because the suit Behnken had been using had some problems with its communications equipment.|$|E
25|$|Wood posts {{enable the}} {{fabrication}} of strong, direct, yet inexpensive connections between large trusses and walls. Exact details for post-to-truss connections vary from designer to designer, {{and may be}} influenced by post type. Solid-sawn timber and glulam posts are generally notched to form a truss bearing surface. The truss is rested on the notches and bolted into place. A special plate/bracket may be added to increase connection load transfer capabilities. With mechanically-laminated posts, the truss may rest on a shortened outer-ply or on a shortened inner-ply. The later scenario places <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> in double shear and is a very effective connection.|$|E
50|$|When the {{solenoid valve}} is {{energized}} {{the air in}} front of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> vents, allowing <b>the</b> bias supplied {{to the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to move it forward. When <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> has moved forward enough to seal the breech, the pin unseals from the powertube it rides in, and air is vented through <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to <b>the</b> ball, firing it. When the solenoid valve is de-energized, air is again supplied to the front of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to return it.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> body, {{including}} <b>the</b> handle {{is made of}} {{a single}} piece of machined steel. To remove any play and reduce any chance of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> binding during <b>the</b> cycling of <b>the</b> action, <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head is smaller with the locking lugs being the same diameter as the body itself. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> has three gas vents along <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> body which will allow for the venting of hot gases should the case not seal the chamber or if a pierced primer should occur. Shortly after production began in Germany, <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> body was fluted to provide further positive feeding and extraction of the cartridges.|$|R
50|$|The Wildey uses a fixed-barrel, three-lug, rotating-bolt design. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> locks into <b>the</b> aft barrel extension. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> {{is linked}} to the slide via one of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> lugs. When <b>the</b> {{cartridge}} is fired, the piston is forced against the slide. The retracting slide catches <b>the</b> extended <b>bolt</b> lug which causes <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to rotate open. The spent cartridge is ejected by <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> through <b>the</b> retracting slide's ejection port. The fixed-barrel design is considered to promote greater accuracy over pistols designed around an articulating barrel design. The Wildey can be used as either a single-shot or an auto-loading pistol.|$|R
