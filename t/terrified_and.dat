25|$|Job was quiet, brief in words, and {{the only}} sound heard from his lips was the Jesus prayer. For many days and weeks he would retreat into his locked cave, so narrow that entry is difficult, and so small that it was {{impossible}} to sit, stand or lie conveniently. From the long periods of kneeling, his knees were covered with wounds, and wearing knee-marks into the rock floor. His disciple Dosyfey recounts that he saw supernatural light coming from the depths of the cave, shining for two hours onto the opposite side of the church. Dosyfey records that at the sight was <b>terrified</b> <b>and</b> fell to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Sparhawk-Jones {{struggled}} with depression, like her father, {{and when she}} was not well she burned her paintings, which reduced the number of works available for sale. In 1913, Sparhawk-Jones had a mental breakdown and lived in the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane for three years. The experience was hard on her and she was forever changed. Sparhawk-Jones was <b>terrified</b> <b>and</b> lonely at the asylum, and may have been subject to opium or sedative drugs. She moved in with her mother after she was released from the hospital in 1916. Sparhawk-Jones dealt with the losses of her teacher William Merritt Chase, who died in 1916, and Morton Shamburg, who died in 1918. She said that she did not work as an artist for about 12 years.|$|E

25|$|In 213, when Sun Quan's rival Cao Cao led an army {{to attack}} Ruxu (濡須; north of present-day Wuwei County, Anhui), Xu Sheng {{followed}} Sun Quan {{to resist the}} enemy at the Battle of Ruxu. Cao Cao launched a heavy assault on Hengjiang (橫江; southeast of present-day He County, Anhui, on the northern shore of the Yangtze), so Xu Sheng and Sun Quan's other generals led their forces to defend that position. Strong winds blew their mengchongs (a type of warship) across the river towards Cao Cao's side. Sun Quan's generals were all <b>terrified</b> <b>and</b> did not dare {{to land on the}} enemy's grounds. However, Xu Sheng led his men to charge at the enemy and succeeded in killing a few and forcing the rest to retreat. When the winds stopped, Sun Quan's forces returned to their side. Sun Quan highly praised Xu Sheng for his courage.|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling <b>terrified</b> <b>and</b> uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
25|$|The {{retreating}} raiders {{made their}} way to the coast at Zhapu while carrying their plunder with them. Their heavily laden river boats, thousands in number, stretched for miles. They however, did not have the seaworthy vessels to make their escape from China since Xu Hai had theirs destroyed when they first landed. Here Hu Zongxian offered them a deal: all who wished to surrender would be given positions in the military, while all who wished to return to Japan would be provided with seagoing vessels. The raiders had little choice but to accept. Now that Hu Zongxian had Xu Hai by the ear, he incited Xu Hai to attack his fellow marauders north in Songjiang to prove his sincerity. Xu Hai did so, hoping to keep the Songjiang marauders' booty and vessels for himself. As the raider groups fought each other in Zhujing (朱涇), the general Yu Dayou burned the river boats that Xu Hai left behind, and made short work of the remnant Songjiang marauders fleeing from Xu Hai. The operation left Xu Hai stranded and <b>terrified,</b> <b>and</b> he sent gifts and a younger brother as hostage to Hu as reassurance of his surrender.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Murphy {{starred in}} Red Lights with Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver's character {{who is a}} paranormal investigator. [...] Murphy considered working with De Niro to {{have been one of}} the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: [...] "My first scene when I come to visit him my character is supposed to be <b>terrified</b> <b>and</b> intimidated. There was no acting involved. The man has presence. You can't act presence. I'll never have that. Watching him use it...when you put a camera on it, it just becomes something else." ...|$|E
500|$|The storyline used {{elements}} of suspense, {{created by the}} use of [...] "shared secrets" [...] between Peggy and her daughter-in-law Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon), who invented elaborate cover stories to mask Peggy's trips to hospital from her sons and partner. Tension was deliberately built for viewing pleasure, posing the questions of whether Peggy's lump was benign or malignant and whether she would die, but also in terms of Peggy's relationships, whether her children would discover the truth or if George would end their relationship. Henderson has suggested that: [...] "such devises [...] pathos to Peggy's treatment path. Audiences [...] that she [...] <b>terrified</b> <b>and</b> about to discover her biopsy results, but must watch as she is casually castigated by her son Grant for pestering his wife Tiffany to accompany her to 'the dentist'." [...] Hospital scenes were also played for narrative pace to build tension and drama.|$|E

[...] Hill immediately communicated his concerns to Gascoyne, who sent for the young woman. [...] Accompanied by a contingent of Canningites, her answers were at first noncommittal, but once isolated from Canning's friends she soon admitted to Gascoyne that she had perjured herself. [...] She was committed to the Poultry Compter, where the Canningites continued to support her until they learnt that [...] "particular persons only" [...] were allowed to visit. [...] Hall was again questioned on 7March, by both Gascoyne and Canning's supporters. [...] When asked why she had lied to the court, she said [...] "when I was at Mr Fielding's I at first spoke the truth, but was told {{it was not the}} truth. [...] I was <b>terrified</b> <b>and</b> threatened to be sent to Newgate, and prosecuted as a felon, unless I should speak the truth." [...] She was asked by one of her supporters if she was still lying, but her replies were deemed inconclusive and having confessed to and denied most of the things about which she was questioned, each side began to see her as a liability.|$|E

500|$|Michael Tedder of Vulture wrote {{positively}} of {{the episode}} and awarded it {{four out of five}} stars. He called the final fight between Pam and Jim [...] "ugly and real" [...] and one in which [...] "the writers didn't flinch", in that it truly made him feel uncomfortable. Tedder complimented both Fischer and Krasinski, and wrote that Krasinski [...] "doesn't try to make Jim look charming in this fight, just <b>terrified</b> <b>and</b> exhausted." [...] He called Nellie's subplot [...] "the best use of this new version of Nellie", but wrote that Dwight and Darryl's subplot was undeveloped. Rick Porter of Zap2it felt that, while the episode was [...] "up and down" [...] (he wrote that Dwight and Darryl's subplot was [...] "flat", but that Erin and Pete's yielded several humorous lines) the final confrontation between Jim and Pam was [...] "a big dose of reality" [...] and that it was not [...] "a contrived fight". David Wilcox of The Citizen wrote that the fight between Pam and Jim was [...] "welcome" [...] because their relationship had grown stale ever since they had [...] "hooked up and started living their perfect little lives together." [...] Wilcox praised {{the way in which the}} fight was written, and wrote that he [...] "couldn't help smiling. Not because the fight wasn't wrenching to watch. But because it was." [...] Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a 7.8 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. She reasoned that while the episode was funny but largely forgettable, the final scene made it worth watching.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit <b>terrified,</b> <b>and</b> let me tell you why: I was too young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E
