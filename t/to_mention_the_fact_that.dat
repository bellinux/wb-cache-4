25|$|The {{next book}} in HarperCollins' four book series, Emily the Strange: Stranger and Stranger, was {{released}} in March 2010. In this book Emily is back in Blandindulle and preparing {{to move to a}} new town. While experimenting with her supply of Black rock and duplicating device she accidentally clones herself. Enjoying the benefit of a second Emily at first, the real Emily comes across problems such as identity crisis and loss of some of her unique talents. Not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> her clone thinks she's the real Emily and evidently plans to end Emily Strange for good.|$|E
500|$|Bronstein {{felt that}} Fischer [...] "had {{the right to}} play the match with Karpov on his own conditions". Korchnoi stated:Was Fischer right in {{demanding}} that the world title be protected by a two point handicap – that the challenger would be considered the winner with a 10–8 score and that the champion would retain his title {{in the event of}} a 9–9 draw? Yes, this was quite natural: the champion deserves this, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> further play to the first win {{in the event of a}}n even score would be nothing short of a lottery – the winner in that case could not claim to have won a convincing victory.|$|E
2500|$|Yael Kahn, {{chair of}} the UK-based Islington Friends of Yibna said that while she pleased to see openly {{criticism}} of Israeli policies, she {{also found that the}} petition was [...] "wholly inappropriate, due to its failure <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> these settlements are illegal. I am utterly appalled by the failure of the petition to mention Gaza and the barbaric siege Israel imposes on the 1.5 million Palestinians living there. It is outrageous to not speak out against the Israeli restrictions on the amount of food Palestinians in Gaza are allowed to have." ...|$|E

6000|$|He had forty-two boxes, all {{carefully}} packed, [...] With {{his name}} painted clearly on each: [...] But, since he omitted <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> [...] They were all left {{behind on the}} beach.|$|R
60|$|Leger {{remembered that}} she had once professed herself {{perfectly}} contented with the Green River country, {{but he did not}} think it advisable <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b> He rose and flung an armful of wood upon the fire, and then stood still smiling.|$|R
2500|$|Shaun Williamson {{frequently}} plays {{himself in}} Ricky Gervais's Extras, {{where he is}} referred to at all times as [...] "Barry from EastEnders". Derek Martin (Charlie Slater) appeared in episode three in the third series of Little Britain in 2005. The sketch primarily focused around the character Marjorie Dawes telling her Fat Fighters group not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Martin is in EastEnders, then mentioning it herself. In the Comic Relief special of Little Britain, the character Dennis Waterman refers to his [...] "daughter - the one in EastEnders". This is {{a reference to the}} real actor Dennis Waterman, who is the father of Hannah Waterman, who played Laura Beale in the show.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the film}} and the play take {{dramatic}} license with the on-air and behind-the-scene details of The Nixon Interviews. [...] Jonathan Aitken, one of Nixon's official biographers who spent much time with the former president at La Casa Pacifica, rebukes the film for its portrayal of a drunken Nixon making a late-night phone call as never having happened and says it is [...] "from start to finish, an artistic invention by the scriptwriter Peter Morgan." [...] Director Ron Howard discussed the scene in detail on his feature commentary for the DVD release, pointing out it was a deliberate act of dramatic license, and while Frost never received such a phone call, [...] "it was known that Richard Nixon, during ...the Watergate scandal, had occasionally made midnight phone calls that he couldn't very well recall the following day." [...] Aitken recalls that [...] "Frost did not ambush Nixon during the final interview into a damaging admission of guilt. What the former president 'confessed' about Watergate was carefully pre-planned. It was only with considerable help and advice from his adversary's team that Frost managed to get much more out of Nixon, in the closing sequences, by reining in his fierce attitude and adopting a gentler approach." [...] Elizabeth Drew of the Huffington Post and author of Richard M. Nixon (2007) noted some inaccuracies, including a misrepresentation {{of the end of}} the interviews, the failure <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Nixon received 20% of the profits from the interviews, and what she says are inaccurate representations of some of the characters. Drew points out a critical line in the movie that is particularly deceptive: Nixon admitted he [...] "'...was involved in a 'cover-up,' as you call it.' The ellipsis is of course unknown to the audience, and is crucial: What Nixon actually said was, 'You're wanting me to say that I participated in an illegal cover-up. No!'" ...|$|E

He is married and lives with his daughter and son in Essex. Jason also owns a Ferrari F355, but is careful never <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> in public.|$|R

6000|$|She {{seemed to}} look at me a moment as for the tip of the ear of irony. “You doubtless think I exaggerate, and you force me {{therefore}} <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I speak of such matters with a certain intelligence.” ...|$|E
60|$|When Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase, {{every one}} {{told him he}} was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no doubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville himself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his duty <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} a few areas where de facto {{differences}} within states exist, the overall pattern is simple enough, and close enough to actual practice, that it is effective and efficient to learn the basic pattern (for repeat travelers and repeat users of long-distance telephone service) and <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>to</b> those likely to be affected by it (for those living or working in areas where de facto exceptions apply).|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen!" [...] he said. [...] "It'll {{take them}} {{an hour to}} catch up with us. Suppose, during that time, that door {{happened}} to open accidentally, as it were, and close again? You wouldn't think it necessary <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> eh? You would be a good fellow and keep your mouth shut, yes? You might even see your way to {{go so far as to}} back me up in a statement to the effect that I hooked it out with my----?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Both Peter and Jumper {{opened their}} eyes very wide with surprise. [...] "Also," [...] {{continued}} Old Mother Nature, [...] "you forgot <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Jumper never hides in hollow logs and {{holes in the}} ground as you do. Why don't you, Jumper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'May it please your Majesty,' said Lachesis, 'I am {{doubtful}} {{whether we}} have the power of expelling anyone from Hades. It is not less the law that a mortal cannot remain here; and it is too notorious for me <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> none here have the power of inflicting death.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-night, my dear friend," [...] he said, [...] "all of us, I believe, {{go on to}} a ball at Carmarthen House. It would grieve me also, I am sure, Duke, to seem inhospitable, but I am {{compelled}} <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{the hour}} for which the carriages have been ordered is already at hand." ...|$|E
60|$|Pillingshot had not finished, but Scott so evidently {{believed}} that he had, {{that it would have}} been unkind <b>to</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b> He followed <b>the</b> smiter to the nets.|$|R
6000|$|That home-thrust told. The judge's colour was livid to look upon. What {{could this}} girl mean? How on earth could she know? How had she even {{found out he}} was at Mambury at all? A terrible doubt oppressed his soul. Had Gwendoline confided his {{movements}} to Elma? He had warned his daughter time and again not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> [...] "for fear of misapprehension," [...] he said, with shuffling eyes askance. It was better nobody should know he had been anywhere near Dartmoor {{on the day of the}} accident.|$|R
60|$|She {{wondered}} what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city, and finally decided {{that he had been}} appointed to some great honor, somewhere, but had been too modest <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b> If she had seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture in the dark.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{admit it}} would be rough on any {{ordinary}} boy <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> his father was in prison," [...] said Dick. [...] "But we all know, and Dan Baxter himself knows, that one is about as wicked as the other. The only thing that makes Arnold Baxter's case worse {{is that he is}} old enough to know better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} it would have suited you, Thyra--a seat on horseback for a throne, and a rough tent for a palace, would not be in your way at all. I think a snug villa on the slopes of the bay of Carthagena, will suit you better, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I shall make an {{infinitely}} more pleasant and agreeable master than a Numidian chief would do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Hardy," [...] he ordered, {{as he drew}} on his gloves, [...] "spend as {{much time}} as you like with that fellow and let me know what sort of {{questions}} he asks you. Be careful not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I am dining with Mr. Hebblethwaite. For the rest, fence with him. I am not quite sure what it all means. If by any chance he mentions a man named Selingman, let me know. Good night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which was not often, my dear," [...] Captain Ripon--her husband--said. [...] "However it is, as you say, too bad; and I {{will bring}} the fellow to justice, if I can. There are twelve prize fowls--worth a couple of guineas apiece, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of their being pets of yours--stolen, {{probably}} by tramps; who will eat them, and for whom the commonest barn-door chickens would have done as well. There are marks of blood {{in two or three}} places, so they have evidently been killed for food. The house was locked up last night, all right; for you see they got in by breaking in a panel of the door.|$|R
40|$|A person {{familiar}} with the Star Wars trilogy and currently hooked to the remake of „Battleship Galactica“ may feel curiously attracted {{and at the same}} time puzzled when entering one of the grandiose baroque interiors, many of which can be found in Bavaria, Austria and Hungary, whose ceilings are decorated with elaborate celestial landscapes. The sheer exuberance of the visual display of imaginary cosmic interaction has no match in contemporary architecture, but it may well be regarded as akin to recent science fiction scenarios, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of real life digital warfare. As far as iconographic conventions are concerned, Jupiter and Superman are reasonably close relatives. Yet, on the other hand, centuries divide those exquisite showcases of church and nobility from pop culture...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} my habit, sir, to study the Education Acts of my country ever since that which was passed {{at the time of}} the Great Skirmish; but, with the {{exception}} of exercise, I have not as yet been able to find any direct allusion to these matters. Nor is this surprising when you consider that education is popularly supposed to be, not for the acquisition of happiness, but for the good of trade or the promotion of acute self-consciousness through what we know as culture. If by any chance there should arise a President of Education so enlightened as to share my views, it would be impossible for him <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> for fear of being sent to Colney Hatch." ...|$|R
60|$|His wife denied {{herself for}} a day to her most {{intimate}} friends,--for {{it was she who}} had entertained visions of a title; and it was characteristic of the Rose of Sharon that she knew nothing of the Vanes beyond the name. The discovery that the Austens were the oldest family in the State was in the nature of a balm; and henceforth, in speaking of Austen, she never failed <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> his great-grandfather was Minister to Spain in the '30's,--a period when her own was engaged in a far different calling.|$|E
60|$|As Mr. Markam and the salmon-fisher walked {{together}} {{along the}} shore the former asked his companion not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{he had been in}} such imminent danger, for that it would only distress his dear wife and children. He said that he would warn them all of the quicksand, and for that purpose he, then and there, asked questions about it till he felt that his information on the subject was complete. Before they parted he asked his companion if he had happened to see a second figure, dressed like himself on the other rock as he had approached to succour him.|$|E
6000|$|I confess {{it was a}} {{sufficiently}} suspicious conjunction. The three representatives of the diamond interest gazed {{at each other with}} inquiring side-glances. Then their eyes fell suddenly: they avoided one another. Had each independently substituted a weak and inferior natural stone for Professor Schleiermacher's manufactured pebbles? It almost seemed so. For a moment, I admit, I was half inclined to suppose it. But next second I changed my mind. Could a man of Sir Charles Vandrift's integrity and high principle stoop for lucre's sake to so mean an expedient?--not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> even if he did, and if Mosenheimer did likewise, the stones submitted to the scientific men would have amply sufficed to establish the reality and success of the experiments! ...|$|E
50|$|Noteworthy <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Workbench was {{the only}} window manager that {{eventually}} inspired an entire family of descendant and successors: Ambient in MorphOS, Zune/Wanderer in AROS, Workbench NG (New Generation in AmigaOS 4.0 and 4.1). Workbench 4.1 was enhanced by 2D vector interface powered by Cairo libraries, and presenting a modern Porter-Duff 3D based Compositing Engine.|$|R
5000|$|Bob Colayco of GameSpot {{said of the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions: [...] "NBA 2K6 isn't for {{the casual}} {{basketball}} fan who doesn't know a pick and roll from picking his nose. The difficulty of the game, and new interface nuances, {{may be a little}} overwhelming for someone who's more attuned to something like NBA Jam or NBA Street. But for those looking for a quality simulation basketball experience, NBA 2K6 is a resounding slam dunk and is easily recommendable to any fan of the series or to any hardcore basketball fan in general." [...] VideoGamer.com's Greg Vallentin praised the simulation gameplay and the amount of content, but criticized the Xbox 360 version for not offering enough improvements. He stated: [...] "NBA 2K6, like its predecessors, delivers a solid simulation basketball game that's worth picking up if you've got a hankering for <b>the</b> sport, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that's it's incredibly affordable." ...|$|R
5000|$|The James who Paul {{met with}} here was James, known as [...] "the brother of Jesus", and {{also known as}} [...] "James the Just". The murder of James, the son of Zebedee and brother of John the Apostle, had been {{reported}} in , and this James, the new leader of 'the brethren', was referred to in [...] Some commentators identify him with James the son of Alphaeus who had served {{as one of the}} twelve apostles (...) , for example Matthew Poole suggested that James was 'one of the apostles', but others disagree. The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges [...] states [...] "There was not any Apostle there or St Luke would hardly have failed <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> as {{he was one of those}} present" [...] and William Robertson Nicoll, in the Expositor's Greek Testament, likewise argued that [...] "Nothing is said of the Apostles" [...] Hans Hinrich Wendt suggested that the presence of of the apostles was encompassed within the reference to 'elders', but this view is contested by Nicoll.|$|R
