40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the impact of simulated rat damage on grain yield in irrigated lowland rice in An Giang province, in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Rat damage was simulated by making a 45 ° cut {{at the base of}} the rice <b>tillers</b> about 3 - 5 cm above the soil surface. 0 % (control), 5 %, 10 %, 25 % and 50 % of the <b>tillers</b> were removed at the <b>tillering</b> (25 days after sowing, DAS), panicle initiation (43 DAS), flowering (72 DAS) and ripening (87 DAS) stages. The total number of mature <b>tillers,</b> immature <b>tillers</b> and percent filled grains, the weight of 1000 grains and grain yields were recorded. The rice crop completely compensated by increased <b>tillering</b> and yield for <b>tillers</b> damaged up to 50 % at the <b>tillering</b> stage. However, the damage and yield loss were highly variable. The ability of the rice crop to compensate at later stages progressively reduced. The implications for managing rat damage to rice crops are (1) rodent control activities should be applied before 10 % of <b>tillers</b> are damaged at the <b>tillering</b> stage, and (2) a well balanced nitrogen supply during the <b>tillering</b> stage could potentially assist the rice plants to better compensate for rat damage. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Formation {{of higher}} number of <b>tillers</b> is {{desirable}} for higher grain yield in both wheat and barley; <b>tillers</b> have delayed physiological development. Studies addressing the contribution of secondary <b>tillers</b> in final DON concentration for wheat and barley are limited. This project aims to improve {{our understanding of the}} relationship between FHB symptoms and DON concentration by examining the contribution of primary spikes and secondary <b>tillers</b> {{as it relates to the}} final DON concentration. Experiments, established as split-split plot design with five replications, was be conducted in South Dakota with moderately resistant and susceptible cultivars of each spring wheat, winter wheat and barley. Two inoculation time treatments was applied; at the anthesis of primary spikes (Feekes 10. 5) and at anthesis of <b>tillers</b> (Feekes 11. 2). Primary spikes (inoculated at Feekes 10. 5) and <b>tillers</b> (inoculated at Feekes 11. 2) were harvested separately, analyzed for visually scabby kernels and deoxynivalenol following standard protocols. Levels of DON were statistically higher in main heads of barley and spring wheat in each cultivar compared to its <b>tillers.</b> In winter wheat, though there was higher DON level in <b>tillers</b> than main heads in each cultivar, it was not statistically different. Based upon our result, it is suggested that cultivars with high <b>tillers</b> number should be selected in breeding programs to develop cultivars with high yield and low DON. Similarly, planting density of wheat and barley can be adjusted such that it will result in higher numbers of <b>tillers,</b> increasing <b>tillers</b> proportion that might lower DON concentration in final harvest...|$|R

The per cent increase in hybrid was 6.26 over ADT 43 and 21.7 over ADT 36. This variation in number of <b>tillers</b> at active <b>tillering,</b> panicle initiation and maturity stages within the varieties and hybrid were observed again due to the intrinsic character of the varieties and hybrid. In the case of different levels of enriched pressmud compost, the levels of 1.25 and 2.50  t ha− 1 were equally influencing the production of number of <b>tillers.</b> However, the treatments, 3.75 and 5.00  t ha− 1 was significantly on par in producing the number of <b>tillers</b> as, 583 and 582  m− 2, respectively, during maturity stage.
