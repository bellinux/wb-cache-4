5|$|During {{his time}} at Harvard, Whitehead {{produced}} his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote Science and the Modern World, which was immediately hailed {{as an alternative to}} the Cartesian dualism <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> popular science. Lectures from 1927–28, were published in 1929 as a book named Process and Reality, which has been compared (both in importance and difficulty) to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.|$|E

While Seattle public schools were influenced by Washington’s superintendent Worth McClure, they still struggled to pay teachers and maintain attendance. The UW, despite academic challenges <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> the college due to differing views on teaching and learning, focused on growth in student enrollment rather than improving the existing school.|$|E
5|$|The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy {{recommendations}} before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, and in the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all capitalist governments had done so. Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, {{partly as a result}} of the stagflation <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> the Anglo-American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists. He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the business cycle favourably with fiscal policy.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the scholar}} István Boná, Thurisind's {{rise to power}} is a typical example of the {{conflicts}} among the leading families for the kingship <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> Gepidia in the 6th century and {{made it difficult to}} maintain the succession within the king's family. To contain these obstacles Thurisind made Turismod, his oldest son, commander of the Gepid forces in Sirmium, an important position that made Turismod the king's heir apparent (in early Germanic custom the eldest son was not necessarily the first in line of succession). After Turismod died, his younger brother Cunimund became commander in Sirmium and thus heir apparent.|$|E

5|$|After {{penetrating}} Ganon, {{the four}} Links firmly seal him inside the Four Sword, bringing chaos and horror to an end. Peace returns to Hyrule, {{the souls of}} the knights are freed from their torment, and the people celebrate as all traces of evil <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> Hyrule are vanquished. With Ganon defeated and sealed inside, Link returns the Four Sword that sealed darkness away back to its resting pedestal and the four Links become one again. After the battle, The Maidens of the Shrine use their powers and create a barrier, which is strong enough for the Four Sword to rest before the six maidens leave. Thus, Link's journey has ended and both he and Zelda leave the Sanctuary as Darkness fades away and Light endures in the Land of Hyrule, bringing peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|High waves caused beach erosion northward through Virginia. At Virginia Beach, {{the waves}} led to minor {{flooding}} along the Sandbridge section; rough surf {{and a strong}} undertow drowned one swimmer there. The storm triggered statewide power outages that affected about 5,000residents, {{as well as the}} Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel. In Newport News, lightning set a roof on fire in the Lee Hall section of the city. Emily's light rains in the area were not enough to break a prolonged drought <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> Virginia. Rough seas and high tides later caused coastal flooding along Fire Island in New York.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} men in {{leadership}} positions {{were likely to be}} wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the British First Army headquarters, a large-scale plasticine model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the topographical features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system. In addition, upwards of 40,000 topographical trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield. These measures gave each platoon a clearer picture of how it fitted into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the command and control problems <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> First World War combat.|$|E

5|$|The first tests using {{electric}} detonators and solid pits {{were performed on}} 7 and 14 February 1945; until then primacord-based initiation was employed. The {{electric detonators}} showed a significant improvement in the achieved compression degree and symmetry, and were used on all RaLa tests thereafter. Based on these results, {{by the end of}} February the design of the gadget, as the bomb was euphemistically known, was settled. Other test methods were also necessary, as the RaLa experiments provided only indirect indications about the formation of problematic jets <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> the early implosion designs, but RaLa was the most important.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's ski jumping at these championships, the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of snowfall <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} the ski jumping individual large hill competition to be limited to one jump.|$|E
5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E

5|$|In January 1995, R.E.M. {{set out on}} {{its first}} tour in six years. The tour was a huge {{commercial}} success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm {{was only the beginning}} of a series of health problems <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia and released in home video form as Road Movie.|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
5|$|The RF {{claimed that}} the bloody civil wars, {{military}} coups and other disasters <b>that</b> <b>plagued</b> the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black nationalist leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the Congo, it presented chaotic doomsday scenarios of what black nationalist rule in Southern Rhodesia might mean, particularly for the white community. Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony's proud war record on Britain's behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War context to form an anti-communist, pro-Western front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.|$|E
