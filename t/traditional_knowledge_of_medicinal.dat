Realizing that the biodiversity of their forests is under threat, the ASPnet schools, together with university researchers and medical practitioners, united their forces to come to the rescue of the forest resources in Côte d'Ivoire. The schools promote botanical gardens where parents as well as traditional medicine practitioners teach students how to conserve and manage forest resources in a more sustainable way. Through the study visits in the botanical garden, students acquire <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicinal</b> plant cultivation which will enable them to identify, protect, preserve and promote the medicinal plants which have tremendous ecological and cultural importance in Côte d'Ivoire.

40|$|Abstract Background In ethnobotanical research, the {{investigation}} into <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicinal</b> plants {{in the context of}} migration has been of increasing interest in recent decades since it is influenced and changed by new environmental and social conditions. It most likely undergoes transformation processes to match the different living circumstances in the new location. This study compares the <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicinal</b> plants held by Tyroleans – and their descendants – who emigrated to Australia, Brazil and Peru at different time scales. The study’s findings allow a discussion of the complexities and dynamics that influence this knowledge within the context of long-distance migration. Methods Information was obtained from 65 informants by free-listing, semi-structured interviews and non-participatory observation in Tyrol (Austria) and the migrants’ countries: Australia, Brazil and Peru. The collected data was analysed using different quantitative approaches, including statistical tests, and compared between the countries of investigation. Results All respondents in all four investigation areas claimed that they had knowledge and made use of medicinal plants to treat basic ailments in their day-to-day lives. Informants made 1, 139 citations of medicinal plants in total in free lists, which correspond to 164 botanical taxa (genus or species level) in Tyrol, 87 in Australia, 84 in Brazil and 134 in Peru. Of all the botanical taxa listed, only five (1. 1 %) were listed in all four countries under investigation. Agreement among informants within free lists was highest in Tyrol (17 %), followed by Peru (12. 2 %), Australia (11. 9 %) and Brazil (11. 2 %). The proportion of agreement differs significantly between informants in Australia and Tyrol (p[*]=[*] 0. 001), Brazil and Tyrol (p[*]=[*] 0. 001) and Peru and Tyrol (p[*]=[*] 0. 001) and is similar between informants in the migrant countries, as indicated by statistical tests. We recorded 1, 286 use citations according to 744 different uses (Tyrol: 552, Australia: 200, Brazil: 180, Peru: 357) belonging to 22 different categories of use. Use values are significantly different between Tyrol and Australia (p[*] Conclusions Changing ecological and social conditions have transformed and shaped <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicinal</b> plants through adaptation processes to match the new circumstances in the country of arrival.

Data was collected through participant observation and both semi-structured and in-depth interviews with 10 herbal specialists. A total of 50 medicinal plant taxa were documented, distributed among 46 genera and 27 botanical families. In folk medicine they are applied in 75 different formulations, which cure 63 human and three animal ailments. Quantitative ethnobotanical indices were calculated to analyze traditional knowledge of the informants and to determine the cultural importance of particular medicinal plants. Ziziphora pamiroalaica, Peganum harmala, and Inula orientalis obtained the highest use value (UV). The best-represented and culturally important families were Lamiaceae, Asteraceae, and Apiaceae.

40|$|Background: The {{study of}} <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicinal</b> plants {{has led to}} discoveries that have helped combat {{diseases}} and improve healthcare. However, the development of quantitative measures that can assist our quest for new medicinal plants has not greatly advanced in recent years. Phylogenetic tools have entered many scientific fields {{in the last two}} decades to provide explanatory power, but have been overlooked in ethnomedicinal studies. Several studies show that medicinal properties are not randomly distributed in plant phylogenies, suggesting that phylogeny shapes ethnobotanical use. Nevertheless, empirical studies that explicitly combine ethnobotanical and phylogenetic information are scarce. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we borrowed tools from community ecology phylogenetics to quantify significance of phylogenetic signal in medicinal properties in plants and identify nodes on phylogenies with high bioscreening potential. To do this, we produced an ethnomedicinal review from extensive literature research and a multilocus phylogenetic hypothesis for the pantropical genus Pterocarpus (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae). We demonstrate that species used to treat a certain conditions, such as malaria, are significantly phylogenetically clumped and we highlight nodes in the phylogeny that are significantly overabundant in species used to treat certain conditions. These cross-cultural patterns in ethnomedicinal usage in Pterocarpus are interpreted in the light of phylogenetic relationships. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides techniques that enable the application of phylogenies in bioscreening, bu...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} recognised the estimated 190, 000 Orang Asli in Peninsular Malaysia have traditional knowledge {{that could be}} further utilised {{for the development of}} bio-technology products. In the meantime, it is observed that such knowledge is dwindling and could possibly be lost in the wave of modernisation. It is essential to record and develop such knowledge for local and national interests. It is within this context that under the Ninth Malaysia Plan (2006 - 2010), the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) has made a special effort to document Traditional Knowledge (TK). This project is implemented by Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM) and the main objective is to establish a database on <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicinal</b> and aromatic plants used by Orang Asli in Peninsular Malaysia. This paper concerns the partnership and involvement between researchers and Orang Asli community in documenting the traditional knowledge as well as capacity building. The whole process involves initial discussion with community leaders. This was followed by two awareness workshops held at RPS Iskandar, Bera, Pahang and at the RPS Banun, Gerik, Perak. Two socio-economic surveys were subsequently conducted in these two locations. The information gathered is being analysed and is expected to provide input to policy makers in terms of conserving and developing the traditional knowledge of the Orang Asli communities. Challenges in carrying out the project are also highlighted in this paper...|$|E

40|$|This study explores <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> some <b>medicinal</b> plants {{amongst the}} sub-urban {{community}} of and around a township in the Eastern Cape province. This qualitative interpretivist case study presents the prior <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicinal</b> plants possessed by Grade 9 learners, {{which is used}} as a springboard toward interviewing traditional healers, herbal practitioners and lecturers at a university in the departments of Botany and Pharmacy. The data obtained from the informants reveals the factors that can influence integration <b>of</b> indigenous <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicinal</b> plants in the learning programme for grade 9 General Science. These factors include: prior <b>knowledge</b> and enthusiasm <b>of</b> Grade 9 learners and teachers, support of the community which include parents, traditional healers, herbal practitioners and professionals who could introduce indigenous <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicinal</b> plants into formal education, availability of resource materials and complexity of identifying pharmacologically tested plants from other indigenous medicinal plants. The analysis and discussion of the findings, have led me to conclude that the enthusiasm of learners who have a rich background <b>of</b> indigenous <b>knowledge</b> on <b>medicinal</b> plants is likely to be hampered by the unenthusiastic teachers as well as the reluctance of herbal practitioners in their communities to part with this knowledge. Hence I recommend that teachers be motivated through workshops and in-service training, conducted by goverr paid herbal practitioners using the prior <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> learners as a stepping-stone. ...|$|R
