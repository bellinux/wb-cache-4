40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 159 – 167 Coral reefs of {{the coastal}} area of Abrolhos are located in an {{environment}} with a high influx of terrigenous sediments that are carried out to the sea, either {{as a result of}} natural processes (river output, coastal erosion, and torrents) or due to anthropogenic influences (deforestation, coastal development, and dredging). Excessive terrigenous sediment in coastal areas has been identified as one of the major threats to coral reefs, leading to their worldwide decline. The present study assessed the evolution of sedimentation in the Abrolhos coastal reefs during the past decades by analyzing samples from sediment cores collected near the reefs of Coroa Vermelha (located 15 km from the coast), Pedra de Leste (located 12 km from the coast) and Popa Verde (located 35 km from the coast). The purpose of this assessment was to observe whether the previously described pattern of surficial bottom sediment distribution in Abrolhos, which consisted of <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> in the nearshore reefs, to carbonate-dominant sediments towards the offshore reefs, is still a prevalent feature. Sediment color, texture, CaCO 3 percentage, biogenic compounds and clay minerals, as well as the sedimentation rate and the geochronology of the sediment cores were analyzed. The results showed indications of an increase in the deposition of <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud,</b> over the last decade, {{in the vicinity of the}} reefs nearest to the coast, though this does not yet constitute a definitive evidence of such a change. However, this observation therefore suggests that local processes resulting from anthropogenic actions are most likely causing an increase of the sedimentation rate of continent-derived sediment runoff in the Abrolhos coastal areas. To minimize this situation, there is an urgent need for the development of new management strategies to protect the already disturbed Abrolhos coastal reefs, especially during times of global changes...|$|R

On the Ross Sea Continental Shelf, the core sequences contain two lithologic units, soft diatomaceous mud in the upper and compound glacio-marine sediments in the lower. The lower lithologic unit suggests that highly ice-sheet influenced sedimentation existed in glacial times in the Ross Sea. The core sequences on the continental slope and deep-sea basins off the Ross Sea comprise foraminiferal ooze, siliceous <b>mud,</b> and <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud,</b> sometimes with laminated parts.

40|$|One {{the most}} {{interesting}} features of ocean sedimentation is the manganese formations {{on the surface of}} the ocean floor in some areas. These are especially widespread in the Pacific Ocean as concretions, grains, and crusts on rock fragments and bedrock outcrops. Iron-manganese concretions are the most abundant as they completely cover about 10 % of the bottom of the Pacific Ocean where there are ore concentrations. The concretions occupy from 20 - 50 % of the bottom and up to 80 - 90 % on separate submarine rises. Such concretions are found in different types of bottom deposits, from abyssal red clays to <b>terrigenous</b> <b>muds,</b> but they occur most widely in red clays and quite often in carbonate muds. Their shape and their dimensions are very diverse and change from place to place, from station to station, varying from 0. 5 - 20 cm. They may be oval, globular, reniform, or slaggy and often they are fiat or isometric concretions of an indefinite shape. The concretions generally have nuclei of pumice, basalt fragments, clayey and tuffaceous material, sharks' teeth, whale ossicles, and fossil sponges. Most concretions have concentric layers, combined with dendritic ramifications of iron and manganese oxides...|$|E

Sampling was performed under normal fishing activities in 21 otter trawl hauls and 62 set nets operations. One hundred thirty-two invertebrate species were altogether discarded in medium and small scale fishery over the study area, classified in 16 classes and 7 phyla. Small scale fisheries yielded almost 70 % of the total invertebrate diversity, while otter trawling only 50 %. Molluscs were the most diverse group in both fisheries followed by crustaceans and echinoderms. Multivariate analysis revealed a clear differentiation in discard species composition between the two fisheries reflecting different benthic habitats. According to the species composition of the discards certain benthic biocoenoses were identified. The Coastal <b>terrigenous</b> <b>muds</b> biocoenosis prevailed in medium scale fishing areas, accompanied by the Coastal detritic, Muddy detritic, and Bathyal mud biocoenoses. Several plant-dominated communities (mostly those of Infralittoral photophilus algae, Circalittoral sciaphilus algae, and Posidonia meadows), were recognized through small scale fishery discards. The higher diversity of the latter was attributed to the great variety of habitats and established communities in the relevant fishing grounds. These results show that invertebrate discards could contribute background data for monitoring the complex benthic system...|$|E

Radiocarbon dating and stra-tigraphy of shelf vibrocores and slope gravity cores document late Pleis-toceae/Holocene d position. Shelf sediments of the late Pleistocene high-stand (60 - 26 ky) are rare, either never having been deposited or having been removed uring the following sea-level fall (26 - 17 ky). During the subsequent lowstand the shelf was exposed, facies shifted basinward, and beach/dune complexes were constructed near the shelf edge. The deep shelf was characterized by nondeposition and hardground formation, and the shelf margin became locally erosional.

Variations in tropical plankton frequencies define submillenial warming intervals that culminate in these fluvial episodes. Strengthened tropical currents in the gulf at these times appear to have increased sea surface temperatures and associated flow of moist gulf air to the midwest.

IRD is most abundant in the lower Pliocene (sediments older than 4. 5 Ma) following the first major West Antarctic glaciation. A decrease in IRD to near-zero above 3. 2 Ma may record a transition from valley glaciers to a grounded ice-sheet on West Antarctica. Bottom current flow, recorded in sediments as the proportion of silt, was at a maximum around 3. 0 - 3. 3 Ma then gradually decreased until 0. 5 Ma.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} piston coring device (HPC- 15) allows recovery of deep ocean sediments with minimal disturbance. The device was used during Leg 72 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) aboard the Glomar Challenger. Core samples were recovered from bore {{holes in the}} Rio Grande Rise in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Relatively undisturbed sediment cores were obtained from Holes 515 A, 516, 517, and 518. The results of shipboard physical property measurements and on-shore geotechnical laboratory tests on these cores are presented in this chapter. A limited number of 0. 3 m cores were obtained and used {{in a series of}} geotechnical tests, including one-dimensional consolidation, direct shear, Atterburg limit, particle size analysis, and specific gravity tests. Throughout the testing program, attention was focused on assessment of sample disturbance associated with the HPC- 15 coring device. The HPC- 15 device limits sample disturbance reasonably well in <b>terrigenous</b> <b>muds</b> (clays). However, sample disturbance associated with coring calcareous sediments (nannofossil-foraminifer oozes) is severe. The noncohesive, granular behavior of the calcareous sediments is vulnerable to severe disturbance, because of the design of the sampling head on the device at the time of Leg 72. A number of modifications to the sampling head design are recommended and discussed in this chapter. The modifications will improve sample quality for testing purposes and provide longer unbroken core samples by reducing friction between the sediment column and the sampling tool...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} the facies change {{in response to}} the Holocene transgression within five sediment cores taken in the lagoon of Mayotte, which contain a Type- 1 depositional sequence (lowstand, transgressive and highstand deposits underlain by an erosive sequence boundary). Quantitative compositional analysis and visual examination of the bioclasts were used to document the facies changes. The distribution of the skeletal and non-skeletal grains in the lagoon of Mayotte is clearly controlled by (1) the rate and amplitude of the Holocene sea-level rise, (2) the pre-Holocene basement topography and (3) the growth-potential of the barrier reef during sea-level rise, and the changes in bathymetry and continuity during this period. The sequence boundary consists of the glacial karst surface. The change-over from the glacial lowstand is marked by the occurrence of mangrove deposits. Terrigenous and/or mixed terrigenous-carbonate muds to sandy muds with a mollusc or mollusc-ostracod assemblage dominate the transgressive deposits. Mixed carbonate-siliciclastic or carbonate sand to gravel with a mollusc-foraminifer or mollusc-coral-foraminifer assemblage characterize the early highstand deposits on the inner lagoonal plains. The early highstand deposits in the outer lagoonal plains consist of carbonate muds with a mollusc-foraminifer assemblage.

40|$|Twelve gravity cores {{from various}} {{settings}} within the Mayotte barrier reef–lagoon complex were studied {{to determine the}} sedimentology of the sequence stratigraphic systems tracts that formed during the Holocene transgression. Our studies focussed on the determination of physical, chemical, mineralogical and biological parameters of the sediments from specific systems tracts. These parameters determine the thickness and facies of each systems tracts and are controlled by the rate and amplitude of sea-level rise, lagoonal topography and environmental changes. The lowstand systems tract (LST) (before 11. 5 ka BP) comprises ferralitic or organic-rich paleosoils in the proximal and middle lagoon and karstified Pleistocene reefal carbonates in the distal lagoon. The transgressive systems tract (TST) (11. 5 – 7 ka BP) consists of a lower terrigenous and an upper mixed terrigenous–carbonate or carbonate-dominated unit. Locally, mangrove muds were deposited. The highstand systems tract (HST) {{can be divided into}} an early highstand (eHST) (7 – 1 ka BP) and a late highstand systems tract (lHST) (after 1 ka BP). In the proximal lagoonal wedge, the early highstand systems tract consists of terrigenous or mixed terrigenous–carbonate muds to sandy muds. In the middle lagoon, it shows carbonate mud to sandy mud and carbonate gravel to reefal carbonates in the distal lagoons. <b>Terrigenous</b> <b>muds</b> dominate the late highstand systems tract in the proximal lagoonal wedge. In the mid-lagoonal plain, mixed terrigenous–carbonate or carbonate mud to sandy mud dominates, while carbonate gravel to reefal carbonate prevails in the distal lagoon. For the last 9 ka, sedimentation in the lagoon of Mayotte has been spatially divided into a proximal terrigenous and a distal, carbonate-dominated province. Maximum carbonate concentrations between 4 and 1 ka BP coincide with the time of maximum solar insolation. After 1 ka BP, a general decrease in carbonate concentrations can be observed. This coincides with increased terrigenous sediment input, which results from a reduction in accommodation space and to some extent is of anthropogenic origin...|$|E

Within the study area the principal hydrocarbon reservoir is the Upper Sabil Formation, which is sealed by Harash Formation lime mudstones. Facies ana-lysis and seismic mapping indicate that the Upper Sabil Formation consists of a prograding carbonate shelf with a rimmed platform morphology and palaeo-slopes in excess of 5 c ~ along the eastern and western flanks of the Agedabia Trough.

The {{physical}} properties, compressional-wave velocity, and consolidation characteristics {{indicate that the}} periplatform carbonate sediments maintain more water content and lower compressional velocity near the Queensland Plateau than the clayey hemipelagic sediments, which have a clay content of up to 60 %. Bulk density, void ratio or porosity, water content, and compressional-wave velocity are shown to have a linear relationship with burial depth. Between 3. 5 and 5 Ma (about 100 - 500 mbsf), these physical properties maintained a constant rate vs. the depth in core because of the fast sedimentation-rate effect at Site 815. However, compressionalwave velocity still increases downward in this section. The clay content in this section causes an increase of bulk modulus and compaction effect. At Site 817, scarce <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> content and abundant carbonate content (88 %- 97 %) cause a straight line relationship between physical properties and burial depth. During the consolidation test, we show that dominant micritic particles may cause faster acoustic velocity than sediments composed mainly of coccoliths.

40|$|Modern shelf {{morphology}} is {{the result}} of the interplay between short and long term sedimentary processes. The relation between rates of sediment supply/carbonate growth and accommodation space creation will not only control coastal transgression and regression, but will also define the shelf sedimentary regimes acting to shape the seabed. Herein, shelf morphology and sedimentology are investigated in order to discuss how these characteristics can be representative of distinct sedimentary regimes. The study area is the eastern Brazilian shelf where coastal transgression and regression coexist with the most important coral reef system of the South Atlantic. A compilation of existing published and unpublished data was carried out in order to produce morphological and faciological maps and compare the mapped features with high-resolution seismic and sonographic data. The results show three major regions or morphological compartments: Abrolhos Shelf, Doce River Shelf and the Paleovalleys Shelf. In terms of shelf sedimentary domain, rhodolith beds predominate over the outer shelf along the entire area, coralline reefs are present along the northern Abrolhos inner shelf and a significant <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> deposit is observed associated to the Doce River adjacent inner shelf beds. The rest of the shelf is composed by bioclastic or <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> sand and gravel. Terrigenous sedimentation is always restricted to the shoreface or inner shelf shallower areas and carbonate sands and gravels are predominant elsewhere. The Abrolhos shelf shows two distinct sectors; the northern area is a typical mixed sediment environment that has a supply regime along the coast/shoreface, mainly due to longshore transport and a carbonate regime along the inner and outer shelf. The southern shelf morphology and sedimentation are controlled by the antecedent topography and is typically a accommodation regime shelf with associated rhodolith beds. The Doce river shelf is a supply regime environment with the formation of a 5 to 8 m thick regressive deposit with downlapping clinoforms. Southward from the Doce river shelf, a significant shift in sedimentary regime is observed as the morphology becomes very irregular with associated hardbottoms and unfilled paleovalleys. This sector of the shelf (Paleovalley shelf) is characterized by an accommodation regime. The interpretation shows that the entire study area can be defined as a mixed sedimentation shelf, showing supply and accommodation regimes. Shelf morphology worked as an indicator of these changes. Carbonate/terrigenous deposition during a highstand/regressive phase coeval along the eastern Brazilian shelf, either laterally and across shelf. This lateral/along coast variation in sediment supply and carbonate production leads to distinct lateral facies and geometry. These spatial changes in morphology and facies, with coexistence of carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentation, are very important for the correlation and interpretation of the geological record, especially stratigraphic surfaces and sequence units...|$|R
40|$|Ocean Drilling Program Site 1119 {{is located}} east of South Island, New Zealand, in 394 m water depth {{on the upper}} {{continental}} slope. Though 93 km offshore today, during recent glaciations the site lay near the lowstand shoreline, directly beneath the path of seasonal riverine meltwater plumes. The core comprises an upper portion (0 – 86. 19 metres composite depth (mcd)) deposited as upper slope clinoforms and a lower portion (to 513. 5 mcd) deposited as mid-slope, intermediate water depth sediment drifts, the two intervals being separated across a short c. 25 k. y. long unconformity within Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 8. Almost throughout, the core comprises alternating micaceous muds and silts (glacials) and muddy, sometimes calcareous, sands (interglacials). Because of the enhanced potassium content of the <b>terrigenous</b> <b>muds,</b> the lithologies that characterise the two different climatic states possess markedly different natural gamma radiation signals, high and low, respectively. The natural gamma profile of Site 1119 therefore provides a high quality climatic time series with a 1 – 2 k. y. resolution (as sampled) back to the mid-Pliocene. The cyclic gamma ray pattern provides a proxy measure of ice volume in the Southern Alps, and is therefore an atmospheric record. This record matches closely that of oceanic oxygen isotope curves back to MIS 100 (2. 4 Ma) and less closely beyond to MIS Gi- 11 (3. 91 Ma) {{at the base of}} the core. Marked, high gamma ray intervals at 3. 68 – 3. 63, 3. 38, 3. 12, and 2. 80 – 2. 67 Ma may reflect sharp mid-latitude atmospheric coolings at these times, as supported by marine faunal and isotopic evidence elsewhere in the New Zealand region. Alternatively, they may in part reflect changes in clay provenance consequent upon tectonic uplift in the hinterland. The natural gamma measurements are consistent with an overall decline of 6 °C in average atmospheric temperature over South Island, New Zealand, since 2. 45 Ma. Milankovitch 41 k. y. cyclicity is also prominent in the natural gamma record over this period, and its 60 API unit magnitude implies temperature swings up to 12 °C between glacials and interglacials (G/I). Similarly large G/I temperature changes occur also in nearby sea surface temperatures east of South Island and in atmospheric temperatures in Antarctica (Vostok), suggesting that Pleistocene climate signals were closely synchronised across wide areas of Southern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes. Together with changing tectonic and related palaeogeographic patterns, these temperature changes must have played a significant role in influencing the local time ranges of taxa used in biostratigraphy. Very few, if any, traditional New Zealand Pliocene-Pleistocene index fossils have synchronous ranges across the region, and other methods of correlation (magnetostratigraphy, cyclostratigraphy, tephrochronology, isotope stratigraphy, and numeric dating) have therefore come to be of particular importance. The Site 1119 natural gamma record provides a unique reference template for climate variation in New Zealand mid-latitudes, with which are compared the available correlation markers for both onshore and offshore Pliocene-Pleistocene strata in the New Zealand region...|$|E
40|$|The sediments of the Galician Interior Basin are {{influenced}} by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and by their proximity to the Western Iberia continental landmass, and thus provide an adequate archive to study the peculiarities of the last glacial‐interglacial dynamics and the transition into present day conditions. The aim of this study has been to analyse the sedimentary expression of climatic processes and forcings derived from the relation between the last North Atlantic glacial cycle and the local regional components -including abrupt climate changes and local events- {{since the end of the}} last glacial period in this area. We have attempted to establish the rates and magnitudes of change of this system to understand its climate dynamics, processes and feedbacks, and hence its role on a local to sub‐regional scale from a palaeoclimatic proxies perspective. The inference of these climatic mechanisms encrypted in the deep-sea sedimentary record needs to constrain the spatial and temporal scales of the sedimentary processes involved, in particular the identification of source areas, pathways and transport, storage times and hydrodynamic conditions. In order to achieve these goals we have used a twofold approach; an initial effort to constrain the current sedimentary conditions to their associated local hydrography conditions by means of a mooring, which will be used to later infer the palaeoenvironmental conditions from sediment cores. The location of the mooring and the 5 coring locations has been based on the acquisition of new geophysical data: a precise 20 x 20 m bathymetry covering an area of 9860 km 2 and 690 km of high-resolution seismic profiles distributed in 10 transects that allow to investigate the main sedimentary units in the region. The mooring comprised 2 sediment traps located at 500 and 1400 m below the sea surface. These depths are under the influence of the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) and Mediterranean Water (MW). The sediment traps also target sediments from the shelf and the upper slope. Sediments were collected monthly for a 9 month period, whilst hydrographic conditions such as current speed, salinity, oxygen and turbidity were continuously recorded in associated instruments at the same depths. Finally, a multidisciplinary study combining resolution scans, including geochemistry (ITRAX), physical properties (GEOTEK) and enviromagnetic properties (2 G cryogenic magnetometer), has been constrained using a very robust geochronology framework. Further analyses comprised grain size distributions, S͞S, SEM, XRD, stable and high-precision radioactive isotopes. The area consists mostly of generally autochthonous hemipelagic and <b>terrigenous</b> <b>muds</b> and sandy to silty muds with high clay content, showing abundant bioturbation and early diagenesis. Allochthonous material of different provenances (characterized by 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratios) occurs interbedded within the hemipelagic sediments associated to Heinrich Stadials HS 1 to HS 6. The sediments also show significant changes in the vigour of bottom-currents (based on the S͞S proxy) both within and between the HS. The combination of these sedimentological, geochemical and geophysical data has provided a new insight into the role of current strength, circulation and sediment provenance changes in the area, and allowed to establish across vs. along margin transport balances in the sedimentary record of the Galician Internal basin over the last 60 Ky...|$|E
40|$|The late Mississippian Great Blue Limestone was {{studied at}} four {{locations}} around Cache Valley, Utah. One location was at Dry Lake in the Pisgah Hills {{to the west}} of Cache Valley. Three locations were in the Bear River Range to the east of Cache Valley. From north to south the locations are: 1) Beirdneau Peak, 2) Logan Peak, and 3) the ridge to the north of East Fork Canyon. The Dry Lake location represents the upper, middle, and some of {{the lower part of the}} section. The base of the section is covered. Locations in the Bear River Range represent the lower and middle parts of the Great Blue Limestone. The upper part of the section has been removed by erosion. The sections at the four locations are correlated with one another by the Lithostrotion-Turbophyllum Zone present at all four locations at the top of the lower part. Field work included measuring each section and collecting samples, for insoluble-residue analysis, at regularly spaced intervals at each location. Slab samples representative of the faunal assemblages were collected for laboratory analysis. Orientations of recumbent rugose coralla on exposed bedding planes of the Lithostrotion-Turbophyllum Zone at the four locations were measured for paleocurrent analysis. Laboratory work included: 1) flume experiments, 2) analysis of slabs for faunal composition, preserved orientations, species associations, density, diversity, and species morphology, 3) insoluble-residue analysis, and, 4) X-ray diffraction to determine the characteristic mineralogy. Statistical analysis of the data collected in the field and from slabs included calculations of: 1) index of affinity and generation of faunal association dendograms, 2) mean, mode and angular deviation of the coral orientational data, 3) mean, skewness, and kurtosis of size-frequency distributions of rugose corals and the opportunistic species Rugosochonetes-loganensis and, 4) species equitability-diversity. The Great Blue has been divided into three units on the basis of lithology. The lower Great Blue is a massive, thick-bedded, darkgray, microcrystalline limestone. The Long Trail Shale is a thinbedded, light-brown shale. The upper Great Blue is a massive, thickbedded, dark-gray, microcrystalline limestone. These units correspond to units 2, 3, and 4 of the Brazer Formation. Seven faunal zones were identified in the Great Blue. In the lower Great Blue the Turbophyllum Zone and the Lithostrotion-Turbophyllum Zone are present. The Brachiopod-Pelecypod Zone is present in the Long Trail Shale. In the upper Great Blue the Coral-Cephalopod, Caninia, Rugosochonetes-Orthotetes, Rugosochonetes-Paladin, and Crinoid Bryozoan Zones are present. Orientations of the apical ends of recumbent rugose conals in the Lithostrotion-Turbophyllum Zone of the lower Great Blue were used to reconstruct paleocurrent directions and intensities. Results of the survey indicate a preferred orientation of the apical ends of the rugose coralla in the direction which is now southeast. Results of the flume experiment indicate that rugose coral coralla subjected to unidirectional currents became oriented with the apical end pointed into the current. The modal orientations of the long axis of the coralla exposed on the bedding-plane surfaces suggest the existence of currents, predominantly from the south. The paleocurrent analysis suggests gentle tidal currents, with a stronger ebb component, operating for long periods of time. Micritic lithologies within the Turbophyllum Zone were deposited during a transgression. The zone is populated by high and very-high filter-feeders, but species diversity is low. The faunal and lithologic evidence from the Lithostrotion-Turbophyllum Zone suggest an offshore environment, at or near effective wave base, inhabited by a few species which were low, high, or very-high filter-feeders. The Brachiopod-Pelecypod Zone contains a faunal assemblage associated with terrigenous lithologies suggestive of a nearshore environment that resulted from a regression. Species diversity in this zone is high. The Coral-Cephalopod Zone contains a sparse fauna and includes dark, micritic lithologies interpreted to have been deposited under conditions of almost no current activity, in possibly the deepest water, relative to the other zones. A rapid transgression and poorly oxygenated conditions above the substrate did not allow the development of a coral-crinoid community similar to the Lithostrotion-Turbophyllum Zone. Lithologic and faunal evidence in the Caninia Zone suggest a gradual regression that resulted in a shoaled environment similar to that of the Lithostrotion-Turbophyllum Zone. The zone is habited by low, high, and very-high level filter-feeders. Species diversity is high. The Rugosochonetes-Orthotetes Zone contains a fauna similar to the Brachiopod-Pelecypod Zone, but the fauna is not as abundant or diverse. Terrigenous lithologies and faunal evidence suggest a shallower environment that resulted from a continuation of the regression initiated during deposition of the lithologies within the Coral-Cephalopod and Caninia Zones. The succeeding calcilutites of the Rugosochonetes-Paladin Zone were deposited at a water depth greater than the underlying <b>terrigenous</b> <b>muds</b> of the Rugosochonetes-orthotetes Zone. The zone displays high dominance and low diversity. The biospartic lithology of the Crinoid-Bryozoan Zone represents an environment situated in deeper water than the Rugosochonetes-Paladin Zone. Species diversity is very low and only the very-high filter-feeding niches are occupied. The succession of the communities appears to be controlled by the nature of the substrate and the associated turbidity, current agitation, and sedimentation rate during deposition. The insoluble-residue survey indicates zones of terrigenous influx which influenced the nature of the substrate and permits inferences concerning proximity to the source area. Asymmetrical cycles of rapid transgression and gradual regression over shallow shelf habitats controlled the faunal successions and retrogressions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{glaciation}} on sediment drifts is recognised from marked sedimentary facies variation in deep sea cores {{taken from the}} continental rise of the Antarctic Peninsula Pacific margin. Nineteen sediment cores were visually described, logged for magnetic susceptibility, and X-radiographed. About 1000 analyses were performed for grain size, clay minerals and biostratigraphy (foraminifera, nannofossils and diatoms). Four sediment types associated with distinct sedimentary processes are recognised based on textural/compositional analysis. (1) Hemipelagic mud forms {{the bulk of the}} interglacial sediment, and accumulated from the pelagic settling of bioclasts and ice-rafted/windtransported detritus. (2) <b>Terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> forms the bulk of the glacial sediment, and accumulated from a combination of sedimentary processes including turbidity currents, turbid plumes, and bottom current reworking of nepheloid layers. (3) Silty deposits occurring as laminated layers and lenses, represent the lateral spillout of lowdensity turbidity currents. (4) Lastly, glacial/interglacial gravelly mud layers derive from settling of ice-rafted detritus. Five depositional settings are interpreted within sediment Drift 7, each characterised by the dominance/interaction of one or several depositional processes. The repetitive succession of typical sedimentary facies is inferred to reflect a sequence of four climatic stages (glaciation, glacial, deglaciation, and interglacial), each one characterised by a distinctive clay mineral assemblage and bioclastic content. Variations in clay mineral assemblage within interglacial stage 5 (core SED- 06) suggest minor colder climatic fluctuations, possibly correlatable with substages 5 a to 5 e...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{capture of}} {{large amounts of}} small, {{immature}} fish of commercial species {{is a serious problem}} particularly in multispecies fisheries. Moreover, considerable and increasing interest is being devoted by fishery scientists to identify the distribution and habitat needs of species throughout their life cycle. To elucidate species composition, the abundance of juveniles in the demersal assemblages and the role of different life history (juvenile and adult) stages of target species in structuring demersal communities, two bottom trawl surveys were carried out during the autumn 2003 and 2004. Multivariate analyses were performed on density indices of adults and juveniles life stages of 30 target species and total density indices {{for the remainder of the}} catch species. Juveniles represent more than 61 % of the total catch in both the years investigated and their abundance and spatial distribution was strictly related to the sea bottom biocoenotic features. Most juveniles were concentrated in the coastal shelf area and in particular in the hauls performed on the Coastal <b>Terrigenous</b> <b>Mud</b> biocoenosis (CTM). The demersal assemblages located in the slope stratum showed, in general, a lower concentration of juvenile specimens; however, some facies of the Bathyal Mud biocoenosis that characterizes the deep layer of our study area showed a very high percentage of juveniles. This information improves our understanding of ecosystem functioning and represents a useful basis for providing advice on the management of multispecies demersal fisheries within an ecosystem approach...|$|R
40|$|Hole 515 A was {{drilled in}} the {{southern}} Brazil Basin by the Glomar Challenger on DSDP Leg 72, using the newly developed hydraulic piston corer (HPC). A total of 108 m of undisturbed <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> (T 1) and sandy mud (T 2) was obtained (see site chapter, Site 515, this volume). The core was sampled at levels that corresponded to 50 -kPa increments of overburden pressure {{to determine if a}} pattern of clay fabric development could be discerned. After criticalpoint drying and gold-palladium coating, 15 samples were analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Clay fabric consists of randomly oriented, large and small domains of face-to-face (FF) stacked clay particles, frequently linked together by short "chains" in an edge-to-face (EF) orientation. As overburden pressure increases, linkages decrease, and the "chains" become incorporated into the domains. Distortion of platelike domains into "cornflake" structures (well-crystallized montmorillonite?) and spherical aggregates occurs at overburden pressures of 400 kPa. Orientation parallel with bedding occurs at 500 kPa as the "cornflake" structures become flattened and compressed. Maximum fabric development occurs at 590 kPa. Large plates and coalesced domains form a pervasive linear FF pattern, interrupted by a few large and small EF bridging structures. Deformation of the large EF-oriented plates occurs, forming circular, pitlike voids. Fabric development in cores from this deep-sea site follows well the developmental model suggested by Bennett and others (1981) for Mississippi Delta clays with high to medium void ratios...|$|R

Instantaneous frequencies computed from the transmission seismograms are displayed as gray-shaded images to give an acoustic overview of the lithology of each core. Ccntirneter-scale variations in the ultrasonic waveforms associated with lithological changes are illustrated by wiggle traces in detail. Cross-correlation, multiple-filter, and spectral ratio techniques are applied to derive P wave velocities and attenuation coefficients. S wave velocities and attenuation coefficients, elastic moduli, and permeabilities are calculated by an inversion scheme based on the Biot-Stoll viscoelastic model. Together wilh porosity measurements, P and S wave scatter diagrams are constructed to characterize different sediment types by their velocity- and attenuation-porosity relationships. They demonstrate that terrigenous, calcareous, and diatomaceous sediments cover different velocity- and attenuation-porosity ranges. In terrigcnous sediments, P wave vclocities and attenuation coefficients decrease rapidly with increasing porosity, whereas S wave velocities and shear moduli are very low. Calcareous sediments behave similarly at relatively higher porosities. Foraminifera skeletons in compositions of <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> and calcareous ooze cause a stiffening of the frame accompanied by higher shear moduli, P wave velocities, and attenuation coefficients. In diatomaceous ooze {{the contribution of the}} shear modulus becomes increasingly important and is controlled by the opal content, whereas attenuation is very low. This leads to the opportunity to predict the opal content from nondestructive P wave velocity measurements at centimeter-scale resolution...|$|R
40|$|AI~STIL~CT: Very poorly sorted, non-laminated thin {{layers of}} clayey to silty sand {{designated}} as "a"-division of turbidites occur among thinly laminated, free-grained spill-over deposits {{on the natural}} evees of the relatively steep upper channel segment of the Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel (NAMOC) of the Labrador Sea. These layers are non-graded and the transition to overlying ripple-cross laminated silt or parallel laminated <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> is abrupt {{both in terms of}} grain-size and sorting. The "a"-division is interpreted as a head spill-over deposit from channelized turbidity currents. Turbulence in the current head causes a wide range of available grain sizes to be thrown up high enough so that lateral overflow over the channel banks can carry them to the levees where they are deposited as massive, ungraded sand layers containing ranule to clay-sized material. These head-spill overflows may be supercritical at times. Subcritical body spill from the dilute upper parts of the (same or a later) flow generally deposits thinly laminated (d-division) or homogeneous (e-division) muds which represent the bulk of the spill-over deposits. Locally, body spill deposits include ripple cross-laminated ['me sand and silt (c-division), and rarely a- and b- divisions. The common occurrence of the "a"-division on the upper channel levees (channel slope greater or equal 0. 002) and the scarcity of such layers further downchannel (slope gradient less than 0. 002) supports Komar's (1972) choice of a critical slope gradient of 0. 002 for head spill-over to occur. Although no other modem examples of head spill deposits have been recognized similar, but considerably thicker, deposits are known from ancient levee sequences...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} bottom trawl fishing on the macrobenthic communities inhabiting the coastal <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> off the northern coast of Sicily (Western Mediterranean). Two intensely trawled gulfs were compared with two gulfs from which trawling has been excluded for 15 years. The results show a significant effect of trawling on the faunal assemblage and when comparing the mean biomass and the whole isotopic composition of the benthic communities. A similar pattern, although not significant, was found for total abundance, biomass, production/biomass ratio and diversity. Higher abundance and lower biomass {{were found in the}} untrawled areas, attributable to the presence of more numerous yet smaller individuals, possibly a consequence of more abundant larger predators that are not removed by trawling, and consequent higher predatory pressure on the benthic macrofauna. The SIMPER analysis evidenced a dominance of burrowing deposit feeding worms (Paraonidae and Cossuridae) in trawled areas, as a result of increased mechanical alteration and hence more organic matter available as food. In contrast, the response to trawling as drawn by the use of trophic markers (i. e., stable isotopes) was less clear. While d 15 N of benthic taxa did not vary significantly between untrawled and trawled areas, d 13 C was higher in trawled areas possibly due to high sediment resuspension and consequent intense microbial activity. Mixing models confirmed higher reliance to a detritus-based food web for benthic organisms in the trawled areas. Standard Ellipse Areas (SEAc) as a measure of community niche width were slightly larger in trawled areas, likely due to higher generalism triggered by alteration/ removal of the original benthic community...|$|R
40|$|Low Isles Reef is {{the most}} southerly located of 46 coral reef {{platforms}} unique to the inner shelf of the northern Great Barrier Reef Province, Australia, which support both sea grass and mangrove growth. Such reefs develop {{in areas that are}} influenced by river flood plumes and where interreef sediments are dominated by <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud.</b> Low Isles Reef has long been a popular tourist destination. Informal reports of decreasing visibility, a decline in scleractinian corals, and increases in soft coral and macroalgae have sparked speculation that agricultural activities in coastal catchments are affecting the reef. Comparison of the modern surface of Low Isles Reef with historical surveys and photographs dating back to 1928 allows quantification of modern sedimentary processes, rates of change, and factors influencing reef development. Results indicate that changes on Low Isles Reef are related to remobilization of coarse sediment during storm events and gradual shoreline retreat associated with rising sea level. Retreat of shingle ramparts and elongate ridges of coral debris toward the reef interior has led to the infilling of subtidal ponds on the reef top, which supported hard coral colonies in 1928. The gradual development of a composite shingle rampart along the windward margin has promoted an increase (; 150 %) {{in the area of the}} reef top covered by mangroves. On the leeward margin, a decrease in hard corals since 1950 may reflect a rising contribution of organic debris from the expanding mangrove swamp. Results suggest that recent changes on Low Isles Reef can be explained in the context of natural processes. Further study is needed before the effects of agricultural activities in coastal catchments on reef health can be confirmed...|$|R
40|$|During Leg 177 of the Ocean Drilling Program, an {{expanded}} sequence of Pliocene to Holocene calcareous muds was recovered at Site 1089 on a drift deposit {{in the southern}} Cape Basin (SE South Atlantic). The reconstruction of detrital sources and modes of sediment transport gives insight into the operational modes of regional current systems in response to climate variability over the last 590 kyr, as inferred from sedimentological and mineralogical parameters of the terrigenous sediment fraction. Terrigenous sediments mainly originate from African sources with minor contributions from distant southern sources (South America and Antarctica) and are supplied by circumpolar water masses, North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), and surface currents of the Agulhas Current. Changes in clay mineralogy as tracers of deep and shallow ocean circulation, best displayed by variations in quartz/feldspar ratios and kaolinite/chlorite ratios of clay, reflect both the northward displacement of NADW injection into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and a weakening of Agulhas Current leakage from the Indian Ocean around South Africa to the South Atlantic during glacial stages, sub-stages, and stadials. Modifications of these regional current patterns are consistent with perturbations in global conveyor circulation and climate variability on Milankovitch and sub-Milankovitch time scales. Elevated mass-accumulation rates of terrigenous matter generally document high particle fluxes and focusing effects by bottom-current action throughout the late Quaternary. Current sorting and coarsening of <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud,</b> independently of its source signals, prevails during interglacial periods and is linked to a stronger flow of Antarctic Bottom Water and the invigoration of deep contour currents in response to long-term changes (100 -kyr cyclicity) in Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics, high-amplitude fluctuations in global sea level, and increased bottomwater formation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{virtually}} unfolded {{sedimentary cover}} of the Cordilleras Central and Oriental in the eastern Dominican Republic (eastern Hispaniola, tropical North Atlantic) largely consists of Pliocene to Early Pleistocene mixed siliciclastics and carbonates. These deposits have been grouped into two laterally interfingering mapping units, the Yanigua and Los Haitises formations. The former (mainly siliciclastics) comprises marl, marly limestone, and minor conglomerate, sandstone, lignite, and carbonaceous clay and crops out closest to the basement. The Los Haitises Formation mainly consists of limestone and intercalating beds of marly limestone and marl. Lithological mapping at the 1 : 50, 000 scale and facies analysis of twelve measured sections and of additional fourteen outcrops suggest that these deposits mainly formed on a shallow-water marine platform fringing the precursor reliefs of the Cordillera Oriental and the southeastern end of the Cordillera Central. Only a limited proportion of sediment formed in floodplains and marshes. Marl and marly limestone dominated the inner platform sediments. <b>Terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> decreased away from the emergent basement and carbonate sedimentation dominated the more external platform. Corals, molluscs, echinoids, foraminifers, bryozoans, coralline algae, and Halimeda are the main components with varying amounts of carbonate mud. The platform was generally a low-energy environment with seagrass patches. In the inner platform, corals grew as isolated colonies or as small patch reefs dominated by Porites in marly and bioclastic substrates. Branching corals (Stylophora and Acropora) grew in extensive carpets in more distal areas. At least in the last stage of its development (Early Pleistocene), the platform was rimmed by a reef barrier similar to the Holocene Caribbean barrier reefs, with Acropora gr. palmata, A. cervicornis, Porites, Montastrea, Siderastrea, and Diploria as the main reef builders...|$|R
40|$|Living Africa {{has been}} {{successful}} in advancing our understanding of the post-rift evolution of the western (Orange Basin) and southern margins primarily from seismic profiles. It has also been successful in our understanding of the late Cenozoic evolution of the margin and deep basins through seismic profiles and the sedimentology and geochemistry of recovered sediment cores. The results to date are clearly linked and it remains for the three subprojects to coordinate a meaningful synthesis. The principal scientific advances can be divided into post-drift (mid Cretaceous) hydrocarbon basin modelling (GFZ and AWI) and the late Cenozoic sedimentary record (AWI and UCT). The sedimentary and structural evolution of the post-rift sedimentary basin has been reconstructed for the offshore Orange Basin from the interpretation of approximately 6000 km of 2 D seismic data. A 3 D petroleum systems model implies an active kitchen area generating hydrocarbons in the outer western part of the basin. Gas leakage features mapped in the seismic sections relate to structural and sedimentary development with migration modelled to occur along stratigraphic horizons towards the inner near-shore part of the basin. Further modelling will constrain the pathways, timing and duration of hydrocarbon migration events and a basin-wide quantification of the thermogenic gas flux to the ocean/atmosphere as a function of geologic time. The analysis of high-amplitude seismic reflections, so called bright spots, indicates anoxic conditions between ~ 90 Ma and ~ 80 Ma for the region south of South Africa. These bright spots may correlate to worldwide Oceanic Anoxic Event 3 and represent important hydrocarbon source rocks (black shales). It has become increasingly evident that the southern Africa region and the surrounding Southern Ocean are critical components of the global Earth system and that it is essential to understand the role these areas have had and continue to have in the distribution of heat by the ocean and changes in marine productivity related to continent-ocean interactions. The late Cenozoic geologic history, so sparsely preserved on the continent, has been advanced through the analysis of high-resolution seismic reflection data (AWI) and geochemistry of sediment recovered by coring (UCT). Palaeo current reconstruction of North Atlantic Deep Water and (proto-) Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) reveals changes in the flow paths and flow strengths since the late Eocene. The initial opening of the Drake Passage to deep water flow and establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current had a large impact on the formation of AABW and the onset of upwelling in the southern Benguela region as indicated by the first major phosphogenic episode at 26 - 24 Ma. Seismic reflection data indicate reorganization of deep ocean circulation associated with global climate transitions of the Oligocene, middle Miocene and Pliocene. Integration of litho- bio- and Sr-isotope- stratigraphy reveals several major factors influencing the evolution of the margin: 1) neotectonic uplift in the middle Miocene and Pliocene, 2) sea-level fluctuations related to global glaciation, and 3) upwelling and the supply of <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> and nutrients to the margin as indicated by authigenic minerals such as phosphorite and glauconite. Continental slope records over several glacial to interglacial climatic cycles as well as high-resolution Holocene records from the mudbelt on the western margin indicate that <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> delivered by the Orange River has increased by a factor of 8 as a result of anthropogenic land use changes. Storage of <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> and organic carbon on the shelf during interglacial highstands alternate with resuspension and dispersal of shelf mud during glacial lowstands and thereby vary the flux of nutrients (P and Fe) to the open ocean biological pump.

Low Isles Reef is one of 46 low wooded island-reefs unique to the northern Great Barrier Reef, which are situated in areas that lie in reach of river flood plumes and where inter-reef sediments are dominated by <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud.</b> Radiocarbon ages from surface and subsurface sediment samples indicate that Low Isles Reef began to form at ca 3000 y BP, several thousand years after the Holocene sea-level still-stand, and reached sea-level soon after (within ~ 500 years). Maximum reef productivity, marked {{by the development of}} mature reef flats that contributed sediment to a central lagoon, was restricted to a narrow window of time, between 3000 and 2000 y BP. This interval corresponds to: (i) a fall in relative sea-level, from ~ 1 m above present at ca 5500 y BP to the current datum between 3000 and 2000 y BP; and (ii) a regional climate transition from pluvial (wetter) to the more arid conditions of today. The most recent stage of development (ca 2000 – 0 y BP) is characterized by extremely low rates of carbonate production and a dominance of destructive reef processes, namely storm-driven remobilization of reef-top sediments and transport of broken coral debris from the reef front and margins to the reef top. Results of the present study enhance existing models of reef development for the Great Barrier Reef that are based on regional variations in reef-surface morphology and highlight the role of climate in controlling the timing and regional distribution of carbonate production in this classic mixed carbonate–siliciclastic environment...|$|R
40|$|The Chancellor {{succession}} {{accumulated in}} a deep-water trough bordering a wide, epeiric shelf during Middle and Late Cambrian time. The Chancellor is divisible into seven major lithostratigraphic units, which are correlative with an eastern shelf assemblage comprising eight cabonate and siliciclastic formations. The deep-water carbonate and siliciclastic sediments in the Chancellor are divisible into five basic lithofacies, {{each of which}} has several variants due to a variety of depositional and diagenetic factors. Sediments in the argillite lithofacies were deposited by dilute, muddy and silty turbidity currents and hemipelagic settling. The ribbon calcilutite lithofacies was probably deposited in a similar manner, but owes its final appearance to diagenetic enhancement of rhythmic, primary variations in sediment composition. Both of these lithofacies contain a variety of synsedimentary deformation structures indicative of slope instability. The ribbon calcisiltite lithofacies is composed of interbedded silty carbonate and <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud</b> turbidites. The calcarenite lithofacies is the product of high-concentration turbidity flows. It locally occupies large, channel-like features ("megachannels"), which are inferred to be slide scars incised into the upper slope. Most of the sediments assigned to the conglomerate lithofacies show evidence of matrix strength, and were laid down by debris flows. This lithofacies includes spectacular megaconglomerates containing Epiphyton boundstone blocks up to 50 m in maximum dimension. Periplatform talus blocks of similar size are scattered throughout the Chancellor. During most of Chancellor time, silt- and sand-sized material either bypassed the upper slope or was confined to the shelf. The high proportion of carbonate and siliciclastic turbidites in the Duchesnay and Oke units (middle Chancellor) is a direct reflection of an abrupt, regressive shift in the position of the cratonal shoreline. Spectacular cross-strike exposures have revealed that the Eldon-Pika margin and adjoining upper slope strata (Tokumm and Vermilion sub-units) are traversed by at least three megatruncation surfaces.

40|$|Table Head and Goose Tickle group strata {{in western}} Newfoundland are a deepening-upward, {{carbonate}} to clastic sequence deposited on the convergent, paleosouth-facing, North American continental margin during Middle Ordovician time. Preceding passive margin platform growth was abruptly terminated by widespread, early Middle Ordovician block-faulting and differential uplift (St. George Unconformity) caused by migration of a peripheral bulge across the platform interior. Subsequent sea level rise led to widespread peritidal, then shallow subtidal, carbonate deposition (Table Point Formation) on a tectonically unstable platform {{that formed the}} western flank of the evolving Taconic foreland basin. Synsedimentary faulting and differential subsidence profoundly influenced sedimentation, leading to marked variations in thickness and abrupt lateral and vertical changes in platformal carbonate lithofacies. Episodic seismicity and changes in slope triggered gravitational slides and flows. This platform was in turn tectonically drowned by extensional faulting and differential collapse as it {{became part of the}} outer trench slope of the subduction zone. Thin-bedded, hemipelagic and turbiditic limestone and shale (Table Cove Formation) accumulated on discontinuous, gently-dipping carbonate slopes and basin margins of variable duration and facing direction. Massive, polymictic, carbonate debris flow conglomerate, calciturbidite and shale (Cape Cormorant Formation) were deposited in an isolated basin adjacent to a high relief fault scarp that exhumed several hundred metres of buried, older, passive margin platformal carbonate. Laminated black shale (Black Cove Formation) accumulated in remote, sediment-starved basins, and on the tops of isolated, rapidly foundered, relict platforms. As the (collapsed) platform entered the trench it was buried by siliciclastic flysch (American Tickle Formation and Mainland Sandstone) derived from an advancing accretionary prism. <b>Terrigenous</b> <b>mud,</b> silt and sand, transported mostly by turbidity currents travelling southwest parallel to the trench axis, accumulated in topographic depressions controlled by antecedent structural domains.

40|$|The {{platform}} and fringing reefs of Torres Strait are morphologically similar to reefs {{of the northern}} Great Barrier Reef to the south, except that several are elongated {{in the direction of}} the strong tidal currents between the Coral Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Surface and subsurface investigations and radiocarbon dating on Yam, Warraber and Hammond Islands reveal that the initiation and mode of Holocene reef growth reflect antecedent topography and sea-level history. On the granitic Yam Island, fringing reefs have established in some places over a Pleistocene limestone at about 6 m depth around 7000 years BP. Emergent Holocene microatolls of Porites sp. indicate that the reefs have prograded seawards while sea level has fallen gradually from at least 0. 8 m above present about 5800 years BP. On the Warraber Island reef platform drilling near the centre indicated a Pleistocene limestone foundation at a depth of about 6 m over which reefs established around 6700 years BP. Reef growth lagged behind that on Yam Island. Microatolls on the mature reef flat indicate that the reef reached sea level around 5300 years BP when the sea was around 0. 8 – 1. 0 m above present. On the reef flat on the western side of Hammond Island bedrock was encountered at 7 – 8 m depth, overlain by <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud.</b> A progradational reef sequence of only 1 – 2 m thickness has built seaward over these muds, as sea level has fallen over the past 5800 years. Reef-flat progradation on these reefs is interpreted to have occurred by a series of stepwise buildouts marked by lines of microatolls parallel to the reef crest, marking individual coalescing coral heads. Detrital infill has occurred between these. This pattern of reef progradation is consistent with the radiocarbon dating results from these reefs, and with seismic investigations on the Torres Reefs...|$|R
40|$|A {{principal}} objective at Site 820, {{situated on the}} outer shelf, upper slope of the northeastern Australian continental margin, was to test the relationships between changes in Pleistocene sea level and sedimentary packages produced on a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic continental margin. To this end, we have examined the downcore distribution of grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and calcium-carbonate content throughout Hole 820 A and, in particular, the top 35 meters below the seafloor (mbsf). These data are compared with variations in the oxygen-isotope signal defined for the same hole and are interpreted as indicating sea-level oscillations. The distribution of sand, mud, calcium carbonate of the mud fraction and total sample, and magnetic susceptibility during the last 20, 000 yr defines {{the position of a}} sea-level regression (41, 000 - 18, 000 yr B. P.), a lowstand, early (18, 000 - 9, 400 yr B. P.) and late transgressions (9400 - 900 yr B. P.), and a highstand (4900 yr to the present). The regression is seen first in a high-carbonate content peak. Calcium carbonate constituents mainly comprise skeletal carbonate grains, with abundant planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and lime muds. The lowstand is characterized by a maximum abundance of the sand fraction, which contains dominantly skeletal carbonate grains and a minor abundance of lithoclasts. Sand-sized terrigenous sediments are proposed to have bypassed the continental shelf during a lowstand of sea level. Sedimentation rates throughout the regression and lowstand are low (3. 0 cm/k. y.). The early transgression, marked by highest values in magnetic susceptibility, displays a rapid increase in sedimentation rate that coincided with an increase in <b>terrigenous</b> <b>mud.</b> Highest sedimentation rates of 82. 3 cm/k. y. occurred during the late transgression, with increasing percentages of lime-mud.
