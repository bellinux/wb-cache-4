40|$|In recent years, {{fuel cells}} have been {{explored}} {{for use in}} aircraft. While the weight and size of fuel cells allows only the smallest of aircraft to use fuel cells for their primary engines, fuel cells have showed promise for use as auxiliary power units (APUs), which power aircraft accessories and serve as an electrical backup {{in case of an}} engine failure. Fuel cell MUS are both more efficient and emit fewer pollutants. However, sea-level fuel cells need modifications to be properly used in aircraft applications. At high altitudes, the ambient air has a much lower pressure than at sea level, which makes it much more difficult to get air into the fuel cell to react and produce electricity. Compressors can be used to pressurize the air, but this leads to added weight, volume, and power usage, all of which are undesirable things. Another problem is that fuel cells require hydrogen to create electricity, and ever since the Hindenburg burst into flames, aircraft carrying large quantities of hydrogen have not been in high demand. However, jet fuel is a hydrocarbon, so it is possible to reform it into hydrogen. Since jet fuel is already used to power conventional APUs, it is very convenient to use this to generate the hydrogen for fuel-cell-based APUs. Fuel cells also tend to get large and heavy when used for applications that require a large amount of power. Reducing the size and weight becomes especially beneficial when it comes to fuel cells for aircraft. My goal this summer is to work on several aspects of Aircraft Fuel Cell Power System project. My first goal is to perform checks on a newly built injector rig designed to test different catalysts to determine the best setup for reforming Jet-A fuel into hydrogen. These checks include testing various thermocouples, <b>transmitters,</b> <b>and</b> <b>transducers,</b> as well making sure that the rig was actually built to the design specifications. These checks will help to ensure that the rig will operate properly and give correct results when it is finally ready for testing. Another of my goals is to test new membranes for use in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, in the hope that these membranes can increase the electricity that is produced by he 1 cells. Producing more electricity means that fewer fuel cells are needed, thus reducing the weight and volume of an APU based on fuel cells, making such an APU much more viable...|$|E

This determination has been accomplished by developing a mathematical model of the measuring process carried out by sonic anemometers; a model which includes the non-straight trajectory effect. The problem is solved by small perturbation techniques, based on the relevant small parameter of the problem, the Mach number of the reference flow, M. As part of the solution, a general analytical expression for the deviations of the computed measured speed from the nominal speed has been obtained.

40|$|Air-coupled {{ultrasonic}} capacitance transducers {{operating at}} frequencies {{of up to}} 1 MHz have been employed in a fan-beam configuration for the cross-sectional tomographic imaging of temperature fields and flow fields in air, {{and the location of}} solid objects. Separate <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> receiver <b>transducers</b> were manufactured using thin polymer dielectric membranes and polished metal backplates, and used to acquire through-transmission data. The fan-beam reconstruction was developed in LabVIEW using a re-bin routine combined with a filtered backprojection algorithm and a difference technique to generate the cross-sectional images. The system was first used to reconstruct images showing the locations of solid objects positioned within the scanned region through interpretation of the arrival time of the transmitted ultrasound. The technique was then extended to image the temperature fields produced in air above a small heat source and the flow field produced by a nozzle connected to a regulated compressed air source. Reconstructed temperatures were within 4 % of the measured background air temperature and 9 % of the air temperature measured above the heat source. Reconstructed images of the flow field above a small nozzle were also presented, showing that the horizontal component of the flow velocity could be resolved using this method. 2002 Elsevier Science B.

Our objective was to create custom software that allows the user to control the <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> receiver <b>transducers,</b> thereby allowing greater flexibility. The open system design allows user and developer transparency, and extensibility for additional features to be added. In this design, low-level Radio Frequency (RF) data is captured at a high data rate (40 MHz/s). This low level information, typically not available on a standard machine, can enable the calculation of important acoustic characteristics such as backscatter, attenuation, speed of sound, intensity, and acoustic impedance. These properties, inherent in the RF data, can be processed and analysed on a personal computer to the sonographer's discretion. The software {{can be used to}} construct traditional B-mode, M-Mode images and videos. An application of this has been in the development of custom graphical user interfaces to select key regions of interest and extract ultrasonic properties post examination. This information was typically only possible during interrogation. By exposing users to the low-level processing as well as the high-level output, a greater appreciation and understanding is gained of the processes and physics of ultrasound technology.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of malignant cell transformation {{mediated by the}} oncogenic, chimeric nucleophosmin/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM/ALK) tyrosine kinase remain only partially understood. Here we report that the NPM/ALK-carrying T cell lymphoma (ALK+TCL) cells secrete IL- 10 and TGF-Î² and express FoxP 3, indicating their T regulatory (Treg) cell phenotype. The secreted IL- 10 suppresses proliferation of normal immune, CD 3 /CD 28 -stimulated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and enhances viability of the ALK+TCL cells. The Treg phenotype of the affected cells is strictly dependent on NPM/ALK expression and function as demonstrated by transfection of the kinase into BaF 3 cells and inhibition of its enzymatic activity and expression in ALK+TCL cells. NPM/ALK, in turn, induces the phenotype through activation of its key signal <b>transmitter,</b> signal <b>transducer</b> <b>and</b> activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3).

Project partners are Airbus, Bremen, IngenieurbÃ¼ro Dr. Hillger, Braunschweig, and intelligeNDT, Erlangen, with DLR, Braunschweig, as subcontractor. One task is the development and the construction of a non-contact ultrasonic imaging system (Â„Demonstrator IIIÂ“) for basic researches. This system provides fast scanning with a single-shot data acquisition (without signal averaging). The dynamic range in one shot reaches up to 50 dB. The demonstrator allows the application of different types of air coupled <b>transducers</b> <b>and</b> therefore it allows the comparison of their performances. The modular design of the system provides further developments and adaptations to special inspection tasks. A power transmitter with burst-signals (peak power of 1. 2 kW) and a free programmable transmitter can be used for the excitation of the transducers. The user-friendly software records C-scans and full wave scans and provides C-scan evaluations.

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic {{guided wave}} {{has been widely}} used for the pipe inspection. The {{conventional}} method is to use piezoelectric transducers that should be contacted to the target surface. However, in order to automatically inspect pipes in the manufacturing stage, non-contact inspections are strongly required. In this paper, we propose a new non-contact method for the automation of pipe inspection, which generates the ultrasonic guided wave by laser and receives by air-coupled transducer. Also we have developed a rotational canning system to show the inspection result as a 2 -D image, which makes the operator find out defects easily. Then, in practical applications of guided wave techniques, it is preferred to generate and detect a single or less dispersive mode. So this paper considers the enhancement of mode-selectivity, where a laser beam illuminated through arrayed line slits is used as the <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> the air-coupled <b>transducer</b> is used as the receiver. The line arrayed laser illumination is a wavelength matching technique that can generate only a few modes. The air-coupled transducer detects the leaky wave of the propagated guided wave, and by tuning its detection angle we can detect the selected single mode. This method can generate and receive the guided wave of a specific mode, which makes the interpretation of received signal clearer and resultantly improves the accuracy of inspection. The proposed method {{was applied to the}} stainless pipe specimen with artificial defects and its inspection performance was verified. The experimental results showed that the fundamental axial-longitudinal mode was dominantly generated and received, and the location and the size of pipe defects could be displayed well in the 2 dimensional scanning images in real time...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} progress, experiments, {{and results}} {{for a project}} to develop a pipeline inline inspection tool that uses electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) to detect and grade stress corrosion cracking (SCC). There is a brief introduction that gives background material about EMATs and relevant previous Tuboscope work toward a tool. This work left various choices about the modes <b>and</b> <b>transducers</b> for this project. The experimental section then describes the lab systems, improvements to these systems, and setups and techniques to narrow the choices. Improvements, which involved transducer matching networks, better magnetic biasing, and lower noise electronics, led to improved signal to noise (SNR) levels. The setups permitted <b>transducer</b> characterizations <b>and</b> interaction measurements in plates with man-made cracks, pipeline sections with SCC, and a full pipe with SCC. The latter were done with a moveable and compact EMAT setup, called a lab mouse, which is detailed. Next, the results section justifies the mode <b>and</b> <b>transducer</b> choices. These were for magnetostrictive EMATs {{and the use of}} EMAT launched modes: SH 0 (at 2. 1 MHz-mm) and SV 1 (at 3. 9 MHz-mm). This section then gives details of measurements on these modes. The measurements consisted of signal to noise ratio, insertion loss, magnetic biasing sensitivities crack reflection and transmission coefficients, beam width, standoff and tilt sensitivities. For most of the measurements the section presents analysis curves, such as reflection coefficient versus crack depth. Some notable results for the chosen modes are: that acceptable SNRs were generated in a pipe with magnetostrictive EMATs, that optimum bias for magnetostrictive <b>transmitters</b> <b>and</b> receivers is magnetic saturation, that crack reflection and transmission coefficients from crack interactions agree with 2 D simulations and seem workable for crack grading, and that the mouse has good waveform quality and so is ready for exhaustive measurement EMAT scans of SCC interactions.

40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} {{of plant}} and animal cells serves as a <b>transmitter,</b> <b>transducer,</b> <b>and</b> effector of cell signaling mechanisms. In plants, pathways for proliferation, differentiation, intracellular vesicular transport, cell-wall biosynthesis, symbiosis, secretion, and membrane recycling depend on the organization and dynamic properties of actin- and tubulin-based structures that are either associated with the plasma membrane or traverse the cytoplasm. Recently, a new in vivo cytoskeletal assay (cell optical displacement assay) was introduced to measure the tension within subdomains (cortical, transvacuolar, and perinuclear) of the actin network in living plant cells. Cell optical displacement assay measurements within soybean (Glycine max [L. ]) root cells previously demonstrated that lipophilic signals, e. g. linoleic acid and arachidonic acid or changes in cytoplasmic pH gradients, could induce significant reductions in the tension within the actin network of transvacuolar strands. In contrast, enhancement of cytoplasmic free Ca 2 + resulted in an increase in tension. In the present communication we have used these measurements to show that a similar antipodal pattern of activity exists for auxins and cytokinins (in their ability to modify the tension within the actin network of plant cells). It is suggested that these growth substances exert their effect on the cytoskeleton through the activation of signaling cascades, which result in the production of lipophilic and ionic second messengers, both of which have been demonstrated to directly effect the tension within the actin network of soybean root cells...|$|R
