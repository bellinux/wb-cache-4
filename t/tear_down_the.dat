5|$|After {{losing their}} first five games, Maryland beat South Carolina on Homecoming weekend, 21â€“15, which {{prompted}} Maryland fans to <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> goalposts in celebration. In the 25-mile per hour winds, the Terrapins capitalized on the Gamecocks' poor punting game, which included one blocked punt.|$|E
5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Berlin Wall, {{there are}} some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented {{that there is little}} {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision to <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, CSX Transportation, the then-owner of {{the northernmost}} section, from 30th to 34th Streets, agreed in {{principle}} to donate the section to the city, while the Related Companies, which owns the development rights to the West Side Rail Yards, agreed not to <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> spur that crosses 10th Avenue.

5|$|A {{touchdown}} pass reception by end Dale Van Sickel {{of more than}} 30 yards provided another score in the third period, followed by Brumbaugh's extra point kick. To close the third quarter, fullback Rainey Cawthon made a 40-yard broken field run. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Crabtree passed to Brumbaugh for another score, but Brumbaugh's extra point attempt was blocked by the Bulldogs. In {{the middle of the}} fourth quarter, Gator fans rushed the field to <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> goal posts, and fist fights broke out between Georgia and Florida fans.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the cast}} and writers of TGS are {{preparing}} their annual Ludachristmas party in the writer's room. Tracy is annoyed because {{he is unable to}} attend due to a recent order from a courtroom judge which requires him to wear an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is also annoyed because he believes that none of the staff know what the true meaning of Christmas is. He cancels Ludachristmas and makes the staff sit through a talk, led by himself and Reverend Gary (John F Mooney), about the meaning of Christmas. This inspires {{the cast and}} writers to run outside of 30 Rock and <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> big Christmas tree which is outside the building. Kenneth eventually stops their efforts and Tracy reveals that he has been drinking alcohol when he should not have been.|$|E

25|$|The City of Miami {{embarked}} {{on a plan to}} extensively renovate the stadium. However, those plans fell by the wayside as Miami focused on keeping the Florida Marlins in town, forcing the Hurricanes to threaten a move to Dolphin Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) in suburban Miami Gardens if a plan to renovate the stadium were not in place within 45days. Some feared that Miami would permit the college to leave, only to <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Orange Bowl and replace it with the new stadium for the Marlins.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Opry, Ryman Auditorium sat mostly vacant and decaying for twenty years. An initial effort by National Life & Accident to <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Ryman and use its bricks to build a chapel at Opryland USA was met with resounding resistance from the public, including the influential musicians of the time. The plans were abandoned, and the building remained standing with an uncertain future.
