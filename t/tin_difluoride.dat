50|$|Sodium {{fluoride}}, <b>tin</b> <b>difluoride,</b> and, most commonly, sodium monofluorophosphate, {{are used}} in toothpaste. In 1955, the first fluoride toothpaste {{was introduced in the}} United States. Now, almost all toothpaste in developed countries is fluoridated. For example, 95% of European toothpaste contains fluoride. Gels and foams are often advised for special patient groups, particularly those undergoing radiation therapy to the head (cancer patients). The patient receives a four-minute application of a high amount of fluoride. Varnishes, which can be more quickly applied, exist and perform a similar function. Fluoride is also contained in prescription and non-prescription mouthwashes and is a trace component of foods manufactured using fluoridated water supplies.|$|E
