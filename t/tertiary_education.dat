40|$|Vocational {{training}} {{versus a}} traditional university education. This chapter seeks {{to answer the}} question of whether ‘tertiary technical education’ has contributed to increasing economic and social opportunity for young people in Latin America, using three case studies from Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. It examines the extent to which <b>tertiary</b> technical <b>education</b> has contributed towards democratising access to education through institutional diversification, expanded enrolment and, at least theoretically, improved access to quality employment. The analysis shows that <b>tertiary</b> technical <b>education</b> has contributed to widening of opportunities by offering an alternative form of education to new generations of young people. <b>Tertiary</b> technical <b>education</b> is more accessible, shorter in duration, has a vocational orientation, and tends to be cheaper than a university education. However, the case studies also reveal that while a <b>tertiary</b> technical <b>education</b> diploma is an asset for young people seeking employment, it nonetheless does not have the same perceived value as a traditional university education. Available data appear to indicate that graduates of <b>tertiary</b> technical <b>education</b> earn less on average than university graduates and face several challenges in the labour market. Furthermore, the studies reveal that despite the presence of highly regarded <b>tertiary</b> technical <b>education</b> institutions in all three countries, these carry less prestige and status than universities...|$|R
