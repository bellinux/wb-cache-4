40|$|Piezoelectric bimorph laminar {{actuator}} of <b>tapered</b> <b>width</b> exhibits {{better performance}} for out-of-plane deflection {{compared to the}} rectangular surface area, while consuming equal surface area. This paper contains electromechanical analysis and modeling of a <b>tapered</b> <b>width</b> piezoelectric bimorph laminar actuator at high electric field in static state. The analysis {{is based on the}} second order constitutive equations of piezoelectric material, assuming small strain and large electric field to capture its behavior at high electric field. Analytical expressions are developed for block force, output strain energy, output energy density, input electrical energy, capacitance and energy efficiency at high electric field. The analytical expressions show that for fixed length, thickness, and surface area of the actuator, how the block force and output strain energy gets improved in a tapered surface actuator compared to a rectangular surface. Constant thickness, constant length and constant surface area of the actuator ensure constant mass, and constant electrical capacitance. We consider high electric field in both series and parallel electrical connection for the analysis. Part of the analytical results is validated with the experimental results, which are reported in earlier literature...|$|E
40|$|A rigid multibody {{method for}} free {{vibration}} analysis of beams with variable axial parameters Aleksandar Nikolic ́ and Slaviša Šalinić This paper presents {{a new approach}} to the problem of determining the frequencies and mode shapes of Euler–Bernoulli tapered cantilever beams with a tip mass and a spring at the free end. The approach is based on the replacement of the flexible beam by a rigid multibody system. Beams with constant thickness and exponentially and linearly <b>tapered</b> <b>width,</b> as well as double-tapered cantilever beams are considered. The influence of the tip mass, stiffness of the spring, and taper on the frequencies of the free transverse vibrations of tapered cantilever beams are examined. Numerical examples with results confirming the convergence and accuracy of the approach are given...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrity}} {{and safety of}} beam-like structures are dependent in part on their boundary conditions which can vary with time due to damage or aging. Structural health monitoring of such structures should therefore include attention to boundary conditions. Where the boundary conditions can be represented by a lumped spring then the identification of associated stiffness parameter values may be a means to quantifying {{the integrity of the}} support. This paper investigates such a method for identifying the equivalent translational and rotational stiffness of a constrained tapered beam-like structure. An analytical model of a beam of <b>tapered</b> <b>width</b> and thickness is adopted as a simplified representation of a tower-like structure. The model is used to explore in what scenarios natural frequencies and/or nodal points might be sufficiently sensitive to changes in support conditions to be measurable indicators of damage. The method is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations for a numerical example where the severity of noise can be controlled...|$|E

Because cone outer {{segments}} (COS) are {{now known}} to be continually renewed, I reexamined COS morphogenesis in retinas of Xenopus tadpoles (prepared by standard histologic techniques and viewed by light and electron microscopy) to clarify how COS incorporate new membrane. I observed that developing COS underwent an unexpected shape change: they were always conical, but their <b>taper</b> (<b>width</b> divided by length) continually decreased.

40|$|Autoregressive {{prediction}} {{is adapted to}} double the resolution of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Extended Fine Structure (ARPEFS) Fourier transforms. Even with the optimal taper (weighting function), the commonly used taper-and-transform Fourier method has limited resolution: it assumes the signal is zero {{beyond the limits of}} the measurement. By seeking the Fourier spectrum of an infinite extent oscillation consistent with the measurements but otherwise having maximum entropy, the errors caused by finite data range can be reduced. Our procedure developed to implement this concept applies autoregressive prediction to extrapolate the signal to an extent controlled by a <b>taper</b> <b>width.</b> Difficulties encountered when processing actual ARPEFS data are discussed. A key feature of this approach is the ability to convert improved measurements (signal-to-noise or point density) into improved Fourier resolution...|$|R

40|$|A novel design {{technique}} for low-loss waveguide crossing using the self-imaging properties of multimode interference (MMI) structures is presented. The technique exploits {{the observation that}} optical fields with a small lie width relative {{to that of the}} MMI structure in the image reformed region experience negligible propagation loss {{even in the absence of}} lateral guiding mechanism around the region. This allows the introduction of a slab in the MMI region. The technique could also be used to design planar light-wave circuits with small wavelength-dependent loss which is important for DWDM devices. Using two-dimensional wide-angle BPM simulations, <b>taper</b> <b>width</b> technology and MMI structure technology is compared for low-loss slab propagation in orthogonal intersection. We also demonstrate that low-loss crossing waveguides with intersection angle as small as 23 ° can be achieved with the aid of MMI structures.

The dispersion property is analyzed by simulation {{in regards to}} frequency comb generation. The <b>taper</b> <b>width</b> is optimized for maximum coupling. Measurement setup is built up and described. For the SMW ring resonator, the intrinsic quality factor is fitted to be 6, 800 and 16, 000 near 5. 2 μm and 4. 5 μm, respectively. For the MMW ring resonator, it rises to 35, 000 near 4. 5 μm. Transmission spectrum distortion is observed at high input power, and is modeled as heat effect. Thermal tuning rate is experimentally confirmed at 0. 21 nm/°C. Based on the measured distortion and heat simulation, absorption loss is estimated. All-optical modulation is conducted to estimate the response time of this process. It can be shown that main loss is from surface thus is reducible by improving surface quality.

The completion of each DI increased COS length by one lamella but caused no noticeable change in local COS width; thus the formation of many DI throughout the distal COS presumably resulted in the observed decrease in overall COS taper. Based on these findings, I suggest that DI indicate growing membrane fronts and may represent sites where newly synthesized membrane is incorporated into COS. Because DI occur in developing and adult COS of various vertebrate species, I propose that DI formation {{plays an important role in}} the generation of COS taper during development and the remodeling of COS taper in mature cones after tip shedding...|$|R
