5|$|Richardson {{asked if}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> {{something}} like Steven Sykes's dummy railhead which {{had worked so}} well at Misheifa. Barkas answered {{that he intended to}} build a dummy water pipeline to go down south, and to be obviously not ready.|$|E
5|$|Each team's squad {{consisted}} of 18 players (two of whom must be goalkeepers). Teams also had two additional reserve players <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> as replacements {{in the event}} of serious injury, at any time. During a match, all remaining squad members not named in the starting team are available {{to be one of the}} three permitted substitutions (provided the player is not serving a suspension).|$|E
5|$|For a {{few weeks}} in 1972, he and his parents and sister lived at Lemmons, the north London home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard. Cecil Day-Lewis had cancer and Howard invited the family to Lemmons as a place <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> to rest and recuperate. Cecil died there in May that year.|$|E

5|$|Since lahars were {{produced}} repeatedly, scientists realized that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> these to analyze a trial period for a newly developed device proposed {{to measure the}} movement of rocks against each other. This device, now known as an Acoustic Flow Monitor, alerts nearby stations to possible lahars.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of riders, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. The riders in the first category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> a bicycle with lower gears. The riders in the machines poinçonnées category {{had to use the}} same bicycle in the entire race, and to verify this, their bicycles were marked.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of season two's nineteenth episode, the writers had decided Helen's fate. Originally, the {{character}} {{was going to die}} on her wedding night, but the creative team felt <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> her more in the mythology. Gough explains the idea Helen still had Clark's blood, she knew his secret, and her relationship with Lex was too good to write off. The creative team kept Helen's true motivations a secret to Vaugier, which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character as if there were no ulterior motives.|$|E

50|$|Class 65 {{locomotives}} {{proved to}} be exceptionally reliable engines, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be <b>used</b> universally, because their coal bunkers and water tanks were small. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only be <b>used</b> for short-range goods traffic.|$|R

5|$|On 16 October, Kennedy was {{informed}} that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, {{could come up with}} no way of doing this that would not appear weak. On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May, some {{residents}} of Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood informed rebel leaders that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> a sewer tunnel that {{ran from the}} Dung Gate to a mill in the Jewish Quarter, to clandestinely enter Jerusalem. The next day, 36 rebels (peasants and Jerusalemites) {{under the leadership of}} Sheikh Subh Shawkah, chief of the Bethlehem-area Fawaghirah tribe, entered the city via the tunnel and then opened the Dung Gate to allow thousands of rebels inside the walled city. The Egyptian commander of the city, Rashad Bey, subsequently withdrew his garrison into Jerusalem's citadel to take up positions against the incoming rebels.|$|E
5|$|As in 1905, the cyclists {{were divided}} in two categories, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur {{machines}} poinçonnées, where the riders {{in the first}} category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> a bicycle with lower gears. In 1905, sponsors {{had not been so}} enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned that it had a commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poinçonnées category, because the average French citizen could identify more with them. In 1906, {{more than half of the}} cyclists started in the poinçonnées category, including Lucien Petit-Breton, one of the pre-favourites.|$|E

5000|$|Leaning Tower of Things - Both {{teams were}} given an {{identical}} assortment of objects, and had 60 seconds to build as tall a freestanding structure as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>using</b> those objects. The structures still had to remain standing on their own for three seconds after the time buzzer sounded; {{the team with the}} tallest structure won the event.|$|R
25|$|Korean placenames and {{official}} titles were changed to Chinese (with Sino-Korean pronunciation), so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> in Literary Chinese.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced {{to take the place}} of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of Monopoly. The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, {{there was a significant}} chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of lithium-ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, {{so it would be}} a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E

5|$|In February 1920, a Notice to Airmen {{was issued}} advising pilots {{that had made}} {{emergency}} landings at Penshurst that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> the War Office telephone to inform the police of their arrival and to obtain conveyances for their passengers {{to take them to}} Penshurst station. On 5 June 1920, the first air mail flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired Airco DH.9 with 300 letters on board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not to land at Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced to land at Penshurst due to a combination of the weather and running low on fuel. A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the letters on to London. A linen windsock was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921. On 24 September 1921, a de Havilland DH.18 aircraft diverted to Penshurst as Croydon was fogbound.|$|E
5|$|The Army of the Danube {{advanced}} on Pfullendorf and Ostrach, {{the former}} an imperial city in Upper (southern) Swabia, {{and the latter}} a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance. Jourdan's objective was simple and direct: cut the Austrian line at {{the border of the}} southwestern German states and Switzerland, preventing the Coalition's use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe. Isolation of the two theaters would prevent the Austrians from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> these routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Ostrach, {{also called}} the Battle by Ostrach, {{occurred}} 20–23March 1799. In early March, the Army of the Danube pressed forward toward Pfullendorf and Ostrach, the former an imperial city in Upper Swabia and the latter a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem. Their goal was to cut the Austrian line at Switzerland, preventing the Coalition use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe. This would ostensibly isolate the armies of the Coalition in northern Italy and Germany, and prevent them from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E

5|$|The Quarrymen {{played a}} series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 shillings each, {{starting}} on 29 August to October 1959, featuring Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Brown, but without a drummer, and only one microphone connected to the club's small PA system. The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air-conditioning, and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. After {{the success of the}} first night, Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency, and paid the whole group £3 a night. Every Saturday thereafter, queues lengthened onto the street, which was financially good for Mona, as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee. As there was no amplification, Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before The Quarrymen, but this was only so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> his 40-Watt amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The Southern removed {{everything}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> elsewhere, and by 8 November, {{had lifted}} the track from Lynton to milepost 15⅓ - on the Barnstaple side of Woody Bay station. On 13 November an auction was held, although the railway failed to attract much interest. Most rolling stock, and every loco except for Lew, was scrapped at Pilton. Some coaches were sectioned {{for use as}} garden sheds. Third class seats became garden furniture, and first class seats {{found their way into}} local snooker halls and Masonic lodges. In December, Plymouth ship breaker Sidney Castle won the tender to dismantle the railway. The remaining track was lifted by June 1936, and in September, surviving loco Lew was shipped to Brazil. The stations and track bed were auctioned in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The ice-skating {{scenes were}} filmed at Wollman Rink in Central Park, {{requiring}} the rink to {{close to the}} public for three consecutive days. Some scenes with the leads were also shot at Cafe Lalo, the same restaurant where When Harry Met Sally (1989) was shot. The film was also shot at the Rockfeller Center. The producers had earlier scouted for a public bridge in India that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> for four days, but due to the 2008 Mumbai attacks obtaining permission from a local government was difficult. The search ended in Kuala Lumpur, where a scene of Kiara and Akash attempting suicide was shot. The opening suicide attempt sequence was filmed at the Golden Gate Bridge. Several scenes were shot in Nevada, Las Vegas. Additional filming was done in Malaysia and Thailand.|$|E
