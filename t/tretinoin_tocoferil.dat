30|$|Lesions notwithstanding, the patient’s CA 19 - 9 {{level was}} reduced by almost {{half in the}} first month after {{starting}} S- 1 chemotherapy (120  mg/day). Therefore, S- 1 chemotherapy was continued at a reduced dose of 100  mg/day after discussions with the patient and a dermatologist. The eruptions were treated with topical ointment and lotion (betamethasone butyrate propionate, maxacalcitol, <b>tretinoin</b> <b>tocoferil,</b> and dexamethasone valerate) (Fig.  2). The eruptions were aggravated by the administration of S- 1 and improved within 2  weeks after the discontinuation of S- 1. The pigmentation associated with the eruption gradually spread during periods of S- 1 administration. We continued S- 1 chemotherapy for 41  months after having adjusted the dose and dosage interval (Fig.  2). The subjective and objective symptoms improved when the rest interval was changed to 2  weeks followed by 3  weeks of treatment and the dose was reduced to 80  mg/day.|$|E
