500|$|Orbital {{inclination}} has a 100 ka periodicity, while eccentricity's 95 and 125ka periods could inter-react {{to give a}} 108ka effect. While it {{is possible}} that the less significant, and originally overlooked, inclination variability has a deep effect on climate, the eccentricity only modifies insolation by a small amount: 1–2% of the shift caused by the 21,000-year precession and 41,000-year obliquity cycles. [...] Such a big impact from inclination would therefore be disproportionate in comparison to other cycles. One possible mechanism suggested to account for this was the passage of Earth through regions of cosmic dust. Our eccentric orbit would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> dusty clouds in space, which would act to occlude some of the incoming radiation, shadowing the Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Mario Tarradell from The Dallas Morning News gave a {{positive}} review for her performance in Dallas writing: [...] "The Material Girl {{then proceeded to}} <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> a song cycle that examined sex, liberation, sin, empowerment, love, addiction, rebellion and finally redemption, and she did it all in classic Madonna style– controversial and eye-popping." [...] Mark Kemp from Creative Loafing gave {{a positive}} review for her performance in Atlanta writing: [...] "Madonna has continued to grow, {{not just as a}} musical performer but as a musical stage actor, deconstructionist and reconstructionist. Her MDNA Tour is not a concert— it's a theater event, complete with concepts and routines that range from well-thought-out to somewhat abstruse. The singer is as committed as ever to making statements and being provocative— that's her stock-in-trade, after all— and her non-hit material is every bit as adventurous and challenging as any of her hits. More so, in many cases." ...|$|E

[...] "It would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> {{a section}} of the country we haven't as yet seen, and we might have lots of sport, fishing, and swimming, and maybe hunting. How many will the houseboat accommodate?" [...] he added.|$|E

"We sha'n't be long going down," [...] Harry said, [...] "I reckon {{the stream}} is running ten miles an hour, {{and as we}} shall be paddling, it will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> in ten minutes. We had all better sit farther aft, so as to take her bow right out of water. She will go through it ever so much easier so." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{time had}} been when the Marches {{would have taken a}} purely {{aesthetic}} view of the facts as they glimpsed them in this street of tenement-houses; when they would have contented themselves with saying that it was as picturesque as a street in Naples or Florence, and with wondering why nobody came to paint it; they would have thought they were sufficiently serious about it in blaming the artists for their failure to appreciate it, and going abroad for the picturesque when they had it here under their noses. It was to the nose that the street made one of its strongest appeals, and Mrs. March pulled up her window of the coupe. [...] "Why does he <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> such a disgusting street?" [...] she demanded, with an exasperation of which her husband divined the origin.|$|E
50|$|The novel <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> Eva Luna's journey though life {{so far and}} {{her ability}} to tell stories, {{interweaving}} Eva's personal story with the broader geopolitical turmoil of Latin America during the 1950s - 1980s.|$|R

6000|$|... "There, Miss Rose," [...] he said, with a didactic sort of air, {{pointing}} {{with his}} short, thick {{finger at the}} little bay which was just opening to their view; [...] "there's as neat a cove as a craft need bring up in. That {{used to be a}} capital place to lie in, to wait for a wind to pass the Gate; but it has got to be most too public for my taste. I'm rural, I tell Mulford, and love to get in out-of-the-way berths with my brig, where she can see salt-meadows, and smell the clover. You never catch me down in any of the crowded slips, around the markets, or anywhere {{in that part of the}} town, for I do love country air. That's Hallet's Cove, Miss Rose, and a pretty anchorage it would be for us, if the wind and tide didn't sarve to <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> the Gate." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{landed on}} a low and thinly wooded point, and while my companions were {{pitching}} the tent, I ran {{up to the house}} to get some sugar, our six pounds being gone. It was no wonder they were, for Polis had a sweet tooth. He would first fill his dipper nearly a third full of sugar, and then add the coffee to it. Here was a clearing extending back from the lake to a hilltop, with some dark-colored log buildings and a storehouse in it, and half a dozen men {{standing in front of the}} principal hut, greedy for news. Among them was the man who tended the dam on the Allegash and tossed the bullet. He, having charge of the dams, and learning that we were going to Webster Stream the next day, told me that some of their men, who were haying at Telos Lake, had shut the dam at the canal there in order to catch trout, and if we wanted more water to <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> the canal we might raise the gate.|$|E
60|$|There were {{portraits of}} Queen Louisa, very beautiful; of Queen Victoria, a present; {{one of the}} Empress of Russia; also a statue of the latter. The ball room {{contained}} a statue of Victory, by Ranch, a beautiful female figure, the model of which, we were told, is his own daughter. He had the grace to allow her some clothing, which was fatherly, for an artist. The palace rooms were very magnificent. The walls were covered with a damask of silk and gold, into which was inwrought the Prussian eagle. In the crowning room was an immense quantity of plate, in solid gold and silver. The guide seemed not a little proud of our king, princes, and palace. Men will attach themselves to power and splendor as naturally as moss will grow on a rock. There is, perhaps, a foundation for this in human nature-- witness the Israelites of old, who could not rest till they obtained a king. The Guide told us there were nine hundred rooms in the palace, but that he should only <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> the best. We were duly sensible of the mercy.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for Last Days has been positive, {{and the work}} has received praise from HorrorNews.net and The Guardian. Tor.com and Bloody Disgusting both gave favorable reviews, and Tor.com wrote that [...] "At its most powerful, Last Days is unputdownable: a non-stop docu-horror novel — ditto, a novel docu-horror — with a portentous premise, a pair of deftly-drawn characters to <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> its ill-lit outbuildings and at last into the eerie light, and staged along the way a series of solid scares, stitched together with good humour and a smart sense of self-awareness." ...|$|E

5000|$|As author Ted Sennett described, stars Caesar, Coca, Carl Reiner, and Howard Morris ...appeared in {{a series}} of superbly written {{sketches}} that poked fun at human foibles and pretensions. Alone onstage, Caesar would depict a befuddled Everyman trying to cope with life, or a blustering Germanic 'professor' being interviewed at an airport and vainly trying to conceal his abysmal stupidity. Alone onstage (or with a partner), Imogene Coca would make us laugh at a passion-ridden torch singer, or a daffy ballerina, or a sweet, wistful tramp. Together, Caesar and Coca would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>through</b> the hilarious marital tribulations of Doris and Charlie Hickenlooper, or show us two strangers exchanging cliches when they meet for the first time.|$|E
