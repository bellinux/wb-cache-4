5|$|During his studies, Wheeler had {{developed}} {{his love of}} archaeology, having joined an excavation of Viroconium Cornoviorum, a Romano-British settlement in Wroxeter, in 1913. Considering a profession in the discipline, he won a studentship that had been established jointly by the University of London and the Society of Antiquaries in memory of Augustus Wollaston Franks. The prominent archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans doubled <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> went with the studentship. Wheeler's proposed project had been to analyse Romano-Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded {{a trip to the}} Rhineland in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums; his research into this subject was never published.|$|E

25|$|Kmart's {{profitability}} {{and sales}} peaked in 1992, and have since declined due to competition with Walmart, Target, and internet shopping. In 1994, Kmart closed 110 stores. Unlike its competitors Walmart and Target, Kmart failed {{to invest in}} computer technology to manage its supply chain. Furthermore, Kmart maintained a high dividend, which reduced <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was available for improving its stores. Many business analysts also faulted the company for failing to create a coherent brand image.|$|E
50|$|Discount {{policy is}} policy {{taken by the}} central bank to {{increase}} and decrease the money circulation by raising or lowering bank rates. If the Central Bank raised bank rates, its aim to reduce <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> With <b>the</b> high rates, {{people are expected to}} save their money in bank. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> will be reduced. Policy to raise bank rates is used to press inflation. Meanwhile, if the central bank lowers bank rates, its aim to increase <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> With <b>the</b> low rates, people are expected to save their money in bank. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> circulating in <b>the</b> society will increase.

25|$|Boniface II {{attempted}} to re-entrench {{the practice of}} appointing his successor, but the public outcry was too great, resulting in a highly disputed election in 532 characterized by widespread accounts of bribery and coercion, which resulted in Pope John II (the first to take a papal name). Athalaric, the Ostrogoth king, forced John II to approve decrees that banned any private agreements to elect a pope and enacting limits on <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> could be spent during a papal election (an early example of campaign finance reform). In fact, Athalaric himself was able to engineer the election of Pope Silverius, the son of Pope Hormisdas, upon John II's death.|$|E
25|$|Ministers {{increased}} <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> {{parties and}} candidates {{were allowed to}} spend on the election by 23%, a move decided against Electoral Commission advice. The election saw the first cap on spending by parties in individual constituencies during the 100 days before Parliament's dissolution on 30 March: £30,700, plus a per-voter allowance of 9p in county constituencies and 6p in borough seats. An additional voter allowance of more than £8,700 is available after the dissolution of Parliament. UK political parties spent £31.1m in the 2010 general election, of which the Conservative Party spent 53%, the Labour Party spent 25% and the Liberal Democrats 15%.|$|E
25|$|Membership {{is crucial}} to co-operatives and more than 8 million people are members of co-operatives in the UK which use 'The Co-operative Brand'. Members of co-operatives get to be democratically {{involved}} in {{the running of the}} society, often with votes on key business decisions and for the election of board members. It is also common for members to be provided with a share of the society's annual profits which is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> an individual has spent with the society over the year. This share of the profit is commonly referred to as co-op's dividend. The size of the dividend varies depending on the financial performance of the group.|$|E

25|$|CSL, {{one of the}} world's {{top five}} biotech companies, and Sigma Pharmaceuticals have their {{headquarters}} in Melbourne. The two are the largest listed Australian pharmaceutical companies. Melbourne has an important ICT industry that employs over 60,000 people (one third of Australia's ICT workforce), with a turnover of AU$19.8 billion and export revenues of AU615 million. In addition, tourism also {{plays an important role}} in Melbourne's economy, with about 7.6 million domestic visitors and 1.88 million international visitors in 2004. In 2008, Melbourne overtook Sydney with <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> domestic tourists spent in the city, accounting for around AU$15.8 billion annually. Melbourne has been attracting an increasing share of domestic and international conference markets. Construction began in February 2006 of a AU$1 billion 5000-seat international convention centre, Hilton Hotel and commercial precinct adjacent to the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre to link development along the Yarra River with the Southbank precinct and multibillion-dollar Docklands redevelopment.|$|E
25|$|Some pros {{always had}} {{problems}} with how the ABA decided its number one pros for the year {{going back to the}} 1979 season. The biggest complaint that it was canted to have the points work out so that the number one pro would almost certainly be decided going into the ABA's Grand National in November with the lion's share of the points being doled out then (the points that were earned was <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was earned through the year. At that time the ABA AA pro who won the most money was declared No. 1 pro). The pros claimed that this benefited the ABA since it meant an exciting finish to the season, but it was detrimental to the pros in that a season of consistent wins and near wins could be undone by having an off day and/or a normally inconsistent rider having a great day and capturing the number one plate. Other issues like a bigger pro purse and that the purse be spread out over eight places instead of the top four at ABA Nationals which would ensure anyone making the pro main would get a share of the winnings were also a factor. The claim was while NBL, NBA and independent promotional races' purses have gone up over the years, the ABA's purses had remained relatively stagnant.|$|E
25|$|In 1722, Enríquez alleged in {{a letter}} to the Crown that since his return Danío had only pursued the {{appropriation}} of his fortune. These accusations were backed by Valdivia and Paris. However, the governor was likely simply trying to recover the wealth that he had left in charge of the privateer years before. Enríquez tried to bring an end to the conflict by offering a sum between 15,000 and 20,000 pieces of eight to Danío. However, this offering was declined. Furthermore, both could never agree on <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was owed due to their previous arrangement, with the governor claiming that it was 42,261 pieces of eight, but the privateer rebuffing that it was a shared debt and that the fortune was spent in critical investments. Enríquez even told the king that he possessed a document stating that he was actually the creditor of the governor's fortune and as such owned nothing. This infuriated Danío, who ordered his incarceration on December 9, 1722. Antonio Camino, was also jailed but soon escaped and traveled to Havana. Once there, he began collecting positive accounts for his employer. Among those that agreed to help were a group of military officials that had been neglected by Danío in October 1720, only to be fully attended by Enríquez. After gathering the support, Camino traveled to Spain where he spoke in the privateer's behalf for over a year. Valdivia tried to request an excarceration with external help, but Enríquez remained in jail. The relationship between the Church functionary and the privateer had been criticized by Danío. To further antagonize Enríquez, he created a system of official privateering by reassigning the sloop Santiago, confiscated along his other property. Ubides became involved in this venture, but the plan backfired and the ship was captured by a pirate brigantine sailing from Martinique in its first mission. The entire blame fell on Danío, who had staffed the boat with an inexperienced crew that did not know how to react once they witnessed a jolly roger. Seeking an escape, the governor devised an account where he blamed Camino, claiming that he had provided route information to the pirates, supposedly acting on Enríquez's behalf. Danío claimed that the privateer formed an alliance with the pirates so that he could freely import illegal contraband and he even tried to bribe a St. Thomas sailor with 1,000 pieces of eight so that his account had a witness. The governor tried to restart the official privateering project, meeting moderate success by mimicking the pirate code's repartition of the loot captured. They captured three vessels, two from France and Great Britain and a third one sailed by freebooters.|$|E

500|$|The United States was {{represented}} by Mark R. Freeman, Assistant to the Solicitor General.

[...] Due to the lack of sufficient funding, the Secretary of the Interior has distributed the available funds on a pro rata basis among all of the IDEAA contracts. [...] The United States also pointed out that the Constitution prohibits payments unless those payments have been appropriated or authorized by Congress. [...] Freeman argued that the government's liability does not extend past <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> Congress has appropriated for all of the contracts. [...] The government also stated that the contract did not create a binding promise to pay the tribes the full amount of the contract.|$|E
