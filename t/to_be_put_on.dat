A {{few hours}} before he was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a ventilator, he was {{planning}} on writing his next novel, {{a story about a}} grandfather.

He died on 13 May 2001, in Chennai at the age of 94.|$|E

5|$|The Irish Republican Army, that {{controlled}} {{much of the}} southern part of the country during the Irish civil war, issued a 1d, 2d and 6d label, mainly because of a stamp shortage. These were printed in Cork and were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> sale in August 1922, but in the meantime the Irish Free State army landed near Cork and the IRA set fire to their own barracks before they retreated from Cork, destroying most of the labels.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt enraged Chandler by {{charging}} that, when Chandler was a senator, he had {{voted in favor}} of declaring World War II, but soon after resigned his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor of}} the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.|$|E
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1990, after the first {{democratic}} elections in Croatia, the municipal government finally approved the project. An architectural competition was planned for January 1991. Political turmoil in the country, followed by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995), caused the project <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold again. In 1994 President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman said to Jakov Bienenfeld, Council member of the Zagreb Jewish community, that they should build the new synagogue {{at the site of}} the former synagogue, which will be funded by the Croatian government. Bienenfeld declined the offer believing to be inappropriate when 1800 Catholic churches are left destroyed at the time, during Croatian War of Independence.|$|E

5|$|Coloured {{seats and}} a police room {{were added to the}} Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the Hillsborough {{disaster}} in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, the Taylor Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action. The stand—renamed the Centenary Stand—was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, President Grant's Indian peace policy, {{enforced}} {{and coordinated}} by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona, required the Apache <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> reservations {{where they would}} receive supplies and agriculture education. The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers. In one raid, {{believed to have been}} conducted by Apache warriors, settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan, Arizona. The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant. 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville. Angered over the murders, the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians, 42 Mexicans, and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache. When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30, they murdered 144 Apaches, mostly women and children, in {{what became known as the}} Camp Grant Massacre. Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery. In May, an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise; during the chase they killed 13 Apache. Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona.|$|E
