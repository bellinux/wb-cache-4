5|$|The covert war in Laos {{continues}} to fascinate those with {{any knowledge of}} it. It {{was one of the}} quintessential Cold War insurgency/counterinsurgency, low-intensity conflicts and offers many lessons in the conduct of irregular covert operations supported by modern military technology. It also remains one of only a few military operations of the Vietnam War about which both major belligerent parties (the U.S. and North Vietnam) are still reluctant to discuss openly their participation. For the North Vietnamese, this is understandable. Hanoi has no more incentive to discuss its operations <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had in the 1960s or 1970s. Although the U.S. has been more open about its participation, the covert war remains a touchy subject.|$|E

It is endemic to the region, and {{is found in}} a much smaller range <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> originally inhabited. Since the San Joaquin Valley fell under heavy agricultural cultivation, habitat loss combined with rodenticide use has reduced the squirrels numbers enough that it is now listed as a threatened species.|$|E

However, increasing numbers of more affluent Muslims' children attend fully-fledged private Islamic schools, which combine secular and religious education. Among Muslims of Indian origin, madaris also used to provide instruction in Urdu, although this is far less common <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> used to be.|$|E

25|$|Under {{all three}} of the {{conceptual}} approaches to animal cruelty discussed above, performing unnecessary experiments or demonstrations upon animals that cause them substantial pain or distress may be viewed as cruelty. Due to changes in ethical standards, this type of cruelty tends to be less common <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> {{used to be in the}} past. For example, schoolroom demonstrations of oxygen depletion routinely suffocated birds by placing them under a glass cover, and animals were suffocated in the Cave of Dogs to demonstrate the density and toxicity of carbon dioxide to curious travellers on the Grand Tour.|$|E
25|$|Dog meat is {{far less}} popular <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> used to be, being viewed largely {{as a kind of}} health tonic rather than as a diet staple, {{especially}} amongst the younger generations who view dogs as pets and service animals. That said, historically the consumption of dog meat {{can be traced back to}} antiquity. Dog bones were excavated in a neolithic settlement in Changnyeong, South Gyeongsang Province. A wall painting in the Goguryeo tombs complex in South Hwanghae Province, a UNESCO World Heritage site which dates from 4th century AD, depicts a slaughtered dog in a storehouse.|$|E

[...] However, he was critical of the episode's third act. [...] "The side of the show feels like it was intended to amuse a few fans and it doesn’t show a lot of real cleverness or wit", he wrote. He summarized the episode as being decent, but inconsistent.|$|E

The American Coaster Enthusiasts' Inside Track {{magazine}} ranked Thunder Run as the [...] "fourth best {{of its kind}} in the nation". In 2007, the Lexington Herald-Leader described the ride as having [...] "a few nice drops and that jerky, clicking wooden coaster feel that some people love, but it never gets too wild". Tim O'Brien, formerly of Amusement Business, rode the inaugural run of the ride in 1990, as well as the first cycle of the refurbished ride in 2013. O'Brien describes the updated ride as [...] "a better ride <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> was back then", commending the ride's ability to give a classic wooden roller coaster feel, yet run smoothly.

So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain third-party titles, it may not always remain that way. Just how Microsoft will get it to that point, though, is still a mystery." [...] However, he disfavored the console's dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality, Kinect's voice recognition, and that some games do not natively run at 1080p resolution, but are upscaled. In an August 2016 review of the Xbox One S model, TechRadar further commended Microsoft's recent improvements to Xbox One, citing a strong lineup of first-party titles in 2015 and further improvements to the console's interface.|$|E

The use of the Wii Remote for the Celestial Brush was well received; in GameSpots review, they noted that the Wii functionality with the Brush [...] "improves {{the pace of the}} game". However, other aspects to the controls were found to be weaker, particularly in combat. In their review, Nintendo Power recommended the PlayStation 2 version of the game over the Wii, stating that [...] "Though you can overcome the drawing and attacking issues with practice (and by sticking to whip-style weapons), it's a hurdle you shouldn't have to leap." [...] The Wii version was given the Game of the Month award from IGN for April 2008.

The Confession is a key document of Lutheranism and its Presentation to Emperor Charles V in June 1530 was a momentous event of the Protestant Reformation. This symphony was written for a full orchestra and was Mendelssohn's second extended symphony. It was not published until 1868, 21 years after the composer's death - hence its numbering as '5'.

As a beneficial result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues and the need for relationship-building through techniques such as assignment of a child to a specific care provider. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to follow through on these considerations, nevertheless a larger number of infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than {{was the case in the}} past, and emotional development of children in nonparental care may be different <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> was in the 1980s or in Bowlby's time.|$|E
