The framework of all musical events lies on several prominent leit-motives developed through the symphonic texture. The two main leit-motives are extracted from the <b>thematic</b> <b>fabric</b> of Mokranjac’s Rukovet no. 11 (Song-Wreath no. 11): the songs “Biljana, whitening the linen” (“Biljana platno beleše”) and “Let me go” (“Pušči me”). Along with these two leit-motivical citations, the ballet music also features a theme from the widely known song “Biljana,” {{as well as the}} transcription of a folk tune notated by V. Đorđević (“I’m drinking wine and rakia” (“Pijem vino i rakiju”)) which does not serve as a leit-motive, but rather appears only as a theme of the closing bachelor’s kolo. The main leit-motives symbolize Biljana’s character and love of the two youths. Other prominent motives, although of a more sporadic role, depict Biljana’s father and the sword. The citations represent the ballet’s primary thematic material that ensures coherency of its musical content. The motives are treated in a symphonic manner whereas the symphonic development serves the dramatics of the plot: the motivical transformation is tightly connected with the plot and the shifts demonstrate characters’ psychological ordeals and characterize dramatic tensions. In terms of harmony, while there are some bolder instances within the realm of romanticist expression, Hristić mostly operates with simple devices. His harmonic language encompasses modality, specific scalar structures such as the Balkan scale (minor), whole-tone scale (utilized strictly in melodic lines), and Phrygian mode-mixture, to the typical late romanticist expanded tonality. The most captivating aspect of Hristić’s craftsmanship pertains to the richness of orchestral sound. This trait is also manifested in the four orchestral suites composed of the most pertinent ballet excerpts (recording of the Belgrade Philharmonic with conductor Emil Tabakov, 1998).|$|E
5000|$|Evidence: {{the play}} {{must have been}} written between 1605 and 1609. A {{terminus}} post quem of 1605 is fixed by Menenius' speech regarding the body politic (1.1.93-152), which is partly derived from a speech attributed to Pope Adrian IV in William Camden's Remaines of a Greater Worke, Concerning Britaine, {{which was published in}} 1605. A terminus ante quem of 1609 can be fixed by Ben Jonson's Epicœne, or The silent woman, which mocks the line [...] "he lurched all swords of the garland" [...] (2.2.99), and Robert Armin's Phantasma the Italian Tailor and his Boy, which contains a close parallel to the line [...] "they threw their caps/As they would hang them on the horns o'th'moon" [...] (1.1.209-210). Epicœne was written in 1609, and Phantasma was entered into the Stationers Register on 6 February 1609. Topical allusions, however, can be used to narrow the date further. For example, the presentation of the grain riots is strikingly reminiscent of the Midlands corn riots of 1607. Perhaps significantly, Shakespeare was in Stratford-upon-Avon for much of autumn 1608, organising his mother's funeral and conducting business, and thus would have been close to the origin point of the unrest. The reference to [...] "the coal of fire upon the ice" [...] (1.1.170) is a possible allusion to the winter of 1607-08, when the frost was so severe that vendors set up booths on the frozen Thames river, and pans of coals were placed on the ice so that pedestrians could warm themselves. Also, an allusion to the complaints about Hugh Myddelton's project to bring clean water to London from the River Lea (which originated in 1608) has been detected in Martius' warning to the patricians [...] "to say he'll turn your current in a ditch/And make your channel his" [...] (3.1.98-9). Gary Taylor also finds the use of act divisions in the Folio text important, as the King's Men only began to use act divisions when they occupied the indoors Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608. Lee Bliss argues that the five-act structure is built into the <b>thematic</b> <b>fabric</b> of the play, further strengthening the argument that it was written for Blackfriars. Indeed, Bliss believes Coriolanus may have been the King's Men's debut play at the theatre. Taylor believes that the cumulative internal evidence all points to a composition date of no earlier than spring 1608. In his 1994 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, R.B. Parker dates the play mid-1608. In his 2000 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Lee Bliss is unconvinced by the arguments that Shakespeare is referring to the freezing of the Thames or to Myddelton's scheme, and settles on a date of late 1608 to early 1609.|$|E
40|$|The schema {{under which}} the {{specimen}} text can be apprehended relies primarily on binary units. They are either assembled onto an axis of opposition or similarity. If similarity is called for, smaller units are usually combined into larger units, or else are ordered into chains of equvalent parts. Larger units are organized into tripartite structures: the chapters form three major units (1); textual relations are represented as triangular models (2); and throughout the text, reference is made {{to the concept of}} the Trinity (3). The number three stands for completeness and the number thirteen functions similarly: there are thirteen chapters in the text. The "Wendepunkt" of the novella occurs in the middle, thus dividing the text into two equal parts which both function independently as all binary units do, but they are equivalent units in terms of structural relevance. As independent units, the first establishes the thematic material, the second completes the drama and confirms the prevailing sense of tragedy. Together they constitute the text. The basic motifs are already present in the first paragraph of Katz und Maus, and as the text continues, variation and juxtaposition work to expand on the notions the text has established in the beginning, so that the beginning already foreshadows the final event. Mahlke's body and its exceptional symmetry function as a map for textual relations. The straight line descending from his Mittelscheitel down to his Adamsapfel and further down to his genitals is the same vertical axis and center line which divides the novella in the middle of chapter seven. All other parts are fitted onto that axis and revolve around it as story, plot and characters are added into the <b>thematic</b> <b>fabric</b> of Katz und Maus. As a result the body's volume and density are increased while the skeleton's major axis starts to turn at regular intervals. As the axis continues to rotate, different parts come into view and are displayed as the elements that form an organic whole. At the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines of that cross lies the source of all good and evil: Mahlke's Adamsapfel. Big, round and energetic, it feeds all other parts and dominates the entire structure. The Adam's apple is Mahlke's motor and the motor of all textual activity. It is procreator of the text and generator of the inherent major conflict which exists between Katz and Maus...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{linkages}} between literature and folklore, {{the role and}} place of folklore motives {{in the works of}} Kabardinian writers. The analysis is carried out on the material of H. Teunov (story “Aslan”), A. Shortanov (novel “The Highlanders”), A. Keshokov (novels “The tops do not sleep,” “Broken Horseshoe”, “Roots”) and others. The article considers the problem in its evolutionary development from the period of the 1940 s to the present. The main attention is paid {{to the study of the}} specific use of folk motifs, symbols and images in the works of a single artist’s words. If in the early periods of the formation of the national literature it was often observed directly “inclusive” folk motifs in artistic fabric of the work, in the 1980 - 1990 -ies it is marked by the introduction of the organic folk motifs, images and symbolism in <b>thematic</b> and plot-compositional <b>fabric</b> of prose works. The constructive role of folklore consists not only in the private and purposeful use of legends, stories, parables, but in the plot-composite formation of works (A. Keshokov, T. Adygov etc.) The article concludes that in contemporary prose Kabardinian wisdom takes new moral and aesthetic value and meaning...|$|R
