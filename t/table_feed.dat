50|$|A {{horizontal}} mill has {{the same}} sort but the cutters are mounted on a horizontal spindle (see Arbor milling) across the table. Many horizontal mills also feature a built-in rotary table that allows milling at various angles; this feature is called a universal table. While endmills and the other types of tools available to a vertical mill {{may be used in}} a horizontal mill, their real advantage lies in arbor-mounted cutters, called side and face mills, which have a cross section rather like a circular saw, but are generally wider and smaller in diameter. Because the cutters have good support from the arbor and have a larger cross-sectional area than an end mill, quite heavy cuts can be taken enabling rapid material removal rates. These are used to mill grooves and slots. Plain mills are used to shape flat surfaces. Several cutters may be ganged together on the arbor to mill a complex shape of slots and planes. Special cutters can also cut grooves, bevels, radii, or indeed any section desired. These specialty cutters tend to be expensive. Simplex mills have one spindle, and duplex mills have two. It is also easier to cut gears on a horizontal mill. Some horizontal milling machines are equipped with a power-take-off provision on the table. This allows the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> to be synchronized to a rotary fixture, enabling the milling of spiral features such as hypoid gears.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} a noninvasive method to assess <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed (mm/s) in modern commercial computed tomography (CT) systems. The <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> (mm/rotation) was measured at selected nominal <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speeds, given as low (26. 67 mm/s), intermediate (48. 00 mm/s), and high (64. 00 mm/s), by utilizing a computed radiography (CR) cassette installed with a photostimulable phosphor plate. The cassette was placed on the examination table to travel through the isocenter longitudinally, with a total scan length of over 430 mm. The distance travelled was employed to determine the total <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> length. To calculate the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed, gantry rotation time was measured concurrently at a preselected nominal rotation time of 750 ms.

With the rising demands of modern engineering products, the control of surface texture together with high material removal rate has become more important. In this paper, the effects of various process parameters of CNC Milling like Spindle Speed (N), <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> rate (FR), depth of cut (DOC), step over (SO) and coolant pressure (CP) have been investigated to reveal their impact on surface roughness and material removal rate of hot die steel (H- 11) using one variable at a time approach(OFAT). The experimental studies were performed on SURYA VF 30 CNC VS machine. The processing of the job has been done by solid carbide four flute end-mill tools under finishing conditions.

The experimental data was collected by end milling of hardened AISI 4140 steel using carbide cutter under dry and minimum quantity lubrication conditions according to Taguchi L (16) orthogonal array. The predictive model of the responses was formulated by using response surface methodology. The analysis of variance revealed that the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> has the maximum influence on cutting force, and the flow rate of lubricant has the highest effect on surface roughness. The parameter setting at lower <b>table</b> <b>feed,</b> higher cutting speed, and 150 -ml/h lubricant flow yield the minimum value of the responses.

40|$|Vineyards {{around the}} world sustain {{significant}} economic losses due to grape loss and damage caused by frugivorous passerine birds, and while bird control methods are in place, their efficacy is limited and/or short lived. With the call for more sustainable agricultural practices globally, it would be advantageous to offer an ecologically based solution to the bird problem in vineyards, while further research and development into cheaper, more effective methods of bird control that does not create noise or disturbance to communities surrounding vineyards is required. The Australasian harrier, a native, diurnal New Zealand raptor, is the focal species of this project. With considerable numbers of harriers sited around New Zealand viticultural land, {{the aim of this}} project was to attract populations of these harriers into vineyards by providing them with an important food source – animal carcasses. The presence of harriers was expected to exploit the innate fear that pest passerine birds have towards raptors and provide an effective biological control aid that would provide an economically and environmentally sound solution to passerine bird induced grape damage as the passerines responded to the harrier rather than foraging on grapes. The Australian harrier was attracted to raised <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> in Canterbury and Wairarapa vineyards with supplementary food. Results indicated it was difficult to attain regular <b>feeding</b> from all <b>tables</b> set up. Some <b>feeding</b> <b>table</b> sites saw harriers <b>feeding</b> off <b>tables</b> regularly and intermittently, while at other sites no harriers exploited the tables. When presented with a two choice food test on <b>feeding</b> <b>tables,</b> comprising one-day-old cock chicks and rabbit pieces in the springtime, chicks (86 %) were the harriers’ clear choice over rabbit pieces (14 %). During the summer season, there was no preference, with equal amounts of both baits taken. Where <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> were present, pest bird abundance decreased by 56 %, and grape damage also decreased by 59 %; however, these results were not necessarily linked only to harrier presence. While harrier numbers increased due to <b>feeding</b> <b>tables,</b> so did the number of other predators. A further trial without <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> where supplementary food was placed on the ground to attract all predators, showed an increase of predators in the treatment sites compared to control sites, with harriers and cats the most frequently observed. Pest passerine bird densities in the control sites were higher than the treatment sites. Raised <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> baited with animal carcasses are not necessarily a reliable method to encourage harrier feeding in vineyards. Several reasons may explain why this method may be unreliable. The best reason may be the motivation to feed off a novel object, i. e. the raised table was not sufficient because of neophobic tendencies for some harriers, and these were difficult to overcome. Alternative, easily accessible food sources were readily available in some landscapes and agonistic relationships with other species, who were frequently seen harassing harriers in study sites, may well have confounded attempts to achieve <b>feeding</b> off <b>tables</b> at all sites. Findings perhaps negate the need for any <b>feeding</b> <b>tables,</b> and supplementary <b>feeding</b> alone may be the key to attracting harriers and other predators into vineyards to achieve the fundamental goal of decreasing pest passerine bird numbers and consequent grape damage...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{engineering}} provides {{solutions to}} wear and corrosion degradation of engineering components. Laser cladding is a surfacing process {{used to produce}} wear and corrosion resistant surfaces by covering a particular part of the substrate with another material that has superior properties, producing a fusion bond between the two materials with minimal dilution of the clad layer by the substrate. The advantages of laser cladding compared to conventional techniques include low and controllable heat input into the workpiece, a high cooling rate, great processing flexibility, low distortion due to the low heat input to the workpiece and minimal post-treatment. The main processing parameters of laser cladding include laser power, laser spot size, processing speed, and powder feed rate. Within an optimized operational window, all these variables have some effect on {{the temperature of the}} clad interaction zone. The laser cladding technique is very complicated because it involves metallurgical and physical phenomena, such as laser beam-materials interaction, heat transfer between the clad and the substrate, and the interdiffusion of the clad and the substrate materials. Laser cladding is currently an open-loop process, relying on the skills of the operator and requiring dedication to specialty to make it successful. Unless the required expertise is provided, attempts to make the process successful will be futile. The objective in conducting the project was to investigate and develop prototype sensors to monitor and control Nd:YAG laser cladding process. Through a LabVIEW software based monitoring program, real-time process monitoring of optical emissions in the form of light and heat radiation was carried out, and correlated with the properties of the produced clad layers. During various experiments, single- and multiple-track laser cladding trials were performed. The responses of such sensors to the selected conditions were examined and an in depth analysis of detected heat and optical radiation signals was carried out. The results of these experiments showed the ability of such sensors to recognize changes in process parameters, and detected defects on layer surfaces along with the presence of oxides. A multi-function closed-loop laser power and CNC motion <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> rate control interface based on a LabVIEW platform has been designed and built, which is capable of accepting and interpreting sensors' data and adjusting accordingly the laser power and CNC motion <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> rate to produce sound clad layers.
