50|$|ASTM A992 {{steel is}} a {{structural}} steel alloy {{often used in}} the USA for steel wide-flange and I beams. Like other carbon steels, the density of ASTM A992 steel is approximately 7850 kg/m3 (0.2836 lb/in3).

50|$|The numbers {{stamped on}} the head of the bolt are {{referred}} to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called property class) stamped {{on the head}}. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a <b>tensile</b> <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.|$|E
50|$|Ultimate tensile {{strength}} is the {{tensile stress at}} which the bolt fails. <b>Tensile</b> <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener {{is said to be}} operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio and shear modulus of bulk cotton lint fibers were determined. The cotton lint was compressed in an MTS machine to a predetermined density, and the resilient forces induced by the cotton lint after being compressed were measured. Finite element analysis was used to model force on cotton bale ties, and determine the magnitude of the resilient forces on the bale ties. The nodal forces on the bale tie material were evaluated for three different bale tie materials to determine if bale tie breakage would occur. Young's modulus of bulk lint cotton was found to be 9 MPa and the Poisson's ratio was 0. 1, while 12 MPa was recorded for the shear modulus. The FEA analysis showed that round steel ties, at six ties per bale were loaded at 5. 9 % of their <b>tensile</b> <b>yield</b> <b>strength,</b> and at 5. 4 % for eight ties per bale.
