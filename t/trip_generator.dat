This paper analyses system behavior at selected study area in 790 Bus Test System Network using PSSE software to justify that TSI COI Speed can serve as an indicator to detect OOS at early stage in order to initiate Force Generator Tripping Scheme (FGTS). In this paper, TSI COI Speed and Accelerating Power are used as a new technique to be implemented in FGTS; a complete algorithm is developed that can detect OOS, initiate FGTS, calculate the amount of MW quantum to force <b>trip</b> <b>generator,</b> determine which generator and the most suitable location to force <b>trip</b> <b>generator,</b> evaluate on the effectiveness of FGTS, and initiate contingency action to take if OOS still exists in the system...|$|E

In power systems, the maximum use of existing capacities along with the increased powers transferred through the transition lines make transient stability studies even more important.

3000|$|In this example, {{the method}} {{requires}} three iterations to converge {{to a minimum}} cost solution, when no better solutions are found by adding additional SPS failure modes to secure against. In this case, the solution κ _ 3 {{is equal to the}} global optimum found by enumeration of all possible candidates. The method starts with the base case κ _ 0 =κ (Q_ 0) that has a large optimality gap, largely due to the loss-of-load risk X. The root cause to this high exposure is that all selected generators are located at Bus 22, which increases the risk from a common mode failure at this bus. In the first iteration, the method generates and evaluates a variety of SPS configurations that differ from the base case. The best of these, κ _ 1, [...] is found by securing the system against the common fault at Bus 22 when the most onerous contingency (lines 25 and 26) occurs. It reduces the risk X by diversifying the SPS capacity among Buses 18, 21 and 22, and by committing an additional 100  MW of SPS capacity. The next two iterations provide further robustness to the SPS in case of the double line contingency event, securing the system against the common failure to trip generation in Bus 21 and a failure to <b>trip</b> <b>generator</b> 1 in Bus 18.

Considering the substantial number of short-distance trips, the time consumed in traffic jams, the higher costs for parking vehicles and restrictions in central business districts, many commuters have found that non-motorized modes of transportation serve as viable and economical transport alternatives. Thus, local governments should encourage and stimulate non-motorized modes of transportation. In return, governments must provide safe conditions for these forms of transportation, and motorized vehicle users must respect and coexist with pedestrians and cyclists, which are the most vulnerable users of the transportation system. Although current trends in sustainable transport aim to encourage and stimulate non-motorized modes of transportation that are socially more efficient than motorized transportation, few to no safety policies have been implemented regarding vulnerable road users (VRU), mainly in large urban centers. Due to the spatial nature of the data used in transport-related studies, geospatial technologies provide a powerful analytical method for studying VRU safety frameworks through the use of spatial analysis. In this article, spatial analysis is used to determine the locations of regions that are characterized by a concentration of traffic accidents (black zones) involving VRU (injuries and casualties) in São Paulo, Brazil (developing country), and Rome, Italy (developed country). The black zones are investigated to obtain spatial patterns that can cause multiple accidents. A method based on kernel density estimation (KDE) is used to compare the two cities and show economic, social, cultural, demographic and geographic differences and/or similarities and how these factors are linked to the locations of VRU traffic accidents. Multivariate regression analyses (ordinary least squares (OLS) models and spatial regression models) are performed to investigate spatial correlations, to understand the dynamics of VRU road accidents in São Paulo and Rome and to detect factors (variables) that contribute to the occurrences of these events, such as the presence of <b>trip</b> <b>generator</b> hubs (TGH), the number of generated urban trips and demographic data.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the South African Transport Conference 17 - 20 July 2000 "Action in transport for the new millennium", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT:The third edition of the SA Road Traffic Signs Manual (SARTSM) has been in use since 1993. It constitutes a complete technical revision of the Manual in use earlier and provides guidelines for most situations to be encountered in the road signage environment. Due to the extensive expansion and upgrading of the facilities at the Johannesburg International Airport (JIA) {{and in particular the}} construction of the multi-storey parkade, changes had been made to the distribution roads within the Airport precinct. Road signage issues represented {{a large portion of the}} complaints received by Airport management in the past. The changes to the road system presented the opportunity to reconsider the way in which motorist guidance was given. JIA is an exceedingly large <b>trip</b> <b>generator.</b> At the moment, it is estimated that these trips amount to more than 30000 vehicles daily. The planning for the airport is being done for some 20 million PAX annually by the year 2010. This would result in at least 50000 vehicle trips daily. Due to the extremely congested landside area the task of the motorist is equally difficult, especially so for the non-regular visitor to JIA. The brief given to Africon was to develop a signage system that would be user-friendlier and fit the proposed new usage pattern of the facilities available to the motorist. The signage plan provided for the motorist to be led through a number of successive decisions to reach his destination. Guidance towards available parking has been achieved through the linking of variable message signs (both rotating vane and LED display types) to a parking management system implemented in all the parking areas, thus providing dynamically changing information. Other frequently used or future facilities were included in the signage plan in such a way that the most logical routes to reach them were identified. This took cognisance of the need to balance the usage of the two approach roads (also in terms of road signage utilization) as far as possible. This signage plan had been developed against the background of the guidelines contained in SARTSM. A number of principles in SARTSM were utilised in an unconventional way. Differently coloured background insert panels were used to provide a means whereby different routes could be colour-coded, for example. The colours so used are also not regular road signage colours, but were chosen to partly co-incide with a colour convention that has been utilised within the terminal buildings for some time already. With the cooperation of the signage manufacturer, it was even possible to provide these non-traditional colours in fully retro-reflective sheeting, thus ensuring that the signs look the same by night as by day. It is concluded that the signage plan was successfully implemented in a very complicated environment, because it adhered strictly to certain important principles whilst it interpreted the SARTSM in an innovative way where possible.

40|$|PhD (Electrical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 The {{rotor shaft}} of a {{synchronous}} machine can experience severe mechanical stress due to torque pulsations during a pole-slip condition. All pole-slip protection relays {{currently on the}} market use the impedance pole-slip protection method to detect a pole-slip. No commercial relay currently available can predict accurately when a generator is about to experience a damaging pole-slip. All the relays will only <b>trip</b> a <b>generator</b> after it has pole-slipped one or more times. Severe mechanical damage could be caused to a machine after only one pole-slip. It is therefore essential to enhance pole-slip protection relays {{to such an extent}} that it can <b>trip</b> a <b>generator</b> before it pole slips. The proposed pole-slip protection function must predict when a generator will become unstable during a network fault. As soon as instability is predicted, the <b>generator</b> must be <b>tripped</b> before the fault is cleared to avoid damaging post-fault torque effects. Conventional impedance pole-slip protection methods are are also discussed and the shortcomings of impedance pole-slip protection are investigated. The new pole-slip protection function was designed by using PSCAD. Detailed PSCAD simulations on different network configurations proved that the new pole-slip protection function will <b>trip</b> a <b>generator</b> before a damaging pole-slip occurs. The new pole-slip protection function was also implemented on an ABB REM 543 multifunctional protection relay and tested on a RTDS. The concept of the new pole-slip function was successfully demonstrated on the protection relay. The operation of conventional impedance scheme relays was compared with the proposed pole-slip function for different fault conditions. Although the new pole-slip protection function is more complex than the existing impedance functions, it was concluded that similar skills are required to test and commission the new protection function. The new pole-slip function outperforms the impedance protection methods, since the new protection function can <b>trip</b> the <b>generator</b> before it pole-slips. Doctora...|$|R
