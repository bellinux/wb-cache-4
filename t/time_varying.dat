25|$|Parametric {{resonance}} {{occurs in}} a mechanical system when a system is parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. Parametric excitation differs from forcing since the action appears as a <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> modification on a system parameter.|$|E

This was intended to deny an enemy the use of civilian GPS receivers for precision weapon guidance.|$|E

25|$|Parametric {{resonance}} {{occurs in}} a mechanical system when a system is parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. Parametric excitation differs from forcing, since the action appears as a <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> modification on a system parameter. This effect is different from regular resonance because it exhibits the instability phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|In Season 1, tied matches were {{resolved}} by a sudden death round; one team was randomly selected as the attackers and given about two minutes (<b>time</b> <b>varying</b> by map) without any overtime to secure a control point to win the match; otherwise, the defenders won. Blizzard had quickly recognized this method of resolving ties was not popular.|$|E
25|$|Earnshaw's theorem {{shows that}} no {{combination}} of static magnets {{can be in}} a stable equilibrium. Therefore a dynamic (<b>time</b> <b>varying)</b> magnetic field is required to achieve stabilization. EMS systems rely on active electronic stabilization that constantly measures the bearing distance and adjusts the electromagnet current accordingly. EDS systems rely on changing magnetic fields to create currents, which can give passive stability.|$|E

25|$|This {{equation}} {{reveals that}} memristance defines a linear relationship between current and voltage, {{as long as}} M does not vary with charge. Nonzero current implies <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> charge. Alternating current, however, may reveal the linear dependence in circuit operation by inducing a measurable voltage without net charge movement—as long as the maximum change in q does not cause much change in M.|$|E
25|$|Parametric {{resonance}} {{occurs in}} a mechanical system when a system is parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. Parametric resonance takes place when the external excitation frequency equals twice the natural frequency of the system. Parametric excitation differs from forcing since the action appears as a <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> modification on a system parameter. The classical example of parametric resonance {{is that of the}} vertically forced pendulum.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, {{using an}} {{extended}} {{version of the}} Stern–Gerlach apparatus, Isidor Rabi and colleagues showed that by using a varying magnetic field, one can force the magnetic moment to go from one state to the other. The series of experiments culminated in 1937 when they discovered that state transitions could be induced using <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> fields or RF fields. The so-called Rabi oscillation is the working mechanism for the Magnetic Resonance Imaging equipment found in hospitals.|$|E

25|$|Fast tissues absorb gas {{relatively}} quickly, {{but will}} generally release it quickly during ascent. A fast tissue may become saturated {{in the course}} of a normal sports dive, while a slow tissue may have absorbed only a small part of its potential gas capacity. By calculating the levels in each compartment separately, researchers are able to construct more effective algorithms. In addition, each compartment may be able to tolerate more or less supersaturation than others. The final form is a complicated model, but one that allows for the construction of algorithms and tables suited to a wide variety of diving. A typical dive computer has an 8–12 tissue model, with half <b>times</b> <b>varying</b> from 5 minutes to 400 minutes. The Bühlmann tables use an algorithm with 16 tissues, with half <b>times</b> <b>varying</b> from 4 minutes to 640 minutes.|$|R

25|$|The Maxwell–Faraday {{version of}} Faraday's law of {{induction}} describes how a <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> magnetic field creates ("induces") an electric field. This dynamically induced electric field has closed field lines {{similar to a}} magnetic field, unless superposed by a static (charge induced) electric field. This aspect of electromagnetic induction is the operating principle behind many electric generators: for example, a rotating bar magnet creates a changing magnetic field, which in turn generates an electric field in a nearby wire.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{may choose}} between several methods of {{fertility}} preservation prior to chemotherapy, including cryopreservation of semen, ovarian tissue, oocytes, or embryos. As {{more than half}} of cancer patients are elderly, this adverse effect is only relevant for a minority of patients. A study in France between 1999 and 2011 came to the result that embryo freezing before administration of gonadotoxic agents to females caused a delay of treatment in 34% of cases, and a live birth in 27% of surviving cases who wanted to become pregnant, with the follow-up <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> between 1 and 13 years.|$|E
25|$|Faraday {{explained}} {{electromagnetic induction}} using a concept he called lines of force. However, {{scientists at the}} time widely rejected his theoretical ideas, mainly {{because they were not}} formulated mathematically. An exception was James Clerk Maxwell, who used Faraday's ideas as the basis of his quantitative electromagnetic theory. In Maxwell's model, the <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> aspect of electromagnetic induction is expressed as a differential equation, which Oliver Heaviside referred to as Faraday's law even though it is slightly different from Faraday's original formulation and does not describe motional EMF. Heaviside's version (see Maxwell–Faraday equation below) is the form recognized today in the group of equations known as Maxwell's equations.|$|E

25|$|In general, neither {{impedance}} nor admittance can be <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> as {{they are}} defined for complex exponentials for –∞ < t < +∞. If the complex exponential voltage–current ratio changes over time or amplitude, the circuit element cannot be described using the frequency domain. However, many systems (e.g., varicaps {{that are used in}} radio tuners) may exhibit non-linear or time-varying voltage–current ratios that appear to be linear time-invariant (LTI) for small signals over small observation windows; hence, they can be roughly described as having a time-varying impedance. That is, this description is an approximation; over large signal swings or observation windows, the voltage–current relationship is non-LTI and cannot be described by impedance.|$|E
25|$|The Travelcard is an inter-modal travel {{ticket for}} {{unlimited}} {{use on the}} London Underground, London Overground, TfL Rail, Docklands Light Railway, Tramlink, London Buses and National Rail services in the Greater London area. Travelcards can be purchased {{for a period of}} <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> from one day to a year, from Transport for London, National Rail and their agents. Depending on where it is purchased, and the length of validity, a Travelcard is either printed on a paper ticket with a magnetic stripe or encoded onto an Oyster card, Transport for London's contactless electronic smart card. The cost of a Travelcard is determined by the area it covers and, for this purpose, London is divided into a number of fare zones. The Travelcard season ticket for unlimited travel on London Buses and the London Underground was launched on 22 May 1983 by London Transport. One Day Travelcards and validity on other transport modes were added from 1984 onwards. The introduction of the Travelcard caused an increase in patronage and reduced the number of tickets that needed to be purchased by passengers.|$|E
500|$|Originating from {{conflicting}} {{state and}} federal legislation passed between 1787 and 1805, the dispute resulted from poor understanding of geographical features of the Great Lakes at the <b>time.</b> <b>Varying</b> interpretations of the law caused the governments of Ohio and Michigan to both claim sovereignty over a [...] region along the border, {{now known as the}} Toledo Strip. When Michigan petitioned for statehood in 1835, it sought to include the disputed territory within its boundaries; Ohio's congressional delegation was in turn able to stall Michigan's admission to the Union.|$|E
