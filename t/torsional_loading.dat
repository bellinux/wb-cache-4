40|$|ABSTRACT: Torsional {{buckling}} of multi-walled {{carbon nanotube}} embedded in an elastic matrix subjected to thermal fields is studied using a continuum-based multilayered shell model. The model {{takes into account}} the multilayer van der Waals (vdW) interaction between any two layers of the MWCNT as radius dependent function. The elastic matrix surrounding the outermost tube is modeled as Pasternak foundation to account for not only the normal stresses, but also the shear stress between the outermost tube and the surrounding medium. The effect of inner tube radius, number of tubes, stiffness of surrounding elastic medium and temperature change on the critical <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> is examined. Numerical results show that the vdW interaction will lead to a higher critical <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> and at room or lower temperature the critical <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> for infinitesimal buckling of a multi-walled carbon nanotube increases as the value of temperature change increases, while at a temperature higher than room temperature the critical <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> for infinitesimal buckling of a multi-walled carbon nanotube decreases as the value of temperature change increases.

5000|$|In 2008, Eric Snively and Adam Cox {{tested the}} {{performance}} of 2D and 3D pachycephalosaur skulls through finite element analysis, and found that they could withstand considerable impact; greater vaulting of the domes allowed for higher forces of impact. They also considered it likely that pachycephalosaur domes were covered in keratin, a strong material that can withstand much energy without being permanently damaged (like the osteoderms of crocodilians), and therefore incorporated keratin into their test formula. In 2011, American palaeontologists Kevin Padian and John R. Horner proposed that [...] "bizarre structures" [...] in dinosaurs in general (including domes, frills, horns, and crests) were primarily used for species recognition, and dismissed other explanations as unsupported by evidence. Among other studies, these authors cited Goodwin et al.'s 2004 paper on pachycephalosaur domes as support of this idea, and they pointed out that such structures {{did not appear to}} be sexually dimorphic. In a response to Padian and Horner the same year, Rob J. Knell and Scott D. Sampson argued that species recognition was not unlikely as a secondary function for [...] "bizarre structures" [...] in dinosaurs, but that sexual selection (used in display or combat to compete for mates) was a more likely explanation, due to the high cost of developing them, and because such structures appear to be highly variable within species. In 2013, the British palaeontologists David E. Hone and Darren Naish criticized the [...] "species recognition hypothesis", and argued that no extant animals use such structures primarily for species recognition, and that Padian and Horner had ignored the possibility of mutual sexual selection (where both sexes are ornamented).In 2011, Snively and Jessica M. Theodor conducted a finite element analysis by simulating head-impacts with CT scanned skulls of S. validum (UALVP 2), Prenocephale prenes and several extant head-butting artiodactyls. They found that the correlations between head-striking and skull morphologies found in the living animals also existed in the studied pachycephalosaurs. Stegoceras and Prenocephale both had skull shapes similar to the bighorn sheep with cancellous bone protecting the brain. They also shared similarities in the distribution of compact and cancellous regions with the bighorn sheep, white-bellied duiker and the giraffe. The white-bellied duiker was found to be the closest morphological analogue to Stegoceras; this head-butting species has a dome which is smaller but similarly rounded. Stegoceras was better capable of dissipating force than artiodactyls that butt heads at high forces, but the less vascularized domes of older pachycephalosaurs, and possibly diminished ability to heal from injuries, argued against such combat in older individuals. The study also tested the effects of a keratinous covering of the dome, and found it to aid in performance. Though Stegoceras lacked the pneumatic sinuses that are found below the point of impact in the skulls of head-striking artiodactyls, it instead had vascular struts which could have similarly acted as braces, as well as conduits to feed the development of a keratin covering.In 2012, Schott and Evans suggested that the regularity in squamosal ornamentation throughout the ontogeny of Stegoceras was consistent with species recognition, but the change from flat to domed frontoparietals in late age suggests that the function of this feature changed through ontogeny, and was perhaps sexually selected, possibly for intra-specific combat.

Methods: Thirteen matched pairs of cadaveric femora were randomized into two groups: a notched group, which con-sisted of femora with a 3 -mm anterior cortical defect, and an unnotched group of controls. Each pair then underwent <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> to failure. The ability of a number of measures to predict femoral <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> to failure was assessed with use of regression analysis. These measures included dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans of the proximal and the distal part of the femur, geometric measures of both anterior and posterior cortical thickness as well as the polar moment of inertia of the distal part of the femur as calculated on computed tomography scans, and the Singh os-teoporosis index as determined on radiographs. Results: The <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> to failure averaged 98. 9 N-m for the notched femora and 143. 9 N-m for the controls; the dif-ference was significant (p < 0. 01). Although several variables correlated with <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> to failure, distal femoral bone-mineral density demonstrated the highest significant correlation (r = 0. 85; p < 0. 001).

40|$|This {{research}} thesis {{presents an}} analysis of the <b>torsional</b> <b>loads</b> on V-band clamps. In some applications, the relative rotational movement of the flanges connected by V-band clamps can result in catastrophic system failure. The ability to understand the factors impacting on <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> capacity is therefore essential. In this research project, a theoretical model of a V-band joint subjected to <b>torsional</b> <b>loads</b> was developed. This model is used to identify those parameters that will impact on the joint’s reliability. An experimental investigation was conducted to validate a theoretical model using a newly developed test rig. The development and features of this test rig are presented in this report. This experimental investigation also allowed the impact of those parameters that are difficult to control, to be determined. A total of three V-bands were used with different diameters but nominally identical cross sections were studied. In the research results, the initial slip point between flanges and the V-band clamp was identified by experimentation within this research project. Different sizes of Vbands were used under boundary conditions and loads. From the simulation results it was determned that the friction effect on the V-band depends {{on the size of the}} V-band. For the largest size of V-band, there was moderate correlation of the experimental and theoretical results. For the smallest size, the results suggest that with band tightening, flange contact is localised, rather than being throughout the band’s entire circumference.

40|$|The {{present study}} reports {{the effects of}} {{combined}} torsional and compressive cyclic loading on trabecular bone in order to mimic true physiological conditions and thereby provides improved data that represents clinical and real life conditions. However, only compressive behaviour is evaluated in most previous studies of bone mechanics. From the monotonic evaluation, {{it is observed that}} lower stress is needed for the onset of microcrack in the sample under <b>torsional</b> <b>loading,</b> compared to the stress needed in compression. Trabecular bone samples were subjected to a combination of torsion and compression fatigue at different stress levels during which they were compared to compressive axial fatigue. The stress levels were determined by considering the monotonic strength at 25 - 50 % for both compressive and shear stresses. Significant decrease in fatigue lifetime is observed in between samples of pure compression fatigue and those with superpositioned <b>torsional</b> <b>loading</b> (p< 0. 05). The reduction in fatigue lifetime became more evident at a high torsional stress level. In this case, the failure of the sample is said to be 'torsional dominant'. Fatigue behaviour of bovine trabecular bone begins with plastic deformation, followed by strain accumulation and modulus reduction. As the strain rate increases, more energy dissipates and the sample finally failed. Further, the analysis of fractograph revealed something on the trabeculae by bending in sample with superpositioned <b>torsional</b> <b>loading.</b> In conclusion, <b>torsional</b> <b>loading</b> decreases the quality of the trabecular properties in terms of stiffness, life and structural integrity.

40|$|<b>Torsional</b> <b>load</b> on pile {{foundations}} is induced {{by the action of}} eccentric horizontal forces on the supporting structures. Such loading not only initiates twist at the pile head, but also reduces its axial capacity significantly associated with increased settlement of the foundation. Inadequate design of piles under torsion may lead to disastrous consequences. Although several theoretical and experimental investigations have already been carried out on piles under <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> as evidenced from the available literature, there is ample scope for further contributions on the influence of <b>torsional</b> <b>load</b> on pile foundation. This paper presents a novel numerical model (boundary element method) to analyze the response of a single, vertical, floating pile subjected to pure <b>torsional</b> <b>load.</b> The nonlinear stress-strain response of soil has been incorporated in the model by hyperbolic correlation, whereas the pile material has been idealized as elastic-perfectly plastic. The effect of progressive pile-soil slippage at the interface is considered. Apart from predicting the load-displacement response with incremental angle of twist of pile under pure torsion, the profiles for shear stress and angle of twist and the depth of interface slippage are some of the salient features captured by the proposed model. Validation of the model developed by comparing with existing models and experimental data indicate the suitability and accuracy of the solutions developed. However, minor discrepancies in the solution appeared owing to the simplified assumptions of perfectly plastic postpeak soil behavior and the absence of residual stress in the soil owing to pile installation. The proposed model is also applied successfully to selected case studies on concrete piles (L=D ranged from 10 - 40) in medium-soft clay, medium-dense sand, and layered soil, and a set of design curves have been constructed. 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R
