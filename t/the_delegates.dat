5|$|During the siege, {{newly elected}} delegates from across Texas {{met at the}} Convention of 1836. On March 2, <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> {{declared}} independence, forming the Republic of Texas. Four days later, <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> at the convention received a dispatch Travis had written March 3 warning of his dire situation. Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, Robert Potter called for the convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve the Alamo. Sam Houston convinced <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> to remain in Washington-on-the-Brazos to develop a constitution. After being appointed sole commander of all Texian troops, Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the 400volunteers who were still waiting for Fannin to lead them to the Alamo.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>delegates</b> {{voted to}} address the {{platform}} before deciding on nominees, and debate began when they reconvened at 8:45p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the Resolutions Committee already, but <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> insisted on debating several provisions. On many planks, there was widespread agreement among <b>the</b> <b>delegates.</b> On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal or paper, should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for paper money at the time). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income tax, laws to mandate safe working conditions in factories, the regulation of interstate commerce, {{and an end to}} child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.|$|E

5000|$|In delegation, {{an object}} handles {{a request by}} delegating to a second object (<b>the</b> <b>delegate).</b> <b>The</b> <b>delegate</b> is a helper object, but with the {{original}} context. With language-level support for delegation, this is done implicitly by having [...] in <b>the</b> <b>delegate</b> refer to <b>the</b> original (sending) object, not <b>the</b> <b>delegate</b> (receiving object). In <b>the</b> <b>delegate</b> pattern, this is instead accomplished by explicitly passing the original object to <b>the</b> <b>delegate,</b> as an argument to a method. Note that [...] "delegation" [...] is often used loosely {{to refer to the}} distinct concept of forwarding, where the sending object simply uses the corresponding member on the receiving object, evaluated {{in the context of the}} receiving object, not the original object.|$|R

5|$|The {{sovereignty}} convention {{gathered at}} the William Forst House in Russellville as scheduled on November 18, 1861. Burnett also presided over this convention. Fearing {{for the safety of}} <b>the</b> <b>delegates,</b> he first proposed postponing proceedings until January 8, 1862, but Scott County's George W. Johnson convinced the majority of <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> to continue. By the third day, the military situation was so tenuous that the entire convention had to be moved to a tower on the campus of Bethel Female College, a now-defunct institution in Russellville.|$|E
5|$|When the {{convention}} concluded, Ross returned home {{and spent the}} next four years focusing on his farm. In 1880, he became an accidental candidate for Texas State Senator from the 22nd District. The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates, with neither receiving a two-thirds majority. As a compromise, one of <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> suggested the group nominate Ross. Although no one asked Ross whether he wanted to run for office, <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> elected him as their candidate. He agreed to the nomination to spare the trouble and expense of another convention.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all of <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the second day, June 23, the Committee on Permanent Organization {{announced}} the roster of officers, including the permanent president, John W. Stevenson of Kentucky. Before <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> could formally elect Stevenson, they heard the report on the Committee on Credentials. Two rival factions of Massachusetts Democrats had agreed to compromise, both being admitted as a united delegation. A similar dispute in New York was not resolved so easily: Tammany Hall and Tilden's Irving Hall had sent rival delegations as well, and neither was willing to compromise. The Committee had voted to consider the Irving Hall Democrats to have been regularly elected; Tammany was consequently excluded. Debate followed, in which some delegates urged compromise, with the idea that a united delegation would help unite the party in New York in the coming general election. The argument was unpersuasive, as <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> endorsed the Committee's decision by a vote of 457 to 205Â½; Tammany was banished. Stevenson was then installed as permanent chairman and, as the Committee on Resolutions had not finished writing the platform, <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> moved on to nominations.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Glenn was a {{candidate}} for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination.

5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the members of the Ministerium {{intended}} for this to be a permanent break, or a temporary protest.

5|$|More {{than half}} of <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> had trained as lawyers (several had even been judges), {{although}} only about a quarter had practiced law as their principal means of business. There were also merchants, manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two or three physicians, a minister, and several small farmers. Of the twenty-five who owned slaves, sixteen depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the mainstay of their income. Most of <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> were landowners with substantial holdings, and most, {{with the possible exception}} of Roger Sherman and William Few, were very comfortably wealthy. George Washington and Robert Morris were among the wealthiest men in the entire country.|$|E

30|$|Delegation of Authority {{allows a}} user (<b>the</b> delegator) to <b>delegate</b> {{any of his}} {{privileges}} to another user or application of his choice (<b>the</b> <b>delegate)</b> [15]. When role based or attribute based access controls are used, then <b>the</b> delegator may <b>delegate</b> a role or attribute instead of a privilege, since privileges are assigned to roles and attributes. This form of delegation is superior to existing grid based delegation that relies on proxy certificates [16], since i) <b>the</b> <b>delegate</b> must authenticate as himself, {{and not as a}} child of the delegator as in proxy certificates (which is a form of masquerade) and ii) fine grained delegation is automatically supported by <b>the</b> delegator <b>delegating</b> a subset of his identity attributes. Delegation in federated systems is made more difficult because the cloud SP may not have had contact with <b>the</b> <b>delegate</b> before, therefore does not know how to recognise which user is <b>the</b> chosen <b>delegate.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some {{claim that}} the FVdG {{influenced}} strikes in the arms industry as early as February or March 1918, but the organization was not re-established {{on a national level}} until December 1918. On December 14, Fritz Kater started publishing Der Syndikalist (The Syndicalist) in Berlin as a replacement for Die Einigkeit. On December 26 and 27, a conference organized by Kater and attended by 33 delegates from 43 local unions took place in Berlin. <b>The</b> <b>delegates</b> reflected upon the difficult times during the war and proudly noted that the FVdG was the only trade union which did not have to adjust its program to the new political conditions because it had remained loyal to its anti-state and internationalist principles. <b>The</b> <b>delegates</b> reaffirmed their rejection of parliamentarianism and refused to participate in the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The Definite Synodical Platform was {{not enough}} to cause the Pennsylvania Ministerium to leave the General Synod, but it was a foretaste of things to come. When the Frankean Synod, a Lutheran church body noted for its {{progressive}} politics and its utter disregard for the Lutheran Confessions, was admitted to the General Synod, the leadership of the Ministerium had seen enough. At the 1864 gathering of the General Synod, at which the Frankeans were admitted, <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> from the Ministerium left in protest. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> left before the General Synod passed a resolution affirming and strengthening their commitment to the Augsburg Confession.|$|E
5|$|The Union Greenback {{convention}} had reconvened {{at nearby}} Farwell Hall and sent an emissary to the National Greenbackers. <b>The</b> <b>delegates</b> voted {{to join the}} other faction in a special conference committee to work for reunification, then adjourned until 7:30 that evening. While {{they waited for the}} committees to finish their work, <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> listened to speeches by several prominent Greenbackers, including Denis Kearney, a California labor leader, and William Wallace, a Canadian parliamentarian and advocate for currency reform. Meanwhile, the Credentials Committee voted narrowly to admit the Union Greenbackers, as well as a delegation from the Socialist Labor Party. The Committee on Permanent Organization voted to recommend Richard F. Trevellick, a Michigan trade union organizer, as the permanent chairman of the convention. None of the reports were finished by the appointed time, so the convention adjourned again until 10:45 Thursday morning.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} Rugby World Cup {{had been}} {{suggested}} on numerous occasions {{going back to the}} 1950s, but met with opposition from most unions in the IRFB. The idea resurfaced several times in the early 1980s, with the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) in 1983, and the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) in 1984 independently proposing the establishment of a world cup. A proposal was again put to the IRFB in 1985 and this time successfully passed 10â6. <b>The</b> <b>delegates</b> from Australia, France, New Zealand and South Africa all voted for the proposal, and <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> from Ireland and Scotland against; the English and Welsh delegates were split, with one from each country for and one against.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Function {{objects are}} used to express higher-order {{features}} in objectoriented programs. C # provides <b>the</b> <b>delegate</b> construct to simplify the implementation of function objects. A delegate instance represents a method together with a target object. Sound reasoning about <b>delegates</b> requires that <b>the</b> precondition of the underlying method holds whenever a delegate is invoked. This is difficult to achieve if the method precondition depends {{on the state of}} the target object. Proving such a precondition when <b>the</b> <b>delegate</b> is invoked is in general not possible because properties of the target object are typically not known at the invocation site. Proving the precondition when <b>the</b> <b>delegate</b> is instantiated is not sufficient either because the state of the target might change before <b>the</b> <b>delegate</b> is invoked. In this paper, we present a verification methodology for C # <b>delegates.</b> Properties of <b>the</b> target object are expressed as invariant of <b>the</b> <b>delegate.</b> Our methodology keeps track when this invariant can be assumed to hold. It enables modular verification of interesting implementations and is proven sound. ...|$|R
