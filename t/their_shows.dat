5|$|A {{review of}} their {{performance}} at The Ritz in New York on January 6, 1989 highlights the good shape and musicianship of the band, but remarks that the new songs were played with considerably less enthusiasm {{than the rest of}} the show. Although the band continued to tour regularly, the songs from Imaginos had already disappeared from <b>their</b> <b>shows</b> by the end of 1989, never to be performed live again.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to London, Carte formed a new {{partnership}} with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally after the expenses of each of <b>their</b> <b>shows.</b> Meanwhile, Pinafore continued to play strongly. On 20 February 1880, Pinafore completed its initial run of 571performances. Only one other work of musical theatre in the world had ever run longer, Robert Planquette's operetta Les cloches de Corneville.|$|E
5000|$|The color guard {{team has}} been the state champions in their {{division}} {{a total of three}} times. The years were: 2011 for <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "Glitter in the Air", 2012 for <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "Titanic" [...] and 2014 for <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "Stormy Love".|$|R
50|$|Reasons for win: The {{team was}} commended for {{the style of}} their puppets and how well Clay Aiken and Lisa Lampanelli played into one another {{throughout}} <b>their</b> <b>show.</b> While <b>their</b> <b>show</b> did feature some inappropriate blue comedy material and Penn Jillette slipped out of his role (missed a couple of cues from timeline) as the host, <b>their</b> <b>show</b> was still superior.|$|R
5000|$|Their first {{competitive}} {{year was}} in 2007 with <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "The Journey Begins". Part of the Class A division, Fusion Core finished in 4th place, {{just on the}} outside of making finals for Class A. In 2008, its second competitive year, Fusion Core won second place in the Class A division of DCA with <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "Momentum", winning them numerous caption awards. In 2009, <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "Progress" [...] saw Fusion Core finishing in 5th place, just outside finals again (Class A changed the number of finalists from 3 to 4 in 2008.) Fusion Core won their first, and only, Class A title in 2010 with <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "Changing Perceptions." [...] In 2011, the corps finished in second place for the second time with <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "AfriCORE: Untamed".|$|R
5|$|For live shows, The White Stripes {{were known}} for Jack's {{employment}} of heavy distortion, {{as well as}} audio feedback and overdrive. The duo performed considerably more recklessly and unstructured live, never preparing set lists for <b>their</b> <b>shows,</b> believing that planning too closely would ruin the spontaneity of their performances.|$|E
5|$|Kelly Hogan, an {{old friend}} of Leitman's, offered to provide music for the film and soundtrack, and {{recorded}} songs with the combo, The Corn Sisters, Carolyn Mark and Neko Case. While recording, Case discovered that Ella Waldek was her great-aunt, which was previously unknown to her. After providing music for the film, they began promoting it at all of <b>their</b> <b>shows.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{bands of}} the NWOBHM {{had the same}} look as their fans and {{produced}} rock shows without special visual effects. A notable exception was Iron Maiden, which created the grisly character Eddie the Head as a stage prop to enrich their performances very early in their career. Other exceptions were Demon, Cloven Hoof and Samson, which used various props, costumes and tricks in <b>their</b> <b>shows,</b> while Pagan Altar and Venom became well known for their elaborate scenography inspired by shock rock and Satanism.|$|E
50|$|The festival {{took place}} in Tritsis Park in Ilion, Athens.Iron Maiden {{cancelled}} <b>their</b> <b>show</b> at the third day, due to Janick Gers' accident at a previous show. The Flaming Lips also cancelled <b>their</b> <b>show.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Spirit of Waxahachie Indian {{marching band}} {{is the largest}} {{organization}} on campus. For over 20 years, the band has received numerous awards both locally and around the nation.

5000|$|The Mighty Marching Rebel Band and Color Guard {{is one of}} the few {{high school}} bands in the AUHSD that has {{qualified}} for the SCSBOA championships all twelve years. In 2008, <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "Letters from Home" [...] won them 4th place. In 2009, <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "Medieval Motives" [...] won them the championships with 1st place. In 2010, <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "Sacred Ground" [...] won them 7th place. In 2011, <b>their</b> <b>show</b> [...] "Danzas del Mundo" [...] won them (again) 4th place. This Savanna band has been a 5A division band and only in the 2011-2012 season did the band moved up one division to compete against bigger bands.|$|R
5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that <b>their</b> <b>shows</b> were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E
5|$|Born in Watts, Los Angeles, to {{a middle-class}} African-American family, Sylvester {{developed}} {{a love of}} singing through the gospel choir of his Pentecostal church. Leaving the church after the congregation expressed disapproval of his homosexuality, he found friendship {{among a group of}} black cross-dressers and transgender women who called themselves The Disquotays. Moving to San Francisco in 1970 at the age of 22, Sylvester embraced the counterculture and joined the avant-garde drag troupe The Cockettes, producing solo segments of <b>their</b> <b>shows</b> which were heavily influenced by female blues and jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. During the Cockettes' critically panned tour of New York City, Sylvester left them to pursue his career elsewhere. He came to front Sylvester and his Hot Band, a rock act that released two commercially unsuccessful albums on Blue Thumb Records in 1973 before disbanding.|$|E
5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, {{thought that}} it would have been more {{profitable}} to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for <b>their</b> <b>shows</b> as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio just a couple of months before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E
50|$|Because of WGN's {{clear channel}} signal, <b>their</b> <b>show</b> has been heard {{throughout}} most of the United States and Canada, and <b>their</b> <b>show</b> (along with all of WGN's programming, except for Chicago Cubs games) has also been webcast.|$|R

5000|$|Phish {{played this}} song {{to start the}} third set of <b>their</b> <b>show</b> on 12/31/2014.

Phish also played this song to start the second set of <b>their</b> <b>show</b> on 8/4/2017.|$|R
5|$|Interest in {{the case}} did not quickly fade. The play Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn existed in various {{anonymous}} versions; it was a sensational hit throughout the mid 19th century {{and may have been}} the most performed play of the time. Victorian fairground peep shows were forced to add extra apertures for their viewers when exhibiting <b>their</b> <b>shows</b> of the murder. The plays of the Victorian era tended to portray Corder as a cold-blooded monster and Maria as the innocent whom he preyed upon; her reputation and her children by other fathers were airbrushed out, and Corder was made into an older man. Charles Dickens published an account of the murder in his magazine All the Year Round after initially rejecting it because he felt the story to be too well known and the account of the stepmother's dreams rather far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|The band {{first became}} {{involved}} with Sarajevo in 1993 on their Zoo TV Tour; approached by aid worker Bill Carter about bringing attention to the Siege of Sarajevo, the band conducted nightly satellite transmissions with Bosnians during <b>their</b> <b>shows.</b> These link-ups were the subject of criticism from journalists for mixing entertainment with human tragedy. Although the war made it impractical for U2 to visit Sarajevo at the time, they vowed to eventually play a concert in the city. After the conflict ended in November 1995, they made arrangements to visit Sarajevo, and with help from United Nations ambassadors and peacekeeping troops, they scheduled and played the concert in 1997.|$|E
5|$|With Infinity, Townsend {{began to}} label all albums outside of Strapping Young Lad {{under his own}} name, {{dropping}} the Ocean Machine moniker, to reduce confusion. He wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects, they are all simply aspects of his identity. The album Biomech was relabeled and redistributed as Ocean Machine: Biomech, under Townsend's name, to reflect the new arrangement. Townsend's bandmates began to play two sets at <b>their</b> <b>shows,</b> one as Strapping Young Lad, and one as the Devin Townsend Band, playing songs from Townsend's solo albums.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Connors {{is fired}} by the school board due to the {{violence}} associated with wrestling, after the board fails {{to make a distinction}} between what he teaches and professional wrestling (as do the town bar regulars). They also find videos of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling on his iPhone and mistake them for gay pornography. The boys are excited to learn WWE Chairman Vince McMahon has heard of their federation and will be scouting one of <b>their</b> <b>shows.</b> Mr. Connors sits in his apartment surrounded by awards for wrestling and in tears over his termination and what wrestling has become. Vengeful, he plans to sabotage the event in a personal vow to restore the integrity of the wrestling sport. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny secretly decide to relegate Butters, Jimmy and Token to smaller roles, thinking that it will give themselves a better opportunity to impress McMahon. They hold tryouts {{in the manner of a}} theater audition in order to find new talent for their show, which is now more reminiscent of musical theatre than wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Throughout their career, the Grateful Dead {{were known}} to {{tolerate}} taping of the live shows. There was a demand from fans to hear the improvisations that resulted from each show, {{and the concept of}} taping shows appealed to the band's general community ethos. They were unique among bands in that their live shows tended not to be pressed and packaged as LPs, but remained in tape form to be shared between tapers. The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product. In 1985, the Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live taping of <b>their</b> <b>shows,</b> and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality. Other bands, including Pearl Jam, Phish and the Dave Matthews Band tolerate taping in a similar manner to the Dead, provided no profit is involved. Because of the questionable legality of bootlegs, fans have sometimes simply dubbed a bootleg onto tape and freely passed it onto others.|$|E

NBC disputes that claim, claiming that Apple balked at NBC's request to package shows together and make wholesale pricing more flexible. NBC claims that they never asked to double the wholesale price and insisted that <b>their</b> <b>shows</b> would be sold by iTunes Store through early December. Other networks who sell <b>their</b> <b>shows</b> via iTunes did not follow suit. On December 1, 2007, NBC shows were pulled from iTunes Store.|$|E
