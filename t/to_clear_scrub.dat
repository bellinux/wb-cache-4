50|$|Several {{attempts}} {{had been}} made for land legislation after 1857. A Select Committee on the Sale of Crown Lands was chaired by C. H. Goode in 1965, however its report was of marginal value. Strangways introduced a bill in 1868 which was eventually passed in January 1869, despite conflict with pastoralists. There was an increasing demand for more land to be available for farmers <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> of <b>scrub</b> {{for the purpose of}} more intensive agriculture such as growing grain crops and mixed farming. The legislation provided for the creation of agricultural areas and sale of crown land on credit.The Act allowed a person to purchase up to 640 acres, with a payment of 20 per cent at the fall of the hammer at auction, and four years to pay the remainder.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1829 Commandant Patrick Logan of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement {{founded a}} {{secondary}} agricultural establishment at Eagle Farm approximately eight miles from Brisbane. One {{hundred and fifty}} men were deployed <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> the <b>scrub.</b> By January 1832 about 680 acres (272.5 hectares) were under cultivation with mostly maize and some potatoes, some cattle and pigs were also being raised. Working so near the Eagle Farm swamp caused a noticeable increase in malaria amongst the convicts, but despite calls for its abandonment, the farm was maintained. By 1836, 768 acres (307.2 hectares) had been cleared, {{but no more than}} 46 acres (16.4 hectares) were under cultivation. However the historical report by Paul Ashron and Sue Rosen suggests the area under cultivation was closer to 700 acres. Prangley in [...] "The Eagle Farm agricultural establishment" [...] was unable to be definitive on this issue, saying the amount of actual area under cultivation [...] "remains unclear".|$|R

50|$|Initially {{there were}} no sewage systems, water lines, {{telephone}} lines or electricity. The access road {{was no more than}} a dirt track which had <b>to</b> be <b>cleared</b> of <b>scrub</b> and stone. By 1969 more than half of the road was paved, but the last 1.4 km remained in poor condition until the end of the 1980s. It was not until 1994 that Bardou was connected to the French electricity grid. A telephone connection has been available since the late 1970s. However, the village still has no water supply. Drinking water is collected from natural springs in the vicinity. The waste water is collected over the year, fermented and dispersed via a sewage irrigation field. Some of the houses still do not have power and water to date. There are several outhouses on the outskirts of the village and in the centre of the village there is now a bath house with two showers and water toilets for guests.|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} management techniques {{are being used to}} maintain and bolster the reserve's benefit for wildlife.

5000|$|Farquhar, {{like most}} of the Woongarra farmers, barely made a living from maize growing. Although the soil was good and two crops per year could be obtained, the inundations of pests and disease, the expense and {{difficulties}} of transport, and the lack of a strong market, combined to erode farmers' profits. However, in the early 1880s the district was transformed following the construction of the Millaquin Sugar Refinery (1880-82) and the establishment of a viable sugar industry in the area. Small crushing or [...] "juice" [...] mills were erected on farms throughout the Woongarra, and the juice piped directly to the refinery, or if along the Burnett River, transported by punt. In the period 1882-84, 24 crushing mills were established in the Bundaberg district, most of them in the Woongarra Shire. By October 1882, when the Millaquin refinery went into production, crushing mills were operating at Ashgrove, Avoca, Fairymead, Glenmorris, Grange, Kepnock, Mabbro, Summerville, Windermere and Woodbine plantations. Seaview, Mon Repos and Sunnyside Plantations were established in 1884. Woodlands followed soon after. Sugar was embraced wholeheartedly by the Woongarra farmers, particularly when they could obtain cheap indentured labour from the South Sea Islands <b>to</b> help <b>clear</b> the <b>scrub</b> and work the cane fields.|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of cereal cultivation {{was one of}} the most important cultural processes in history, marking the transition from hunting and gathering by Mesolithic foragers to the food-producing economy of Neolithic farmers 1. In the Lower Yangtze region of China, a centre of rice domestication 2, the timing and system of initial rice cultivation remain unclear. Here we report detailed evidence from Kuahuqiao that reveals the precise cultural and environmental context of rice cultivation at this earliest known Neolithic site in eastern China, 7, 700 calibrated years before present (cal. yr bp). Pollen, algal, fungal spore and micro-charcoal data from sediments demonstrate that these Neolithic communities selected lowland swamps for their rice cultivation and settlement, using fire <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> alder-dominated wetland <b>scrub</b> and prepare the site for occupation, then to maintain wet grassland vegetation of paddy type. Regular flooding by slightly brackish water was probably controlled by 'bunding' to maintain crop yields. The site's exploitation ceased when it was overwhelmed by marine inundation 7, 550 cal. yr bp. Our results establish that rice cultivation began in coastal wetlands of eastern China, an ecosystem vulnerable to coastal change but of high fertility and productivity, attractions maximized for about two centuries by sustained high levels of cultural management of the environment...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, as Brisbane's gaol at Petrie Terrace {{became more and}} more crowded, about 30 prisoners were {{transferred}} to an old hulk, called the Proserpine, anchored near the mouth of the Brisbane River.

Following the management work, Perranzabuloe Parish Council leased the site and in 1884-85 there was further scrub clearance and the fence replaced. Rose Community Association and later Rose Men's Institute took over the management until 1995. The following year Cornwall Wildlife Trust undertook an ecological assessment and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers <b>cleared</b> <b>scrub</b> from the outer face of the banks and the ditch.

50|$|In October 1874, Doherty {{selected}} portion 21, parish of Pimpama (158 {{acres of}} second class pastoral land on Hotham Creek, on which Laurel Hill Farmhouse was later built). The block already contained some improvements, including a slab barn {{and a small}} humpy and about 12 acres of <b>scrub</b> <b>cleared</b> and partly under cultivation, for which Doherty paid £20, and was issued with a conditional lease on the property for 10 years from 1 January 1875.

50|$|According to one theory, it was {{a sudden}} change in climate, the Younger Dryas event (c. 10,800 to 9500 BC), that {{inspired}} the development of agriculture. The Younger Dryas was a 1,000-year-long interruption in the higher temperatures prevailing since the Last Glacial Maximum, which produced a sudden drought in the Levant. This would have endangered the wild cereals, which could no longer compete with dryland scrub, but upon which the population had become dependent to sustain a relatively large sedentary population. By artificially <b>clearing</b> <b>scrub</b> and planting seeds obtained from elsewhere, they began to practice agriculture. However, this theory {{of the origin of}} agriculture is controversial in the scientific community.|$|R
50|$|For {{much of its}} route the Downs Link {{follows the}} course of two {{dismantled}} railways - the Cranleigh Line and the Steyning Line - both of which closed in the 1960s {{as a result of the}} Beeching Axe. Between 1965 and 1970 the track was lifted and much of the track ballast was removed. The coppiced woodland along many of the cuttings and embankment sides remained unmanaged until 2 April 1970 when ownership of much of the track was sold by the British Railways Board to Surrey County Council and Hambleton Rural District Council (which became Waverley Borough Council in 1974) for £17,500.

50|$|In 1984, Surrey County Council {{produced}} the first management plan for Chobham Common which acknowledged invading scrub, fire and erosion {{as the main}} threats to the site.

While describing birch and pine invasion on the Common as “Possibly the most serious problem for nature conservation” the 1984 Management Plan states, “Widespread invasion control is difficult to justify financially. Intervention management will therefore {{be limited to the}} more significant open habitats and places where an acceptable level of tree cover can be maintained at low cost”.|$|R
