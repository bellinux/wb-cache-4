5|$|However, for the Kriegsmarine, Operation Cerberus {{had been}} {{operational}} success, but a strategic reverse. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>situation</b> had forced {{them into an}} operation which was in effect, a strategic withdrawal from the Atlantic. From that point onwards, the German campaign in the Atlantic was to be carried by the U-Boats, unsupported by a surface fleet. With the German ships removed from the French Atlantic ports, the British fleets could contain them much more effectively in Norway and the North Sea. Moreover, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had been damaged by mines and required extensive repairs. Prinz Eugen was torpedoed and her stern collapsed just weeks after Cerberus. All three ships were out of action for extended periods. More bad luck followed, with Gneisenau being knocked out for good in February 1942 and {{the sinking of the}} Scharnhorst in December 1943. None of the ships sailed in the Atlantic again in the intervening period, leaving the Battle of the Atlantic to be carried on by U-Boat forces.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them.

It is evident also that the Stormont {{government}} {{is no longer in}} control of the situation. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>situation</b> is the inevitable outcome of the policies pursued for decades by successive Stormont governments. It is clear also that the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse. It is obvious that the RUC is no longer accepted as an impartial police force. Neither would the employment of British troops be acceptable nor would they be likely to restore peaceful conditions, certainly not in the long term. The Irish Government have, therefore, requested the British Government to apply immediately to the United Nations for the urgent dispatch of a Peace-Keeping Force to the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and have instructed the Permanent Representative to the United Nations to inform the Secretary General of this request. We have also asked the British Government {{to see to it that}} police attacks on the people of Derry should cease immediately.|$|E

25|$|Later on 11 June de Gaulle {{attended}} {{the meeting of}} the Anglo-French Supreme War Council at the Chateau du Muguet at Briare. The British were represented by Churchill, Anthony Eden, John Dill, General Ismay and Edward Spears, and the French by Reynaud, Pétain, Weygand and Georges. Churchill demanded that the French take to guerrilla warfare, and reminded Pétain of how he had {{come to the aid of}} the British with forty divisions in March 1918, receiving a dusty answer in each case. De Gaulle's fighting spirit made a strong impression on the British. At the meeting de Gaulle met Pétain for the first time in two years. Pétain noted his recent promotion to general, adding that he did not congratulate him, as ranks were of no use in defeat. When de Gaulle protested that Pétain himself had been promoted to brigadier-general and division commander at the Battle of the Marne in 1914, he replied that there was “no comparison” with <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>situation.</b> De Gaulle later conceded that Pétain was right about that much at least. De Gaulle missed the second day of the conference as he was in Rennes for a meeting (not mentioned in his memoirs) to discuss the plans for the Breton redoubt with General René Altmayer. He then returned to attend a Cabinet meeting, at which it was clear that there was a growing movement for an armistice, and which decided that the government should move to Bordeaux rather than de Gaulle’s preference for Quimper in Brittany.|$|E
500|$|Foliot then {{proceeded}} to Rome, but at Milan he received word that his envoy at the papal court had secured the right {{for him to be}} absolved by Rotrou, Archbishop of Rouen. Foliot then returned to Rouen, where he was absolved on 5April and reinstated in his see on 1May. The only requirement of this absolution was that Foliot accept a penance to be imposed by the pope. Much of Foliot's objections to Becket's excommunication stemmed from the lack of warning that Foliot and the others had received, contrary to the customary and normal procedures. Becket and his supporters pointed out that there were some situations in which it was possible to excommunicate without warning, but Foliot claimed that <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>situation</b> was not one of them. According to Foliot, Becket's habit was [...] "to condemn first, judge second". Foliot's example of appealing excommunications to the papacy was an important step in the setting up of an appeal process for excommunication during the 12th century.|$|E

[...] However, they are unaware she was originally a mole for the Russian MIND MGMT counterpart known as Zero. When Lyme and Duncan try to activate her, they also awaken her Zero training and Megan begins to orchestrate the selfdestruction of her subdivision through subterfuge. As the groups prepare to recruit Megan for their various agendas, Lyme, Eraser, and Meru reflect {{on how they}} arrived at their present position. Lyme regrets his multiple manipulations of Meru, and is currently on a mission of atonement. Meru is still adjusting to her recently awakened memories of her own training as a MIND MGMT agent. The Eraser dreams of her dead husband, a former MIND MGMT agent, and the night she was framed for his murder. As the Homemaker's plan climaxes in a massacre, Eraser, Lyme, and Meru all arrive at the same time.

The talisman that Mina gave Soma is able to slow the transformation, {{enabling}} Arikado to arrive in time to inform Soma that the [...] "Mina" [...] that Celia killed was a doppelgänger. This aborts the transformation, but a soul exits Soma and enters the doppelgänger, which takes on the appearance of Dmitrii. Dmitrii states that when Soma defeated him he {{allowed himself to be}} absorbed, wishing to use his powers to copy Soma's ability of dominance over the souls of Dracula's minions. [...] He then leaves with Celia to absorb the souls of many powerful demons and monsters in an attempt to increase his power. Soma and Arikado chase after the two, and find them in the castle's basement. Dmitrii, using Celia as a sacrifice, seals Arikado's powers, and engages Soma. However, his soul is unable to bear the strain of controlling the demons he has absorbed, and they erupt out of him, combining into one gargantuan creature called Menace. Soma manages to defeat it, but the souls that composed the demon begin to fall under Soma's dominance. He becomes overwhelmed and rejects them, fleeing from the castle with Arikado. Soma is conflicted over <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>situation,</b> as he believes that it was his responsibility to become the dark lord and that the events of the game were a result of him not accepting this responsibility, but Arikado convinces him that his fate is not fixed.
