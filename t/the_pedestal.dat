5|$|A tablet {{placed by}} the New York {{committee}} commemorates the fundraising done to build <b>the</b> <b>pedestal.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{the choice}} of statues settled, a {{competition}} was run in Adelaide in 1903 to find the design for <b>the</b> <b>pedestal.</b> A total of 12 entries were received, with the submission by Garlick, Sibley and Wooldridge being selected as the winner. <b>The</b> <b>pedestal</b> is 12feet in height, and was constructed from granite quarried from {{the nearby town of}} Murray Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, the Parliamentary {{authorities}} undertook a three-week conservation project to repair and restore the statue. It consisted of removing accumulated dirt and an old coating of black wax, repatinating the bronze surface to return it to its original colour and treating it with a clear wax as protection from pollution and the elements. The bas reliefs on <b>the</b> <b>pedestal</b> were also cleaned and treated, as was <b>the</b> <b>pedestal</b> itself.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of <b>the</b> <b>pedestal</b> or statue, showing off various details. Access to <b>the</b> <b>pedestal,</b> which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of <b>the</b> <b>pedestal.</b> An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E
5|$|It {{stands on}} a granite {{pedestal}} also designed by Marochetti and made by Freeman & Co. of Penryn, Cornwall. Bas-relief panels showing Crusaders fighting the Saracens at the Battle of Ascalon and Richard on his deathbed pardoning Bertran de Born, the archer who fatally shot him in 1199, {{were added to the}} east and west sides of <b>the</b> <b>pedestal</b> in 1866–67. As the statue cannot be accessed by the general public – the area around it is used as the House of Lords car park – the west-side scene showing Richard and Bertran is the only one visible from the street. According to Marochetti, the two bas-reliefs were designed in the style of Lorenzo Ghiberti's doors at the Florence Baptistry. Bronze letters on the front of <b>the</b> <b>pedestal</b> bear the inscription RICHARD I CŒUR DE LION / 1189–1199.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, <b>the</b> <b>pedestal</b> was not {{completed}} until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of <b>the</b> <b>pedestal,</b> {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>pedestal's</b> east {{face has}} four quotes by {{different}} individuals. These are: ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The south {{face of the}} Quilinen calvary. Various apostles {{stand around}} <b>the</b> <b>pedestal's</b> platform.|$|R
25|$|The latter {{three options}} {{required}} dismounting the sculptures, repairing them, repairing <b>the</b> <b>pedestals,</b> and then remounting the statues.|$|R
5|$|Even {{with these}} efforts, {{fundraising}} lagged. Grover Cleveland, {{the governor of}} New York, vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884. An attempt the next year to have Congress provide $100,000, sufficient to complete the project, also failed. The New York committee, with only $3,000 in the bank, suspended work on <b>the</b> <b>pedestal.</b> With the project in jeopardy, groups from other American cities, including Boston and Philadelphia, offered to pay {{the full cost of}} erecting the statue in return for relocating it.|$|E
5|$|For five days, on December 16–20, 1911, the University {{celebrated its}} 300th Anniversary. The main {{features}} of the celebration included: a Solemn High Mass {{in honor of the}} founder of the University, Miguel de Benavides; the unveiling of the commemorative plaque for the festivities; the unveiling of a plaque placed at <b>the</b> <b>pedestal</b> of the statue of Benavides in the College site in Intramuros; the laying of the foundation stone for the future building at University in Sampaloc; and a big banquet.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt {{ordered the}} statue to be {{transferred}} to the National Park Service (NPS). In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island. With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear. The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced. Rusted cast-iron steps in <b>the</b> <b>pedestal</b> were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into <b>the</b> <b>pedestal.</b> The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, on February 20, 1950, the CFA began reconsidering {{the height}} of <b>the</b> statues' <b>pedestals.</b> <b>The</b> {{previously}} approved <b>pedestals</b> were deemed to be too low, and the CFA considered raising them to [...] The Park Service made life-size silhouettes of the statues, and the CFA made a site visit to the plaza {{on the east side}} of the Lincoln Memorial to view the mock-ups. After viewing the silhouettes, the CFA agreed not to make any changes to the pedestals' height. The commission did, however, begin to discuss what inscriptions might be made on <b>the</b> <b>pedestals.</b>|$|R

During the fierce attacks that dogged the convoy, Ledbury claimed three enemy {{aircraft}} destroyed and five damaged, {{and was one of}} three destroyers that helped the crippled oil tanker Ohio into the Grand Harbour. She added to her battle honours with the Allied landings in Sicily, Salerno, and operations in the Adriatic and Aegean. The Royal Navy finally scrapped Ledbury in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The central figure's {{mouth is}} {{positioned}} directly on its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth {{as if in a}} snarl, and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ. This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating from the base of <b>the</b> <b>pedestal.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pedestal,</b> which {{contains}} badges from every {{winner of the}} competition, is made of hardwood plywood.

50|$|The Oliver P. Morton {{memorial}} {{is composed}} of three bronze statues and two bronze reliefs, one plaque on the front, and two plaques on the rear, also of bronze. <b>The</b> <b>pedestals</b> on which <b>the</b> statues stand are made of granite. Oliver Perry Morton stands positioned in the center, raised above the other two figures by a full figure's height. Two Union soldiers flank either side of Morton. The soldiers on the proper left is uniformed and holding a bayonet. The soldier on the proper right is holding a rifle and wearing a sword on his left; this figure is uniformed as well. Below the figures {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>pedestals</b> are two flags crossed with olive branches, and there is an oak wreath of leaves and acorns in the center.The reliefs are located on the sides of <b>the</b> soldiers' <b>pedestals.</b> <b>The</b> relief that faces south depicts Oliver P. Morton giving a speech. The relief that faces north shows him standing in an infirmary tent.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the money}} was duly raised and the bronze cast of the statue was finally {{completed}} in 1856, a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years. The original idea had been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition. This prompted opposition, as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry's newly completed Palace of Westminster. Various other locations to display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached {{that it would be}} placed in Old Palace Yard, Marochetti's preferred location. It was installed in October 1860, though it was not until March 1867 that it was finally completed with the addition of bronze bas-reliefs on either side of <b>the</b> <b>pedestal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bartholdi was {{inspired}} by a French law professor and politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples. Because of the post-war instability in France, work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build <b>the</b> <b>pedestal.</b> Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.|$|E
5|$|Erected as a {{permanent}} memorial to the men of Oldham {{who were killed in}} the First World War, Oldham's war memorial consists of a granite base surmounted by a bronze sculpture depicting five soldiers making their way along the trenches in order to go into battle. The main standing figure, having climbed out of the trenches, is shown calling on his comrades to advance, and is the same figure used at the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in London and the 41st Division memorial at Flers in France. The base serves to house books containing the roll of honour of the 1st, 10th and 24th Battalions, Manchester Regiment. <b>The</b> <b>pedestal</b> has two bronze doors at either side.|$|E
50|$|The {{sculpture}} was vandalized in the 1980s. The figure's hands, the quill, and <b>the</b> <b>pedestal's</b> bronze plaque {{were all}} stolen. In 1991, {{after years of}} fundraising, art conservators cleaned the statue and replaced its missing parts.|$|R
50|$|A staged plan {{agreed in}} March 2003 by the Prussia Columns Working Group envisaged the {{following}} steps: First <b>the</b> <b>pedestals</b> of <b>the</b> two monuments should {{be returned to}} their rightful place, then the column drums and finally the statues by 2010. Because parts of <b>the</b> <b>pedestals</b> were and are still dotted randomly around the site of the monument in Neukamp (as at January 2007). The idea behind this phased plan was and is that a beginning must be made more visible to attract sponsors and increase donations. In seeking sponsors for this project, the President of the County Council even wrote, for example, to the royal houses of Denmark and Sweden.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} {{is made in}} cast {{bronze and}} depicts two figures: one is Stephanie, a nude female, {{and the other is}} Spy, a horse. Each figure stands on its own <b>pedestal</b> and <b>the</b> <b>pedestals</b> are placed next to each other so the figures stand side by side, about two feet apart. Spy stands to the proper right of Stephanie. Both figures are looking forward. Spy's feet stand straight and parallel to each other, except for the proper left hoof which is placed slightly back from the plane of the proper right foot. Stephanie stands straight with her arms at her sides slightly lifted away from her hips. The front of each of <b>the</b> <b>pedestals</b> are aligned despite the difference in the length of <b>the</b> sculpture and <b>pedestal</b> between <b>the</b> two figures.|$|R
5|$|In December 1878, the University Rector {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} erecting a monument with a statue of the founder in the Plaza de Santo Tomás in Intramuros. The Benavides Monument was made in Paris in 1889 through funds collected by the faculty, students {{and friends of the}} university. It was inaugurated on July 2, 1891– opening of the school year. The monument is a bronze figure of Benavides on a pedestal facing the old campus in Intramuros. The base of the statue has the name of the sculptor and year of the make: Tony Noël, 1889. <b>The</b> <b>pedestal</b> was decorated with the seals of the Dominican Order and the university, as well as plaques on which were written the history of UST and a brief biography of the archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti {{accepted}} {{the commission and}} created plaster models of the reliefs. He installed one of the models in his château in France, where it remains today, while the other was set into {{the wall of a}} gardener's cottage adjoining his French estate. The bronze relief of the deathbed scene was added to <b>the</b> <b>pedestal</b> in August 1866, while the Taking of Ascalon was installed in March 1867. The Art Journal criticised the deathbed scene as being excessively stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in the Houses of Parliament, created by John Cross, that depicted the same subject.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the statue's {{workmanship}} caused problems during its first half-century; the horse's tail fell off the day after it was installed at the Great Exhibition, and forty years after its installation it was discovered to be riddled with holes and to have never been properly attached to its pedestal. It narrowly escaped destruction during the Second World War when a German bomb dropped during the Blitz landed a few metres away and peppered it with shrapnel. <b>The</b> <b>pedestal</b> and the horse's tail were damaged and Richard's sword was bent by the blast. In 2009, the Parliamentary authorities undertook a project to conserve and restore the statue.|$|E
2500|$|By October 1933, the CFA {{had also}} {{resolved}} other aesthetic issues regarding the statues. In addition to approving {{the height of}} the statues (each would be [...] tall), it set the height of <b>the</b> <b>pedestals</b> at [...] and {{the height of the}} plinth beneath the statues at [...] Granite from Mount Airy, North Carolina, would be used for <b>the</b> plinths and <b>pedestals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The cornice is an {{elaborate}} {{element of the}} facade considering {{the size of the}} building. It has large brackets and ornamented dentils. Above the cornice is a parapet with a central triangular pediment. At the ends of <b>the</b> parapet are <b>pedestals</b> and an open Italianate balustrade runs between these and the pediment. Three large cast cement urns crown <b>the</b> <b>pedestals</b> and <b>the</b> pediment.|$|R
