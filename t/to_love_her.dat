500|$|In the {{original}} animated film, the Beast does little singing {{apart from a}} brief solo during [...] "Something There" [...] because Menken and Ashman {{had not been able}} to agree upon a suitable moment within the film during which the Beast could have performed his own song. However, Menken considered it imperative that the character sing a solo in both the stage and live-action adaptations because he believes the Beast is actually the story's protagonist [...] "whose life has changed in the most dramatic way." [...] In the stage production, the Beast performs the ballad [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] after he frightens Belle away from the castle, wondering if he will ever be able to love anyone since he struggles <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>her.</b> Menken and Condon had deliberated whether or not the song should be re-used in the remake; despite Menken's strong attachment to [...] "If I Can't Love Her", the musical number was ultimately omitted because it had been written specifically to conclude the first act of a Broadway musical. Screenwriter Stephen Chbosky had originally suggested that the character receive a new song to perform some time after he has saved Belle from the wolves. Due to the remake's three-act structure, Menken and Condon concluded that it would be best to replace [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with a song that better depicts the Beast's feelings for Belle after he has finally learned <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>her</b> and realizes she is no longer his prisoner, while accepting the grimm reality that releasing her would ultimately decrease his chances of becoming human again. Rice, who co-wrote [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with Menken, further convinced the composer to substitute [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with a more appropriate song, joking, [...] "it would be like writing 'Don't Cry for Me Brazil'," [...] referring to [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina", a song he famously wrote for the stage musical Evita.|$|E
