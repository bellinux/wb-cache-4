5|$|After the World Cup, Taylor was disheartened by {{both her}} own, and England's, lack of success. She bemoaned that the sacrifices {{she had made}} had come to nothing, and after talking to psychologists, she {{realised}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to readdress her work–life balance. An amateur violinist, she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E

Chandler, who, although appeared happy to see Dimitri, was nonetheless jealous {{of the fact that}} Dimitri, and not him, would be overseeing Chandler Media.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet's ships, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Cöln was among the ships interned. On the voyage there, her captain radioed the fleet commander that one of the ship's steam turbines had a leaking condenser. Reuter dispatched another light cruiser to remain with the ship in the event <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to be towed. Despite the problematic turbine, Cöln managed to steam into port, the last ship in the German line.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Madonna was {{shooting}} for her third motion picture Who's That Girl, {{known at the}} time as Slammer. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had written and produced her third studio album True Blue in 1986. Madonna explained to them <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday as Leonard developed the chorus of the song. He handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of the song.|$|E
5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E
5|$|The odd {{relationship}} between Stratus and James continued into 2006, {{with the two}} Divas competing {{against each other in}} a title match at New Year's Revolution, where Stratus emerged victorious. Despite the defeat, James continued to be enamored of Stratus which made her feel uncomfortable, and on March 6, Stratus confronted James, telling her <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> space. The duo briefly reconciled on the March 18 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, teaming together to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria; however, after the match, James turned on Stratus and attacked her. A match at WrestleMania 22 saw Stratus lose the Women's Championship to James, ending her 448-day reign. The match, at the time, was widely {{recognized as one of the}} best women's matches in the company. During a rematch at Backlash, Stratus suffered a legitimate dislocated shoulder after taking a bump to the outside of the ring. While she was rehabilitating for six weeks, she continued to appear on-screen.|$|E

5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the castor beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E

Before murdering Alleen, Schmid told Saunders to rape her, but he couldn't do it, because Saunders was gay. While the murder occurred, Mary French {{was waiting in the}} car and {{listening}} to the radio. Afterwards the three buried her. When Alleen went missing, her father told her mother he felt she had been murdered and left in the desert. The mother, Norma Rowe, went to the police and was told <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> more evidence before they could go looking in the desert.|$|E
25|$|After the pilgrimage, Sarada Devi {{lived alone}} in Kamarpukur, the village where Ramakrishna was born. There, she endured poverty, verging on {{starvation}} for a year. In 1888, {{when the news}} reached the lay and monastic disciples of Ramakrishna <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> their care and attention, they invited her to Calcutta and arranged for her stay. Swami Saradananda built a permanent house for Sarada Devi in Calcutta. The house was named the Udbodhan House, after the Bengali monthly magazine published by the Ramakrishna Math. The house, also known as Mayerbati ("Holy Mother's House"), is where she spent the longest period of her life outside Jayrambati.|$|E
25|$|Cassatt {{saw that}} works by female artists were often {{dismissed}} with contempt unless {{the artist had}} a friend or protector on the jury, {{and she would not}} flirt with jurors to curry favor. Her cynicism grew when one of the two pictures she submitted in 1875 was refused by the jury, only to be accepted the following year after she darkened the background. She had quarrels with Sartain, who thought Cassatt too outspoken and self-centered, and eventually they parted. Out of her distress and self-criticism, Cassatt decided <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to move away from genre paintings and onto more fashionable subjects, in order to attract portrait commissions from American socialites abroad, but that attempt bore little fruit at first.|$|E

25|$|Patti's last marriage, in 1899, was to Baron Rolf Cederström (1870–1947), a priggish, but handsome, Swedish aristocrat {{many years}} her junior. The Baron {{severely}} curtailed Patti's social life. He cut down her domestic staff from 40 to 18, but {{gave her the}} devotion and flattery <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed,</b> becoming her sole legatee. After her death, he married a much younger woman. Their only daughter, Brita Yvonne Cederström (born 1924), ended up as Patti's sole heir. Patti had no children, but was close to her nieces and nephews. The two-time Tony Award-winning Broadway actress and singer Patti LuPone is a great-grand niece and namesake. Drummer Scott Devours is her 3rd great nephew. The Welsh opera singer Lisa Lee Dark is her 4th great-grand niece through her marriage to the French tenor Ernesto Nicolini.|$|E
25|$|Isabella II succeeded {{her father}} {{when he died in}} 1833. She was only three years old and Maria Cristina, her mother, served as regent. Maria knew <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> the support of the liberals to oppose Don Carlos so she granted a {{constitution}} in 1834. Don Carlos found his greatest support in Catalonia and the Basques country because the constitution centralized the provinces thus denying them the autonomy they sought. He was defeated and fled the country in 1839. Isabella was declared of age in 1843 and she married her cousin Francisco de Asis, the son of her father's brother, on 10 October 1846. A military revolution broke out against Isabella in 1868 and she was deposed on 29 September. She abdicated in favor of her son, Alfonso, in 1870, but Spain was proclaimed a republic for a brief time.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Schultz stated that {{a series of}} events changed his {{political}} views from the right of the political spectrum to left of the spectrum. One event was his mother's battle with Alzheimer's Disease, which began a long, slow decline of her mental health. Schultz found it frustrating trying to get her the services <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed.</b> Another was that he met a psychiatric nurse named Wendy who ran a homeless shelter in Fargo, North Dakota. He attributed much of his political change to her. Although he had criticized the homeless on his show, he said in his book that she helped to humanize them and he reportedly found that some of the people he had insulted were veterans, unable to get the psychiatric or medical services that might help them. He says that was the moment he began to look at poverty differently.|$|E
