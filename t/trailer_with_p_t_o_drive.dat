40|$|Quarkonium {{production}} {{at a given}} large <b>p</b> <b>T</b> is dominated by parton fragmentation: a parton which is produced <b>with</b> transverse momentum <b>p</b> <b>T</b> =z fragments into a quarkonium state which carries a fraction z of the parton momentum. Since parton production cross sections fall steeply <b>with</b> <b>p</b> <b>T,</b> high z fragmentation is favored. However, quantum number constraints may require the emission of gluons in the fragmentation process, and this softens the z dependence of the fragmentation function. We discuss the possibility that higher-order processes may enhance the large z part of fragmentation functions and thus contribute significantly to the quarkonium cross section. An explicit calculation of light quark fragmentation into j c shows that the higher-order process q ! qj c in fact dominates the lowest-order process q ! qgj c. 1.

40|$|Measurements of the dierential cross {{sections}} for multijet scenarios in proton-proton collisions {{are presented as}} a function of the transverse momentum <b>p</b> <b>T</b> and pseudorapi- dity, together with the correlations in azimuthal angle and the <b>p</b> <b>T</b> balance among the jets. Two dierent scenarios are separately studied; in the rst one an exclusive four-jet nal state is selected in j j 50 GeV each, together with two jets of <b>p</b> <b>T</b> > 20 GeV each. No other jets <b>with</b> <b>p</b> <b>T</b> > 20 GeV are allowed in the selected events. In the second one at least four jets <b>with</b> <b>p</b> <b>T</b> > 20 GeV are required: two of the four selected jets are asked to be originated by a b-quark in j j < 2. 4, while no requests on the avour of the other two jets, which are selected within j j < 4. 7 are applied. The data sample was collected in 2010 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, with an integrated luminosity of 36 pb- 1. The total cross section is measured to be (pp ! 4 j+X) = 330 5 (stat.) 45 (syst.) and (pp ! 2 b+ 2 j+X) = 67 : 2 2 : 2 (stat.) 22 : 5 (syst.) for, respectively, the two selected multijet scenarios. It is found that xed-order matrix element calculations including parton showers describe the measured dierential {{cross sections}} in some regions of phase space only, and that adding contributions from double parton scattering brings the Monte Carlo predictions closer to the data. A new method of extraction of double parton scattering contributions from an experimental measurement is introduced for the rst time: it is applied to W+dijet measurements and to both multijet channels. Values of eff are measured to be 19. 0 + 4 : 6 mb and 23. 2 + 3 : 3 mb for the two examined selections. These values are consistent between each other and compatible with measurements based on dierent physics channels at 7 TeV...|$|R
