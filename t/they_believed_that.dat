5|$|The Republicans {{had formed}} a number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in {{gratitude}} for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic {{about the idea of}} African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E
5|$|Alchemists {{thought of}} mercury as the First Matter {{from which all}} metals were formed. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{different}} metals could be produced by varying {{the quality and quantity}} of sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.|$|E
5|$|During the {{two weeks}} leading up to the Grand Prix, Räikkönen and Felipe Massa {{released}} statements to the press saying <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> everything would be different in Canada because of the very different conditions—as shown at Paul Ricard. Fernando Alonso believed McLaren had momentum from their win in Monaco, and Martin Whitmarsh said that they were realistic about dominating the race.|$|E
5000|$|Jehovah's Witnesses <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> sin is inherited, like a disease, and {{has been}} passed on from {{generation}} to generation of humans, beginning with Adam and Eve, whom Witnesses believe are real historical characters. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it began with the Devil, and then with humans wanting to decide for themselves what was [...] "Good and Bad." [...] <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> at that very moment they lost perfection and began to die. Jehovah's Witnesses consider human beings to be souls, and so when a human dies due to sin, <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> his soul dies as well. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jesus is the only human ever to have lived and died sinless.|$|R

5|$|In the Central Asian-Turkic myths, Jupiter {{is called}} Erendiz or Erentüz, from eren (of {{uncertain}} meaning) and yultuz ("star"). There are many {{theories about the}} meaning of eren. These peoples calculated the period of the orbit of Jupiter as 11 years and 300 days. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> some social and natural events connected to Erentüz's movements on the sky.|$|E
5|$|Superstition in the {{northeast}} (Maine and New Brunswick) relates how woodsmen would not harm gorbeys as <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> whatever they inflicted on the bird would be done to them. A folk tale circulated {{about a man who}} plucked a gorbey of its feathers and later woke up the next morning having lost all his hair. Although the story was widespread in the early to mid-20th century, it {{does not appear to have}} been extant in 1902.|$|E
5|$|The Clark Field Rescue Coordinating Center {{declared}} the aircraft missing {{the morning of}} 16 March 1962. Navy officials reported that <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the aircraft had crashed closer to Guam than the Philippines. At {{the time of the}} disappearance, the weather was clear and the sea calm. The Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marines ordered aircraft and ships to the area.|$|E
5000|$|Jehovah's Witnesses {{emphasize}} use of {{the name}} Jehovah - a representation of God's name based on the Tetragrammaton. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jehovah is the only true God, the creator of all things, and the [...] "Universal Sovereign". <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> all worship should be directed toward him, {{and that he is}} not part of a Trinity; consequently, the group places more emphasis on God than on Christ. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Holy Spirit is God's applied power or [...] "active force", rather than a person.|$|R

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> sinking or capturing the trawlers would force the British to spread themselves thin to defend the fishing fleet and might result in some useful auxiliary ships for the Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E
5|$|Arana's support {{began to}} be {{solicited}} by the landed elite, who felt threatened by Arévalo's reforms. Arana, who was not initially inclined {{to get involved with}} politics, began to make occasional statements against the government. In the 1948 parliamentary election, he backed a number of opposition candidates, all of whom were defeated. By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana, while a small fragment of the Popular Liberation Front split off to support him. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> only a military officer could defeat Arana.|$|E
5000|$|Secularists {{from the}} Mouvement laïque québécois because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> ethics and {{religious}} culture {{should not be}} taught within a single course also, <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> teaching both of these subjects together induce people {{to think that it}} is not possible to behave ethically without any religious belief ...|$|R
50|$|Some localists {{are against}} {{political}} intervention and peace keeping measures. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> communities should find solutions {{to their own}} problems and in their own time, in whatever fashion <b>they</b> decide. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> all societies are capable of achieving long term peace once {{given the opportunity to}} do so.|$|R

"Do not confuse it," [...] {{replied the}} constable, [...] "with those chance {{dynamite}} outbreaks from Russia or from Ireland, which {{are really the}} outbreaks of oppressed, if mistaken, men. This is a vast philosophic movement, consisting of an outer and an inner ring. You might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood. I prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section, the inner ring the supremely guilty section. The outer ring--the main mass of their supporters--are merely anarchists; that is, men who <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> all the evil results of human crime are {{the results of the}} system that has called it crime. <b>They</b> do not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the crime creates the punishment. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the punishment has created the crime. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good. These I call the innocent section." ...|$|R
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E
5|$|During the Song Dynasty, Beiyue Temple {{was used}} as an {{alternate}} site to make sacrifices to the Northern Peak, Mount Heng, one of the sacred mountains of Daoism. During this time, Mount Heng was controlled by the Liao Dynasty (916-1125). In order to maintain political legitimacy and receive Daoist support, Beiyue Temple was chosen by the Song Emperor as the location to make sacrifices to Hengshan. Even though the mountain was not controlled by the Song, <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> a 'geomantic vein' that would direct their sacrifices could be cut through enemy-controlled territory and reach it.|$|E
5|$|Essad Pasha Toptani, as {{minister}} {{of war and}} interior, was against a peaceful solution of the problem. He opposed the International Commission of Control which believed that the problem could be solved by diplomatic means. The Prince and his cabinet accepted Essad Pasha's proposals for a military solution. Several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the (predominantly Muslim) population of central Albania. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the new regime was a tool of the (Christian) Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the arable land. On the basis of those beliefs they revolted.|$|E
50|$|Children {{believe what}} we tell them. They have {{complete}} faith in us. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a rose plucked from a garden can plunge a family into conflict. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{the hands of}} a human beast will smoke when he slays a victim, and that this will cause him shame when a young maiden takes up residence in his home. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> a thousand other simple things.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding whether non-Witnesses will be [...] "saved", <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jesus has the {{responsibility}} of judging such ones, and that no human can judge for themselves who will be saved. Based on their interpretation of Acts 24:15, <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> {{there will be a}} resurrection of righteous and unrighteous people. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> non-Witnesses alive now may attain salvation if they [...] "begin to serve God".|$|R
25|$|The Ojibwe crafted the dreamcatcher. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{if one is}} {{hung above}} {{the head of a}} sleeper, it will catch and trap bad dreams, {{preventing}} them from reaching the dreamer. Traditional Ojibwe use dreamcatchers only for children, as <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> adults should be able to interpret their dreams, good or bad, and use them in their lives.|$|R
5|$|In 1904, the Brazilian Navy {{found itself}} well behind its Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships {{had been ordered}} {{since the fall of}} the Brazilian monarchy in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just {{concluded}} a fifteen-year naval arms race which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in the Brazilian government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> building a strong navy would play an essential role in remaking the country into an international power.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Miralles {{and others}} {{reviewed}} the taxon maculata {{and concluded that}} the animal now known as Trachylepis maculata also belongs in the African clade, but they were unable {{to determine whether or not}} it is indigenous to Guyana. They also reviewed Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata and replaced it with Trachylepis tschudii because the older name was preoccupied by Linnaeus's and Gray's punctata. Although they were unable to resolve the identity of T.tschudii, which is still known from a single specimen, <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> it is most likely the same species as the Noronha skink; it may be either a representative of an undiscovered Amazonian population of the latter or simply a mislabeled animal from Fernando de Noronha.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the 2000 United States Census, city {{officials}} made a push to get residents to respond {{and participate in the}} enumeration, citing calculations by city officials that as many as 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates from the Census Bureau, which resulted in the loss of government aid and political representation. It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms because <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the information could be used to justify their deportation.|$|E
50|$|Freemen {{often will}} not accept legal representation; <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{to do so would}} mean {{contracting}} with the state. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the United Kingdom and Canada are now operating in bankruptcy and are therefore under admiralty law. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> since the abolition of the gold standard, UK currency is backed not by gold but by the people (or the legal fiction of their persons). They describe persons as creditors of the UK corporation. Therefore, a court is a place of business, and a summons is an invitation to discuss the matter at hand, with no powers to require attendance or compliance. <b>They</b> may <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the government controls secret bank accounts in their name as part of this theory, which may be accessed to pay off debts.|$|R

5|$|Michelle Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, {{also known}} as the omnibus autism {{proceeding}} (OAP), was a court case involving the family of Michelle Cedillo, an autistic girl whose parents sued the United States government because <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> her autism was caused by her receipt of both the measles-mumps-and-rubella vaccine ({{also known as}} the MMR vaccine) and thimerosal-containing vaccines. The omnibus proceeding required the petitioners to present three test cases for each proposed mechanism by which vaccines had, according to them, caused their children's autism; Michelle was the first such case for the MMR-and-thimerosal hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, the Kentucky House {{achieved}} a quorum, and the Senate did so the following day. Having lost {{the battle against}} the special session, Laffoon proposed a primary with a run-off if no candidate received a majority on the first ballot. Some, including Chandler, believed this action was aimed against former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham, who Laffoon believed would challenge Rhea for the Democratic nomination. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> a double primary {{would be too much}} for the aging Beckham to endure. Supporters of a single primary found they did not have the votes in the legislature to pass it, so they agreed to a double primary, which Laffoon signed into law on February 27, 1935.|$|E
5|$|Paraná invited several liberals to {{join the}} {{conservative}} ranks and {{went so far as}} to name some as ministers. The new cabinet, although highly successful, was plagued from the start by strong opposition from ultraconservative members of the Conservative Party who repudiated the new liberal recruits. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the cabinet had become a political machine infested with converted liberals who did not genuinely share the party's ideals and were primarily interested in gaining public offices. Despite this mistrust, Paraná showed resilience in fending off threats and overcoming obstacles and setbacks. However, in September 1856, at the height of his career, he died unexpectedly, although the cabinet survived him until May 1857.|$|E
