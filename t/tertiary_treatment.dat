40|$|The use of treated {{wastewater}} {{to irrigate}} the sugar beet (Beta Vulgaris L. var. saccharifera) for bioethanol {{could play a}} strategic role to contrast the use of natural water resources and increase the productivity of the crop. The 2 -year experiment (2013 - 2014) was performed on sugar beet irrigated with fresh water and wastewater at different steps of the reclamation process (secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>treatments).</b> The data obtained showed that the root sugar beet yield and ethanol production under fresh water treatment (52. 2 Mg ha – 1 and 5446 L ha – 1) were lower respect to that obtained from the secondary and <b>tertiary</b> wastewater <b>treatments</b> (66. 7 Mg ha – 1 and 6785 L ha – 1, and 58. 7 Mg h – 1 and 6164 L ha – 1, respectively), with the same irrigation volumes. These results can depend on the higher quantity of nutrient uptake when wastewater is used for irrigation. In particular, the average N applied (as nitrate and ammonium) with irrigation during the growing seasons (2013 and 2014) was corresponding to the supply of 4, 28 and 20 kg ha – 1, for the fresh water, secondary, and <b>tertiary</b> wastewater <b>treatments,</b> respectively...|$|R

25|$|Membrane {{filters are}} widely used for {{filtering}} both drinking water and sewage. For drinking water, membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2μm—including giardia and cryptosporidium. Membrane filters are an effective form of <b>tertiary</b> <b>treatment</b> when it is desired to reuse the water for industry, for limited domestic purposes, or before discharging the water into a river {{that is used by}} towns further downstream. They {{are widely used}} in industry, particularly for beverage preparation (including bottled water).

25|$|Effluent {{from the}} {{pulp and paper}} {{industry}} is generally high in suspended solids and BOD. Plants that bleach wood pulp for paper making may generate chloroform, dioxins (including 2,3,7,8-TCDD), furans, phenols and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Stand-alone paper mills using imported pulp may only require simple primary treatment, such as sedimentation or dissolved air flotation. Increased BOD or COD loadings, as well as organic pollutants, may require biological treatment such as activated sludge or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. For mills with high inorganic loadings like salt, <b>tertiary</b> <b>treatments</b> may be required, either general membrane treatments like ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis or treatments to remove specific contaminants, such as nutrients.|$|R

25|$|Discharges {{from the}} Darton sewage {{treatment}} works contained residues from dyes {{used by a}} local carpet manufacturer, which reached the works by a foul sewer, but could not be adequately treated by the existing processes. As a result, the final effluent was a deep red colour, and was {{a major factor in}} the poor biochemical oxygen demand ratings for the river. Major improvements, including new primary settlement tanks and <b>tertiary</b> <b>treatment</b> lagoons, were made to the treatment works, and the carpet manufacturers installed facilities to treat their effluent before it was discharged to the sewer. By 1994, fish were again appearing below the Star Paper Mill weir, and Yorkshire Water and the Environment Agency carried out another fish restocking programme.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that in 2006 there was sufficient capacity to treat 52% of municipal residential wastewater. By June 2010, there were 1,519 municipal wastewater treatment plants in China and 18 plants were added each week. Many existing plants are being expanded and upgraded to include a <b>tertiary</b> <b>treatment</b> stage for nutrient removal to comply with more stringent discharge standards introduced in 2002. In terms of technologies, in 2007, the most commonly used technologies were various forms of activated sludge, including oxidation ditches (24% of all plants), sequencing batch reactors (11%), conventional activated sludge (5%) and membrane bioreactors. In small communities, plants using only primary treatment were still common (15% of all plants). An analysis in 2004 by the Ministry of Construction showed that, according to treatment plant records, most plants operated in compliance with discharge standards.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{the overall}} water use in Morocco, {{reclaimed}} water can only provide {{a fraction of the}} country's increasing water needs. Furthermore, there is no regulatory framework for water reuse and no established system to recover the costs for reclaimed water from users. The country's largest reuse project is currently under construction in Marrakech, where reclaimed water from a 90,000 m3/day plant will be reused primarily to irrigate golf courses. The <b>tertiary</b> <b>treatment</b> and the network to distribute the reclaimed water will be financed by private investors. Redal, the utility serving Rabat, was carrying out a study in 2009 to assess the feasibility of wastewater reuse to irrigate green spaces in the city. Besides this {{there have been a few}} scattered small-scale pilot reuse projects since the 1980s, some of which have been abandoned. Among the sustainable projects is a project to irrigate golf courses in Ben Slimane that has been operating since 1997 with a capacity of 5,600 cubic meter/day. In 2009 a large reuse project was planned in Agadir to irrigate a golf course and municipal gardens with 50,000 cubic meters/day. In 2009 there were also two projects for direct, planned reuse in agriculture in Oujda and Beni Mellal. These projects are financed by the National Environmental Fund and would add a tertia2bb03c3e1; centralauth_Session=1reatment plants.

25|$|Activated sludge is {{a common}} suspended-growth method of {{secondary}} treatment. Activated sludge plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved oxygen to promote growth of biological floc that substantially removes organic material. Biological floc is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary clarifier effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo aeration to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological floc of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, ammonia, etc.) are similarly converted to biological floc or oxidized by the floc to nitrites, nitrates, and, in some processes, to nitrogen gas through denitrification. While denitrification is encouraged in some treatment processes, denitrification often impairs the settling of the floc causing poor quality effluent in many suspended aeration plants. Overflow from the activated sludge mixing chamber is sent to a secondary clarifier where the suspended biological floc settles out while the treated water moves into <b>tertiary</b> <b>treatment</b> or disinfection. Settled floc is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among activated sludge biota can reduce treatment efficiency. Nocardia, a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as sewage fungus, is {{the best known of}} many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the floc and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial metal plating waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an activated sludge reactor ecosystem.|$|E

40|$|While {{there are}} {{promising}} developments in public health, most interventions (both {{at the individual}} and community levels) remain focused on "downstream" <b>tertiary</b> <b>treatments</b> or one-on-one interventions. These efforts have their origins in the biomedical paradigm and risk factor epidemiology and the behavioral science research methods that serve as their handmaidens. This paper argues for a more appropriate balance of "downstream" efforts with a more appropriate whole population public health approach to health policy -what may be termed a social policy approach to healthy lifestyles rather than the current lifestyle approach to health policy. New, more appropriate research methods must be developed and applied to match these emerging levels of whole population intervention. We must avoid any disjunction between new upstream policy level interventions and the methods used to measure their effect -appropriate unto the intervention level must be the evaluation method thereof...|$|R

For pharmaceuticals, the following substances have been identified as [...] "toxicologically relevant": substances with endocrine disrupting effects, genotoxic substances and substances that enhance the development of bacterial resistances. They mainly belong to the group of environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants. Techniques for elimination of micropollutants via a fourth treatment stage during sewage treatment are being tested in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. However, since those techniques are still costly, they are not yet applied on a regular basis. Such process steps mainly consist of activated carbon filters that adsorb the micropollutants. Ozone can also be applied as an oxidative method. Also the use of enzymes such as the enzyme laccase is under investigation. A new concept which could provide an energy-efficient treatment of micropollutants could be the use of laccase secreting fungi cultivated at a wastewater treatment plant to degrade micropollutants {{and at the same time}} to provide enzymes at a cathode of a microbial biofuel cells. Microbial biofuel cells are investigated for their property to treat organic matter in wastewater.|$|E
