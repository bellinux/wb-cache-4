5|$|Parker and Stone {{were very}} happy with the episode, but {{received}} feedback from fans <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant.

5|$|Art in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} artistic production within the modern borders of Scotland, between the fifth century and {{the adoption of the}} Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. In the early Middle Ages, there were distinct material cultures evident in the different federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. Pictish art was the only uniquely Scottish Medieval style; it {{can be seen in the}} extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns. It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hoards. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his success}} with the Brewers, the team was {{struggling}} and not likely to make a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27 in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the tougher decisions {{he had to make}} because he was very fond of Greinke.|$|E
5|$|Its {{multiplayer}} {{features were}} praised; according to McCaffrey, the co-operative multiplayer mode had enough content {{for a separate}} game. Although he appreciated Spies vs. Mercs' faster pace, he found the mode less innovative than its predecessor. Reeves partially agreed, describing the revived Spies vs. Mercs mode as refreshing, intense, and bloody. De Matos wrote <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best multiplayer modes he had ever experienced, and the Blacklist version had evolved and modernized while remaining creative. Daniel Bloodworth of GameTrailers praised the game's satisfying co-op design, which tasks players to plan and coordinate strategy.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 Oman cyclone (JTWC designation: 01A, officially {{known as}} Cyclonic Storm ARB 01) was an {{uncommon}} tropical cyclone that struck the Dhofar region of Oman in May 2002. The first storm of the 2002 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it developed on May6 in the Arabian Sea, and it maintained a general west-northwest track {{for much of}} its duration. The system reached cyclonic storm status on May9, meaning it attained winds of greater than 65km/h (40mph), and on May10 it made landfall near Salalah; shortly thereafter it dissipated. The storm was rare, in the sense <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> only eleven tropical cyclones on record to approach the Arabian Peninsula {{in the month of}} May.|$|E

5|$|The art {{of glass}} making {{is thought to}} have {{developed}} during Ahmose's reign. The oldest samples of glass appear to have been defective pieces of faience, but intentional crafting of glass did not occur until the beginning of the 18th dynasty. One of the earliest glass beads found contains the names of both Ahmose and Amenhotep I, written in a style dated to about the time of their reigns. If glassmaking was developed no earlier than Ahmose's reign and the first objects are dated to no later than his successor's reign, it is quite likely <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his subjects who developed the craft.|$|E

In the United States, it premiered on June 8, 2015, at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, and {{received}} a wide theatrical release starting on June 19, 2015, in 2D, 3D, and select IMAX 3D theatres. It was the first animated movie {{to be released in}} Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema and the second for Disney following Tomorrowland. Also notable was the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> two feature films (the other being The Good Dinosaur) released by Pixar in the same calendar year, a first for the company.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims of}} this {{poisoning}} were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures {{in other parts of}} the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> several factors. Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.|$|E

Charting as an A-side single, it achieved success in Japan, peaking at number {{two on the}} Oricon Singles Chart. The single has been certified within four different categories by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). An accompanying music video was shot by Toshitaka Shinoda; it features animation {{in the style of}} Nissin's Freedom Project, including major characters such as the protagonist Takeru lip-synching to the song. The song had been promoted through several Japanese commercials and television shows.|$|E
5|$|Chesney {{was the son}} of Roger de Chesney and Alice de Langetot. The elder Chesney {{came from}} near Quesney-Guesnon in the Calvados region of Normandy, and held lands in England from Robert d'Oilly {{at the time of the}} Domesday Survey in 1087. Alice was the {{daughter}} of Ralph de Langetot, who held lands of Walter Giffard at the time of Domesday. William's brother Robert de Chesney later became Bishop of Lincoln. His other siblings were Reginald, who later became abbot of Evesham Abbey, Hugh, Ralph, Hawise, Beatrice, Isabel, and Roger. Chesney was the uncle of Gilbert Foliot who became successively abbot of Gloucester Abbey, Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> William's sisters that married Gilbert's father, although there is no sure evidence of this. Chesney also mentioned as relatives the brothers Alexander de Chesney and Ralph de Chesney, but the exact relationship is unknown. Chesney needs to be distinguished from another William de Chesney, who held the office of Sheriff of Norfolk between 1146 and 1153.|$|E
5|$|The modern Olympic Games {{were first}} held in Athens in 1896, and {{travelled}} to Paris {{four years later}} {{as part of the}} 1900 Exposition Universelle world's fair. The second Games featured a greatly expanded range of events from the first, up from 43 to 95. Among the events added in 1900 was the tug of war. Two tug of war teams were entered for the Paris tournament; Racing Club de France represented the host nation, along with a team from the United States which was composed of six athletes that were taking part in various other events during the Games. The American team withdrew from the competition, as they discovered that the tug of war was scheduled {{at the same time as}} the hammer throw which three of their team were competing in. A Scandinavian team was accepted as a late-entry by the organisers, comprising a mix of Swedish and Danish athletes competing at the Games. Various reports assign the credit for the formation and entry of this team to different sources; a Danish account claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Danish pullers, Eugen Schmidt who was responsible, while a Swedish record attributed it to their representative at the Games, Lieutenant Bergh.|$|E
