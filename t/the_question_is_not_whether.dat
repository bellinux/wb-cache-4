By the act of 1845, the actions thereby authorized are to be brought and maintained ‘in the same time’ as if brought by citizens of the state. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> an Indian title can be barred by adverse possession, or by state statutes of limitation. The point is that the plaintiff cannot invoke the special remedy given by the statute, without being bound by the conditions upon which it is given.|$|E

2500|$|In other words, whereas McGrew {{argues that}} anthropologists {{must focus on}} {{behaviors}} like communication and tool-use {{because they have no}} access to the mind, Holloway argues that human language and tool-use, including the earliest stone tools in the fossil record 2.6 million years ago, are highly suggestive of cognitive differences between humans and non-humans, and that such cognitive differences in turn explain human evolution. For Holloway, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> other primates communicate, learn or make tools, but the way they do these things. [...] "Washing potatoes in the ocean ... stripping branches of leaves to get termites," [...] and other examples of primate tool-use and learning [...] "are iconic, and there is no feedback from the environment to the animal." [...] Human tools, however, express an independence from natural form that manifests symbolic thinking. [...] "In the preparation of the stick for termite-eating, the relation between product and raw material is iconic. [...] In the making of a stone tool, in contrast, there is no necessary relation between the form of the final product and the original material." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sandiford appealed {{against this}} decision, {{but it was}} again {{rejected}} at the High Court in April 2013, by a three-judge panel, chaired by Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson. By then Sandiford's first line of appeal against her death sentence had been rejected, and she required £6,000 towards her legal costs for {{the next stage of}} her appeal. In his summing up on 22 April Lord Dyson said that it was [...] "most unfortunate" [...] Sandiford required [...] "relatively speaking ... very small sum indeed" [...] for her legal costs, but that this [...] "cannot affect the principle that we have had to consider and it cannot affect our decision. It may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum {{in the course of the}} next few days." [...] The judges published their reasons for rejecting the appeal on 22 May. In the written judgement, Lord Dyson said that Sandiford had argued the Foreign Secretary's position was [...] "unlawful" [...] but that the High Court had been [...] "right to conclude" [...] it was not. [...] "As the Secretary of State concedes, it would be possible to produce a policy under which funds for legal representation were made available to British nationals in certain defined circumstances...But <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> the Secretary of State could produce a different policy which many would regard as fairer and more reasonable and humane than the present policy.

In the same way, the essential issue about Browning as an artist is not whether he, in common with Byron, Wordsworth, Shelley, Tennyson, and Swinburne, sometimes wrote bad poetry, but whether in any other style except Browning's you could have achieved the precise artistic effect which is achieved by such incomparable lyrics as [...] "The Patriot" [...] or [...] "The Laboratory." [...] The answer must be in the negative, and in that answer lies the whole justification of Browning as an artist.|$|E
