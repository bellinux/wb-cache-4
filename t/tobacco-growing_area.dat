5000|$|Government {{intervention}} {{may have}} helped in mitigating the hostilities in Shiraz following Akbar’s removal however other regions of Iran still saw a proliferation in protests. Bazaaris in Tehran {{were among the first}} groups of people to protest against the concession by writing letters of disapproval to the shah even before the concession was publicly announced. It has been argued that this initial opposition stemmed from a Russian attempt to stir up frustration within the merchant community of Tehran. [...] Although Azarbaijan, the north western region of Iran, was not a <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>area,</b> it saw tremendous opposition to the concession due to the large concentration of local merchants and retail traders in the region. [...] In Isfahan a boycott of the consumption of tobacco was implemented even prior to Shirazi’s fatwa (discussed below) while in the city of Tabriz, the bazaar closed down and the ulema stopped teaching in the madrasas. [...] The cities of Mashhad and Kirman also experienced demonstrations in opposition to the concession yet historian Mansoor Moaddel argues that these latter movements were relatively ineffective. [...] Other cities around the country such as Qazvin, Yazd, and Kermanshah were also involved in opposing the shah and the Tobacco Régie.|$|E

40|$|Background: Tobacco leaf curl disease (TLCD) {{is caused}} by begomoviruses in Geminiviridae, and {{infected}} plants exhibit leaf thickening, downward leaf curling, vein swelling as well as stunting symptoms. It {{is one of the}} economically important diseases in tropical and subtropical <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>areas.</b> Seven monopartite begomoviruses have been identified causing TLCD in China. Findings: In this study, two begomoviruses were identified, characterized and polygenetically analyzed to be responsible for TLCD in Sichuan province, China. The complete genomes of two isolates SC 230 and SC 379 from diseased tobacco samples were cloned and sequenced to be 2738 nucleotides (nts) and 2748 nts in size, respectively. Sequence alignment indicated that SC 230 and SC 379 were most closely related to Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV-CN[CN:Sc 226 :Mal: 12]) and Papaya leaf curl China virus (PaLCuCNV-CN[CN:Gx 30 :Lyc: 03]), with a sequence identity of 99. 2 and 99. 2 %, respectively. The infection rate of TYLCCNV and PaLCuCNV was 100 and 34. 78 %, respectively and the co-infection rate was 34. 78 % in fields. Betasatellites of SC 230 and SC 379 share the highest sequence identity with Tomato yellow leaf curl China betasatellite (TYLCCNB-CN[CN:Sc 176 :Malva: 12]) and TYLCCNB-CN[CN:Yn 149 :Tom: 09], with a sequence identity of 95. 2 and 97. 2 % respectively. Sequence identity between betasatellites of SC 230 and SC 379 was 89. 6 %. And TYLCCNB was detected in all the samples. Conclusion: Co-infection of TYLCCNV and PaLCuCNV was identified in tobacco plants with typical symptoms of TLCD from Sichuan province in China, {{and this is the first}} report of PaLCuCNV infecting tobacco in China. TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB disease complex is widespread in <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>areas</b> in Panzhihua city of Sichuan...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco blue mold, {{caused by}} the obligately biotrophic oomycete {{pathogen}} Peronospora tabacina D. B. Adam, is a major foliar disease that results in significant losses in <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>areas.</b> Natural resistance to P. tabacina has not been identified in any variety of common tobacco. Complete resistance, conferred by RBM 1, was found in N. debneyi and was transferred into cultivated tobacco by crossing. In the present study, we characterized the RBM 1 -mediated resistance to blue mold in tobacco and show that the hypersensitive response (HR) {{plays an important role}} in the host defense reactions. Genetic mapping indicated that the disease resistance gene locus resides on chromosome 7. The genetic markers linked to this gene and the genetic map we generated will not only benefit tobacco breeders for variety improvement but will also facilitate the positional cloning of RBM 1 for biologists...|$|R
5000|$|Nalgae, {{the second}} typhoon hit Philippines within one week made {{landfall}} {{along the coast}} of Dinapigue town in Isabela province. The PAGASA weather bureau chief Graciano Yumul said that [...] "The ground is still supersaturated and it cannot absorb more water. This will just flow down to rivers and towns, and there is a big possibility that landslides, flash flooding and flooding could occur." [...] The search and rescue operations for Typhoon Nesat were halted because of the fierce weather brought by Nalgae. The NOLCOM chief Major General Jessie Dellosa said [...] "Our rescue operations are ongoing with the use of watercraft and rubber boats. We are also continuously coordinating with the local government units to rescue the affected residents in Calumpit and Hagonoy." [...] The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council director Benito Ramos said that thousands of rescue workers were deployed across Luzon and the island’s sparsely populated northeast coast was evacuated following the orders from the president Benigno Aquino III. Ramous said [...] "We're implementing persuasive evacuation operations. If I have to handcuff people to remove them from their homes I could be charged with human rights violations." [...] Nalgae was making a similar path across the saturated Luzon Island as Typhoon Nesat. The wind gusts brought by Nalgae toppled trees and blew away tin roofs of some houses in Isabela's provincial capital of Ilagan. Nalgae continued to worsen the flooding and destruction brought by Nesat. Nalgae was far more stronger than Nesat and plummeted the nation with more winds and rains. The governor of Isabela province, Faustino Dy said that [...] "Hundreds of people in coastal areas had been evacuated as rain and strong cut power lines, uprooted trees and blocked roads with debris." [...] He added that [...] "Nalgae could cause floods on Luzon's central plains before passing through La Union province, a <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>area,</b> and then heading off into the South China Sea." [...] Also, the PAGASA announced that an estimated 10-18 mm per hour of rains were experienced in several areas across the nation filling up dams and causing river systems to swell. As the storm continued to move inland with strong winds, many structures including billboards, tarpaulins and wooden materials in the town of Cauayan were damaged. The barriers of the Isabela highway were also destroyed by the typhoon. The government responded quickly and cleared off all the debris on the highway and made it usable again. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDDRMC), the onslaught of the typhoon resulted in the death of 1 person living in the Mountain Province, a landlocked province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. It was reported that Sonny Marcos, a passenger on board a passenger van was buried alongside the Halsema Highway, the highest altitude highway in the Philippines that stretches from Baguio City to Bontoc, Mountain Province. Seeing the heavy rains and flooding caused by the typhoon, Graciano Yumul then said {{to the people of the}} nation, [...] "You can look at all the scientific computations and we can really prove that the dam openings would only contribute a maximum of 5% to the floods we see now in Pampanga and Bulacan. The water came from the run-off from the mountains, due to rains dropped by Pedring." ...|$|E

The current study surveyed students from 23 middle schools in rural Virginia and New York State {{at the end of the}} sixth grade and then one-year later at the end of the seventh grade. Logistic regressions were used to predict changes in levels of adolescent smoking from factors such as parent smoking, peer smoking, sibling smoking, self-efficacy to refuse cigarettes, and whether the adolescent resided in a <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>area.</b> Results from this study indicated that having a best friend who smokes was more important for trying smoking, whereas the number of friends who smoke was more important for experimental and higher levels of smoking. Two variables, having a mother who smokes and an adolescent’s self-efficacy to refuse cigarettes, were found to be a consistent inﬂuence across all stages of smoking behavior. Ethnicity had a slightly different impact on smoking behavior than demonstrated in previous research. African Americans were actually at a higher risk for trying smoking than Caucasians, and there were no differences for ethnicity among those who moved to experimental or higher levels of smoking. In addition, living in a tobacco-growing county was significantly related to adolescents trying smoking, but was not related to adolescents at this age moving to experimental or higher levels of smoking. The findings from this study suggest that there are unique aspects to the smoking behavior of rural adolescents, and suggestions for prevention are made...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial wilt is a {{destructive}} disease {{caused by the}} phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum (R. solanacearum), which is widely found in various <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>areas</b> all over the world. Botanical bactericidal substances have gradually emerged as a hot topic in modern pesticide research. In this study, the antibacterial activities of two phytochemicals (resveratrol and coumarin) against R. solanacearum and their in vivo and in vitro efficacy for controlling tobacco bacterial wilt were evaluated. We rule out significant biological effects of both phytochemicals using transmission electron microscope (TEM) and fluorescence microscope, which suppressed the growth of R. solanacearum. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the toxicity mechanisms mainly involved damaging bacterial cell membrane and preventing swarming motility and biofilm formation. A further pot experiment demonstrated that coumarin and resveratrol significantly inhibited early adhesion and colonization of R. solanacearum in tobacco plants and the corresponding control efficacies were 68 % and 85 % after incubation for 13 days, respectively. The {{findings of this study}} suggest that both resveratrol and coumarin have potential as non-toxic antimicrobial strategies for controlling tobacco bacterial wilt disease...|$|R

40|$|Morphological {{variation}} in nine characters of 157 clones of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) was examined by multivariate analysis. The clones {{were collected from}} peach, Prunus persica, the primary host and the secondary hosts tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum, cabbage, Brassica oleracea, sugarbeet, Beta vulgaris and pepper Capsicum annuum. The 156 clones originated from various regions of Greece, both in the north, where {{a large part of}} the population has an annual bisexual generation on peach, and in more southerly regions, where populations are predominantly unisexual. One clone was collected from tobacco in Caserta, Italy. All clones were laboratory-reared on potato. Canonical variate analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and a non-parametric classification tree method both revealed morphological differences associated with the host-plant on which they were collected. The scores of the first two canonical variates separated the tobacco-feeding clones from those originating from other secondary host-plants. However, in <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>areas</b> the tobacco-feeding form predominated in spring populations on peach, and was sometimes found on other secondary hosts. In addition, using cluster analysis, the clones from tobacco which were sampled in the most southeasterly region showed a relatively large phenotypic distance from those collected further north and west. Moreover, clonal phenotypes were affected both by host plant and by long-term parthenogenetic rearing. However, in spite of these effects, the tobacco form was generally distinguishable from aphids originating from other hosts, indicating that the difference must have a genetic basis. In separate analyses of the clones originating from secondary hosts no association was found between morphology and either life cycle category or colour. Discriminant analysis showed that 89 % of 1723 specimens could be correctly classified into the two groups...|$|R
50|$|On September 29, 1930, 4,000 workers {{supported}} by the United Textile Workers of America left their jobs at the Dan River Mills in Danville (a town already reeling from the closing of cotton mills and furniture factories). Rather than repeat the bloodshed of North Carolina textile strikes, after the mill owner refused his offer to mediate and a November riot in support of 40 striking mill workers charged with unlawful assembly, Pollard acceded to local authorities' requests and called out three companies of the state's National Guard, which kept the peace until the strike collapsed on January 29, 1931. Moreover, widespread poverty within the state reduced the influence of economic fluctuations. In 1929 Virginia ranked 36th in per capita income (although 19th in total income); many blacks, mill workers and subsistence farmers lived in poverty. One tenth of Virginia's 170,000 farmers had incomes over $2500 in 1929, but even in that year two of every five earned less than $600. Farm tenancy was high in the state's cotton and <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>areas,</b> although Virginia also had among the second lowest percentage in the nation of farms subject to mortgages, so foreclosures were not a severe problem. Pollard petitioned President Hoover for continuation in federal road advances (requesting $5 million to be repaid in 10 to 15 years), {{in order to avoid}} a dole. Governor Pollard again balanced the state budget, although he also appointed an Unemployment Relief Committee headed by Byrd confidante William T. Reed, who also opposed expensive work relief programs but urged businesses to adopt a five day workweek and start new building projects.|$|R

A detailed assessment of the situation and options for reform in the EU tobacco sector {{can be found in a}} Commission staff working paper 'Extended Impact Assessment: Tobacco Regime. Full details of the Commission's proposals for reform of the tobacco regime, alongside a summary assessment of the current situation, can be found in the text of the Commission's communication to the Council and European Parliament on 'Accomplishing a sustainable agricultural model for Europe through the reformed CAP: the tobacco, olive oil, cotton and sugar sectors'. It is envisaged that the reform process will 'bring better market orientation and income growth for producers, in addition to the positive impact on producer income development from the increased transfer efficiency of decoupled payments'. This is especially the case for small scale producers who will receive a larger part of their income through the single farm payments. The reform process will also lead to the cessation of production of less profitable varieties of tobacco and the conversion of land to other uses. By the end of the reform period it is anticipated that EU prices will be aligned with world market prices. Comment: The alignment of EU prices with world market prices which the reform process is intended to bring about is likely to reduce the income to ACP suppliers of tobacco to the EU market. These price effects will need to be carefully assessed in the light of the prices which ACP suppliers currently enjoy. A communication containing proposals for reform of the EU tobacco [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In Uganda, biomass smoke {{seems to}} be the largest risk factor for the {{development}} of COPD, but socio-economic factors and gender may have a role. Therefore, more in-depth research is needed to understand the risk factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of socio-economic factors and gender differences on the COPD prevalence in Uganda. The population comprised 588 randomly selected participants (430 years) who previously completed the FRESH AIR Uganda study. In this post hoc analysis, the impact of several socio-economic characteristics, gender and smoking on the prevalence of COPD was assessed using a logistic regression model. The main risk factors associated with COPD were non-Bantu ethnicity (odds ratio (OR) 1. 73, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 06 - 2. 82, P = 0. 030), biomass fuel use for heating (OR 1. 76, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 3. 00, P = 0. 038), former smoker (OR 1. 87, 95 % CI 0. 97 - 3. 60, P = 0. 063) and being unmarried (OR 0. 087, 95 % CI 0. 93 - 2. 95, P = 0. 087). A substantial difference in the prevalence of COPD was seen between the two ethnic groups: non-Bantu 20 % and Bantu 12. 9 %. Additional analysis between these two groups showed significant differences in socio-economic circumstances: non-Bantu people smoked more (57. 7 % vs 10. 7 %), lived in <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>areas</b> (72 % vs 14. 8 %) and were less educated (28. 5 % vs 12. 9 % had no education). With regard to gender, men with COPD were unmarried (OR 3. 09, 95 % CI 1. 25 - 7. 61, P = 0. 015) and used more biomass fuel for heating (OR 2. 15, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 4. 54, P = 0. 045), and women with COPD were former smokers (OR 3. 35, 95 % CI 1. 22 - 9. 22, P = 0. 019). Only a few socio-economic factors (i. e., smoking, biomass fuel use for heating, marital status and non-Bantu ethnicity) have been found to be associated with COPD. This applied for gender differences as well (i. e., for men, marital status and biomass fuel for heating, and for women being a former smoker). More research is needed to clarify the complexity of the different risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Speaking to the European Parliament on September 23 rd 2003 the Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler {{outlined}} the proposals {{contained in the}} second round of the CAP mid-term review proposals. He pointed out that the trend towards decoupling was now firmly established, and argued that the more products which would be included in the single farm payment scheme the better. Against this background the Commission has put forward a communication on reform of the common market organisation for olive oil, tobacco and cotton. Reform proposals in the olive oil, tobacco and cotton sectors are aimed at reorienting support to 'reward healthy, high quality products and practices' and to supporting the development of 'alternative sources of income and economic activity'. In order to achieve this the majority of support is to be decoupled from production and integrated into the single farm payment scheme. Since the production of these crops is concentrated in less favoured regions of the EU it is also proposed to strengthen the rural development measures for these regions. For tobacco the existing tobacco premium is to be decoupled over a three-year period alongside a phasing out of the tobacco fund. During this transition period a special fund will be set up under the rural development pillar to support restructuring in <b>tobacco-growing</b> <b>areas.</b> By the end of the reform period more than 70 % of the current tobacco premium will have been converted into the single farm payments and at least 20 % will be deployed as restructuring assistance. In the olive-oil sector the approach is to be modified, for there are concerns that a complete conversion into a single decoupled payment scheme could lead to land abandonment in traditional production areas. For this reason 40 % of payments are to remain linked to production with 60 % being decoupled and incorporated into the single farm payment scheme. In the cotton sector the Commission has proposed to incorporate part of the current support into the single farm payment scheme and to transform the rest into production aid granted as an area payment. Here again only partial decoupling is to occur. Commissioner Fischler noted that a slightly different approach was being adopted in the sugar sector with three options being put forward for further discussion. This follows the approach adopted in the dairy sector and is designed to find an approach which will minimise land abandonment throughout the EU. Further discussion was felt to be necessary since 'the sugar sector is a sensitive and also complicated sector, which has never, until now, been fundamentally reformed'. It is felt that there is therefore a need for a political debate on sugar-sector reform. Commissioner Fischler noted that in the sugar sector it was clear that any reform of the sugar market will have to: bridge the gap between domestic and world market prices; involve a decoupling of support; weigh the pros and cons of the quota system; take into account the international impact of reform. A concise summary of the situation in the raw tobacco, olive oil and cotton sectors, an explanation of how the common organisation of the market works and a summary of the situation on world markets can be found in the Commission memorandum of September 23 rd 2003. Comment: Reform of the EU tobacco regime is likely to exert a downward price on EU tobacco prices, which could affect ACP earnings from tobacco exports. More fundamentally, the facilitation of disengagement of EU farming from tobacco production will intensify pressures to reduce tobacco consumption in the EU, which could result in a shrinking of the EU tobacco market. In the olive oil and cotton sectors only partial decoupling is proposed. This highlights the extent to which the EU is willing to retain coupled farm payments where this is necessary to keep land under production, setting limits on the extent to which the EU can move over to decoupled farm payments. The Commission's cautious approach to sugar-sector reform highlights the sensitivity of this sector within the EU.
