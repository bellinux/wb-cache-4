5|$|What Arafat {{says about}} me doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also a}} whole list of Arab and world {{politicians}} claim <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E
5|$|Your honor, I {{have stated}} in this court <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{opposed to the}} form of our present government; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> opposed to the social system in which we live; that I believe in the change of both but by {{perfectly}} peaceable and orderly means....|$|E

But, make no mistake, I am {{not the only one who}} is in danger. The Tsarnaev brothers drew inspiration from Feiz Mohammed's internet rants and decided to kill innocent onlookers at a marathon. Everyone is in danger.|$|E

"Believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> guilty--most guilty, my liege and King," [...] {{said the}} Duke, conscience-stricken, and {{kneeling}} down;--"believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> misguided--that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mad--Believe anything but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> capable of harming, or being accessory to harm, your person." ...|$|R

60|$|It <b>is</b> {{little wonder}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> all bewildered, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like some poor mariner upon unknown waters, without stars or compass.|$|R
5|$|Nothing {{could in}} the least {{palliate}} this long, this cold, this very distant separation from my dearest wife and children but the certain knowledge <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> preparing for their ease, happiness and prosperity, and when that is the prise, I know no hardships that I would not encounter with, to obtain it.|$|E
5|$|Now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in baseball, {{just watch}} the game I play. If I catch any crook in baseball, {{the rest of his}} life is going to be a pretty hot one. I'll go to any means and to {{anything}} possible to see that he gets a real penalty for his offense.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, {{and it is}} this {{emphatic}} assertion that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they certainly are but true as natural history they as certainly are not... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> aware of, that match his.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bless me!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "I did {{not know}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> asleep.

5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E
5|$|I {{leave it}} with this House with every confidence. I am equal to either fortune. I can see past the {{decision}} of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, {{and it is no}} vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will admit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

5000|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{often used}} the phrase [...] "drum major {{instinct}}," [...] meaning the instinct to be a leader. In his sermon at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 4, 1968 he said: [...] "If {{you want to say}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for justice, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for peace, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter... I just want to leave a committed life behind." ...|$|R

25|$|I {{would not}} wish to a dog or to a snake, to the most low and misfortunate {{creature}} of the earth, I would {{not wish to}} any of them what I have had to suffer for things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E
25|$|Do {{you believe}} I am ever, {{in any of}} my actions, guided by the thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> 'German'? Do you suppose Mozart was {{consciously}} 'Aryan' when he composed? I recognise only two types of people: those who have talent {{and those who have}} none.|$|E

25|$|Erasmus said of Colet, “When I {{listen to}} Colet {{it seems to}} me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{listening}} to Plato himself.” Erasmus likely portrayed Colet to show that one could be highly critical of the Church while still a loyal priest. His depiction of Colet was partly a depiction of himself.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a sudden}} silence. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still left in the darkness; feeling nothing, hearing nothing.
