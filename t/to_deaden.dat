25|$|In August 2006, Lagasse contributed several {{recipes to}} the meal {{selection}} aboard the International Space Station, {{as part of}} a general NASA effort {{to improve the quality of}} the food supply for astronauts. Lagasse's cuisine in particular was selected in the hopes that the spicier fare would offset the reported tendency of microgravity <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> flavors.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{what their}} license {{application}} read, {{they had no}} blueprint at all with regard to marketing, programming, administration or promotion. The next six months was then spent building a radio station from scratch. A makeshift studio {{was set up in}} Bank Street, South Melbourne, draped with hessian <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> the noise. Late-night dummy runs were performed a week before the on-air date to test the equipment.|$|E
25|$|The rails were {{delivered}} by boat to Bideford Quay by the S.S. Snipe in May 1898 and the sleepers also {{arrived at the}} quay, coming from West Hartlepool in September. Wood blocks were used on the quay, flush with the road surface <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> the noise, as was the practice on roads with heavy horse and cart traffic in many places. The wood became very slippery and caused accidents in wet weather, the company not always being as careful with the application of sand and gravel {{as it should have}} been.|$|E
5000|$|The {{acoustic}} performance of suspended ceilings has improved {{dramatically over the}} years, with enhanced sound absorption and attenuation. This is sometimes achieved by adding insulation known as Sound Attenuation Batts (SABs), more {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "sound batts", above the panels <b>to</b> help <b>deaden</b> sounds and keep adjacent rooms quieter.|$|R
50|$|Kant derived a {{prohibition}} against {{cruelty to animals}} {{as a violation of}} a duty in relation to oneself. According to Kant, man has the imperfect duty to strengthen the feeling of compassion, since this feeling promotes morality in relation to other human beings. But, cruelty <b>to</b> animals <b>deadens</b> the feeling of compassion in man. Therefore, man is obliged not to treat animals brutally (Kant, Metaphysics of Morals, § 17).|$|R
25|$|The Mk2 also {{received}} numerous updates {{including a new}} revised A/C HVAC system, six airbags standard across the range to enhance safety and improved sound <b>deadening</b> <b>to</b> all models to give a more refined, quiet ride.|$|R
25|$|To {{create the}} ruby slippers, the shoes were dyed red, then {{burgundy}} sequined organza overlays {{were attached to}} each shoe's upper and heel. The film's early three-strip Technicolor process required the sequins to be darker than most red sequins found today; bright red sequins would have appeared orange on screen. Two weeks {{before the start of}} shooting, Adrian added butterfly-shaped red strap leather bows. Each of the Art Deco-inspired bows had three large, rectangular, red-glass jewels with dark red bugle beads, outlined in red glass rhinestones in silver settings. The stones and beads were sewn to the bows, then to the organza-covered shoe. Three pairs of the surviving slippers had orange felt glued to their soles <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> the sound of Garland dancing on the Yellow Brick Road.|$|E
25|$|Later, Lensky mischievously invites Onegin to Tatyana's name day celebration {{promising}} a small gathering with just Tatyana, Olga, and their parents. When Onegin arrives, he finds instead a boisterous country ball, a rural parody of and {{contrast to the}} society balls of St. Petersburg he has grown tired of. Onegin is irritated with the guests who gossip about him and Tatyana, and with Lensky for persuading him to come. He decides to avenge himself by dancing and flirting with Olga. Olga is insensitive to her fiancé and apparently attracted to Onegin. Earnest and inexperienced, Lensky is wounded to the core and challenges Onegin to fight a duel; Onegin reluctantly accepts, feeling compelled by social convention. During the duel, Onegin unwillingly kills Lensky. Afterwards, he quits his country estate, traveling abroad <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> his feelings of remorse.|$|E
25|$|In both {{town and}} country, {{means of access}} between the main house and the servant's wings were kept to a minimum, often the single door would be lined with green baize <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> any sound. Long and {{complicated}} passages linking kitchens with dining rooms were devised; in some houses the tortuous route through corridors and staircases from kitchen to dining room could be an eighth of a mile – an absence of cooking smells taking priority over hot food. Even the doors linking to the connecting corridors would be covered by screens, sometimes disguised as bookcases with dummy books, or just simply covered in the same wallpaper as that with which the room was decorated, as the existence of servants {{was not to be}} acknowledged. Cleaning had to be performed {{in the early hours of}} the morning while the employers were asleep, and in the grander houses only male servants were allowed to be visible, and then only when required.|$|E
60|$|In {{process of}} time, fatigue prevailed over anxiety and curiosity. The storm abated, or my senses became <b>deadened</b> <b>to</b> its terrors, and I fell asleep ere yet the mysterious paces of my host {{had ceased to}} shake the {{flooring}} over my head.|$|R
60|$|When {{the pink}} of dawn was shading white, {{we were at}} our posts. A long, hot day--interminably long, <b>deadening</b> <b>to</b> the keenest interest--passed, and still no mustangs came. We slept and watched again, in the {{grateful}} cool of night, till the third day broke.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} line from Newcastle, which operated at 33,000 volts, was becoming overloaded and in about 1946 the Railways decided {{to raise the}} voltage to 66,000 volts. This would enable four times the power to be transmitted. This was firstly done by adding two more insulator discs to the suspended insulators of the line, a pole at a time. Naturally the line had <b>to</b> be <b>deadened</b> for this <b>to</b> be done. To keep disruption to a minimum this work was carried out on a Sunday.|$|R
500|$|Vincent Law, in {{a review}} {{published}} in the Gerry Anderson-centric fanzine Andersonic, considers The Day After Tomorrow an [...] "oddity" [...] and an [...] "uncharacteristically lacklustre entry in the Anderson canon", commenting that the programme [...] "cracks along at a fair old pace, but the educational content does tend <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> {{the first half of}} the story and limits the room for character development." [...] Although he credits the production for [...] "getting its science lesson across in a superficial way", he expresses a negative view of the narration, remarking that [...] "at times Ed [...] comes across like a presenter of one of those old schools programmes from the 70s, just imparting a string of dry facts." [...] He believes that Jane is the only character who develops over the course of the special. The adults, by contrast, are [...] "pretty much peripheral", while David can be considered a [...] "miniature Spock" [...] who [...] "lurks around the ship either brandishing his slide rule, threatening to calculate something, or staring out of the porthole (a nice touch!) dribbling about pulsars." ...|$|E
2500|$|That injury did {{not have}} him cancel any shows, as saying [...] "He (the doctor) told me it's going to hurt – though nothing could hurt worse than Saturday, I don't think – and they can give me {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> the pain when I get out there. I also {{have to have a}} doctor standing by should something give, but I'm going to tape it up, and I'm going to get out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to this {{description}} and the illustration in the Huolongjing, the [...] "Crouching Tiger Cannon" [...] {{was a small}} cannon that was propped up at the muzzle end and pinned to the ground <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> the recoil. This setup supposedly resembles a crouching tiger, giving the cannon its name like its trebuchet predecessor. The barrel holding 100 bullets could mean the [...] "Crouching Tiger Cannon" [...] fired pellets, or that the bullets could {{have been placed in}} a bag as grapeshot.|$|E
40|$|Wonder, innate in the child, is {{an inner}} {{desire to learn}} that awaits reality {{in order to be}} awakened. Wonder is at the origin of reality-based consciousness, thus of learning. The scope of wonder, which occurs at a metaphysical level, is greater than that of curiosity. Unfortunate misinterpretations of {{neuroscience}} have led to false brain-based ideas in the field of education, all of these based on the scientifically wrong assumption that children’s learning depends on an enriched environment. These beliefs have re-enforced the Behaviorist Approach to education and to parenting and have contributed <b>to</b> <b>deadening</b> our children’s sense of wonder. We suggest wonder as the center of all motivation and action in the child. Wonder is what makes life genuinely personal. Beauty is what triggers wonder. Wonder attunes to beauty through sensitivity and is unfolded by attachment. When wonder, beauty, sensitivity and secure attachment are present, learning is meaningful. On the contrary, when there is no volitional dimension involved (no wonder), no end or meaning (no beauty) and no trusting predisposition (secure attachment), the rigid and limiting mechanical process of so-called learning through mere repetition become a deadening and alienating routine. This could be described as training, not as learning, because it does not contemplate the human being as a whole...|$|R
50|$|Carpet and {{headlining}} were downgraded {{to basic}} specification {{and even the}} documentation wallet was changed from faux leather <b>to</b> cloth.

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{believes}} Schopenhauer's ethical {{point of}} view is that the individual succeeds in seeing through the wretchedness of existence and then decides <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> or mortify the joy of life. As a result of this complete asceticism, one reaches contemplation: the individual does this out of sympathy. He sympathizes with all the misery and the misery of others, which is to exist. Kierkegaard here is probably referring to the pessimistic nature of Schopenhauer's philosophy. One of Kierkegaard's main concerns is a suspicion of his whole philosophy: ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the fall}} of 1769, Ebenezer Zane {{explored}} the Wheeling area and established claim to the land via [...] "tomahawk rights." [...] (This process meant <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> a few trees near {{the head of a}} spring, and mark the bark with the initials of the name of the person who made the claim). He returned the following spring with his wife Elizabeth and his younger brothers, Jonathan and Silas; they established the first permanent European settlement in the Wheeling area, naming it Zanesburg. Other families joined the settlement, including the Shepherds (see Monument Place), the Wetzels, and the McCollochs (see McColloch's Leap).|$|E
2500|$|Attaching a small metal, rubber, leather, or wooden {{device called}} a mute, or sordino, {{to the bridge}} of the violin gives a softer, more mellow tone, with fewer audible overtones; the sound of an entire orchestral string section playing with mutes has a hushed quality. The {{conventional}} Italian markings for mute usage are con sord., or con sordina, meaning 'with mute'; and senza sord., meaning 'without mute'; or via sord., meaning 'mute off'. Larger metal, rubber, or wooden mutes are widely available, known as practice mutes or hotel mutes. [...] Such mutes are generally not used in performance, but are used <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> the sound of the violin in practice areas such as hotel rooms. (For practicing purposes there is also the mute violin, a violin without a sound box.) Some composers have used practice mutes for special effect, for example, at the end of Luciano Berio's Sequenza VIII for solo violin.|$|E
60|$|Brangwen was {{sometimes}} {{dragged into the}} trouble. He loved Ursula, therefore {{he always had a}} sense of shame, almost of betrayal, when he turned on her. So he turned fiercely and scathingly, and with a wholesale brutality that made Ursula go white, mute, and numb. Her feelings seemed <b>to</b> be becoming <b>deadened</b> in her, her temper hard and cold.|$|R
60|$|Some one {{knocked on}} her door. The Mexican woman called anxiously. Carley awoke {{to the fact}} that her {{presence}} was not solitary on the physical earth, even if her soul seemed stricken to eternal loneliness. Even in the desert there was a world to consider. Vanity that had bled to death, pride that had been crushed, availed her not here. But something else came to her support. The lesson of the West had been to endure, not to shirk--to face an issue, not to hide. Carley got up, bathed, dressed, brushed and arranged her dishevelled hair. The face she saw in the mirror excited her amaze and pity. Then she went out in answer to the call for dinner. But she could not eat. The ordinary functions of life appeared <b>to</b> be <b>deadened.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{woman and}} her animals face an icy winter. On 11 January, the cow gives birth to a calf. In the coming weeks, the woman grows tired and dreams of succumbing <b>to</b> the <b>deadening</b> snow. On 25 May, after {{spending}} {{a year at the}} lodge in the narrow valley, the {{woman and her}} animals leave in a procession and climb to the high mountain pasture where they spend the summer comforted by the warm sun and star-filled nights. For {{the first time in her}} life, the woman experiences a feeling of calm [...] "as if a big hand stopped the clock" [...] in her head. During that second summer, a transformation begins to take place in her, as if her [...] "newer self" [...] was [...] "being absorbed into a greater whole".|$|R
2500|$|After a {{disastrous}} defeat by Superman, Luthor decides to retire {{and go to}} Lexor permanently. Once there, he finds he has fathered a son by Ardora, Lex Luthor Jr. Luthor spends {{the next several weeks}} with his new family and acting as guardian and scientific advisor to the Lexorians. When it is discovered that Lexor has the same geological instability that destroyed Krypton, Luthor invents and installs a [...] "Neutrarod" [...] <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> the planetary core reactions. However, despite his sincere effort to reform, Luthor's pathological hatred for Superman resurfaces. He soon discovers an underground laboratory, dating from Lexor's technological age. Knowing Superman will eventually locate him, Luthor uses the equipment to create a battlesuit and goes on a series of secretive marauding attacks, professing surprise at the pillage and plunder reported in the news. Superman ultimately arrives on Lexor to take Luthor back to Earth after one of Luthor's still-active machines threatened mass destruction. Luthor counter-attacks with his battlesuit, revealing his true character to the now-disillusioned Lexorian people. During the battle, an energy salvo from the battlesuit accidentally overloads the Neutrarod, resulting in the annihilation of Lexor and all its inhabitants, including Luthor's wife and son.|$|E
2500|$|To block balls that {{a pitcher}} throws on a bounce toward home plate (pitches that {{are said to}} be [...] "in the dirt"), the catcher will slide his body to the left or right, as necessary, to place himself {{directly}} {{in the path of the}} ball. Once in position, he drops to his knees, places his mitt between his legs to prevent the ball from passing through, and leans forward <b>to</b> <b>deaden</b> the rebound when, and if, the ball bounces off his thigh or torso. Although inexperienced catchers may try to catch the errant pitch with his mitt, coaches often prioritize the catcher's ability to [...] "keep the ball in front of him" [...] than to make a catch with his mitt. Ideally, the catcher will be able to knock the ball to the ground where it will stop within arm's reach. To perform this properly, without the ball being deflected in an undesirable direction, the catcher must angle his body so that his chest is always leaning forward, toward home plate. This maneuver is often difficult, and its difficulty depends largely on how fast the ball is traveling, the angle at which the ball is thrown into the ground, where it first hits the ground, the firmness of the ground it hits, and the manner in which it is spinning.|$|E
