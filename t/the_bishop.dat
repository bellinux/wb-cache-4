5|$|The {{church in}} Northumbria {{was one of}} the major landowners, perhaps second only to the king. At the head of the Northumbrian church was the Archbishop of York, an office held by Eanbald I to 796, Eanbald II until some time after 808, and then by Wulfsige to around 830. Immediately below the {{archbishop}} were three bishops: <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> of Lindisfarne, <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> of Hexham and <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> of Whithorn. The typically long term of office of senior clerics meant that kings often had to work with men appointed by their predecessors, with whom their relations might be difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the diocese affecting both clergy and laity was vested entirely in <b>the</b> <b>bishop,</b> who appointed officers to the ecclesiastical, criminal and civil courts. <b>The</b> <b>bishop,</b> assisted by his chapter, produced the church laws and regulations for the bishopric and these were enforced at occasional diocesan synods by <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> or, in his absence, by the dean. Appointed officials adjudicated at consistory courts looking at matters affecting tithes, marriages, divorces, widows, orphans, wills and other related legal matters. In Moray, these courts were held in Elgin and Inverness. By 1452 <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> of Moray held all his lands in one regality and had Courts of Regality presided over by Bailiffs and Deputies to ensure the payment of revenues from his estates.|$|E

50|$|All {{bishops of}} Chiemsee were {{selected}} by the Archbishops, for <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> were <b>the</b> most important supporters of <b>the</b> archbishops. <b>The</b> <b>bishops</b> usually served as auxiliary bishops or fulfilled other duties for the archbishops.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{sideline}} 4...g5, {{the main line}} continues with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns {{in return for a}} material advantage of one pawn, <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> pair. After 6.Nbd2Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> pair, a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may end up with the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all. The maverick gambit 6...f6 also exists.|$|E

5|$|Black can try {{the minor}} line 4...Nc6 that delays the {{development}} of its dark-square bishop, to develop it along the a1–h8 diagonal instead of the a3–f8 diagonal, depending on the circumstances. But the main line is 4...Bc5 to attack the f2-pawn, forcing 5.e3, blocking in White's bishop on c1, so that after 5...Nc6 White will not have enough pieces to protect his e5-pawn in the long run. Placing <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> on the c5-square also has subtler points, as Tseitlin explains:At first sight <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> on c5 lacks prospects, being held at bay by the pawn on e3, and is insecure {{in view of the}} threat to exchange it by Nc3–a4/e4. In reality, posting <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> here has a deep strategic significance. It holds up the advance of the e- and the f-pawns (assuming the white bishop will go to b2), and thereby secures e5 as a future knight outpost, which in turn restricts the activity of both White's bishops. As to the exchanging threat, <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> may conveniently retreat on a7 or f8, or even in some cases remain on c5 with support from a pawn on b6.|$|E
