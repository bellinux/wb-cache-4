5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse {{due to lack}} of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony and later the Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence to prove the theory. It is considered unlikely {{due to lack of}} damage to a fence around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E

5|$|The curve-billed thrasher (Toxostoma curvirostre) is a {{medium-sized}} mimid {{that is a}} member of the genus Toxostoma, native to the southwestern United States and much of Mexico. Referred to as the default desert bird, it is a non-migratory species. Several subspecies have been classified since 1827, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> consensus on the number. Allopatric speciation is believed to have played a major role in the variations of the curve-billed. It shares striking similarities in appearance with another Toxostoma member, Bendire's thrasher. Nevertheless, it is recognized for its grey color and sickle-shaped bill. It generally resides in desert regions of the United States and Mexico, but can inhabit areas predominately populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|U-16 {{was ordered}} by the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1915 and laid down at AG Weser in Bremen on later in the month. When completed, the {{submarine}} was broken down into sections, loaded onto railcars, and shipped on 20 August to the Austro-Hungarian Navy's main base at Pula. After completing the eight-day journey, the sections were riveted together. <b>Though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> specific mention of {{how long it took}} for U-16s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine , shipped to Pula from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks.

He took office on June 4, 1792, the day the state was admitted to the Union. Though not actively partisan, he identified with the Democratic-Republicans. Much of his term was devoted to establishing basic laws, military divisions and a tax structure.|$|E

5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. The social structure of the bohor reedbuck is highly flexible. Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river. Males become sexually mature {{at the age of}} three to four years, while females can conceive at just one year of age, reproducing every nine to fourteen months. <b>Though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> fixed breeding season, mating peaks in the rainy season. The gestation period is seven and a half months long, after which a single calf is born. The calves are weaned at eight to nine months of age.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's lieutenancy was {{primarily}} {{of a military}} nature; by the early 14th century, Ireland had become a rebellious and unruly dominion for the English crown. In this capacity Gaveston had considerable success, killing or defeating several major insurgents. He fortified the town of Newcastle McKynegan and Castle Kevin, and rebuilt the road from Castle Kevin to Glendalough. This helped pacify the county {{at least as far}} as the Wicklow Mountains, west of Dublin. In the field of administration he made less of a mark. The most notable issue with which he was involved concerned a dispute over murage – a toll on the town walls – between the citizens of Dublin. As during the regency, <b>though,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence that Gaveston exploited his position for his own advantage and he did nothing to alienate the local elite.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Hastert {{announced}} he would support an Armenian Genocide resolution. Analysts noted {{that at the time}} there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large Armenian community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights Subcommittee of the House and the International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution {{on the eve of the}} full House vote. He explained this by saying that he had received a letter from Bill Clinton asking him to withdraw it, because it would harm U.S. interests. Even <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence that a payment was made, an official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by Sibel Edmonds, that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.|$|E

5|$|Strongly built, {{and compact}} yet elegant, Andalusians have long, thick manes and tails. Their most common coat color is gray, {{although}} {{they can be}} found in many other colors. They are known for their intelligence, sensitivity and docility. A sub-strain within the breed known as the Carthusian, is considered by breeders to be the purest strain of Andalusian, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> genetic evidence for this claim. The strain is still considered separate from the main breed however, and is preferred by breeders because buyers pay more for horses of Carthusian bloodlines. There are several competing registries keeping records of horses designated as Andalusian or PRE, but they differ on their definition of the Andalusian and PRE, the purity of various strains of the breed, and the legalities of stud book ownership. At least one lawsuit is in progress , to determine the ownership of the Spanish PRE stud book.|$|E
5|$|The dark shyshark poses {{no danger}} to humans and {{is too small}} to be of {{commercial}} importance. Many are hooked by sport fishers casting from the shore, who regard the shark as a pest and often kill it. It may also be caught by subsistence fishers and in lobster traps and bottom trawls, though not in substantial quantities. This shark occasionally finds its way into the aquarium trade, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> direct fishing for this purpose. As the dark shyshark remains common and does not seem heavily threatened by human activity, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Its small range does raise concerns that an increase in regional fishing pressure or habitat degradation could impact the entire population.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} Olympic brand {{has been}} controversial. The {{argument}} is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle. Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares. The IOC {{indicated that they would}} address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games. Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, Robertson-Cole {{underwent}} a major reorganization as the company's founders departed, though the corporation remained under majority British ownership. The flagship U.S. distribution business {{changed its name}} to Film Booking Offices of America, a banner under which R-C had released more than a dozen independent productions. The West Coast studio apparently continued to make films under the Robertson-Cole name for some time, but FBO ultimately became the primary identity of the business for production as well as distribution. Between the 1922 reorganization and October 1923, one of the company's new American investors, Pat Powers, was effectively in command. Powers had previously led his own filmmaking company, part of the multiple merger that created the large Universal studio in 1912. Powers apparently changed the name of Robertson-Cole/FBO to the Powers Studio for a brief period, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> record of the company ever having produced or released a film under that banner. In 1923, the studio launched a series of boxing-themed shorts, Fighting Blood, starring George O'Hara. He would become an FBO mainstay, often paired with Alberta Vaughn, in such comedy series as The Pacemakers (1925). Most of O'Hara's and Vaughn's films for the studio were two-reelers—a measure of film length indicating a running time of about twenty minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Theses {{are written}} as propositions to be argued {{in a formal}} {{academic}} disputation, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence that such an event ever took place. In the heading of the Theses, Luther invited interested scholars from other cities to participate. Holding such a debate was a privilege Luther held as a doctor, {{and it was not}} an unusual form of academic inquiry. Luther prepared twenty sets of theses for disputation at Wittenberg between 1516 and 1521. Andreas Karlstadt had written a set of such theses in April 1517, and these were more radical in theological terms than Luther's. He posted them on the door of All Saints' Church, as Luther was alleged to have done with the Ninety-five Theses. Karlstadt posted his theses {{at a time when the}} relics of the church were placed on display, and this may have been considered a provocative gesture. Similarly, Luther posted the Ninety-five Theses on the eve of All Saints' Day, the most important day of the year for the display of relics at All Saints' Church.|$|E
5|$|The Yamato {{tradition}} is the oldest, originating {{as early as}} the 4th century with the introduction of ironworking techniques from the mainland. According to legend, the smith Amakuni forged the first single-edged long swords with curvature (tachi) around 700. Even <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> authentication of this event or date, the earliest Japanese swords were probably forged in Yamato Province. During the Nara period, many good smiths were located around the capital in Nara. They moved to Kyoto when it became capital {{at the beginning of the}} Heian period, but about 1200 smiths gathered again in Nara when the various sects centered in Nara rose to power during the Kamakura period and needed weapons to arm their monks. Thus, the Yamato {{tradition is}} associated closely with the warrior monks of Nara. Yamato tradition sugata is characterized by a deep torii-zori, high shinogi, and slightly extended kissaki. The jihada is mostly masame-hada, and the hamon is suguha, with rough nie. The bōshi is mainly ko-maru. Generally the style of Yamato blades is considered to be restrained, conservative and static. Five major schools or branches of the Yamato tradition are distinguished: Senjuin, Shikkake, Taima, Tegai and Hōshō. Four of the five schools are represented by national treasure swords.|$|E

5|$|There are {{at least}} five {{competing}} theories about the manuscript's place of origin and time of completion. First, the book, or perhaps just the text, may have been created at Iona, then brought to Kells, where the illuminations were perhaps added, and never finished. Second, the book may have been produced entirely at Iona. Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at Kells. Fourth, {{it may have been}} produced in the north of England, perhaps at Lindisfarne, then brought to Iona and from there to Kells. Finally, {{it may have been the}} product of an unknown monastery in Pictish Scotland, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> actual evidence for this theory, especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland. Although the question of the exact location of the book's production will probably never be answered conclusively, the first theory, that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells, is widely accepted. Regardless of which theory is true, it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicle of Melrose reports Clement's death {{under the}} year 1258. Clement's legacy {{was to be}} remembered as the restorer of the diocese of Dunblane and the builder of its cathedral. Thus for future generations, Clement became the father-figure of the see. Clement was later commemorated as a saint, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> record of formal canonisation. He was commemorated on 19 March, meaning that was almost {{certainly}} believed to have been the date of his death. Clement's death was also noted by Walter Bower, a Lowland Scottish historian writing in the 1440s, who included the following obituary: Clement bishop of Dunblane died, that outstanding member of the Order of Preachers, a man most eloquent in translating various tongues, powerful in speech and action in the sight of God and of men. He found the cathedral church of his diocese reduced by the neglect of his predecessors to such a state of decay that the divine offices were celebrated in it scarcely three times a week, as if it were some rural chapel. He built it up to be a hallowed sanctuary, enriched it with lands and possessions, and increased its prestige by adding prebends and canonries. Such flattering sentiments had even been expressed during Clement's lifetime. In 1250, the General Chapter of the Dominican Order met in London, and decreed that: we grant to Friar Clement of our Order, a bishop of Scotland, after his death, one mass throughout the Order by every friar whomsoever is a priest. Although there survives a sermon almost certainly written by him, Clement was also credited with being a prolific translator and writing four books (including a hagiography of St Dominic), all of which are now lost.|$|E
