40|$|AbstractImproving {{reliability}} in {{the context}} of transportation is of great importance. The running-in period allows material to increase its life duration and therefore its availability. This means the modelling of early failures, considering the specific distributions of failure time. Unlike the exponential distribution which is used for random failures, these distributions must have at least two parameters. Despite the fact that the log normal and normal distributions are frequently used to model the effects of aging, the Weibull distribution is probably the most universally used. With it, we can model the early and random failures as well as the effects of aging. The Weibull distribution (3 parameters) describes the situations in which some time t 0 must pass before a failure happens. It is equal to a <b>two-parameter</b> <b>distribution</b> with a right to a translation. This work consists of modelling the influence of running-in time over the duration of additional life...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{description}} of non-steady-state grain growth or precipitate coarsening {{by means of}} object radius distribution functions with multiple time dependent parameters (distribution concept) seems to be promising. The present paper deals with the simplest case of non-steady-state distribution functions with two parameters â€“ the first one scaling the object radius, the second one determining {{the shape of the}} distribution function.

Semi-analytical solutions for the evolving parameters of arbitrary <b>two-parameter</b> <b>distribution</b> functions can be developed. As examples Kirkaldy and Weibull-type distribution functions are investigated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the {{parameters}} of a Pareto mixture. Application of standard techniques to a mixture of Pareto is problematic.

The Pareto distribution is a commonly used model for heavy-tailed data. It is a <b>two-parameter</b> <b>distribution</b> whose shape parameter determines the degree of heaviness of the tail, {{so that it can}} be adapted to data with different features. This work is motivated by an application in the operational risk measurement field: we fit a Pareto mixture to operational losses recorded by a bank in two different business lines. Losses below an unknown threshold are discarded, so that the observed data are truncated. The thresholds used in the two business lines are unknown. Thus, under the assumption that each population follows a Pareto distribution, the appropriate model is a mixture of Pareto where all the parameters have to be estimated. ...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical considerations, {{supported}} by {{statistical analysis of}} 39 annual flood series (AFS) of Italian basins, suggest that the two-component extreme value (TCEV) distribution can be assumed as a parent flood distribution, i. e., one closely representative of the real flood experience.

However, the <b>two-parameter</b> <b>distribution</b> of this family, obtained on the assumption of identically distributed floods, does not account for the high variability of both observed skewness and largest order statistics, so that a significant number of observed floods qualify as outliers under this distribution.

A regionalized TCEV distribution, with parameters representative of a set of 39 Italian AFS's, was shown to closely reproduce the observed distribution of skewness and that of the largest order statistic. ...|$|E
