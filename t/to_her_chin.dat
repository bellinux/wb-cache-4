25|$|Mendoza {{then began}} {{shooting}} {{the rest of}} the hostages one by one, aiming at each of their heads. Amy Leung Ng Yau-woon told of how her husband Ken Leung Kam-wing shielded her with his body and saved her from harm while sacrificing his own life. Similarly, their daughter Jessie Leung Song-yi took two bullets while protecting her older brother, and died as a result. Passenger Joe Chan shielded himself from Mendoza's gunfire with his backpack and survived, but both of his wrists were shattered. Chan's traveling companion was seriously injured by a gunshot <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A king's {{daughter}} {{is full of}} woe. A harpist plays and everyone else falls asleep. He takes her {{on the back of}} his horse to Wearie's Well. He tells her to wade in, and when she expresses her doubts - when she is up to her knee and then her waist - says that no harm will befall her and that he has often watered his horse there. [...] When she is up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> he tells her: ...|$|E
60|$|A puff of {{cold wind}} struck {{her face and}} she shivered. Florence noticed her and pulled up the second robe and tucked it closely round her up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|E
60|$|And colours bright She delighted in; The fiddle to hear, And <b>to</b> lift <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> And sing {{as small}} As a twittering wren.|$|R
50|$|After the wedding, Youngmi is {{continually}} educated by Euna on classical music and manners. Despite {{being treated like}} a dress-up doll or a pupil, she is trying <b>to</b> keep <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> up, and loves her new husband a lot.|$|R
60|$|The {{blood of}} indignation and anger had been rising <b>to</b> Thuvia's face. <b>Her</b> <b>chin</b> was up, a haughty curve upon her perfect lips.|$|R
60|$|So {{she drank}} {{some of the}} wine, and it dribbled on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b> She was not good at {{managing}} a bottle. But she liked the feeling of warmth it gave her. She was very tired.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am better," [...] {{she assured}} him, {{sitting up in}} bed and pulling the clothes <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b> [...] "I am quite well now. Tell me at once where I am and what you are doing over there." ...|$|E
60|$|Soon afterward, when Marian was in bed, and Miss McQuinch, {{according}} to a nightly custom of theirs, was seated on the coverlet with her knees doubled up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> inside her bedgown, they discussed the adventure very earnestly.|$|E
60|$|She was {{as strange}} {{an old woman}} as one could hope {{to see in a}} lifetime. Her nose bent down <b>to</b> meet <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> and <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> bent up <b>to</b> reach <b>her</b> nose; her face was gray with great age, and her hair was as white as snow. She wore a long red cloak over her shoulders, and a great black cat sat {{on the back of her}} chair.|$|R
5000|$|... †† Rebecca Chin of Great Britain was {{originally}} awarded the silver {{medal in the}} women's discus throw F37-38 event. Following a challenge <b>to</b> <b>her</b> classification, <b>Chin</b> was deemed ineligible for the event, stripped of her medal, and her results were erased.|$|R
60|$|Alice did {{not much}} like keeping {{so close to}} her: first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height <b>to</b> rest <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> upon Alice's shoulder, {{and it was an}} uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.|$|R
60|$|ALICE. Good Lord! how {{grim and}} ghastly looks her Grace, With both her knees drawn upward <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b> There was an old-world tomb beside my father's, And this was open'd, {{and the dead}} were found Sitting, and in this fashion; she looks a corpse.|$|E
60|$|Without a word, {{and with}} marvellous rapidity, {{the change was}} effected. Laura {{produced}} from her hand-bag a wig, which she pinned inside her hat and passed over to Quest. Then she flung herself on {{to the bed and}} drew the blanket up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} some one," [...] said she, turning quietly away; and as she resumed her seat a {{sensitive}} flush animated her face, while a trembling ray at once kindled and softened her eye. She raised her hand <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> cast her gaze down, and seemed to think as she waited.|$|E
50|$|Tiz {{said in an}} {{interview}} that she wrote the song about a darker period in her life where she felt like nothing was going her way, but her brother was there <b>to</b> tell <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>chin</b> up, keep moving, and never give up. It was cowritten with Kinetics & One Love, songwriter Emily Warren and was produced by J.R. Rotem and co-produced by Teal Douville.|$|R
5000|$|Tiz {{released}} a follow-up single in 2015, [...] "Whistle (While You Work It)". Tiz {{said in an}} interview that she wrote the song about a darker period in her life where she felt like nothing was going her way, but her brother was there <b>to</b> tell <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>chin</b> up, keep moving, and never give up. It was cowritten with Kinetics & One Love, songwriter Emily Warren and was produced by JR Rotem.|$|R
2500|$|According to William Mann, Mozart disliked prima donna Adriana Ferrarese del Bene, da Ponte's arrogant {{mistress}} {{for whom}} the role of Fiordiligi had been created. Knowing <b>her</b> idiosyncratic tendency <b>to</b> drop <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> on low notes and throw back her head on high ones, Mozart filled her showpiece aria Come scoglio with constant leaps from low to high and high to low {{in order to make}} Ferrarese's head [...] "bob like a chicken" [...] onstage.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{opened his}} eyes to see the bright red sun crimsoning the eastern hills, and {{streaming}} gloriously over the colored forests. He raised himself on his elbow to look around. Nell was still asleep. The blanket was tucked close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b> Her chestnut hair was tumbled like a schoolgirl's; she looked as fresh and sweet as the morning.|$|E
6000|$|She hastily dressed herself, Yeobright moodily {{walking up}} and down the room the whole of the time. At last all her things were on. Her little hands quivered so violently as she held them <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> to fasten her bonnet that she could not tie the strings, and after a few moments she relinquished the attempt. Seeing this he moved forward and said, [...] "Let me tie them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sol Jerrems the storekeeper, {{coming in}} from the back room where he had been drawing {{molasses}} for Farmer Higgins, found perched on top the sugar-barrel a chunky, red-haired, freckle-faced young girl whom he had never seen before. She seemed perfectly at home in his store and sat with her knees drawn up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> and her arms encircling her legs, eyeing soberly the two or three farmers who had come to the Crossing to [...] "trade." ...|$|E
60|$|Kendricks {{had caught}} madame's eye with the glass at his lips. He rose {{at once and}} bowed. Madame {{acknowledged}} his graciousness with a huge smile, which spread even <b>to</b> <b>her</b> double <b>chin.</b> Monsieur leaned forward and joined in the ceremony. Mademoiselle, after a timid glance at her mother, also responded. Kendricks' character as an Englishman of gallantry was thoroughly established.|$|R
5000|$|The Duchess is a {{character}} in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865. Carroll does not describe her physically in much detail, although as stated in Chapter 9 [...] "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height <b>to</b> rest <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> upon Alice’s shoulder..." [...] Her hideous appearance and short stature is strongly established in the popular imagination thanks to John Tenniel's illustrations and from context {{it is clear that}} Alice finds her quite unattractive.|$|R
50|$|Chin {{began selling}} clothes {{out of her}} home in South Minneapolis while {{she and her husband}} raised their five children. Her {{interest}} in food and restaurants began while she was still running her clothing business from <b>her</b> home. <b>Chin</b> cooked free meals and hosted dinner parties for her customers as a way of thanking them for their business. Soon, customers requested that Chin host cooking classes and cater events, according <b>to</b> <b>her</b> daughter, Laura <b>Chin.</b>|$|R
60|$|Trot {{dreamed that}} she was at home in her own bed, but the night seemed chilly {{and she wanted to}} draw the coverlet up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b> She was not wide awake, but {{realized}} {{that she was}} cold and unable to move her arms to cover herself up. She tried, but could not stir. Then she roused herself a little more and tried again. Yes, it was cold, very cold! Really, she MUST do something to get warm, she thought. She opened her eyes and stared at a great wall of ice in front of her.|$|E
60|$|De Stancy then {{prepared}} to leave for England by the first morning train, and roused the night-porter, which functionary, having packed off Abner Power, was discovered asleep on the sofa of the landlord's parlour. At half-past five Paula, who in the interim had been pensively sitting with her hand <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> quite forgetting that she had meant to go to bed, heard wheels without, and looked from the window. A fly had been brought round, {{and one of the}} hotel servants was in the act of putting up a portmanteau with De Stancy's initials upon it. A minute afterwards the captain came to her door.|$|E
60|$|As {{she said}} these words her foot slipped, {{and in another}} moment, splash! she was up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> in salt water. Her first idea {{was that she had}} somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that {{wherever}} you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.|$|E
60|$|Peggotty had {{a basket}} of {{refreshments}} on her knee, which would have lasted us out handsomely, {{if we had been}} going to London by the same conveyance. We ate a good deal, and slept a good deal. Peggotty always went <b>to</b> sleep with <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> upon the handle of the basket, her hold of which never relaxed; and I could not have believed unless I had heard her do it, that one defenceless woman could have snored so much.|$|R
6000|$|He says <b>to</b> <b>her</b> what moves her most. [...] He {{would not}} name his soul within [...] Her hearing,--rather pays her cost [...] With praises <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips and <b>chin.</b> [...] Man has but one soul, 't is ordained, [...] And each soul but one love, I add; [...] Yet souls are damned and love's profaned; [...] These nightingales will sing me mad! [...] The nightingales, the nightingales! ...|$|R
25|$|In September 1987, Chin's mother, Lily Chin, {{moved from}} Oak Park back <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{hometown}} of Guangzhou, China, {{to avoid being}} reminded of the tragedy. She returned to the United States for medical treatment in late 2001, and died on June 9, 2002. Prior <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death, Lily <b>Chin</b> had established a scholarship in Vincent's memory, to be administered by American Citizens for Justice. By the time of Lily's death, Japanese automakers had already started assembling their models stateside.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this moment}} her foot slipped, and splash! {{she was up}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> in salt water. Her first idea {{was that she had}} fallen into the sea: then she remembered that she was under ground, and she soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high. [...] "I wish I hadn't cried so much!" [...] said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out, [...] "I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! Well! that'll be a queer thing, to be sure! However, every thing is queer today." [...] Very soon she saw {{something}} splashing about in the pool near her: at first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was herself, and soon made out that it was only a mouse, that had slipped in like herself.|$|E
60|$|Before {{he could}} answer her further she was up-stairs, {{and had her}} child in her arms. It {{seemed to be an}} age since the boy had been stolen from her in the early spring in that unknown, dingy street near Tottenham Court Road. Twice she had seen her darling since that,--twice during his captivity; but on each of these {{occasions}} she had seen him as one not belonging to herself, and had seen him under circumstances which had robbed the greeting of almost all its pleasure. But now he was her own again, to take whither she would, to dress and to undress, to feed, to coax, to teach, and to caress. And the child lay close up to her as she hugged him, putting up his little cheek <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> and burying himself happily in her embrace. He had not much as yet to say, but she could feel that he was contented.|$|E
6000|$|She had a {{compartment}} {{to herself}} in the train from London to Morningside Park, and she sat with both {{her feet on the}} seat in an attitude that would certainly have distressed her mother to see, and horrified her grandmother beyond measure; she sat with her knees up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> and her hands clasped before them, and she was so lost in thought that she discovered with a start, from a lettered lamp, that she was at Morningside Park, and thought she was moving out of the station, whereas she was only moving in. [...] "Lord!" [...] she said. She jumped up at once, caught up a leather clutch containing notebooks, a fat text-book, and a chocolate-and-yellow-covered pamphlet, and leaped neatly from the carriage, only to discover that the train was slowing down and that she had to traverse the full length of the platform past it again as the result of her precipitation. [...] "Sold again," [...] she remarked. [...] "Idiot!" [...] She raged inwardly while she walked along with that air of self-contained serenity that is proper to a young lady of nearly two-and-twenty under the eye of the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "No gent," [...] said Corny, [...] "would {{talk to a}} lady {{like you}} done. Fie upon you, Willie! Even if she happens to be your wife {{you ought to have}} more respect for your clothes than <b>to</b> <b>chin</b> <b>her</b> back that way. Maybe it ain't my butt-in, but it goes, anyhow--you strike me as bein' a whole lot to the wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>chin</b> {{certainly}} trembled. And she {{was looking}} at me with extreme attention. I made a step nearer <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chair.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help {{blushing}} as I declined, for I felt we were on my weak point, now. But Miss Mowcher, finding that I was not at present disposed for any decoration {{within the range of}} her art, and that I was, for the time being, proof against the blandishments of the small bottle which she held up before one eye <b>to</b> enforce <b>her</b> persuasions, said we would make a beginning on an early day, and requested the aid of my hand <b>to</b> descend from <b>her</b> elevated station. Thus assisted, she skipped down with much agility, and began <b>to</b> tie <b>her</b> double <b>chin</b> into <b>her</b> bonnet.|$|R
