5|$|Savage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, {{has responded}} by {{releasing}} a lengthy statement, {{along with a}} selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> were taken out of context.|$|E
5|$|Sports mascots {{have been}} cited {{as an example of}} microaggressions, the {{everyday}} insults that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to in <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> and actions of other groups in society.|$|E

40|$|It will {{be shown}} that <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> [1] {{contains}} numerous errors, misconceptions, inaccuracies, false assumptions, misunderstandings and unjustified claims. The analysis of <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> is built on a false assumption that the terminal current of an antenna fed by a waveguide is independent of frequency. This false assumption arises from the misunderstandings on the basic theory of transmission lines and misconceptions of normalization for a linear system. As a result, all the equations obtained from the assumption in <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> are incorrect, and the related discussions are untruthful. The delta gap source modeling has been abused in <b>the</b> <b>comment,</b> and this {{is reflected in the}} numerical results in <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> that give rise to negative stored energy. The main results of <b>the</b> <b>commented</b> paper have been misinterpreted by the authors of <b>the</b> <b>comment,</b> and <b>the</b> related analysis is established on illogical reasoning. <b>The</b> <b>comment</b> fails to pinpoint any errors in <b>the</b> <b>commented</b> paper. Instead, it reveals that the main results obtained by the authors of <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> in their previous publication [2] are incorrect. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>comment</b> in text format {{contains}} sarcasm, linguistic problems etc. To {{predict the}} sentiment of that comment {{we have to}} understand the nature and ambience of <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> thoroughly, as a single word can create a contradiction about the polarity of <b>the</b> <b>comment.</b> However, this aspect is also not considered in this paper.|$|R
25|$|The related {{concept of}} {{maternal}} mind-mindedness assesses the mother's {{ability to understand}} and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness {{has been found to}} be related to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's comment is deemed an appropriate mind-related <b>comment</b> if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent coder, if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> associated <b>the</b> infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> encouraged <b>the</b> infant to go on with his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> about <b>the</b> current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> deters <b>the</b> infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> is unclear, it is deemed a in-appropriate mind-related comment and correlates to low mind-mindedness.|$|R
5|$|At {{least two}} {{complaints}} {{were made to}} RCMP about <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> {{by one of the}} parade organizers, Inderjit Singh Bains, on Sher-E-Punjab radio. During part of the show hosted by Gurvinder Dhaliwal, Bains spoke about the importance of honouring the Sikh faith and some logistics of the Surrey, B.C., parade that draws tens of thousands of people.|$|E
5|$|Barton told ESPN that {{he would}} not return to Queens Park Rangers after the loan spell, and he also said that he only joined the club for money because his partner was expecting a child. Following <b>the</b> <b>comments,</b> on 25 November 2012, he made his league debut in a 1–0 home win against Lille. In his third league {{appearance}} on 2 December, Barton provided the assists for both Souleymane Diawara's and André Ayew's goals as Marseille defeated Brest 2–1 to remain two points behind leaders Lyon.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} week of the program several HouseGuests made {{controversial}} remarks during several arguments on the live Internet feeds.

5000|$|An Ed Comment is {{intended}} to be an interjection from the editor, inserted into a body of text as if spoken in real-time. <b>The</b> <b>comment</b> is italicised and bracketed, and the suffix [...] - Ed is attached to <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> to show that it is from the editor.

5000|$|The McCain {{campaign}} {{called for}} an apology from Senator Rockefeller and for Barack Obama, whom Rockefeller endorsed, to denounce <b>the</b> <b>comment.</b> Rockefeller later apologized for <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> and <b>the</b> Obama campaign issued a statement expressing Obama's disagreement with <b>the</b> <b>comment.</b> Senator Lindsey Graham (R) of South Carolina noted that [...] "John didn't drop bombs from 35,000 feet....the bombs were not laser guided (in the 1960 and 1970s)".|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Comment</b> had {{its start}} in 1927.

[...] Today, <b>The</b> <b>Comment</b> has about 20 staff writers and prints nine newspapers per semester printing 1100 copies each time. It is funded by the SGA (Student Government Association). <b>The</b> <b>Comment</b> has a website that is updated daily with news about the school and sports at Bridgewater State University, but also with current news of the nation. Their main motive is to relate the stories back to Bridgewater students. With that being said, {{it is a common}} occurrence to see faces and stories of students in <b>the</b> newspaper. <b>The</b> <b>Comment</b> focuses on upcoming events rather than reviews to catch hold of the reader’s interest.|$|R

5|$|The band's live {{performances}} at large venues {{such as the}} Sydney Entertainment Centre was criticised by some fans, as the band had previously stated they disliked playing to large crowds.

5|$|The {{day after}} being fired, Savage apologized {{on his radio}} program and on his website. He {{explained}} that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller {{and that he was}} off the air {{at the time of the}} offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made <b>the</b> <b>comments.</b> He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Comment</b> of Ankh F N Khonsu is {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} part of Liber Al vel Legis. At other times, it {{is considered to be a}} different document. In either instance, it has been understood by some to mean that no discussion of any of the Holy Books may take place, despite the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Comment,</b> which was written after all of the Holy Books were written, only applies to the Book of the Law. According to this interpretation, which appears to be Crowley's as well, the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Comment</b> is to allow others to interpret Liber Al vel Legis for themselves; in other words, no one is to preach its contents or tell you their understanding of it is the one true understanding. However, <b>the</b> <b>Comment</b> also prohibits <b>the</b> study of the Book of the Law! The punishment for violating <b>the</b> <b>Comment</b> is anathema (shunning).|$|R
5|$|The editing of {{the events}} in {{question}} during the broadcast episodes created controversy for the show and CBS, the broadcaster of Big Brother. While <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> couldn't air due to FCC regulations, the way the events were edited caused critics and fans of the show to claim the show was being edited to make the HouseGuests look good to the viewing public. One critic suggests the recent decline in ratings {{is due to the}} editing process of the show.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue was}} {{resolved}} on May 23, 2008 when BK CEO John Chidsey announced {{an agreement with}} the CIW granting the requested 1¢ pay increase to the workers.

Additionally, the company agreed to provide a ½¢ per pound payment to the CIW to cover payroll taxes and administrative costs for the tomato growers.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1911, Caragiale studied Romanian {{heraldry}} and, to this goal, read Octav-George Lecca's Familii boierești române ("Romanian Boyar Families"). Many of <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> {{added by}} {{him to his}} {{copy of the book}} are polemic, sarcastic, or mysterious, while the sketches he made on the margin include portrayals of boyars being put to death in various ways, as well as caricatures (such as a blazon displaying a donkey's head, which he mockingly assigned to Octav-George Lecca himself). Several of the heraldic objects he created were destined for his own use. In June 1928, he raised a green over yellow ensign he created for the Caragiale family at his property in Fundulea. He also hoisted other symbols, including the flag of Hungary, which, he claimed, underlined his foreign origin.|$|E

5|$|Following Armageddon, Orton {{entered the}} 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, {{but he was}} {{eliminated}} by Rey Mysterio. Mysterio won the match and a title shot, and Orton urged him to put the title shot at stake in a match at No Way Out. In the weeks preceding No Way Out, Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, {{in an attempt to}} gain villain heat. Many fans felt <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005. Orton won at No Way Out, earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle. On April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton was pinned by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Bolt {{responded to}} {{claims that he}} was a lazy athlete, saying that <b>the</b> <b>{{comments}}</b> were unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event, and chose to not make the effort to train for distance running. Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could excel in multiple events—first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece. Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused in practice, and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode {{can be traced back}} to an early idea Vince Gilligan, the writer of the episode, had. His {{original}} idea featured a man holding an individual hostage on a Tilt-A-Whirl. Gilligan pitched this idea at several meetings and it soon became a recurring joke. Most of <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> Gilligan received noted that his premise lacked an explicit mystery to investigate and so Gilligan decided that after the ride was shut off, the man's head would explode. Researching various government experiments, Gilligan discovered the controversial use of low-frequency waves. The secret military experiment featured in this episode is based on two real-life military experiments, Project HAARP and Project ELF. The former is a U.S. Army experiment dealing with electromagnetic radiation in the Earth's ionosphere, and the second is a U.S. Navy experiment dealing with long wavelengths. Thus, a script was crafted that featured an individual that, due to a secret experiment, could not slow down for fear of rupturing his head.|$|E

5000|$|The {{solution}} to [...] "over commenting" [...] is to separate <b>the</b> mechanical <b>comments</b> and <b>the</b> substantive <b>comments.</b> <b>The</b> mechanical <b>comments</b> encourage <b>the</b> student {{to see the}} paper as a fixed piece that just needs some editing. <b>The</b> substantive <b>comments,</b> however, suggest that the student still needs to develop the meaning by doing more research.|$|R

5|$|The re-interment in the Mussolini family crypt in Predappio {{was carried}} out on 1 September 1957, with {{supporters}} present giving the fascist salute. Mussolini was laid to rest in a large stone sarcophagus. The tomb is decorated with fascist symbols and contains a large marble head of Mussolini. In front of the tomb is a register for visitors paying their respects to sign. The tomb has become a neo-fascist place of pilgrimage. The numbers signing the tomb's register range from dozens to hundreds per day, with thousands signing on certain anniversaries; almost all <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> left are supportive of Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|Yagan's skull {{was handed}} over to the Noongar {{delegation}} at a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 31 August 1997. In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, earlier that day: That is how nature goes... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer. Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at <b>the</b> <b>comments.</b> Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.|$|E
5|$|In the November general {{election}} Hatfield faced Democratic incumbent Robert D. Holmes. In {{the final days}} of the campaign U.S. Senator Wayne Morse, a Democrat, implied Hatfield lied in his trial regarding the deadly car accident when he was 17. This tactic backfired as the press denounced <b>the</b> <b>comments,</b> as did Holmes and other Democrats. Hatfield defeated Holmes, winning 55.3% of the vote in the election. That same election saw the Democratic Party gain a majority in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since 1878. Holmes' defeat was attributed in part to the image and charisma portrayed by Hatfield and in part due to the campaign issues such as the declining economy, increased taxation, capital punishment, labor, and education. After the election, Holmes attempted to appoint David O'Hara as Secretary of State to replace Hatfield, who would have to resign to become governor. Hatfield appointed Howell Appling, Jr. to the office, and O'Hara challenged the appointment in state court. The Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hatfield on the constitutional issue, with the appointment of Appling confirmed. He was the youngest governor in the history of Oregon at that point in time at the age of 36.|$|E
