5000|$|A <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> is the <b>hiring</b> of {{a vessel}} for a {{specific}} period of time; the owner still manages the vessel but the charterer selects the ports and directs the vessel where to go. The charterer pays for all fuel the vessel consumes, port charges, commissions, and a daily hire to {{the owner of the}} vessel.|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} {{published}} {{a guide for}} each of the two types of contract between merchant and shipowner: <b>Time</b> <b>Charters</b> and Voyage Charters. In a Voyage <b>Charter,</b> the charterer <b>hires</b> the vessel for a single voyage, while the vessel’s owner provides the master, crew, bunkers and supplies. In a <b>Time</b> <b>Charter,</b> the vessel is hired for a specific amount of time. The vessel’s owner still manages the vessel but the charterer directs the vessel’s operation, and may sub-charter the vessel.|$|R
50|$|The freight market {{consists}} of shipowners, charterers and brokers. They use {{four types of}} contractual arrangements: the voyage charter, the contract of affreightment, the <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> and the bareboat charter. Shipowners contract to carry cargo for an agreed price per tonne while the <b>charter</b> market <b>hires</b> out ships for a certain period. A charter is legally agreed upon in a charter-party in which {{the terms of the}} deal are clearly set out.|$|R
50|$|A trip <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> is a {{comparatively}} short <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> agreed for a specified route only (as {{opposed to the}} standard <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> where charterer is free to employ the vessel within agreed trading areas).|$|R

5000|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called <b>chartering.</b> Tankers are <b>hired</b> by {{four types of}} charter agreements: the voyage <b>charter,</b> the <b>time</b> <b>charter,</b> the bareboat charter, and {{contract}} of affreightment. In a voyage charter the charterer rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port. In a <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments. A completed chartering contract {{is known as a}} charter party.|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} major {{shipping}} companies which operate fleets comprised largely of vessels which are <b>time</b> <b>chartered</b> and subsequently sub-chartered on voyage terms. Legal risks will arise {{for the time}} charterer due the differing natures and terms of <b>time</b> and voyage <b>charters.</b> The essential question examined in this thesis is that of whether, and to what extent, legal risk can be minimized by the negotiation of equivalent contractual terms under <b>time</b> and voyage <b>charter</b> parties. The key areas addressed in this thesis are delivery under <b>time</b> <b>charters</b> compared to readiness under voyage <b>charters,</b> off <b>hire</b> under <b>time</b> <b>charters</b> versus suspension of laytime under voyage charters, obligations relating to cleanliness of cargo spaces, rights and responsibilities relative to safe berths and ports, the time charterer's position under bills of lading, and issues relating to redelivery of the vessel and consequent voyage charter liability if the vessel is unable to undertake the final voyage. The methodology applied is {{an examination of the}} case law, with a primary focus on the extensive body of English jurisprudence. This analysis of the case law is accompanied by a consideration of provisions of major charter party forms. The analysis leads to the conclusion that risk, to varying degrees, can be minimized through the application and clarification of contractual language. With respect to readiness of the vessel it is considered that risk will be reduced through agreeing contractual language which requires early notification of the vessel's delay. As regards off hire and laytime wording that clarifies non physical deficiencies is proposed. With regard to vessel cargo spaces intermediate cleanliness is identified as the greatest risk. Safe port and berth warranties are determined to represent an area of easily manageable risk, while letters of indemnity relating to bills of lading continue to represent very significant risk with suggested but no certain solution. Finally, with respect to redelivery a final voyage clause for <b>time</b> <b>charters</b> has been proposed which serves to almost eliminate risk in this area. Therefore, it is broadly concluded that risk can be managed but not eliminated through drafting of appropriate contractual terms...|$|R

50|$|The <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> {{equivalent}} (TCE) rate is {{a standard}} shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot <b>charters,</b> <b>time</b> <b>charters</b> and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. TCE revenue is a non-GAAP measure.|$|R
50|$|The Spot Department is {{designated}} for the executing of vessel chartering, which includesvoyage <b>charters,</b> <b>time</b> <b>charters,</b> and bareboat charters.

40|$|Present global {{economic}} crisis {{had a strong}} impact on the maritime market. A drastic decline of freight rates and <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> rates was almost immediately visi-ble in the tramp shipping segment. Irrespectively {{of the fact that}} global crisis cau-sed fuel prices to drop as well, many shipping companies found themselves in a very unenviable position, struggling to cover their costs. The authors have analysed the breakeven point for the dry bulk Handymax ship given in the <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> as well as a breakeven point for the same size ship engaged in grain transport from the US Gulf towards Japan. The results demon-strate that in time of crisis the breakeven point in <b>time</b> <b>chartering</b> is achieved by 15 years old Handymax ship that has never changed the owner. In other circumstan-ces the operating results would be different, probably ending up in a loss. Freight rates in the analysed voyage charter, although significantly lower than before the crisis, still permitted the owner to operate with profit. Recent recovery, both in the freight rates {{as well as in the}} <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> rates, gives hope for the shipping indu-stry as a whole.

50|$|A {{charter party}} is the {{contract}} between {{the owner of a}} vessel and the charterer for the use of a vessel. The charterer takes over the vessel for either a certain amount of <b>time</b> (a <b>time</b> <b>charter)</b> or for a certain point-to-point voyage (a voyage charter), giving rise to these two main types of charter agreement. There is a subtype of <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> called the demise or bareboat charter.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to compare and analyze principles, rules and case law applicable to <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> indemnity provisions in situations where the shipowner incurs greater liability for bills of lading inconsistent with charterparty terms, under Norwegian and English law. This {{is an issue that}} has been discussed for many years and still preserves its classic importance. In addition, this dissertation aims to contribute to the analysis of the following legal questions: 1) How indemnities have been understood in <b>time</b> <b>charters</b> under Norwegian and English law?; 2) Whether or not solutions on indemnities in <b>time</b> <b>charters</b> would be similar in Norway and England, in situations where the shipowner incurs greater liability for bills of lading inconsistent with charterparty terms...|$|R
50|$|Time charter: In a <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> {{the owner}} {{provides}} a vessel that is fully manned and equipped. The owner provides the crew, but the crew takes {{orders from the}} charterer. The owner is also responsible for insuring the vessel, repairs the vessel may need, engine parts and food for the ship's personnel. The charterer is responsible for everything else. The main advantage of the <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> is that it diverts the costs of running a ship to the charterer.|$|R
50|$|The demise or {{bareboat charter}} is a subtype of <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> {{in which the}} {{charterer}} takes responsibility for the crewing and maintenance of the ship during the <b>time</b> of the <b>charter,</b> assuming the legal responsibilities of the owner and {{is known as a}} disponent owner.|$|R

50|$|Lemhi Gold went to {{the front}} shortly after the start and set the pace from Awaasif, Diamond Shoal, Sun Princess and Caerleon with <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> towards the back of the field. Diamond Shoal overtook Lemhi Gold with three furlongs left to run and led the field into the straight, at which point Caerleon began to {{struggle}} and drop back. With two furlongs left to run Diamond Shoal held a clear advantage from Awaasif and Sun Princess, with <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> making rapid progress on the outside. Diamond Shoal was still ahead at the furlong pole but was then overtaken by <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> who won by three quarters of a length with Sun Princess a length away in third ahead of Awaasif. There was a gap of five lengths back to Lancastrian in fifth and further long gaps back to Carlingford Castle, Rocamadour and Lemhi Gold. Caerleon finished last after being virtually pulled up by Eddery in the closing stages.|$|R
50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Charter’s</b> next {{race was}} the Eclipse Stakes {{for which she}} was favourite. Mercer held up the filly for her late finish but {{did not get a}} clear run and {{finished}} a fast finishing second to Sadler’s Wells. He received some criticism for this performance but retained the ride on <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> was fifth behind Teenoso in this race and Mercer was not asked to ride her again in her remaining (unsuccessful) races. On King George day Mercer did have an interesting winner when Peter Walwyn’s, two-year-old debutant, Khozaam won the Granville Stakes in impressive style. He followed this up with an equally impressive victory in the Washington Singer Stakes at Newbury. Khozaam finished off his season with a close second to Reach in the Royal Lodge Stakes, despite being hit over the head by Reach’s jockey’s whip. Mercer rode 49 winners in 1984.|$|R
2500|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} that <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> would run at York Racecourse in August, contesting either the Yorkshire Oaks or the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup but was sidelined by a respiratory infection, described as [...] "a dirty nose". She eventually returned for the Sun Chariot Stakes, a Group Two race over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October, {{in which she was}} again asked to concede weight to her rivals. <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won [...] "smoothly" [...] by three-quarters of a length from Stanerra an Irish four-year-old who {{went on to win the}} Japan Cup in 1983. Two weeks later, <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> ran in the Champion Stakes over the same course and distance and started second favourite at odds of 9/2 behind Kalaglow the winner of the Eclipse Stakes and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The other runners included the 2000 Guineas winner Zino and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Buzzard's Bay. Newnes settled <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> towards the rear of the field before moving forward along the rails three and a half furlongs from the finish. The filly was initially unable to obtain a clear run and Newnes had to force her through a gap between Montekin and the tiring Kalaglow, appearing to bump the latter. Once in the clear, <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> quickly took the lead and accelerated away from the field to win impressively by seven lengths, the biggest margin in the history of the race. It had been intended to retire the filly at the end of the season and have her covered by Northern Dancer, but following her win at Newmarket, it was decided that she would remain in training.|$|R
