25|$|Some {{aspects of}} brane physics {{have been applied}} to {{cosmology}}. For example, brane gas cosmology attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is {{the largest number of}} spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>lots</b> of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.|$|E
25|$|Nest refoundation by colonies that {{lose the}} {{original}} one is pretty common, and allows this species of wasps {{to thrive in}} highly disturbed landscapes, that face frequent fires or other disturbances. When the nest is destroyed or goes lost, the swarm just moves to a near point (a branch or else) and begins another nest. Sometimes, when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>lots</b> of wasps, the swarm may break up and create several new little nests. Only {{the one with the}} foundress in it will produce female offspring and complete the cycle, while the other ones will end up producing worker males. If one of those secondary nests is lost, its workers will rather rejoin a near group of other sisters instead of trying to found it again.|$|E
25|$|Popper {{regarded}} {{theories that}} have survived criticism as better corroborated {{in proportion to}} the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, {{in sharp contrast to the}} inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true. Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>lots</b> of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).|$|E

25|$|The {{architecture}} is best understood and {{is almost always}} broken up into four groups and then looking at how architecture changed or didn’t change within those groups. The four groups are: May, Satunsat, and Ah Canul/Canul and Dzib. These groups make up the urban center, and are almost exclusively monumental architecture. They were defined by the excavation team and they’re essentially just a cluster of buildings, or a building (Madrid, 1991). There’s {{a lot more than}} just these four groups; the rest just hasn’t been excavated really, since there was such a heavy focus on excavating monumental architecture. Most of what’s been excavated at Oxkintok is temples, palaces, and multiroom structures. To trace the changes in architecture of the site, the above chart (Fig. 7) was compiled. It’s a compilation of data from the three sources listed below figure 7. It is evident that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>lots</b> of major changes between the three periods, and in general it's a transition from irregular design to a more elaborate, very planned out geometric design with decoration and complex stucco art and stone wrought decorations. One thing that remains consistent the use of domes and arches for entryways and open spaces. Concerning the individual groups, there's a concentration of Proto Puuc in the Ah-Canul group and Early Oxkintok in the May group that was later modified in the Proto Puuc phase, but no group is confined to one phase.|$|E
25|$|Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air is {{structured}} much like other three previous {{games in the}} series with some major twists. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>lots</b> of improvements in gameplay overall compared to others. It {{is more of a}} quest-like adventure than a traditional hidden object game, a mixing of adventure and puzzle game. Featuring loads of puzzles and logical quests with different difficulties, The Book of Air still assure that puzzles are well-tricky and tightly blended with the story, which is a typical feature of quest or click-and-point games, such as: putting together parts of broken statues, reconstructing tricky mechanisms, unscrambling messages using the power of Dream Jewels and many more. There are no lists of items to find but a huge amount of inventory based puzzles, logical riddles and quests to solve, which have been scattered through the locations in the game. The objects that players find may be used in a scene other than the one they found it in. Objects will stay in inventory until players need to use them. All objects that players are able to pick up will serve a purpose, whether they are used in that scene or not. A lot of times in this game the pieces players pick up may only be used as they get to the next scene. Some items may not become visible in a scene right away, players must perform other tasks first before they become visible.|$|E

500|$|Following {{confirmation}} {{about the}} artist's withdrawal, the journal's Aaron Spencer said local residents are being {{deprived of the}} sculpture's [...] "disturbing fantastical whimsy". In an article called [...] "Let's save the giant baby-faced deer statue!", he wrote: [...] "As we all know, I love this statue. I love it a lot. And I think we can save it. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>lots</b> of places in Portland that could use some beautification, and a little public art {{can go a long}} way."

500|$|Stevenson {{described}} {{the character of}} Marion as [...] "cranky, stubborn and lonely", saying that living alone has made her [...] "become quite idiotic and eccentric".

Stevenson compared her own difficulties of parenting to Marion's, saying [...] "it is easier for me than someone like Marion because I have had 14 years experience". Richards spoke {{of the character of}} April, saying that [...] "the residential schools and children's homes were completely different from my life.

500|$|While Levine praised [...] "its bright, cartoony visuals [...] are a notch above {{those of}} many other {{animated}} series," [...] Sinnott considered some of the animation to be [...] "a little stilted." [...] Sinnott called it [...] "a fun series overall", but considered some jokes to be [...] "a little stale". Neil Dorsett of DVD Verdict was generally disappointed; he called voice acting [...] "very standard", and said that [...] "artwork and animation are also both behind the times". Dorsett also criticized Virgil's one-lines, which [...] "invites, like many {{other elements of the}} series, comparison to Spider-Man." [...] He, however, pondered that his opinion may come from a bad first impression: [...] "Although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>lots</b> of things to nitpick about the show, there's not really anything wrong with it." [...] Both Sinnott and Dorsett compared it unfavorably to the original comic book.|$|E
