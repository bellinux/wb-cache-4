5|$|While {{there will}} {{naturally}} {{have been some}} changes throughout the centuries, this section only tries to give a general overview over <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> was recorded in detail in numerous 19th century merchants' handbooks.|$|E
5|$|The Muslims found {{themselves}} in greater difficulties by day. Food was running short, and nights were colder. The lack of sleep made matters worse. So tense was <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that,</b> for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community. Only at night, when the attacks stopped due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship. According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became serious and fear was everywhere.|$|E
5|$|For the German side, {{the battle}} left the 18th Army very {{stretched}} and exhausted. Lacking sufficient reinforcements, {{the command of}} Army Group North {{made the decision to}} shorten the front line by evacuating the Demyansk Pocket salient. The salient had been held throughout 1942, despite being encircled for a few months, as it was an important strategic bridgehead. Together with the Rzhev salient (which was also evacuated in spring 1943), it could potentially be used to encircle a large number of Soviet forces. However, in <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> had developed, retaining it was no longer possible.|$|E

5000|$|United States - Undertaking is {{typically}} allowed on multi-lane roadways or to pass left-turning vehicles. [...] State laws can vary as to <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> permit undertaking.|$|R
30|$|These {{differences}} re-emphasize {{the importance}} of the local monitoring to develop a more comprehensive view of <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> may lead materials to fail or not at given sites.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> arose {{after the}} {{incapacity}} of President Wilson, for which Marshall's vice-presidency is most remembered, revived {{the national debate}} {{on the process of}} presidential succession. The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson's incapacity during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue. The constitutional flaws in the process of presidential succession had been known since the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem. Nearly fifty years later, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers and duties any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers and duties of the office.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} sculpture, Seneb's size {{required}} {{the creator of}} the reliefs to make some unusual artistic choices. The standard convention of depicting higher status through physical size was maintained by portraying Seneb as being larger than his retainers, although this was clearly the opposite of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> actually existed. On the other hand, he is still shown with the physical characteristics of a dwarf. Unusually for such a relief, his wife is not pictured alongside him but appears separately. This may have been done to avoid the complications that would have arisen from needing to depict the couple's relative sizes realistically while still portraying Seneb as the larger party, as convention would have dictated. Seneb is also not shown carrying out typical male activities such as hunting, which was presumably impractical for someone of his stature, although one relief shows him pulling on papyrus reeds to guide his boat through the marshes of the Nile Delta.|$|E
5|$|For {{its part}} the government, not {{consulting}} Solidarity, adopted {{a plan of}} economic measures {{that could only be}} implemented by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.|$|E

5000|$|The blurb was {{incorrect}} in that [...] "Sapper's" [...] Bulldog Drummond stories were not parodied, although {{the character and}} <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> he encountered were briefly mentioned in The Adventure of the Sinister Stranger.|$|R
5000|$|... 2 Little, 2 Late is a 1999 film {{produced}} by Deadpool Pictures {{that tells the}} stories of different students at a local high school and how they dealt with <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> arose after racial tensions erupted.|$|R
25|$|Adding to <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> day was {{the fact}} that Leonid Brezhnev was embarking on a trip to Crimea. Authorities wanted to give the Soviet leader a clear flight path and this caused {{considerable}} disruption of the airline flight operations in the area.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{many things}} that Hitler wrote, many of the {{programs}} and policies that he instituted in Germany, {{but we do not}} blindly copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> we face here in America today.|$|E
25|$|In other instances, Edward {{conducted}} private sessions {{away from}} the studio audience.The subjects of these segments later talked in greater detail about <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> led to their reading with Edward and the effect the reading had on their lives. Periodically, segments revisit people who have previously appeared on the show.|$|E

50|$|The {{series is}} narrated in the first-person from Sven's point of view, giving the reader a limited scope on <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> {{surround}} Sven, {{but as the}} series progresses, Sven gets more and more entwined into the galactic politics surrounding him.|$|R
40|$|Two studies tested <b>the</b> idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> people {{encounter}} {{frequently and}} <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> they associate most strongly with an emotion differ across cultures {{in ways that}} can be understood from what a culture condones or condemns. In a questionnaire study, N = 163 students from the United States and Japan perceived situations as more frequent {{to the extent that}} they elicited condoned emotions (anger in the United States, shame in Japan), and they perceived situations as less frequent {{to the extent that they}} elicited condemned emotions (shame in the United States, anger in Japan). In a second study, N = 160 students from the United States and Japan free-sorted <b>the</b> same <b>situations.</b> For each emotion, <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> could be organized along two cross-culturally common dimensions. Those <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> touched upon central cultural concerns were perceived to elicit stronger emotions. The largest cultural differences were found for shame; smaller, yet meaningful, differences were found for anger. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Another type {{of social}} anxiety is the FoBM (fear of being missed). It comes from <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> we can't produce share-content {{for people to}} consume. The FoBM is a {{counterpart}} of FoMO; however, compared to FoMO it may have a more serious impact since the exclusion from the conversation can result in continuous exclusion later.|$|E
25|$|Overall, these {{agreements}} serve two main purposes. First, they eliminate dual Social Security taxation, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> {{occurs when a}} worker from one country works in another country and is required to pay Social Security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Second, the agreements help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March, {{at press}} conference in Novo-Ogaryovo President Putin {{expressed}} his view on <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> if a revolution took place in Ukraine, {{it is a new}} country with which Russia did not conclude any treaties. He brought up an analogy with events of 1917 in Russia, when {{as a result of the}} revolution the Russian Empire fell apart and a new state was created. However, he stated Ukraine would still have to honour its debts.|$|E

25|$|It {{is through}} Charlie's anguish {{that the reader}} catches a glimpse of Merrick's {{interest}} in the problems the gay male experiences establishing an identity. Charlie's socially imposed resistance {{is in contrast to}} Peter's childlike innocence. When Charlie eventually throws Peter out and marries a woman to protect his reputation, every reader, straight or gay, can detest his duplicity and weakness, but must also empathize with <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> Charlie has had forced upon him by an intolerant society.|$|E
25|$|She {{was kidnapped}} by the FARC on the {{outskirts}} of Valledupar and was later killed. Her body was found with two shots in the head and with gunpowder burns, indicating that the shots were probably fired at close distance by her kidnappers. Her family, the Colombian government, and the OAS condemned the FARC as the party responsible for the murder. The FARC blamed the Army for provoking <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> led to her death.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Aurangzeb, enraged with <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> the British {{fortified}} in Madras, occupied territory around it, captured Mughal ships, {{went into}} alliance with his enemy Sambhaji, he ordered his commanders everywhere in India to exterminate British {{from the country}} and seize their properties anywhere to be found.

25|$|In June 1844, the Synod met in Kingston, Ontario, and paralleled <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> had {{affected}} the Scottish Assembly in 1843, {{when a large}} group also withdrew, and formed a Free Church of Scotland Canadian Synod. By the following September, most of the theological students at Queen's had joined the Free Church, proceeded to Toronto and founded Knox College; they had merged with the aforementioned United Presbyterian Church of Scotland college in 1861, which had moved to Toronto from London, Ontario in 1853.|$|E
25|$|During the Civil War, {{bands of}} Union Kansans known as Jayhawkers had raided east into Confederate Missouri. At the war's close, they {{remained}} {{as a force}} in Kansas. The crossing point for the Texas herds into Kansas/Missouri was at the town of Baxter Springs in {{the southeast corner of}} Kansas. And here the Jayhawkers stopped them cold, stealing some herds and generally forcing the rest to stay in the Indian Territory. This was <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> Story found when he arrived at Baxter Springs.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> the Army of the Holy War and the Palestinian {{forces were}} in was worse. They could {{not rely on}} any form of foreign support and had to get by on the funds that Mohammad Amin al-Husayni could raise. The troops' {{armament}} was limited to what the fighters already had. To make things even worse, {{they had to be}} content with arms bought on the black market or pillaged from British warehouses, and, as a result, did not really have enough arms to wage war.|$|E
2500|$|Works from Raymond Novaco in the 1970s {{have contributed}} {{to many of the}} recent ideas on the {{management}} of anger. These ideas have led to the implementation of different anger management programs. Novaco stressed the importance of looking at <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> led up to the anger in order to have control over the anger. He stated that anger is an emotional response to <b>situations,</b> and <b>that</b> anger occurs in three modalities, either cognitive, somaticaffective or behavioral. [...] After discovering the anger, there should be discussion and self-examination in order to relieve the anger. This process was thought to help the client identify <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> lead to anger and deal with the anger depending on the step that the anger is occurring in. The client is able to use different relaxation skills to reduce their anger before it advances.|$|R
