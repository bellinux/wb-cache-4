Only in rare cases of a mosaicism, {{the presence of a}} normal cell line, in addition to the <b>trisomic</b> cell line, may support the development of a viable trisomy of the other chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Meiotic CPM - Alternatively, CPM {{can occur}} through the {{mechanism}} of <b>trisomic</b> rescue. If a <b>trisomic</b> conception undergoes <b>trisomic</b> rescue in certain cells, including those that are destined to become the baby, then the remaining trisomy cells may be confined to the placenta.|$|E

50|$|Confined placental mosaicism (CPM) {{represents}} a {{discrepancy between the}} chromosomal makeup of the cells in the placenta and the cells in the baby. CPM was first described by Kalousek and Dill in 1983. CPM is diagnosed when some <b>trisomic</b> cells are detected on chorionic villus sampling and only normal cells are found on a subsequent prenatal test, such as amniocentesis or fetal blood sampling. In theory, CPM is when the <b>trisomic</b> cells are found only in the placenta. CPM is detected in approximately 1-2% of ongoing pregnancies that are studied by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy. Chorionic villus sampling is a prenatal procedure which involves a placental biopsy. Most commonly when CPM is found it {{represents a}} <b>trisomic</b> cell line in the placenta and a normal diploid chromosome complement in the baby. However, the fetus is involved in about 10% of cases.|$|E
50|$|UPD {{can occur}} as a random event during the {{formation}} of egg or sperm cells or may happen in early fetal development. It can also occur during <b>trisomic</b> rescue.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{monosomic}} and <b>trisomic</b> {{human embryos}} are not viable, but some aneuploidies can be tolerated, such as trisomy for the smallest chromosome, chromosome 21.

50|$|<b>Trisomic</b> rescue (also {{known as}} trisomy rescue or trisomy zygote rescue) is a genetic {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} fertilized ovum containing three copies of a chromosome loses one of these chromosomes to form a normal, diploid chromosome complement.

50|$|Trisomies {{can occur}} with any chromosome, but often result in miscarriage, rather than live birth. For example, Trisomy 16 {{is the most}} common trisomy in human pregnancies, {{occurring}} in more than 1% of pregnancies; only those pregnancies in which some normal cells occur in addition to the <b>trisomic</b> cells, or mosaic trisomy 16, survive. This condition, however, usually results in spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester.|$|E
50|$|Level of mosaicism: There is a {{correlation}} between {{a high number of}} aneuploid cells detected at CVS with poor pregnancy progress. This includes an association between high levels of abnormal cells in placental tissue and concerns with the growth of the baby. However, it is not accurate to use these associations to try to predict pregnancy outcome based on the percent of <b>trisomic</b> cells in a first trimester CVS result.|$|E
50|$|Human trisomies {{compatible}} with life birth, other than Down syndrome (trisomy 21), are Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13). Complete trisomies of other chromosomes {{are usually not}} viable and represent a relatively frequent cause of miscarriage. Only in rare cases of a mosaicism, {{the presence of a}} normal cell line, in addition to the <b>trisomic</b> cell line, may support the development of a viable trisomy of the other chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Several factors {{influence}} {{the pattern of}} normal and abnormal cells in the developing embryo. Reduced or improved replication rates of the <b>trisomic</b> cells could affect the number of abnormal cells compared {{to the number of}} normal cells. The abnormal cells may fail to differentiate or function properly and could be lost. It is also possible that there is no selection against the abnormal cells, but their presence could compromise the pregnancy on a whole.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} form of mosaicism found through {{prenatal}} diagnosis involves trisomies. Although most forms of trisomy are due to problems in meiosis and affect all cells of the organism, there are cases where the trisomy occurs in only a selection of the cells. This may be caused by a nondisjunction event in an early mitosis, resulting in a loss of a chromosome from some <b>trisomic</b> cells. Generally this leads to a milder phenotype than in non-mosaic patients with the same disorder.|$|E
50|$|It is {{suggested}} that the reason patients with Down's Syndrome are less predisposed to certain cancers {{is due to the}} impact of this gene of reducing blood supply to tumour cells.It is also proposed by epidemiological studies that DS patients are in greater risk of Leukaemia , on the other hand they are at lower risk of cancer and other angiogenesis related diseases such as Diabetic retinopathy and Atherosclerosis , indicating that one or more <b>trisomic</b> genes on chromosome 21 is responsible for protecting DS patients against cancer, and this cancer defence could be a result of angiogenesis suppression.|$|E
5000|$|Cri du chat {{syndrome}} {{is due to}} a partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome number 5, also called [...] "5p monosomy" [...] or [...] "partial monosomy." [...] Approximately 90% of cases result from a sporadic, or randomly occurring, de novo deletion. The remaining 10-15% are due to unequal segregation of a parental balanced translocation where the 5p monosomy is often accompanied by a <b>trisomic</b> portion of the genome. These individuals may have more severe disease than those with isolated monosomy of 5p. A recent study suggests {{this may not be the}} case where a trisomy of chromosome 4q is involved.|$|E

The term [...] "cat eye" [...] syndrome was coined because of the particular appearance of the vertical colobomas in the eyes of some patients. However, over half of the CES patients in the literature do not present with this trait. There is no significant reduction in life expectancy in patients who are not afflicted with one of CES' life-threatening abnormalities.|$|E
5000|$|Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} chromosomal abnormalities amongst live births. Of all trisomy 21 pregnancies, approximately 80% end in spontaneous abortions or still-births. 1-5% of people diagnosed with having Down Syndrome are actually in fact [...] "high- grade" [...] trisomy 21 mosaics. The rest of trisomy 21 mosaics are marked as [...] "low- grade" [...] mosaics, meaning the chromosomal mutation occurs in less than 3-5% of respective tissue. While high- grade trisomy 21 mosaics, demonstrate similar features to full Down Syndrome, low- grade mosaics have a tendency to show milder features, however the effects are quite variable depending on the distribution of the <b>trisomic</b> cells.|$|E
50|$|Specific chromosomes: The {{influence}} of CPM on fetal growth is chromosome specific. Certain chromosomes carry imprinted genes involved in growth or placental function, which {{may contribute to}} impaired pregnancy progress when CPM is detected. Different chromosomes are observed at different frequencies {{depending on the type}} of CPM observed. The pregnancy outcome is strongly chromosome specific. The most frequently seen <b>trisomic</b> cells in confined placental mosaicism involve chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 8 and 16. The next frequently involved are 9, 13, 15, 18, 20 and 22. It has been observed that CPM involving the sex chromosomes usually has no adverse effects on fetal development. The common autosomal trisomies (21, 18, 13) made up a smaller number of cases of mosaicism detected on CVS, but were more often confirmed in fetal tissue (19%). On the other hand, the uncommon autosomal trisomies accounted for a greater number of placental mosaicism cases, but were less often confirmed in fetal tissue (3.2%). When CPM is detected on CVS involving certain chromosomes which are known or suspected to carry imprinted genes, molecular investigations should be performed to exclude fetal UPD. We will explore chromosome specific cases in the chromosome specific section.|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the birth}} defects {{associated}} with trisomy exhibit both variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. This variability {{suggests that it is}} allelic variation and not simply the presence of an additional chromosome that leads to the development of certain trisomy-associated birth defects. With the proper tools, one may use <b>trisomic</b> populations to identify genes involved in the development of specific birth defects. A <b>trisomic</b> population may be advantageous over a normal population if the defect is over-represented in the <b>trisomic</b> population. Alternatively, one can view the <b>trisomic</b> populations as a ‘‘model system’ ’ to offer insight into aspects of both normal and abnormal embryonic development. Standard disomic linkage disequilibrium mapping approaches need to be adjusted to account for the presence of the additional genetic material in the <b>trisomic</b> individuals.

40|$|Background: This {{study is}} part of a {{research}} line which focuses on the relation between follicle pool size and the risk of a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy. Not much is known about the relation between ovarian surgery, an iatrogenic cause of diminished ovarian reserve, and the occurrence of a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy. A previous Dutch study in 2010 of subfertile women who underwent IVF treatment a statistically significant association was found between parameters which lead to a diminished ovarian reserve and the occurrence of a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy. One of these parameters is ovarian surgery. This study indicated that women with previous ovarian surgery more often had a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy than women of the same age without <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy(1). In this study we will try to confirm the relation between previous ovarian surgery and <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy, by repeating the study in a larger non-Dutch general population. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was designed to assess the relation between previous ovarian surgery and <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy. <b>Trisomic</b> cases and controls were selected from the Danish general population, including fertile and IVF-treated women from 1995 to 2010. The women with <b>trisomic</b> pregnancies were selected regardless of the outcome of the pregnancy (termination, miscarriage or a live born child). Women with a live born child without a trisomy served as controls. For each case we selected four controls matched on female age at the estimated date of conception. The proportion of women with a history of ovarian surgery will be compared between cases and controls. Results: 8714 women were included in the study; 1744 <b>trisomic</b> cases and 6969 controls. 48 (2. 8 %) women in the <b>trisomic</b> group and 180 (2. 6 %) in the control group have had ovarian surgery. Logistic regression analysis showed no significant association between previous ovarian surgery and <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy in a general population [odds ratio (OR) 1. 06; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 77 - 1. 47; P= 0. 69]. Conclusion: The current study does not confirm the associaton between ovarian surgery en <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy that was previously found by Haadsma et al. (1) in an IVF population. ...|$|E

Among older women, smoking is more common in women aborting <b>trisomic</b> conceptions than in controls.

40|$|Introduction: As {{women get}} older, their oocyt {{quantity}} and oocyt quality decreases. The number of oocyts declines (quantity) {{and the chance}} of a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy increases (quality). Previous studies suggest there is a relationship between reduced ovarian reserve and {{the chance of a}} <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy. In the years preceding menopause there is a period of change in the menstrual cycle, resulting from a reduced ovarian reserve. This period of change is fixed of 6 - 7 years, regardless of the age at which menopause eventually occurs. In this study we analysed the predictive value of menstrual cycle characteristics for the chance of a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy. Material and Methodes: From all the women included in this study (from 2003 until 2009), blood samples were drawn in the first trimester of the pregnancy. The serum was used to calculate the risk of a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy within a screening program. For each woman with a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy we selected five controls, matched on age, duration of the pregnancy and the date at which the blood sample was taken. The menstrual cycle characteristics of women with a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy (n= 93) were compared with those of the controls (n= 455) using conditional regression analysis. Results: We did not identify a relationship between the duration of the menstrual cycle, the regularity of the cycle and the existence of a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy. We also could not detect a relation between menstrual cycle characteristics and <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy within two different age categories and within two categories with a high and low risk of <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy, based on the screening results. Conclusion: In our study menstrual cycle characteristics have no predictive value for the chance of a <b>trisomic</b> pregnancy. Whether or not there is a relation between oocyt quantity and quality and whether the menstrual cycle gives the best reflection of the ovarian reserve can not be determined based on this study. Additional research is therefore required. ...|$|E
40|$|Astrocytes {{derived from}} <b>trisomic</b> human {{embryonic}} stem cells express markers of astrocytic cancer cells and premalignant stem-like progenitors Sailesh Gopalakrishna-Pillai and Linda E Iverson* Background: <b>Trisomic</b> variants of {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESCs) arise spontaneously in culture. Although <b>trisomic</b> hESCs share many properties with diploid hESCs, they also exhibit features of cancer stem cells. Since most hESC-based therapies will utilize differentiated derivatives, {{it is imperative to}} investigate the potential of <b>trisomic</b> hESCs to undergo malignant transformation during differentiation prior to their use in the clinical setting. Methods: Diploid and <b>trisomic</b> hESCs were differentiated into astrocytic progenitors cells (APCs), RNA extracted and hybridized to human exon-specific microarrays. Global gene expression profiles of diploid and <b>trisomic</b> APCs were compared to that of an astrocytoma cell line and glioblastoma samples, analyzed by others, using the same microarray platform. Results: Bioinformatic analysis of microarray data indicates that differentiated <b>trisomic</b> APCs exhibit global expression profiles with similarities to the malignant astrocytoma cell line. An analogous trend is observed in comparison to glioblastoma samples indicating that <b>trisomic</b> APCs express markers of astrocytic cancer cells. The analysis also allowed identification of transcripts predicted to be differentially expressed in brain tumor stem cells. These data indicate that in vitro differentiation of <b>trisomic</b> hESCs along astrocytic pathways give rise to cells exhibiting properties of premalignant astrocytic stem/progenitor cells. Conclusions: Given their occult nature, opportunities to study premalignant stem/progenitor cells in human have been few. The ability to propagate and direct the differentiation of aneuploid hESCs provides a powerful in vitro system for investigating biological properties of human cells exhibiting features of premalignant stem cells. This in vitro culture system can be used to elucidate changes in gene expression occurring enroute to malignant transformation and to identify molecular markers of cancer stem/progenitor cells. These markers are invaluable for diagnostic purposes and may be novel targets for therapeutic intervention...|$|E
40|$|The Ts 65 Dn mouse is <b>trisomic</b> for {{orthologs}} {{of about}} half the genes on Hsa 21. A number of phenotypes in these <b>trisomic</b> mice parallel those in humans with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), including cognitive deficits due to hippocampal malfunction that are sufficiently similar to human that “therapies” developed in Ts 65 Dn mice are making their way to human clinical trials. However, {{the impact of the}} model is limited by availability. Ts 65 Dn cannot be completely inbred and males are generally considered to be sterile. Females have few, small litters and they exhibit poor care of offspring, frequently abandoning entire litters. Here we report identification and selective breeding of rare fertile males from two working colonies of Ts 65 Dn mice. <b>Trisomic</b> offspring can be propagated by natural matings or by in vitro fertilization (IVF) to produce large cohorts of closely related siblings. The use of a robust euploid strain as recipients of fertilized embryos in IVF or as the female in natural matings greatly improves husbandry.

We developed parameters for cryopreserving sperm from Ts 65 Dn males and used it to produce <b>trisomic</b> offspring by IVF. Use of cryopreserved sperm provides additional flexibility in the choice of oocyte donors from different genetic backgrounds, facilitating rapid production of complex crosses.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using a centromeric probe for chromosome 7, showed that the mean frequency of <b>trisomic</b> nuclei in 5 -microm sections was highest in PVNS (9. 0 %), followed by CS (5. 9 %), OA (5. 6 %), and HS (4. 6 %), whereas <b>trisomic</b> nuclei were rare (0. 7 %) in normal tissue.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{accurate}} {{assignment of}} alleles embedded within <b>trisomic</b> or duplicated regions {{is an essential}} prerequisite for assessing the combined effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genomic copy number. Such an integrated analysis is challenging because heterozygotes for such a SNP {{may be one of}} 2 genotypes - AAB or ABB. Established methods for SNP genotyping, however, can have difficulty discriminating between the 2 heterozygous <b>trisomic</b> genotypes. Wedeveloped a method for assigning heterozygous <b>trisomic</b> genotypes that uses the ratio of the height of the 2 allele peaks obtained by mass spectrometry after a single-base extension assay. METHODS: Eighteen COL 6 A 2 (collagen, type VI, alpha 2) SNPs were analyzed in euploid and <b>trisomic</b> individuals by means of a multiplexed single-base extension assay that generated allele-specific oligonucleotides of differing M r values for detection by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Reference data (mean and SD) for the allele peak height ratios were determined from heterozygous euploid samples. The heterozygous <b>trisomic</b> genotypes were assigned by calculating the z score for each <b>trisomic</b> allele peak height ratio and by considering the sign (+/-) of the z score. RESULTS: Heterozygous <b>trisomic</b> genotypes were assigned in 96. 1 % (range, 89. 9 %- 100 %) of the samples for each SNP analyzed. The genotypes obtained were reproduced in 95 (97. 5 %) of 97 loci retested in a second assay. Subsequently, the origin of nondisjunction was determined in 108 (82 %) of 132 family trios with a Down syndrome child.

40|$|The {{association}} between chromosomal mosaicism observed on chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and poor pregnancy outcome {{has been well}} documented. CVS mosaicism usually represents abnormal cell lines confined to the placenta and often involves chromosomal trisomy. Such confined placental mosaicism (CPM) may occur when there is complete dichotomy between a <b>trisomic</b> karyotype in the placenta and a normal diploid fetus or when both diploid and <b>trisomic</b> components are present within the placenta. Gestations involving pure or significant trisomy in placental lineages associated with a diploid fetal karyotype probably result from a <b>trisomic</b> zygote which has lost one copy of the <b>trisomic</b> chromosome in the embryonic progenitor cells during cleavage. Uniparental disomy {{would be expected to}} occur in one-third of such cases. Trisomy of chromosome 7, 9, 15, or 16 is most common among the gestations with these dichotomic CPMs. Nine pregnancies with trisomy 16 confined to the placenta were prenatally diagnosed.
