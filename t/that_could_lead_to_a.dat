5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: {{the two most important}} ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club. Her mother was confident her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations. In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it led her to want to be a dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.|$|E

A {{development}} executive for Hanna-Barbera, {{who was trying to}} get back into the prime-time business at the time, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Kolins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of King of the Hill in 1997, MacFarlane called Kolins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. The company offered the young writer a strange deal: Fox gave him a budget of US$50,000 to produce a pilot <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least US$1 million).

The tough question is whether we'd force Israel back to 4 June borders if the Arabs accepted terms that amounted to an honest peace settlement.

2500|$|Until {{the passing}} in Australia of the Nationality Act 1920, Australia's {{nationality}} law, {{like that of}} other Commonwealth countries, was governed by the English common law concept of a British subject.

The idea that {{there was such a}} thing as an Australian nationality as distinct from a British one was considered by the High Court of Australia in 1906 to be a [...] "novel idea" [...] to which it was [...] "not disposed to give any countenance". The British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 codified the common law rules. Australia followed with the passing of the Nationality Act 1920, which codified the concept of a British subject in Australia, effective from 1 January 1921. In general, the principles of the 1920 Act and subsequent amendments followed United Kingdom legislation, although there were some differences <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> person being a British subject solely under Australian law.|$|E

Eisenhower also made the point that dialogue at the Four Powers Summit was the type of international negotiation <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union where there would be no need to spy on each other.

He stated that the United States would be more than willing to submit to such an inspection by the U.N. and that he hoped to circumvent the spying controversy with this alternative international surveillance agreement.|$|E
2500|$|The first Parliament of Australia quickly {{moved to}} {{restrict}} immigration to maintain Australia's British character, and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and the Immigration Restriction Bill were passed shortly before parliament rose {{for its first}} Christmas recess.

The Barton Government therefore conceived of the [...] "language dictation test", which would allow the government, at the discretion of the minister, to block unwanted migrants by forcing them to sit a test in [...] "any European language". Race had already been established as a premise for exclusion among the colonial parliaments, so the main question for debate was who exactly the new Commonwealth ought to exclude, with the Labor Party rejecting Britain's calls to placate the populations of its non-white colonies and allow [...] "aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands thereof". There was opposition from Queensland and its sugar industry to the proposals of the Pacific Islanders Bill to exclude [...] "Kanaka" [...] laborers, however Barton argued that the practice was [...] "veiled slavery" [...] <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> [...] "negro problem" [...] similar to that in the United States, and the Bill was passed.|$|E
