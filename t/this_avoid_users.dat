40|$|AbstractWhen {{interactions}} among users {{of a system}} have to take place, for example, over the internet, establishing trust relationships among these users becomes crucial. However, the way this trust is established depends {{to a certain extent}} on the context where the interactions take place. Most of the time, trust is encoded as a numerical value that might not be very meaningful for a not very experienced user. In this paper we propose a model that takes into account the semantic and the computational sides of trust. <b>This</b> <b>avoids</b> <b>users</b> having to deal directly with the computational side; they instead deal with meaningful labels such as Bad or Good in a given context...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a pipeline to easily generate collections of web accessible UCSC genome browsers inter-related by an alignment. Using the alignment, all annotations and the alignment {{itself can be}} efficiently viewed with reference to any genome in the collection, symmetrically. A new, intelligently scaled align-ment display makes it simple to view all changes between the genomes {{at all levels of}} resolution, from substitutions to complex structural rearrangements, including duplications. Visualization is key to understanding functional and comparative genomic information. Genome browsers are therefore critical to the study of biology, providing accessible resources for displaying annotations and alignments. The UCSC Genome Browser [1] {{is one of the most}} popular, but creating a browser within it previously required significant resources, as it was necessary to create a mirror site to host the browser separately, or to work with the staff of the genome browser to create a browser within their main site. Assembly hubs, which build on the successful track hub model [2], make it easy to generate a UCSC browser simply by hosting the data in the form of flat-files on any publicly addressable URL [1]. <b>This</b> <b>avoids</b> <b>users</b> having to install and configure the substantial browser code base on their machines and, by using user hosting, makes updating straightforward. This work extends assembly hubs to allow users to quickly creat...|$|R

30|$|We {{develop a}} virtual memory {{space in the}} {{inactive}} memory of hard disk, which acts as a virtual buffer. The need for this eliminates deleting of streamed content and paves the way to save it by the user for later viewing. This virtual buffer produces the flexibility to stream multiple videos from the same or different servers in a parallel fashion. Also, this gives the time to retransmit the lost packets so that the content available is exactly similar to the download copy. We use a stochastic addressing method to transmit the packets from virtual buffer to the playout buffer with maximum hit rates under various conditions. The virtual to reality mapping (V= R) gives the user an option to store the stream to an external drive via USB (universal serial bus). However, subscription parameters {{can be applied to}} avoid illegal copyrights. We also show that how virtual buffer is effectively created and utilized when the user requests to stream a video of length L and the CBR (constant bit rate) traffic is modeled using Pareto distribution which shows, how 20 % of streamed data is used to achieve the efficiency of 80 % of the bandwidth needed to download the same. The streamed video is saved in the fragmented buffer; thus, it decreases the loading of network while downloading it. <b>This</b> <b>avoids</b> <b>user</b> consuming more bandwidth by downloading or requesting already viewed content to be streamed again. The progressive download (streamed content) is stored in our virtual memory; hence, those packets are skipped while making a download. Downloading a video is the fastest way to fetch the data from the server than by streaming the entire data online. This reduces the per user time slot in a multicasting domain and achieves high-speed content delivery.|$|R
30|$|For methods {{requiring}} {{information on}} background uptake (CT and AT), the background region {{needs to be}} defined by the user which might introduce some variations in the results. For this study, {{it was not the}} case since the phantom body is a homogeneous structure, but in clinical practice, the background region needs to be selected carefully. For FLAB, the background uptake is estimated from the initial VOI and therefore the results might vary based on different VOI selections. FLAB allows the user to tune various parameters to the data, but in <b>this</b> study, we <b>avoided</b> <b>user</b> interference to minimise any bias in our results. The VOI definition for thresholding methods does not introduce variations in the lesion size but might include false positives if it is too large.|$|R
40|$|In Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) broadcasting, service {{providers}} charge subscription fee by scrambling {{the program in}} Conditional Access System (CAS). <b>This</b> <b>avoids</b> unauthorized <b>users</b> to receive the programs. A smart card (CA card) is used to decrypt the Control Words (CWs) and transfer them back to Set-Top Box (STB) in order to descramble the scrambled program. This paper presents a secure mutual authentication and key exchange scheme between STB and smart card for IPTV broadcasting. Its security is based on one way hash function and the discrete logarithm problem. It allows subscribers to choose and change the password freely, provides dynamic session key agreement and mutual authentication between STB and smart card. Security analysis proves that the scheme is strong against subscriber and STB impersonation attacks, replay attack, stolen verifier attack, smart card loss attack, man-in-the-middle attack and attack on perfect forward secrecy which are considered as common threats in IPTV environment. Moreover, the scheme also prevents serious attacks such as smart card cloning and McCormac Hack attack particular to authentication using smart cards.

In my dissertation, I aim to develop the Authentication server that will provide the secure Authentication as a Service to other website and also support the Identity as a Service (IDaaS). In this dissertation, I aim to study about various challenges and issues before developing third party authentication server and try to find some solution to resolve that problems. Literature study mainly focuses on the overview of the Authentication Process, Relation between User-Client-Service Provider, IDaaS and Various Authentication services provider that exist. In designing of the project I have included UML and DFD diagram along with Module diagram. I have tried to keep the service simple, efficient and easy access for client and users. Client can use this service to their website by just adding few lines of code. To make this authentication service more secure I have added some features. Features like Provisioning, De-Provisioning, E-mail Password Recovery and Single Sign-On (SSO) will just make project better.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an Articulated Entity Relationship (AER) diagram is proposed, {{which is an}} {{extension}} of Entity Relationship (ER) diagram to accommodate the Functional Dependency (FD) information as its integral part for complete automation of normalization. In current relational databases (RDBMS) automation of normalization by top down approach is possible using ER diagram as an input, provided the FD information is available independently, meanwhile, through user interaction. Such automation we call partial and conditional automation. To <b>avoid</b> <b>this</b> <b>user</b> interaction, there is a strong need to accommodate FD information as an element of ER diagram itself. Moreover, ER diagrams are not designed by taking into account the requirements of normalization. However, for better automation of normalization it must {{be an integral part of}} conceptual design (ER Diagram). The prime motivation behind this paper to design a system that need only proposed AER diagram as a sole input and normalize the database up to a given normal form in one go. This would allow more amount of automation than the current approach. Such automation we call as total and unconditional automation, which is better and complete in true sense. As the proposed AER diagram is designed by taking in to account the normalization process, normalization up to Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF) becomes an integral part of conceptual design. Additional advantage of AER diagram is that any modifications (addition, deletion or updation of attributes) made to the AER diagram will automatically be reflected in its FD information. Thus description of schema and FD information is guaranteed to be consistent. This cannot be assured in current approach using ER diagrams, as schema and FD information are provided to the system at two different times, separately...|$|R
