5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E
5|$|Some of the cleaner energy {{facilities}} in Boston include the Allston green district, with three ecologically compatible housing facilities. Boston is also breaking ground on multiple green affordable housing facilities {{to help reduce}} the carbon footprint of the city while simultaneously making these initiatives financially available to a greater population. Boston's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> yearly energy and water use statistics and partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for buildings to be more environmentally conscious.|$|E
5|$|This eventuality was foreseen. At the three-power Bermuda Conference with President Dwight D. Eisenhower in December 1953, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, {{suggested}} that the United States allow Britain {{to have access to}} American nuclear weapons to make up the shortfall. There were several technical and legal issues. For American bombs to be carried in British aircraft, the United States would have <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act. Further down the line, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found {{that there has been}} no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E

25|$|In {{an online}} survey carried out among over 75,000 Yougov panel {{participants}} in Britain, 90.9% identified as heterosexual, 5.8% as gay, lesbian or bisexual, 1.3% {{opted not to}} give an answer, and 2.1% gave other reasons. The sample was recruited to closely match the overall British population on demographic variables such as age, gender, employment status and socio-economic classification. Ethnic minorities {{were less likely to}} identify as gay or lesbian than Whites (1.4% vs. 3.5%) but were more likely to prefer not <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> sexual orientation (7.5% vs 0.9%). More LGB than heterosexual respondents indicated they would be less likely <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> true sexual orientation in a face-to-face interview than in a self-administered, online survey.|$|E

25|$|The complex {{nature of}} polyamory {{presents}} difficulties in structuring {{research into the}} stability of polyamorous relationships. For instance, polyamorists may be reluctant <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> relationship status due to potential negative consequences, and researchers may be unfamiliar with {{the full range of}} polyamorous behaviours, leading to poorly framed questions that give misleading results.|$|E
25|$|As {{transgender}} {{women often}} face barriers such as discrimination and stigma when accessing health care, and show reluctance <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> gender when seeking health related services, a collaborative project named ‘TRANS’ {{was set up}} near the Tenderloin to appropriately address the multifaceted needs of this diverse population, as well as offering support.|$|E

50|$|Adolescents {{are able}} to {{determine}} their own amount of parental authority over certain issues by how much or how little they choose <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> parents. Surveys revealed that they are least likely to share information that involves their personal feelings and activities. They actively resist <b>disclosing</b> this <b>to</b> <b>their</b> parents {{because they do not}} see the issues as being harmful, or they feel their parents will not listen to them, or because the matters are very private to them.|$|R

25|$|Canada {{remains the}} only G7 country without {{specific}} protections in place to prevent genetic discrimination. As a result, Canadians who undergo genetic testing can be compelled by insurance companies and employers <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> results and may be denied employment or insurance based on their genes.

25|$|In 2001, {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 22,000 practitioners in the US alone, but the number may be higher as some practitioners may be reluctant <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> religion on a government census or to an academic researcher. Of those living in the United States, some are fully committed priests and priestesses, others are godchildren or members of a particular house-tradition, and many are non-committal clients seeking help with their everyday problems.|$|E
25|$|Many {{transsexual}} men {{and women}} choose to live completely as members of their gender without disclosing details of their birth-assigned sex. This approach is sometimes called stealth. Stealth transsexuals choose not <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> past for numerous reasons, including fear of discrimination and fear of physical violence. There are examples of people having been denied medical treatment upon discovery of their trans status, whether it was revealed by the patient or inadvertently discovered by the doctors.|$|E

A gay identity was more common among men (6.1%) than women (1%), though no differences were found in the share identifying as bisexual (2.4% versus 2.5%). London had a higher share of middle aged or older people identifying as gay (8%) or bisexual (6%) than other parts of the country.|$|E
25|$|Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, , is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that {{statutes}} requiring suspects <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> names during police investigations did not violate the Fourth Amendment if the statute first required reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement. Under the rubric of Terry v. Ohio, , the minimal intrusion on a suspect's privacy, and the legitimate need of law enforcement officers to quickly dispel suspicion that an individual is engaged in criminal activity, justified requiring a suspect to disclose his or her name.|$|E
50|$|In {{making the}} movie, Jean Rouch was {{surprised}} {{as to how}} much his subjects were willing <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> about <b>their</b> life’s dreams and aspirations, finding that his nimble camera offered him a passport into freedom, allowing him to navigate circles he hadn’t dreamt of integrating.

25|$|In {{light of}} the {{possible}} financial cost that may be awarded against them if their petition proved to be unsuccessful, the petitioners applied for a limited protective costs order on 9 July 2014 to cap any potential cost recovery by the respondents {{to no more than}} £25,000 plus VAT, and their own cost to £50,000 plus VAT. Subsequently, the petitioners attempted to adjourn the application, which along with the application itself was denied after a hearing by High Court judges Michael Supperstone and Robin Spencer sitting as a divisional court {{on the grounds that the}} petitioners had deliberately failed <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> financial means when making the initial application.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} family {{guidelines}} and agreements, corporate policies exclusively refer to marriages among {{women and men}} and thereby disregard the situation and {{the special needs of}} non-traditional families. These non-traditional families often consist of couples or individuals with lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) backgrounds that are increasingly under pressure of the community, as their needs within corporations are often paid inadequate attention. Exclusive behavior such as creating environments that do not encourage LGBTs <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> sexual orientation, or even neglecting the fact that LGBT are allowed to adopt children, leads to a feeling of isolation and job stress that ultimately negatively effects the WLB of the affected individuals.|$|E
