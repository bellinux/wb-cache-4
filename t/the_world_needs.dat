5|$|<b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero is {{the ninth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} in May 2001 by Sanctuary Records. After the critical and commercial {{failure of the}} previous album Risk (1999), <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero represented a change back to a heavier musical direction. Subsequently, the album charted at number 16 on the Billboard 200 upon release.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on May 15, 2001 in the United States and sold 61,000 copies in its first week of release, entering the Billboard 200 at number 16. The album sold another 25,000 copies in its second week, falling to number 59. The album also charted in Poland (#17), Germany (#36), Sweden (#38), and Switzerland (#55) as well. By December 2005, <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero had sold about 219,000 copies in the United States. Megadeth commenced a tour to promote the album on June 8, 2001 at Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, where they were featured alongside acts such as AC/DC, The Offspring, and Queens of the Stone Age. Following {{the breakup of the}} band in 2002, six of the album's songs appeared on Still Alive... and Well?, a 2002 compilation combining studio tracks from <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero, with six live tracks.|$|E
5|$|After parting {{with former}} label Capitol Records, {{the album was}} the first of two Megadeth studio albums to be {{released}} by Sanctuary. It was the last of two studio albums to feature drummer Jimmy DeGrasso and the only one to feature Al Pitrelli on lead guitar. Furthermore, <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero was the last album with original bassist David Ellefson until his return to Megadeth in 2010. Additionally, mascot Vic Rattlehead appears on the cover of a Megadeth album {{for the first time since}} Rust in Peace (1990).|$|E

5|$|Through {{the magical}} {{intervention}} of Ox and Volsius, the travelers are {{brought back to}} Castle Andernak, where Georges is {{on the brink of}} death. Volsius persuades Ox to work together with him, resolving the tension between them by revealing that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>needs</b> both symbolic figures—scientific knowledge and spiritual compassion—to work in harmony. Together, they bring Georges back to life and health. He renounces his obsessions and promises to live happily ever after with Eva.|$|E
5|$|A European {{tour with}} AC/DC {{in support of}} <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero began in mid-2001, {{followed}} by an American tour with Iced Earth and Endo in September. Mustaine allowed fans to choose the setlist in each American city. However, the tour was cut short following the September 11 attacks; all dates were canceled, including a DVD shoot in Argentina. The band instead played two shows in Arizona on November 16 and 17, which were filmed and released as Megadeth's first live release, Rude Awakening. That year, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! was remixed and remastered; the reissue featured modified artwork and several bonus tracks.|$|E

25|$|On Earth, Eben and Martha Kent find Kal-El in the {{spacecraft}} and pull him from {{it before it}} explodes. The Kents decide to raise him as their own and name him Clark. Clark is shown learning about his abilities as he grows up, displaying great strength and speed, x-ray vision, super hearing and super durability. Once Clark is an adult, Eben explains how he and Martha found him and that Clark {{has a responsibility to}} use his powers wisely and justly in the interest of truth, tolerance and justice. They agree that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>needs</b> him and that he must leave their farm and go where he is needed. Clark states that he will pursue a job that will keep him close to world events, so he can be aware of emergencies immediately. Martha gives Clark a uniform made from the blankets they found him in and he decides to take on the secret identity Superman. The Kents die shortly after this conversation and Clark moves to Metropolis.|$|E
500|$|After 15 {{years with}} Capitol Records, Megadeth left the label in July 2000. According to Mustaine, the {{departure}} {{was due to}} ongoing tensions with Capitol management. Capitol returned the band's newest recordings and released a greatest hits album, , with two new tracks: [...] "Kill the King" [...] and [...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind". In November, Megadeth signed with Sanctuary Records. The band returned to the studio in October to finish its next album, <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero, which was near completion when Megadeth joined the Maximum Rock tour six months earlier. Following the negative response to Risk, Mustaine fired Bud Prager and produced the album himself. The songs were written by Mustaine alone, except for [...] "Promises", which had contributions from Pitrelli. Two days before the release of <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero, Megadeth appeared in an episode of VH1's Behind the Music showcasing Mustaine, Ellefson, several past members, and Mustaine's old Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.|$|E

500|$|On April 3, Mustaine {{announced}} {{in a press}} release that he was disbanding Megadeth as his arm injury rendered him unable to play guitar. For the next four months, he had physical therapy five days a week, and slowly began to [...] "re-teach" [...] his left hand. To fulfill contract obligations to Sanctuary, Megadeth released the compilation album Still Alive... and Well? The {{first half of the}} album contains live tracks recorded at the Web Theatre in Phoenix, and the second half has studio recordings from <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Megadeth {{released}} its eighth studio album, Risk. The album was noteworthy {{for being a}} drastic musical departure for the band, and {{the culmination of the}} band's increasing attempts for mainstream success throughout the 1990s, a trend starting with Countdown to Extinction (1992). <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero marks a stylistic transition towards the band's thrash metal roots. Furthermore, the album had been touted by the band as an [...] "antidote" [...] to Risk in a press release. However, the album has been noted by several music critics as still retaining some commercial feel from previous albums.|$|E

He broke into Evans' office, read her files, and asks Michael if he is awake or asleep. However, Gemini says that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>needs</b> people like him and Michael; people who can see it sideways. As he takes a flight to Portland, Gemini says that he hopes Michael doesn't wake up and then hangs up.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero was {{released}} in May 2001, and debuted at number sixteen on the Billboard 200. It was banned in Malaysia when the national government determined that the album's artwork was [...] "unsuitable for the nation's youth". Consequently, the band canceled its August 2 concert in Kuala Lumpur. The album marked Megadeth's return to a more aggressive sound after the stylistic variations of its previous two albums, but critics felt it fell short of expectations. Mustaine compared the album to a huge ship at sea, turning and trying to right itself {{to get back on}} course. Its lead single, [...] "Moto Psycho", reached number 22 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.|$|E
500|$|Another {{generally}} positive review {{came from}} Blabbermouth.net reviewer Ray Van Horn, Jr., {{who gave the}} album a 7.5/10 score despite noting that he felt the album had numerous flaws. Specific praise was directed at many of Ellefson's bass parts, as well {{as much of the}} guitar solo work on the album. Van Horn declared that the album is no Risk despite the insistence of other critics and fans, but expressed uncertainty as to which sonic direction the band might take in the future. Chad Bowar of Loudwire had a mixed overall opinion on the album and mainly criticized the album for being more akin to Risk and <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero than other recent albums. Bowar gave reserved praise for the tracks [...] "Kingmaker" [...] and the band's cover of [...] "Cold Sweat".|$|E

Complications from kryptonite exposure cause Superman to fall into a coma, and while doctors are able to remove more fragments from his skin, they cannot revive him. Lois visits {{him in the hospital}} and whispers into his ear while glancing at Jason. Soon after, hospital staff discover his room empty. No longer feeling alone in the universe, Superman visits his newly revealed son in the boy's room and repeats to Jason the words of his own father as he sleeps. Lois starts writing another article, titled [...] "Why <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> Superman." [...] Superman reassures her that he is now back to stay, and flies off into space, where he gazes down at the world.|$|E
500|$|Yancey {{researched}} {{the subject of}} grace, asking non-Christians what they associated with Evangelical Christianity. None of their responses mentioned grace; most cited political stances, such as opposition to LGBT rights and abortion. The author initially intended to call his book What's So Amazing About Grace: and Why Don't Christians Show More of It? Zondervan, its eventual publisher, objected to the title's forcefulness, despite Yancey's argument that he wrote the book about how [...] "we Christians are simply not known by the greatest gift we have". On February 3, 1997, Christianity Today published an essay by Yancey, the magazine's editor-at-large, with the title [...] "A State of Ungrace", {{saying that it was}} the basis of two chapters of Yancey's upcoming book with the working title of What's So Amazing About Grace and Why <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> More of It.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero {{received}} generally mediocre {{reviews and}} {{was regarded as}} a [...] "return to roots" [...] by critics. Writing for AllMusic, reviewer Steve Huey opined that Mustaine [...] "tries to conjure memories" [...] of Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction, but while comparing [...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind" [...] to [...] "Sweating Bullets" [...] (from Countdown to Extinction) said that much of the material [...] "feels like rehashed Megadeth". Huey critiqued the production as still being [...] "radio-friendly" [...] and said because of that, the group [...] "never quite kicks up the fury or flash of past glories". Neil Arnold of Metal Forces wrote that even though the album was [...] "lacking the menace of the band’s earlier work", it was still a more accomplished effort than the previous record. He concluded that Megadeth were [...] "clearly opting for melody over aggression", albeit rarely breaking into [...] "thrash mode".|$|E
