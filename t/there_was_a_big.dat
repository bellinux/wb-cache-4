5|$|They {{embarked}} HMS Resolution on July 13, 1772, in Plymouth. The ship's route led {{first to}} the South Atlantic, then through the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean to the islands of Polynesia and finally around Cape Horn back to England, returning on July 30, 1775. During the three-year journey, the explorers visited New Zealand, the Tonga islands, New Caledonia, Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands and Easter Island. They went further south than anybody before them, almost discovering Antarctica. The journey conclusively disproved the Terra Australis Incognita theory, which claimed <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> habitable continent in the South.|$|E

25|$|When Finland became {{autonomous}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> {{interest in}} creating a new national identity. There was an immense interest in the Finnish language and Finnish culture in the mostly Swedish speaking upper class. At some point the Fennoman movement arose, that thought that the country should be a united nation, with only one language, and, as a reaction, the Svecoman movement, that was afraid that abandoning Swedish would lead to slavicisation or worse.|$|E
25|$|Brâncuși always {{dressed in}} the simple ways the Romanian peasants did. His studio was {{reminiscent}} of the houses of the peasants from his native region: <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> slab of rock as a table and a primitive fireplace, {{similar to those found}} in traditional houses in his native Oltenia, {{while the rest of the}} furniture was made by him out of wood. Brâncuși would cook his own food, traditional Romanian dishes, with which he would treat his guests.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> interest in the mathematical approach to modeling and simulation of parallel processes. This approach may be applied to the analysis of correctness of parallel and distributed programs. The Distributed Computer Network (DCN) research group at Saint Petersburg Technical University developed such a software system for the analysis of program correctness; the new tool was named COVERS (Concurrent Verification and Simulation). This system allowed graphical modeling notation for system structure and behavior. The tool was applied for the research granted by Hewlett Packard.|$|E

25|$|The CMB {{essentially}} {{confirms the}} Big Bang theory. In the late 1940s Alpher and Herman reasoned that if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> bang, {{the expansion of}} the universe would have stretched and cooled the high-energy radiation of the very early universe into the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and down to a temperature of about 5K. They were slightly off with their estimate, but they had exactly the right idea. They predicted the CMB. It took another 15 years for Penzias and Wilson to stumble into discovering that the microwave background was actually there.|$|E
25|$|Following her setback, Sunhwa {{went back}} to being an {{ordinary}} high school student. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> {{change in the way}} Sunhwa's peers looked at her: due to false rumors, they thought she was a JYP trainee; Sunhwa admitted she became afraid of people because of the jealous stares. Teacher Sung Yongho, in charge of the school choir, helped Sunhwa, giving her chances to participate in competitions; then, she was admitted to Baekjae Art College. A few days before the college entrance ceremony, she got a call from an agent who watched Superstar Survival and became a trainee in TS Entertainment.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> bushfire in the Tinderry Range in November 1957 which burnt out 90% of {{the reserve}} and was not {{contained}} until 24December. In January 2003, bushfires ravaged the Canberra region and, spreading from Namadgi National Park, devastated much of the flora and bush landscape around Michelago, particularly down from the Clearview Road toward the Murrumbidgee River. While the village itself was not affected by the fires, several farms and houses were destroyed and mountains of the Clear Range were left blackened and barren. A bushfire which began on 17December 2009 devastated the area east of Michelago, burning out over 9,000 hectares and destroying three homes and a sawmill.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Hodge {{played a}} local 20/20 for Mill Park Cricket Club in the Diamond Valley Cricket Association against Bundoora Park, the match {{being held at}} Redleap Reserve, where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> crowd of over 1,000 people who turned up to come and watch the best Victorian cricketer in the last 20 years. Bundoora Park made 6/142, with Hodge taking 1/17 off 4 overs. Hodge in return opened the batting with good friend Warren Stewert, and blasted 58, {{including}} 3 sixes off 39 balls, before club stalwarts Adam McLaughlin and Luke Peterson got the required runs off the final over. Hodge remained at the club for hours afterwards answering questions, which typifies him as a great cricketer {{on and off the}} field.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was the German Formula 3 Championship in 1989, where Frentzen competed against many future stars {{including}} Michael Schumacher and Karl Wendlinger. At the time, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> push by Bernie Ecclestone to have a German driver in the Formula One World Championship, so the ONS (the German National Motorsports committee) decided to support both Frentzen and Schumacher. The ONS put up the reward of a Formula One test to the driver who first would take a victory in a Formula 3 race. This ultimately ended up being Schumacher, in a controversial race at Zeltweg, Austria in which Frentzen claimed Schumacher had forced him off the track. However, Schumacher {{did not get the}} Formula One test drive anyway; Karl Wendlinger won the German Formula 3 Championship and Frentzen became joint runner-up with Schumacher (the two finishing on identical points totals).|$|E
25|$|As the European season began, {{new cars}} were {{launched}} as organisers {{were due to}} start enforcing new regulations for 1976 having allowed an easing in period over the first three races. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> talking point as the Tyrrell team entered a new P34 six-wheeler for Patrick Depailler. Depailler was on the pace and qualified third, behind Hunt and Lauda. Lauda, driving with broken ribs after an accident driving a tractor once again beat Hunt off {{the line at the}} start and led for the first third of the race. Depailler, after a slow start, was running fourth behind Mass when he spun off and crashed with brake problems. Just before mid-race, the McLarens of Hunt and Mass found another gear and drove past Lauda, but {{towards the end of the}} race, Mass had to retire with an engine failure. Hunt took his first win of the season, with Lauda second and Gunnar Nilsson's Lotus third.|$|E

Yamashiro increased her firing rate between 04:03 and 04:09, despite the widespread fires and damage, and was hit during this time near the starboard engine room by a torpedo. By 04:09, her speed was back up to 12 knots, and Nishimura wired to Kurita: [...] "We proceed till totally annihilated. I have definitely accomplished my mission as pre-arranged. Please rest assured." [...] At the same time, Oldendorf issued a brief cease-fire order to the entire formation after hearing that the destroyer Albert W.

500|$|Beyond Star Treks fictional innovations, its {{contributions}} to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While {{more common in}} subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a human–Vulcan first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode [...] "Plato's Stepchildren", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one. In an interview Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, I {{thought it was a}} Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards me with this big grin on his face. He reached out to me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that Star Trek was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [...] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.' When she told Roddenberry what King had said, he cried.|$|E
