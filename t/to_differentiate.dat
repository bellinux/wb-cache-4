5|$|Schumacher's {{original}} helmet sported the colours of the German {{flag and}} his sponsor's decals. On {{the top was}} a blue circle with white astroids. When Jos Verstappen was his teammate, Schumacher added four red diagonal strokes over the visor <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> his helmet from his teammate. After Schumacher joined Ferrari a prancing horse was added on the back. From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher changed the upper blue colour {{and some of the}} white areas to red. Since 2004, the helmet sported a white diagonal line with a white vertical line in the zone of the German Flag colours (originally to accommodate sponsor AMD), but then these lines remained in the Suzuka 2006 design.|$|E

5|$|Microbats possess magnetoreception, in {{that they}} have a high {{sensitivity}} to Earth's magnetic field, similar to birds.

Since microbats generally have poor eyesight, it is thought they use a magnetite-based method for orientation.|$|E
40|$|Differentiated {{dividends}} are {{a unique}} cash dividend payment scheme prevailing in Korea which allows managers {{to pay higher}} cash dividends to small shareholders than large shareholders. One of the important features of this dividend policy is that it provides an additional choice to managers when deciding on changing firms' dividend policy. Previous studies suggest that managers are expected <b>to</b> initiate <b>differentiated</b> dividends rather than stop paying dividends especially when their company is facing cash constraints. However, we find that a half of the firms changing <b>to</b> <b>differentiated</b> dividend are actually increasing their total dividend payment. In order to explain managers' motivation <b>to</b> initiate <b>differentiated</b> dividends, we employ the time varying fads, dividend premium, suggested by Baker and Wurgler. After conducting logit regressions, we find that dividend premium is positively associated with managers' incentive <b>to</b> initiate <b>differentiated</b> dividends especially when they increase total dividend amount. Also, the firms listed in different stock markets show different motivations when choosing to initiate different dividends...|$|R

40|$|Aerobic and {{anaerobic}} bacteria {{isolated from}} human axillae were tested for {{their capacity to}} adhere to buccal epithelial cells, immortalized human epithelial (HEp- 2) cells, and undifferentiated and differentiated human epithelial cells. In general, both aerobic and anaerobic diphtheroids adhered better <b>to</b> <b>differentiated</b> human epithelial cells than to HEp- 2 and undifferentiated human epithelial cells (P less than 0. 05). Mannose, galactose, fucose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and fibronectin were also assayed for their capacity to inhibit the adherence of diphtheroids to human epithelial cells. A great deal of variability was observed in {{the capacity of the}} latter compounds to inhibit the attachment of aerobic diphtheroids <b>to</b> undifferentiated and <b>differentiated</b> epithelial cells. Overall, mannose appeared to be best at inhibiting the adherence of the aerobic diphtheroids to undifferentiated human epithelial cells. Galactose, fucose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and fibronectin showed a greater capacity to inhibit attachment of aerobic diphtheroids <b>to</b> <b>differentiated</b> than <b>to</b> undifferentiated human epithelial cells. The inhibition of adherence <b>to</b> <b>differentiated</b> human epithelial cells varied with the microorganism and the compound tested; however, the highest and most consistent inhibition of adherence (76. 1 to 88. 6 %) was observed with a 5 % solution of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The in vitro adherence and adherence inhibition assays presented here demonstrate that a number of adhesins and receptors are involved in the adherence of skin bacteria to human epithelial cells and receptors on human epithelial cells are apparently altered during differentiation...|$|R
