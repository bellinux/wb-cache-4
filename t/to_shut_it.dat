5|$|In the mid 1960s, Sands and its {{adjacent}} properties {{were bought}} by the reclusive businessman Howard Hughes, who built a 500-room tower and modernized the hotel. After the 1970s it fell into decline until its final owner, Sheldon Adelson, made the decision <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> down and to build a brand new resort. The last dice in the casino was rolled by Bob Stupak just after 6pm on June 30, 1996. On November 26 of that year, it was finally imploded and demolished, much {{to the dismay of}} longtime employees and sentimentalists. Today, The Venetian stands where the Sands once stood.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} SR 21 between Pleasant Hill and Martinez was finally {{added to the}} state highway system in 1949, as a branch of Route 75. The ferry {{approach}} in Benicia became a spur of Route 74 in 1947, and in 1953 it was transferred to Route 75. The same law, effective immediately as an urgency measure, authorized the Department of Public Works to acquire the ferry system, then operated {{by the city of}} Martinez, which was planning <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> down. Ownership was transferred just after midnight on October 6, 1953.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to government suppression, Nepal Bhasa has faced opposition from hostile critics. After Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation began broadcasting a weekly half-hour program in Nepal Bhasa on 6 November 1983, opponents in Nepal pressured {{the radio station}} <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> down.

25|$|However, {{the company}} had been in {{financial}} trouble even before the government's decision <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> down, mostly due to mismanagement. The company's owner (Sandra Ang) had been allegedly embezzling the company's money. The financial losses from the embezzlement reportedly amounted to Rp 2.1 trillion (approximately US$210 million). On August 12, 2008, the Indonesian police named Sandra Ang as a suspect for money embezzlement. She was also banned from leaving the country.|$|E

However she re-opened the site after completing the internship, prompting the university to threaten to fail her if it remained on-line during her remaining internships.

25|$|After {{clearing}} the game's Ura loop, {{the entirety of}} the plot is revealed: one of the Dolls, EXY, interfaced with the enemy computer network at the end of DaiOuJou, managing <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> down but succumbing to madness soon thereafter. Overwhelmed by the sea of new information, she turned against her human pilot, killing him and herself and becoming the parasitic virtual entity detected by DonPachi HQ; still following her original programming, she created the Element Daughters and the robotic army featured in the game {{in a desperate attempt to}} destroy the installation that would start the chain of events leading to the Blissful Death Wars - presumably, DonPachi Corps HQ itself at the time of the elite squadron's birth.|$|E
25|$|During this period, the IRA also {{launched}} a highly damaging economic bombing campaign in English cities, particularly London, which caused {{a huge amount}} of physical and economic damage to property. Among their targets were the City of London, Bishopsgate and Baltic Exchange in London, with the Bishopsgate bombing causing damage initially estimated at £1 billion. The three mortar rounds were fired at the British Prime minister's office in Downing Street in London during a Cabinet meeting in February 1991 was another propaganda boost for the IRA. A particularly notorious bombing was the Warrington bomb attack in 1993, which killed two young children, Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball. In early March 1994, there were three mortar attacks on Heathrow Airport in London, which forced the authorities <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> down.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, major works {{were carried out}} to enable the {{platform}} to meet UK Government gas export requirements and after this work had been completed, Piper Alpha was operating in what was known as phase 2 mode (operating with the Gas Conservation Module (GCM)) {{since the end of}} 1980 up until July 1988; phase 2 mode was its normal operating state. In the late 1980s, major construction, maintenance and upgrade works had been planned by Occidental and by July 1988, the rig was already well into major work activities, with six major projects identified including the change-out of the GCM unit which meant that the rig had been put back into its initial phase 1 mode (i.e. operating without a GCM unit). Despite the complex and demanding work schedule, Occidental made the decision to continue operating the platform in phase 1 mode throughout this period and not <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> down, as had been originally planned. The planning and controls that were put in place were thought to be adequate. Therefore, Piper continued to export oil at just under 120,000 barrels per day and to export Tartan gas at some 33 MMSCFD (million standard cubic feet per day) during this demanding period.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{container}} manufacture in {{the developed}} world is a mature market business. World demand for flat glass was approximately 52 million tonnes in 2009. The United States, Europe and China account for 75% of demand, with China's consumption having increased from 20% in the early 1990s to 50%. Glass container manufacture is also a geographical business; the product is heavy and large in volume, and the major raw materials (sand, soda ash and limestone) are generally readily available, therefore production facilities need to be located close to their markets. A typical glass furnace holds hundreds of tonnes of molten glass, and so it is simply not practical <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> down every night, or in fact in any period short of a month. Factories therefore run 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This means that there is little opportunity to either increase or decrease production rates by more than a few percent. New furnaces and forming machines cost {{tens of millions of dollars}} and require at least 18 months of planning. Given this fact, and the fact that there are usually more products than machine lines means that products are sold from stock. The marketing/production challenge is therefore to be able to predict demand both in the short 4- to 12-week term and over the 24- to 48-month-long term. Factories are generally sized to service the requirements of a city; in developed countries there is usually a factory per 1–2 million people. A typical factory will produce 1–3 million containers a day.|$|E

500|$|The most {{commonly}} used cylinder valve type is the single outlet plain valve, sometimes known as a [...] "K" [...] valve, which allows connection of a single regulator, and has no reserve function. It simply opens to allow gas flow, or closes <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> off. Several configurations are used, with options of DIN or A-clamp connection, and vertical or transverse spindle arrangements. The valve is operated by turning a knob, usually rubber or plastic, which affords a comfortable grip. Several turns are required to fully open the valves. Some DIN valves are convertible to A-clamp by use of an insert which is screwed into the opening.|$|E
