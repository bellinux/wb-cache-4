40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the coupling resonance conditions of <b>the</b> <b>tyre,</b> cavity and <b>rim</b> with the attachment of trim layers on the inner surface of <b>tyre</b> to mitigate <b>the</b> resonance effect. In order to validate the mathematical formulation, finite element analysis and experimental modal testing were performed to determine the frequency response function (FRF) for a tyre-wheel assembly with and without the trim layers {{as well as for}} separated <b>tyre</b> and <b>rim.</b> It was found that the resonance magnitude has been reduced when the trim layers were added. Couplings of cavity resonance to <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> and <b>rim</b> were plausible due to the proximity of their resonance frequencies.

40|$|Even {{though there}} are no {{regulations}} on the interior noise level of passenger cars, it is a significant quality aspect both for customers and for car manufacturers. The reduction of many other car noise sources pushed tyre road noise to the forefront. What is more, well known phenomenon of <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> acoustic cavity resonance (TCR), appearing around 225 Hz, makes the interior noise noticeably worse. Some techniques to mitigate this phenomenon right at the source are discussed in this thesis, however, these has not been adopted by <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> nor car manufacturers yet. Therefore, there is a desire to minimise at least the transmission of the acoustic or vibration energy from <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> to <b>the</b> compartment. This is where methods like TPA (Transfer Path Analysis) come into play. In this thesis, two different approaches to TPA are used to investigate transmission of the TCR energy. First, the coherence based road decomposition method is used {{to determine whether the}} TCR energy is transmitted by a structure-borne or an air-borne mechanism. The same method serves to identify if the TCR noise comes mainly from the front or the rear suspension. Second, the impedance matrix method was used to determine critical structure-borne transfer paths yielding clear results indicating two critical mounts at the rear suspension which dominate the transfer of vibro-acoustic energy. Subsequent physical modification of the critical mount was tested to verify the results of the transmission study. Moreover, deflection shape analysis of <b>the</b> <b>tyre,</b> <b>rim,</b> front and rear suspension was performed to identify possible amplification effects of the TCR phenomenon...|$|R

50|$|One way to {{estimate}} wheel diameter {{is to add}} twice <b>the</b> nominal <b>tyre</b> cross-section to <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> diameter.

This ignores {{factors that contribute to}} the actual rolling radius of <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> and <b>rim</b> together: <b>the</b> vertical deflection of the tire above the contact patch and the difference between the manufacturer's stated size and the actual tire radius when mounted and inflated.|$|R

5000|$|Often, owners may {{desire to}} lower their vehicle {{to such an extent}} that they must cut away {{portions}} of the frame for more clearance. A reinforcement member commonly referred to as a C-notch is then bolted or welded to the vehicle frame in order to maintain structural integrity. Specifically on pickup trucks, this process is termed [...] "notching" [...] because a portion (notch) of the cargo bed may also be removed, along with the wheel wells, to provide maximum axle clearance. For some, it is desirable to have the vehicle so low that the frame rests on the ground when the air bags are fully deflated. Owners generally choose between having their cars 'tuck' their wheels into the arches when their air suspension is fully lowered or alternatively they can choose to go for 'fitment' which in partnership with stretched <b>tyres</b> sees <b>the</b> arch itself fit in between <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> and <b>rim.</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that wheels are {{responsible}} for a significant amount of the total aerodynamic drag of passenger vehicles. <b>Tyres,</b> and mostly <b>rims,</b> {{have been the subject of}} research in the automotive industry for the past years, but their effect and interaction with each other and with the car exterior is still not completely understood. This paper focuses on the use of CFD to study <b>the</b> effects of <b>tyre</b> geometry (tyre profile and tyre tread) on road vehicle aerodynamics. Whenever possible, results of the numerical computations are compared with experiments. More than sixty configurations were simulated. These simulations combined different <b>tyre</b> profiles, treads, <b>rim</b> designs and spoke orientation on two car types: a sedan and a sports wagon. Two tyre geometries were obtained directly from <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> manufacturer, while a third geometry was obtained from our database and represents a generic tyre which covers different profiles of a given tyre size. All geometries were deformed based on measured wind tunnel data under a defined load and rotating conditions of 100 kph. Results have shown that the main grooves consistently lead to a decrease of both drag and lift. The edge pattern however, did not show a clear trend for drag and lift with respect to the different configurations studied, although its influence was always more noticeable on the sports wagon. The larger profile of <b>the</b> generic <b>tyre</b> resulted in higher drag and lift values with relation to <b>the</b> <b>tyres</b> obtained from <b>the</b> manufacturer. For a given rim, a drag difference was observed between two tyre geometries with same profile but different tyre tread. These findings lead to <b>the</b> conclusion that <b>tyre</b> profile, as well as tyre pattern, are important to consider. These results were confirmed by wind tunnel tests. In conclusion, the work of aerodynamic optimization of rims cannot be separated from <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> itself...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Hand rim {{wheelchair}} propulsion is {{inefficient and}} physically straining. To evaluate the possibly advantageous {{role in this}} respect of three different prototype hand <b>rim</b> <b>configurations</b> (a rubber foam-coated cylindrical (II) hand rim and two profiled rubber foam-coated hand rims (wide and narrow: III, IV)), a group of 10 unimpaired subjects conducted four submaximal discontinuous wheelchair exercise tests on a computer-controlled wheelchair ergometer, thus allowing a comparison with a standard hand rim (chromium-plated round hand rim (I)). Methods: Apart from physiological measures (oxygen uptake, heart rate (HR), ventilation, mechanical efficiency (ME)), a subjective score for the rating {{of each of the}} hand rims was determined, as well as characteristics of the force application in the propulsion phase during each test condition. Timing parameters of the push and recovery phase were determined. Each exercise test was conducted with one of the four hand <b>rim</b> <b>configurations</b> in a counter-balanced order. Results: Analysis of variance with repeated measures (hand <b>rim</b> <b>configuration,</b> power output) revealed no significant effects (P> 0. 05) on any of the physiological parameters and force application characteristics for the main factor 'hand rim configuration'. Only the subjective score (scale 0 - 10) for rating of the hand rims proved significantly different between the round rubber (7. 5 ± 0. 53) coated hand rim - receiving the highest score - versus the narrow rubber-coated flat profiled hand rim (5. 5 ± 1. 72). Discussion: In this subject group and under the selected tasks and submaximal conditions of wheelchair propulsion, the studied hand <b>rim</b> <b>configurations</b> did not introduce critical shifts in the technique of (de-) coupling and power production in the push phase. As a consequence, no systematic shifts in ME are found among the different hand <b>rim</b> <b>configurations.</b> It is suggested that the biological constraints of the task overrule the possible effects of small design variations of the different hand <b>rim</b> <b>configurations</b> within the studied subject group and under the limited test conditions. The hand rim design characteristics may however be much more critical in (1) experienced wheelchair users, (2) especially those subjects with a limited hand-arm and/or trunk function and/or (3) under much more extreme conditions of daily wheelchair ambulation (i. e. turning, stopping/starting, negotiating a slope) or during peak performance. These issues clearly require continued future research. As such, the current results can be viewed as preliminary results only. © 2003 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of a series of}} measurements of the audio-frequency response of a large set of automotive vehicles is presented: a small hatchback model with both a three-door (411 vehicles) and five-door (403 vehicles) derivative and a mid-sized family five-door car (316 vehicles). The sets included vehicles of various specifications, engines, gearboxes, interior trim, wheels and <b>tyres.</b> <b>The</b> tests were performed in a hemianechoic chamber with the temperature and humidity recorded. Two tests were performed on each vehicle and the interior cabin noise measured. In the first, the excitation was acoustically induced by sets of external loudspeakers. In the second test, predominantly structure-borne noise was induced by running the vehicle at a steady speed on a rough roller. For both types of excitation, it is seen that the effects of temperature are small, indicating that manufacturing variability is larger than that due to temperature for the tests conducted. It is also observed that there are no significant outlying vehicles, i. e. there are at most only a few vehicles that consistently have the lowest or highest noise levels over the whole spectrum. For the acoustically excited tests, measured 1 / 3 -octave noise reduction levels typically have a spread of 5 dB or so and the normalised standard deviation of the linear data is typically 0. 1 or higher. Regarding the statistical distribution of the linear data, a lognormal distribution is a somewhat better fit than a Gaussian distribution for lower 1 / 3 -octave bands, while the reverse is true at higher frequencies. For the distribution of the overall linear levels, a Gaussian distribution is generally the most representative. As a simple description of the response variability, it is sufficient for this series of measurements to assume that the acoustically induced airborne cabin noise is best described by a Gaussian distribution with a normalised standard deviation between 0. 09 and 0. 145. There is generally considerable variability in the roller-induced noise, with individual 1 / 3 -octave levels varying by typically 15 dB or so and with the normalised standard deviation being in the range 0. 2 – 0. 35 or more. These levels are strongly affected by wheel <b>rim</b> and <b>tyre</b> constructions. For vehicles with nominally identical wheel <b>rims</b> and <b>tyres,</b> <b>the</b> normalised standard deviation for 1 / 3 -octave levels in the frequency range 40 – 600 Hz is 0. 2 or so.
