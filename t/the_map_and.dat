5|$|According to Ito, the Super Famicom {{release was}} a great success for the company, helping {{establishing}} it as both a developer and publisher. While a success, the game also received criticism from players for its high encounter rate and difficulties using <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> in-game instructions. At the end of 2001, the PlayStation version was the 119th best selling video {{game of the year}} in Japan, with 85,991 sold copies.|$|E
5|$|Players {{begin with}} a {{constructed}} town center or a wagon that will build into such, an armed explorer, and a modest number of villagers. Players explore <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> begin gathering resources used to build additional units and buildings and to research upgrades or technologies. Actions such as training units, constructing buildings, killing enemy units etc., earn the player experience points. At certain experience point thresholds, players earn shipments that may be turned in for cards from the player's Home City, which can include units, upgrades, or resources. The game progresses similar to most real-time strategy games until one side resigns.|$|E
5|$|The {{deliberate}} {{planting of}} fake documents {{to be found}} by the enemy was not new; known as the Haversack Ruse, it had been practised by the British {{and others in the}} First and Second World Wars. In August 1942, before the Battle of Alam el Halfa, a corpse was placed in a blown-up scout car, in a minefield facing the German 90th Light Division. On the corpse was a map purportedly showing the locations of British minefields; the Germans used <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> their tanks were routed to areas of soft sand where they bogged down.|$|E

5|$|The game {{world is}} {{presented}} in a horizontal wraparound and consists of three platforms which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman must assemble his rocket (which spawns in instalments scattered around <b>the</b> <b>map),</b> <b>and</b> then fill it with fuel before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is broadly repeated. In addition, the player has to defend themselves from the planet's aliens, and for bonus points collect valuable resources which occasionally fall from above.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a story}} {{published}} in Century magazine in September 1898, Edwin Emerson, Jr., was {{pretending to be a}} German journalist. He presented himself to the German Consul in St. Thomas and asked for the names of Puerto Ricans of German descent whom he could interview. Among the names which the consul gave him were that of the Riefkohl family of the town of Maunabo. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met 14-year-old Rudolph W. Riefkohl and asked the lad in German if he had a map of Puerto Rico (Emerson had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, however it was decidedly too big for Emerson's use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that Emerson was a spy, and quickly drew another with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. Emerson used <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> it is believed by some that he may have given the map to the U.S. Army Commanding General, Nelson A. Miles, influencing Mile's decision on the landing points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A photostatic copy of Riefkohl's map was {{published in}} the Century article.|$|E
5|$|Spells {{are cast}} using mana, not gold {{as in the}} first game. Spells include healing creatures, {{creating}} Imps, and summoning all creatures to a particular location. There are two grades of each spell, upgraded in the Library, the higher grade version being more powerful. For example, an upgraded Create Imp spell summons a level four Imp, whereas the normal version summons a level one Imp. As with the first game, the player can possess a creature and interact with the world from its perspective using its abilities. A special spell {{is the ability to}} summon Horny to assist the player for a short period. In the Campaign mode, it requires the assembling of the talisman, pieces of which are obtained through the discovery of bonus levels. Mana vaults may be scattered across certain levels; these may be claimed to increase mana generation. Other magical items are special items that provide a specific benefit to the player. These include healing all creatures, revealing <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> <b>and</b> locating a hidden level. There are five hidden levels based on mini games such as golf, bowling, and duck shooting.|$|E

5|$|Susan meets Jim Dolan at the {{hospital}} and she asks him to talk about the Patient Advocacy Program for a news article. Jim reveals that he has cancer and Susan supports him during his treatments. Malcolm comes to visit his parents and detects all is not well between them. Susan becomes worried when Jim does not answer her calls and Karl confesses that he asked Jim to keep his distance, which angers Susan. She accuses Karl of being jealous. Karl invites Jim over for lunch and he notices <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> leaflets for Peru. Jim works out Susan is delaying the holiday for him. He then collapses and Susan begs Karl to save him. Susan comforts Jim when he realises he is going to die and she tries to take him out of {{the hospital}}, so they can visit his childhood home, as promised. Karl stops her and when they step outside to talk, Jim dies. Susan is devastated and blames Karl for keeping her from Jim. She then leaves to arrange Jim's funeral. On her return, Susan and Karl announce that they are separating. Malcolm initially blames Susan for the split, but Karl confesses it was his idea. Karl tells Susan that he cannot be just friends with her and he looks for somewhere else to live. Susan starts a book group with Kate and Sonya Mitchell (Eve Morey).|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive cursor. The cursor changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, {{and can be used}} to talk to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking {{on the edge of the}} screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.|$|E
5|$|The turn-based ground combat uses a {{top-down}} 3D perspective. The player controls a {{squad of}} between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is. Fog of war hides the aliens and their actions from view until the player's soldiers are in range and have line of sight on them, and enemies normally do not act at all until the squad initially comes within line of sight. Soldiers can carry items and perform special abilities; use of these items and abilities is controlled through a toolbar on the head-up display (HUD). A few examples of abilities include firing on enemies automatically after they emerge, launching explosives, and healing allies.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy VII {{is mostly}} comparable to earlier Final Fantasy titles and Japanese role-playing games. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, {{and the battle}} screen. At its grandest scale, players explore the entire world of Final Fantasy VII on a 3D world map. The world map is littered with representations of areas for the player to enter, including towns, environments, and ruins. Natural barrierssuch as mountains, deserts, and bodies of waterblock access by foot to some areas; as the game progresses, the player receives vehicles that help traverse these obstacles. Chocobos {{can be found in}} certain spots on <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> <b>and</b> if caught, can be ridden to areas inaccessible by foot or vehicle. In field mode, the player navigates fully scaled versions of the areas represented on the world map. For {{the first time in the}} Final Fantasy series, this mode is represented in three-dimensional space. The player can explore the environment, talk with characters, advance the story, and initiate event games in this mode. Event games are short minigames that use special control functions and are often tied into the story. While in field mode, the player may also find shops and inns. Shops provide an opportunity to buy and sell items that can aid Cloud and his party, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. If the characters rest at an inn, their hit points and mana points will be completely restored, along with any abnormalities contracted during battles.|$|E

25|$|A good map has to {{compromise}} between portraying the items of interest (or themes) {{in the right}} place on <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> <b>and</b> the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a slightly incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space on the ground. A good example from the late 1980s was the Ordnance Survey's first digital maps, where the absolute positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from ground truth, when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.|$|E
