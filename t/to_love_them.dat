Melanie finds the children hard {{to deal with}} at first but grows <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>them.</b> Ian and Mel plan to marry but Melanie gets cold feet, realising she doesn't truly love Ian. Ian hears her say this and blackmails her into marrying him by telling her that Lucy has cancer.

25|$|Zaripa {{decides that}} {{it is best to}} {{forestall}} conveying the news of Abutalip's death to her children. Yedigei thereafter becomes the paternal figure in her children's lives and grows <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> more than his own daughters. Abutalip's last request was for Yedigei to tell his sons about the Aral Sea, so Yedigei spends much time telling them about his former occupation as a fisherman. As a result of his frequent reminiscing, Yedigei recalls the time he had to catch a golden sturgeon to quell the desires of his wife, Ukubala's, unborn child but decides not to share it. He eventually becomes fond of Zaripa from spending so much time with her and her children, but she does not return his affection and moves away one day when Yedigei travels to another junction to fetch his wandering camel. In consequence, Yedigei projects his anger onto Karanar by maiming him until he runs away again, only to later return famished and dilapidated.|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{subject matter}} expands on Thank Me Laters theme of ambivalence and {{conflicted}} feelings toward fame. Drake's lyrics on Take Care address failed romances, missed connections, relationship {{with friends and}} family, maintaining balance with growing wealth and fame, concerns about leading a hollow life, the passage of young adulthood, and despondency. The album's slower songs generally explore themes of loneliness, heartbreak, and mistrust. The topic of women is prevalent on the album, with songs that address past and potential lovers ("Marvins Room", [...] "The Real Her") and songs about revering ("Make Me Proud") and lavishing them ("We'll Be Fine"). Juan Edgardo Rodriguez of No Ripcord denotes women as [...] "the main force in his songs – he’s consciously aware about what it takes <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>them,</b> but simply decides to thrust aside the guidelines because he's on an entirely different stratosphere from any female average joe." ...|$|E

She is also said to be always on the watch to attack other young mothers.|$|R

2500|$|Parks {{initially}} {{became aware}} of the Beach Boys during their early popularity in the early 1960s. Speaking of them in 1995, he said, [...] "I knew they didn't surf.…I felt some resentment about , and I had been a fan of Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones.…Instinctively, I was not a Beach Boy fan. 'Something really dumb about it.'" [...] He added that, [...] "I loved Pet Sounds, you see. I came back <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>them,</b> and thought they had done a great job. It seemed to me that they would be fine in fighting spirit to take on this challenge of wresting that trophy {{out of the hands of}} those interlopers." [...] Parks has gone on to call Wilson [...] "the biggest event of that era" [...] but is hesitant to label him a [...] "genius," [...] believing Wilson to be more [...] "a lucky guy with a tremendous amount of talent and a lot of people collaborating beautifully around him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Captain von Trapp arrives a {{month later}} from Vienna with Baroness Elsa Schräder and Max Detweiler. Elsa tells Max that {{something}} is preventing the Captain from marrying her. He opines that only poor people have the time for great romances ("How Can Love Survive"). Rolf enters, looking for Liesl, and greets them with [...] "Heil". The Captain orders him away, saying that he is Austrian, not German. Maria and the children leapfrog in, wearing play-clothes that she made from the old drapes in her room. Infuriated, the Captain sends them off to change. She tells him that they need him <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>them,</b> and he angrily orders {{her back to the}} abbey. As she apologizes, they hear the children singing [...] "The Sound of Music", which she had taught them, to welcome Elsa Schräder. He joins in and embraces them. Alone with Maria, he asks her to stay, thanking her for bringing music back into his house. Elsa is suspicious of her until she explains that she will be returning to the abbey in September.|$|E

Mandy helps Ian {{discover}} his more frivolous side and he realises he has feelings for her. They begin a relationship, realising that they both yearn for someone <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>them,</b> and Mandy accepts Ian's impromptu marriage proposal. The relationship is marred by Mandy's one-night stand with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), Ian's insecurities, interference from Mandy's abusive mother Lorraine Stevens (Victoria Alcock), and Lucy's hatred of Mandy. Despite Lucy's best efforts to split them up, Ian is determined to marry Mandy and brings their wedding day forward. Mandy is horrified, however, when Ian chooses her over Lucy and throws his daughter out. Realising she does not love Ian, Mandy leaves him in May 2012, leading to Ian suffering a nervous breakdown.

As long as they're there, screaming at me from the television, glaring at me from the magazines, I'm stuck in the model trap. Hate them first.

60|$|And this is God's way {{of dealing}} with {{each and every one of}} us. This is God's {{way of dealing}} with Christian nations, just as it was His {{way of dealing with}} the Jews of old. He never allowed the Jews to prosper in sin. He punished them at once, and sternly, {{whenever}} they rebelled against Him; not because He hated them, but because He <b>loved</b> <b>them.</b> His <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> showed itself whenever they went well with Him, in triumphs and blessings; and when they rebelled against Him, and broke His laws, He showed that very same <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in plague, and war, and famine, and a mighty hand, and fury poured out. His love had not changed--they had changed; and now the best and only way of showing His <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> was by making them feel His anger; and the best and only way of being merciful to them, was to show them no indulgence.|$|R

[...] Another Manchester critic's assessment was less enthusiastic: [...] "For a story which could touch upon the post-Factory Manchester music scene, the rise of boy bands and the regeneration of the city after the bomb, Never Forget is surprisingly damp.
