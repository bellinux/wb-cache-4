He was in trouble with <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>on</b> {{more than one occasion}} and after the Second World War was charged with defrauding his wartime employers, the Ministry of Food; he was found not guilty. He died in 1959 at the age of 66.|$|E

5|$|The {{pamphlet}} was confiscated by <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>on</b> 8 February. The {{person who}} printed the pamphlet, Nikolai Olsen, {{was arrested on}} the same day, and the apprehension of Jon Hol followed on 10 February. He remained in custody until 26 February, and was indicted on 11 March, for lèse majesté. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Lars Holst were indicted on the same charge. Upon the arrests, the newspaper Verdens Gang noted that no conservative writers had been sanctioned, despite openly calling for a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} {{is the fact}} that both Maribor and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two groups are the largest in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> <b>On</b> many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E

5|$|Cully and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues in the halls, stairwell, and {{elevator}}; all Cully's men {{are killed}} but one, who Doc allows to run away. Cully himself dies when Doc shoots the cables {{of the elevator}} he is in and it crashes {{to the bottom of}} the shaft. Rudy comes to his senses, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>on</b> the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck and force the driver, a cooperative old cowboy, to take them to Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 for his truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple continue into Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>on</b> 5 November and his family received {{a telephone call from}} him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To said this was a reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking whether they had heard from him. His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the case would be closed as resolved.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 2012, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was driving}} her {{daughter}} to school in Morelia at around 8:30a.m. when a vehicle ran them off the road. Two armed men descended from their vehicle and forced {{her out of her}} car as onlookers watched. Gorrostieta Salazar pleaded with her abductors to let her daughter go unharmed, and then agreed to go with the kidnappers. The family of the former mayor initially thought it was a ransom kidnapping. After not hearing from Gorrostieta Salazar or her abductors for two days, they notified <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> <b>On</b> 15 November, police identified the body after farm workers from the rural community of San Juan Tararameo in Cuitzeo found the corpse on their way to work.|$|E

5|$|Several {{newspapers}} published {{images of}} Tomlinson's {{first encounter with}} police that evening. According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument Tube Station at around 7pm. The Daily Mail published an image showing Tomlinson smoking a cigarette {{in front of a}} police van in Lombard Street. An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge him out of the way, and when that didn't work he was moved by four riot officers. The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being pushed by <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> <b>On</b> 16 April The Guardian published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons end up staying inside {{during an}} acid {{rainstorm}} caused by The Republican Party's latest {{decision to make}} caring for the environment a felony offense {{to play a game}} of Monopoly. When it is revealed that Bart has been cheating by using Lego bricks as hotel pieces, Bart threatens Lisa and Homer assaults him. Marge and Lisa try to pry them apart. Despite her inability to talk, Maggie calls <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>on</b> her family before taking hold of Marge and attempting to pull her off Homer. With help from an edible taffy-like substance and a robot, the entire Simpson family is arrested for causing a domestic disturbance.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} censored {{news reports}} and withheld exact casualty figures during the protests. Most pro-government media held Hindus and communists responsible for encouraging the disorder and student unrest. The families of Abul Barkat and Rafiq Uddin Ahmed tried {{to charge the}} police with murder, but the charges were dismissed by <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> <b>On</b> 8 April government report on the incidents failed to show any particular justification for police firings on the students.

5|$|The mounted police {{assisted}} {{in the construction of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway, including relocating indigenous communities living along the route. The force established a wide network of posts and patrols, enabling them to protect and assist the ranchers who created huge cattle businesses across the prairies. The living conditions of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>on</b> the prairies were spartan and often uncomfortable, and only slowly improved over the course of the century. Meanwhile, the railway enabled more settlers to migrate west, creating new towns and industries, while the force restricted the First Nations to the reservations. The mounted police faced challenges in adapting to the changing situation, especially when applying the unpopular prohibition laws to the white community. The force also became drawn into the growing number of industrial disputes between organised labour and company owners.|$|E
5|$|While Árbenz {{was living}} in Montevideo, his wife came to join him. He was also visited by Arévalo a year after his own arrival there. Although the {{relationship}} between Arévalo and the Árbenz family was initially friendly, it soon deteriorated due to {{differences between the two}} men. Arévalo himself was not under surveillance in Uruguay and was occasionally able to express himself through articles in the popular press. He left for Venezuela a year after his arrival to take up a position as a teacher. During his stay in Uruguay, Árbenz was initially required to report to <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>on</b> a daily basis; eventually, however, this requirement was relaxed a little. María Árbenz later stated that the couple was pleased by the hospitality they received in Uruguay, and would have stayed there indefinitely had they received permission to do so.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1915, many Ghadarites (nearly 8,000 in the Punjab {{province}} alone by some estimates) had returned to India. However, they were not assigned a central leadership and begun their work on an ad hoc basis. Although some were rounded up by <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>on</b> suspicion, many remained at large and began establishing contacts with garrisons in major cities like Lahore, Ferozepur and Rawalpindi. Various plans {{had been made to}} attack the military arsenal at Mian Meer, near Lahore and initiate a general uprising on 15 November 1914. In another plan, a group of Sikh soldiers, the manjha jatha, planned to start a mutiny in the 23rd Cavalry at the Lahore cantonment on 26 November. A further plan called for a mutiny to start on 30 November from Ferozepur under Nidham Singh. In Bengal, the Jugantar, through Jatin Mukherjee, established contacts with the garrison at Fort William in Calcutta. In August 1914, Mukherjee's group had seized a large consignment of guns and ammunition from the Rodda company, a major gun manufacturing firm in India. In December 1914, several politically motivated armed robberies to obtain funds were carried out in Calcutta. Mukherjee kept in touch with Rash Behari Bose through Kartar Singh and V.G. Pingle. These rebellious acts, which were until then organised separately by different groups, were brought into a common umbrella under the leadership of Rash Behari Bose in North India, V. G. Pingle in Maharashtra, and Sachindranath Sanyal in Benares. A plan was made for a unified general uprising, with the date set for 21 February 1915.|$|E

5|$|Homer, {{attempting}} {{to prove to}} himself he can {{have a good time}} without Marge, leaves Bart, Lisa and Maggie under the supervision of Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates before they got married. Ironically, Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night, but they leave just before Homer arrives. Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home, which Homer accepts. As Ruth and Marge are driving home, Chief Wiggum, with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car, spots Ruth's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other. He decides to pull them over. Reluctant to stop, Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she's driving actually belongs to her ex-husband, and that she had stolen it as revenge for stiffing her on child support (although Marge points out that Ruth could've just reported him to child services). Ruth leads <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>on</b> a high-speed chase rather than turning herself in. Homer realizes it is Marge in the car, and believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights, which leads him to believe her car is a ghost car.|$|E
