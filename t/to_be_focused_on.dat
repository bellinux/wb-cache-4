5|$|After the war, {{membership}} {{dropped to}} a low of 11,000 in 155 squadrons and the Air Cadet program underwent a transformation to reflect the changing needs of Canada and the cadets. The Air Cadet League introduced awards for proficiency and loyalty to the squadrons, summer courses were offered at RCAF stations, and a flying scholarship course was developed. To date, more than 15,000 cadets have received their private pilot licence through the scholarship course. Training shifted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the development of citizenship and an interest in aviation.

5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was to coat it with black paint, blocking its ability to see or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton yield, and launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|E

5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (<b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on)</b> instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{invention}} of his revolutionary illumination scheme as {{a graduate student at the}} University of Giessen, Köhler was working on overcoming problems with microphotography. Microscopes were illuminated by gas lamps, mirrors or other primitive light sources, resulting in an uneven specimen illumination unsuited for producing good quality photomicrographs using the slow-speed emulsions available at the time. Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source. It involved a collector lens for the lamp that allowed the light source <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the front aperture of the condenser. This in turn allowed the condenser <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the specimen using a field diaphragm and condenser focus control. This superior illumination scheme is still widely used in modern microscopes and forms the basis for phase contrast, differential interference contrast, epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy.|$|E

25|$|The ocelli {{of insects}} bear a simple lens, but their focal point always lies behind the retina; {{consequently}} {{they can never}} form a sharp image. Ocelli (pit-type eyes of arthropods) blur the image across the whole retina, and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush {{the information to the}} brain. Focusing the image would also cause the sun's image <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> a few receptors, with the possibility of damage under the intense light; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Defects in vision can be {{explained}} using optical principles. As people age, the lens becomes less flexible and the near point recedes from the eye, a condition known as presbyopia. Similarly, people suffering from hyperopia cannot decrease the focal length of their lens enough to allow for nearby objects to be imaged on their retina. Conversely, people who cannot increase the focal length of their lens enough to allow for distant objects to be imaged on the retina suffer from myopia and have a far point that is considerably closer than infinity. A condition known as astigmatism results when the cornea is not spherical but instead is more curved in one direction. This causes horizontally extended objects <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> {{different parts of the}} retina than vertically extended objects, and results in distorted images.|$|E

25|$|Geobiology is a {{field of}} {{scientific}} research that explores the interactions between the physical Earth and the biosphere. It is a relatively young field, and its borders are fluid. There is considerable overlap with the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, paleontology, and particularly biogeochemistry. Geobiology applies the principles and methods of biology and geology {{to the study of}} the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth as well as the role of life in the modern world. Geobiologic studies tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> microorganisms, and on the role that life plays in altering the chemical and physical environment of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and/or cryosphere.

25|$|Thus, the Internet {{of things}} creates an {{opportunity}} to measure, collect and analyse an ever-increasing variety of behavioural statistics. Cross-correlation of this data could revolutionise the targeted marketing of products and services.

The Internet of things, therefore, transforms the media industry, companies and even governments, opening up a new era of economic growth and competitiveness. The wealth of data generated by this industry will allow practitioners in advertising and media to gain an elaborate layer on the present targeting mechanisms used by the industry.|$|E
25|$|For an {{organization}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> a democratic leadership style, traits, functions and relationships {{have to be}} obtained. Before you can classify someone to leadership position, certain qualities have to follow. The common assumptions of leaders are: leaders are born; however, {{this is not the}} case. Leaders are developed through different types of training and experience. Through the training and experience, the leader gains different traits to help make the organization functional. Leaders need to be interpersonal, cognitive, and motivational. An interpersonal leader allows for relationships to be built and to communicate messages to their followers. Cognitive leaders are able to problem solve more effective because of their intellectual ability to process information and come up with creative ideas to help eliminate the problem in the organization. Finally, having motivational leaders gets the organization excited about new tasks and this allows for positive productions to occur. Motivation has been associated with ratings of leadership potential, career achievement, and promotion. The three traits will help a leader become successful because others will look up to them, and create a positive organization to work in.|$|E

500|$|Focus constructions emphasise a {{particular}} piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, the girl was stung by a bee (emphasising it was a bee and not for example a wasp that stung her), or The girl was stung by a bee (contrasting with another possibility, for example {{that it was the}} boy). Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> relative to the main clause. For example, That girl over there, she was stung by a bee, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, she was stung by a bee, that girl over there, where reference to the girl is established as an [...] "afterthought".|$|E
