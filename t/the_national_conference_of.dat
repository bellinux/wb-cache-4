5|$|During {{his time}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Ford rebuilt the state's Democratic machine, which would help elect him and others, including Senator Walter Huddleston and Governor Martha Layne Collins. When Governor Nunn asked the legislature to increase the state sales tax in 1968 from 3 percent to 5 percent, Ford opposed the measure, saying it should only pass if food and medicine were exempted. Ford lost this battle; the increase passed without exemptions. From 1970 to 1971, Ford {{was a member of}} the Executive Committee of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> Lieutenant Governors.|$|E

5|$|Following the Third Circuit's decision, Heffernan {{petitioned the}} Supreme Court for certiorari, {{requesting}} {{they hear the}} case.

5|$|The Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act, first {{tentative}} {{draft in}} 1925 and fifth final version in 1932, {{was a result}} of work by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. It was argued that the traffic in narcotic drugs should have the same safeguards and the same regulation in all of the states. The committee took into consideration the fact that the federal government had already passed the Harrison Act in 1914 and the Federal Import and Export Act in 1922. Many people assumed that the Harrison Act was all that was necessary. The Harrison Act, however, was a revenue-producing act and, while it provided penalties for violation, it did not give the states themselves authority to exercise police power in regard to seizure of drugs used in illicit trade, or in regard to punishment of those responsible. The act was recommended to the states for that purpose. As a result of the Uniform State Narcotic Act, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics encouraged state governments to adopt the act. By the middle of the 1930s all member states had some regulation of cannabis.|$|E
