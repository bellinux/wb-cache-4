Microtubules have {{a key role in}} mitosis: they generate the mitotic spindle assembly, which allows chromosome segregation and the cell division. Their stabilization leads to the inability of cells <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> <b>or</b> <b>to</b> their apoptosis. That is why microtubule targeting agents are, nowadays, powerful anticancer drugs. It also explains why tubulin is now considered {{as one of the most}} highly validated cancer targets.|$|R
