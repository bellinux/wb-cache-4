25|$|So Kock went {{directly}} to President Lincoln. Lincoln had his doubts about Kock's sincerity at first. He suspected that Kock was only after the $50 per person which had been promised. Kock managed to convince him, however, and on December 31, the President promised that he would think about his plan. But just one day later, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which contained not a single word about <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> colonial plan.|$|E
25|$|Catholics {{say that}} Santa Muerte is an idol, {{the worship of}} which has been {{rejected}} by God in the Old Testament. Veneration of <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> idol can be a form of inadvertent devil-worship, because regardless of the intent of the worshipers; the devil can trick people into doing such things. Priests regularly chastise parishioners, telling them that death is not a person but rather a phase of life. However, the Church stops short of labeling such followers as heretics, instead accusing them of heterodoxy.|$|E

25|$|We {{have too}} many Jews in the towns. They are needed on the Polish border because in these areas Hebrews alone perform trade. As {{soon as you get}} away from the frontier, the Jews become a disadvantage, they form cliques, they deal in {{contraband}} and get up to all manner of rascally tricks which are detrimental to Christian burghers and merchants.

25|$|Recent {{excavations}} of {{ruins of}} Hindu temples, {{such as the}} 14th century Malinithan {{at the foot of}} the Siang hills in West Siang, indicate they were built during the Chutiya reign. Another notable heritage site, Bhismaknagar, has led to suggestions that the Idu (Mishmi) had an advanced culture and administration in prehistoric times. Again, however, no evidence directly associates Bhismaknagar with <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> known culture but the Chutiya rulers held the areas around Bhismaknagar from the 12th to 16th century. The third heritage site, the 400-year-old Tawang Monastery in the extreme north-west of the state, provides some historical evidence of the Buddhist tribal people. The sixth Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyatso was born in Tawang.|$|E
25|$|The ABO {{blood group}} system {{is used to}} denote the {{presence}} of one, both, or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes. In human blood transfusions {{it is the most}} important of the 35 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized. A very rare (in modern medicine) mismatch in <b>this,</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> serotype, can cause a serious, potentially fatal, adverse reaction after a transfusion, or a contra-indicated immune response to a organ transplant. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies, which are produced {{in the first years of}} life by sensitization to environmental substances, such as food, bacteria, and viruses. ABO blood types are also present in some other animals, for example rodents and apes, such as chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{differences}} in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform phase and frequency responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often {{not the case for}} music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications, but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, and even a few obsolete models, and shows the data for them all in one common format for ease of comparison.. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC60268-4.|$|E
25|$|In the Cairo museum may be {{seen the}} statue of {{a man from the}} period of the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{possibly}} 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> period. The figure is carved out of a solid block of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined on. The eyes are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent rock crystal forms the iris, while a tiny bit of polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The IV., V. and VI. dynasties cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these are not, like mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification (Maspero). As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these Ka statues, the features and proportions were closely copied.|$|E

500|$|It seems {{probable}} {{from this}} description that the mosque had a portal that projected from the wall, {{as did the}} earlier Great Mosque of Mahdiya.

Although the geographers al-Muqaddasi and Ibn Hawqal both praised this mosque, neither left specific descriptions of <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> mosque. Thus Ibn Hawqal says of it only that, [...] "It is one of the mosques distinguished by the spaciousness of its court, elegance of construction, and the fineness of its ceilings." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{suggestions}} {{for the performance}} context of the poem include Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff's argument that it {{was intended as a}} reply to the ritual abuse spoken by women at some festivals of Demeter.

[...] The poem might itself have been performed in an analogous ritual context, but these festivals would probably also have included women, and the poem seems to have been intended to be performed for an all-male audience.|$|E
