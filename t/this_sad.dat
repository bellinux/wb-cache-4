25|$|The {{work was}} ready for {{publication}} {{by the end of}} 1894, but no funds were available to have it printed. Each year Nevill urged the Natal government in his annual Report of the Government Astronomer to provide funds for publication, but to no avail. In his report for 1898 he wrote despairingly: The investigations of the errors in the lunar tables have been wrapped up in brown paper, tied up with red tape, and put away on a shelf until such time as a vote can be obtained to publish it… The next year disaster struck when the manuscript was damaged during a rainstorm owing to a leak in the observatory's roof. In subsequent years similar work was done by others, notably E.W. Brown in the United States, M. Radau in France, and P.H. Cowell in Britain, who received the credit. In 1907 Nevill related <b>this</b> <b>sad</b> history in his presidential address to Section A of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science.|$|E

25|$|During its 28 {{years in}} limbo, Potsdamer Platz exuded a strange fascination towards {{many people on}} the western side, {{especially}} tourists and also visiting politicians and heads of state. For {{the benefit of the}} former, the row of post-war single-storey shops in Potsdamer Straße now sold a wide variety of souvenir goods, many of which were purchased by coach-loads of curious visitors brought specially to <b>this</b> <b>sad</b> location. An observation platform had been erected, primarily for military personnel and police but used increasingly by members of the public, so that they could gaze over the Wall at the wilderness beyond. Meanwhile, among the many V.I.P.s who came to look were U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy (22 February 1962), Prime Minister Harold Wilson of the United Kingdom (6 March 1965), H.M. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom (27 May 1965), H.R.H. Charles, Prince of Wales (3 November 1972), U.S. President Jimmy Carter (15 July 1978), and U.S. Vice President (later President) George H. W. Bush (George Bush Senior) (1 February 1983).|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Gill and Monotype {{released}} an extremely bold sans-serif named Gill Kayo (from KO, or knockout, implying its solidity). This {{has often been}} branded as Gill Sans Ultra Bold, though in practice many letters vary considerably from Gill Sans. It is available in regular and condensed widths. Gill, who thought of the design {{as something of a}} novelty, considered naming it [...] "Double Elefans". Harling reviewed it as [...] "dismal" [...] and sarcastically commented that [...] "typographical historians of 2000AD (which isn't, after all, so very far away) will find this odd outburst in Mr Gill's career, and will spend much time in attempting to track down <b>this</b> <b>sad</b> psychological state of his during 1936." [...] Forty years later he described it as [...] "the most horrendous and blackguardly of these display exploitations". Some initial drawings of Kayo may have been prepared by Gill's son-in-law Denis Tegetmeier; it made a return to popularity in the graphic design of the 1970s and 80s.|$|E
500|$|Anne {{supported}} the Occasional Conformity Bill of 1702, which was {{promoted by the}} Tories and opposed by the Whigs. The bill aimed to disqualify Protestant Dissenters from public office by closing a loophole in the Test Acts, legislation that restricted public office to Anglican conformists. The existing law permitted nonconformists to take office if they took Anglican communion once a year. Anne's husband was placed in an unfortunate position when Anne forced him {{to vote for the}} bill, even though, being a Lutheran, he was an occasional conformist himself. The Whigs successfully blocked the bill {{for the duration of the}} parliamentary session. Anne reinstituted the traditional religious practice of touching for the king's evil that had been eschewed by William as papist superstition. After the Great Storm of 1703, Anne declared a general fast to implore God [...] "to pardon the crying sins of this nation which had drawn down <b>this</b> <b>sad</b> judgement". The Occasional Conformity Bill was revived in the wake of the storm, but Anne withheld support, fearing its reintroduction was a ruse to cause a political quarrel. Once again it failed. A third attempt to introduce the bill as an amendment to a money bill in November 1704 was also thwarted.|$|E
