It {{features}} a two-stage fan (low-pressure compressor) on the low-pressure shaft, {{followed by a}} five-stage high-pressure compressor on the high-pressure shaft. The engine uses an annular combustor, which feeds a single-stage high-pressure turbine followed by a single-stage low-pressure turbine.

50|$|Anyone new to {{variable}} stators had {{to overcome}} {{the complexity of the}} linkages and the difficulty of sealing the pivots and airfoil root/casing clearances. <b>Two</b> <b>spools</b> needed more knowledge about bearings and sealing. GE studied both options for nearly a year before deciding, in 1952, that they should pursue variable stators for the 12:1 pressure ratio(PR) compressor. Rolls-Royce had tested a rig compressor with four stages of variable stators in 1949 but did not pursue the idea at the time for the 6.5:1(PR) Avon. Connors tells us that Pratt and Whitney chose <b>two</b> <b>spools</b> for the 12:1(PR) J57 as they knew a lot more about bearings and sealing than about variable stators.|$|R

50|$|In An Introduction to Metaphysics, Bergson {{presents}} three {{images of}} duration. The first is of <b>two</b> <b>spools,</b> one unrolling {{to represent the}} continuous flow of ageing as one feels oneself moving {{toward the end of}} one's life-span, the other rolling up to represent the continuous growth of memory which, for Bergson, equals consciousness. No two successive moments are identical, for the one will always contain the memory left by the other. A person with no memory might experience two identical moments but, Bergson says, that person's consciousness would thus be {{in a constant state of}} death and rebirth, which he identifies with unconsciousness. The image of <b>two</b> <b>spools,</b> however, is of a homogeneous and commensurable thread, whereas, according to Bergson, no two moments can be the same, hence duration is heterogeneous.|$|R
2500|$|According to Everett in 1986, Pirahã has {{words for}} 'one' (hói) and 'two' (hoí), {{distinguished}} only by tone. In his 2005 analysis, however, Everett said that Pirahã has no words for numerals at all, and that hói and hoí actually mean [...] "small quantity" [...] and [...] "larger quantity". Frank et al. (2008) describes two experiments on four Pirahã speakers {{that were designed}} to test these two hypotheses. In one, ten spools of thread were placed on a table {{one at a time}} and the Pirahã were asked how many were there. All four speakers answered in accordance with the hypothesis that the language has words for 'one' and 'two' in this experiment, uniformly using hói for one <b>spool,</b> hoí for <b>two</b> <b>spools,</b> and a mixture of the second word and 'many' for more than <b>two</b> <b>spools.</b>|$|R
50|$|The F124 {{engine is}} {{fundamentally}} a low bypass, <b>two</b> <b>spool</b> engine (meaning {{that there are}} two rotational shafts, a high-pressure shaft and a low-pressure shaft). The fan/low-pressure compressor section is made of three stages with titanium blades. The first stage has 30 un-shrouded blades, and the overall pressure ratio for the three stage fan section is 2.5:1. Some of the air is bypassed (Bypass ratio of 0.472:1), and the rest is fed to the high-pressure compressor section.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>two</b> <b>spool</b> unmixed turbofan, the LP Compressor {{calculation}} {{is usually}} replaced by Fan Inner (i.e. hub) and Fan Outer (i.e. tip) compression calculations. The power absorbed {{by these two}} [...] "components" [...] is taken as the load on the LP turbine. After the Fan Outer compression calculation, there is a Bypass Duct pressure loss/Bypass Nozzle expansion calculation. Net thrust is obtained by deducting the intake ram drag from {{the sum of the}} Core Nozzle and Bypass Nozzle gross thrusts.|$|E
5000|$|To {{allow the}} system to manage the problem, system {{components}} called [...] "writers" [...] and [...] "spool files" [...] were developed. A writer is a small system program that reads the spool file, matches a particular printer with a ready-to-print spool object, and begins sending instructions to the printer. It is a two-way process; the printer sends a signal back to the system when it is ready for more work. In order to avoid mixing up data from <b>two</b> <b>spool</b> files, the first report to finish and close is traditionally printed first.|$|E

Steering signals are sent to the missile by means of two wires which pay out from <b>two</b> <b>spools</b> on the rear of the missile. A gas-operated arming mechanism is fed from the sustainer motor, arming the warhead 7.7 seconds after launch.|$|R

50|$|The Bristol Proteus was the Bristol Aeroplane Company's first {{successful}} {{gas turbine engine}} design, a turboprop that delivered just over 4,000 hp (3,000 kW). The Proteus was a <b>two</b> <b>spool,</b> reverse-flow gas turbine. Because the turbine stages of the inner spool drove no compressor stages, but only the propeller, this engine was classified as a free-turbine. It powered the Bristol Britannia airliner, small naval patrol craft, hovercraft and electrical generating sets. It was also used to power a land-speed record car, the Bluebird-Proteus CN7. After the merger of Bristol with Armstrong Siddeley the engine became the Bristol Siddeley Proteus, and later the Rolls-Royce Proteus.|$|E
50|$|The Honeywell/ITEC F124 is a low-bypass {{turbofan}} engine {{derived from the}} civilian Honeywell TFE731. The F125 is an afterburning version of the engine. The engine began development in the late 1970s for the Republic of China (Taiwan) Air Force AIDC F-CK Indigenous Defence Fighter (IDF), and it first ran in 1979. The F124/F125 engine has since been proposed for use on other aircraft, such as the T-45 Goshawk and the SEPECAT Jaguar, and currently powers the Aero L-159 Alca and the Alenia Aermacchi M-346. The F124 has a rather unusual design for a <b>two</b> <b>spool</b> gas turbine engine, using both axial and centrifugal compressors in its high-pressure compressor. There are currently only three production variants of the engine, although several more have been proposed throughout its lifespan.|$|E

Because the turbine stages of the inner spool drove no compressor stages, but only a power shaft, this engine is sometimes classified as a free turbine. The engine, a Proteus 705, was specially modified by Bristol's Stanley Hooker to have a power shaft {{at each end of}} the engine. These shafts are connected directly to final drive assemblies with differentials and fixed ratios of 3.6 to 1 providing power to all four wheels via half-shafts.|$|E

The tape speed for [...] "Standard Play" [...] mode (see below) is 3.335 cm/s (1.313 ips) for NTSC, 2.339 cm/s (0.921 ips) for PAL—or just over 2.0 and 1.4 metres (6 ft 6.7 in and 4 ft 7.2 in) per minute respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of two-ply yarn requires <b>two</b> separate <b>spools</b> of singles and either a lazy kate {{or something to}} hold the spools in place. On a wheel, two-ply is created by taking <b>two</b> <b>spools</b> of singles, placing them on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the spool attached to the wheel, and spinning the wheel {{in the opposite direction}} to that in which the singles were spun, while also feeding the yarn onto the spool on the wheel. On a drop spindle, two-ply is created by placing the spools on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the drop spindle, holding equal lengths of singles together and dropping the spindle. The weight of the drop spindle combined with the twist in the singles, causes the drop spindle to turn in the opposite direction that the singles were twisted in until the two singles are plied together.|$|R

40|$|Emissions {{of carbon}} monoxide, total oxides of nitrogen, {{unburned}} hydrocarbons, {{and carbon dioxide}} from an F 100, afterburning, <b>two</b> <b>spool</b> turbofan engine at simulated flight conditions are reported. For each flight condition emission measurements were made {{for two or three}} power levels from intermediate power (nonafterburning) through maximum afterburning. The data showed that emissions vary with flight speed, altitude, power level, and radial position across the nozzle. Carbon monoxide emissions were low for intermediate power (nonafterburning) and partial afterburning, but regions of high carbon monoxide were present downstream of the flame holder at maximum afterburning. Unburned hydrocarbon emissions were low for most of the simulated flight conditions. The local NOX concentrations and their variability with power level increased with increasing flight Mach number at constant altitude, and decreased with increasing altitude at constant Mach number. Carbon dioxide emissions were proportional to local fuel air ratio for all conditions...|$|E
