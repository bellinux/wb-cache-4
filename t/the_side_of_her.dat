5|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mark IX guns {{in single}} mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, Diana {{had a single}} 12-pounder AA gun between her funnels and two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bridge. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.|$|E
5|$|The Tomozuru Incident of 12 March 1934, {{in which}} a top-heavy torpedo boat capsized in heavy weather, caused the IJN to {{investigate}} the stability of all their ships, resulting {{in a number of}} design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength. Ryūjō, already known to be only marginally stable, was promptly docked at the Kure Naval Arsenal for modifications that strengthened her keel and added ballast and shallow torpedo bulges to improve her stability. Her funnels were moved higher up <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E

25|$|Part of {{a famous}} {{theatrical}} family, Bennett's maternal grandfather was Jamaica-born Shakespearean actor Lewis Morrison, who embarked on a stage career in the late 1860s. He was of English, Spanish, Jewish, and African ancestry. On <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> maternal grandmother, actress Rose Wood, the profession dated back to traveling minstrels in 18th century England.|$|E
25|$|Apollo was {{launched}} in March 1794 and commissioned in August under her first commander, Captain John Manley. Her career began inauspiciously, when Manley accidentally ran her aground on sandbanks {{in the mouth of}} the Wash in late 1794. On Manley's orders the ship was lightened by the disposal over <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stores and several of her guns, after which she floated free of the sand. Her rudder had broken in the process, and after some difficulty she was sailed to Great Yarmouth for repairs.|$|E
25|$|As the {{brothers}} and their companions arrive at Atli's door, Vingi admits to his treachery and is promptly slain. Atli then attacks the five guests {{with a force}} of 30. The battle rages for hours and Guðrún joins it on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brothers, throwing away her jewelry. Finally the children of Gjúki are overpowered, having slain 18 of Atli's warriors. Atli trades accusations {{with his wife and}} orders the execution of Gunnarr and Högni. Following a comical episode with Hjalli, Atli's cook, Atli has {{the brothers}} executed. Högni dies laughing while Gunnarr dies playing a harp with his toes.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1967, Seedman, then chief detective for {{southern}} Brooklyn, caught {{the case that}} made his reputation as an investigator who could solve baffling cases. While driving on the Belt Parkway one summer morning near Plum Beach, a young woman named Nancy McEwen suddenly drifted off the road onto the median strip. A police lieutenant in the car behind her pulled over {{to see what the}} problem was. He found her moaning, with her head slumped forward, and called for an ambulance. She died a short time later at Coney Island Hospital, where doctors found a small hole on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head that turned out to have been caused by a bullet.|$|E
25|$|McCreight died in 1958 at age of 93 and {{is buried}} in Morningside Cemetery, Du Bois, Pennsylvania. Alice B.

He is survived by many family members still in the DuBois area that lived in the Wigwam {{including}} his great great grandchildren Leo Brooks, Chris Brooks, Kenny Brooks, Ryan Brooks, Mallory Brooks Overholser and Emily Powers Francisco. His granddaughter Gretchen Swisher Powers and great granddaughter Martha Brooks are currently laid to rest on Juniata Street in DuBois and his grandson Craig Powers resides in the Deep South in Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|Above all, Emily {{loved to}} wander about the wild {{landscape}} of the moors around Haworth. In September 1848 her health began to decline rapidly. Consumptive, but refusing all treatment, {{with the exception of}} a visit from a London doctor – because although it was already too late, her relatives insisted. Despite popular belief, Emily did not die on the dining room sofa. There is no contemporary evidence for the story and Charlotte, in her letter to William Smith Williams, mentions Emily's dog Keeper lying at <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dying-bed. It is possible that she left an unfinished manuscript which Charlotte burned to avoid such controversy as followed the publication of Wuthering Heights. Several documents exist that allude to the possibility, although no proof corroborating this suggestion has ever been found.|$|E

25|$|Wireless decrypts by the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park {{gave the}} Allies about a month's notice of an Italian {{declaration}} of war. The Battle of France was nearing its final phase when intelligence reports suggested that Italy {{was on the}} brink of entering the war on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> Axis partner, Germany. There were few resources available to Britain which could be used to support France against the Italians, with the exception of Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command. The Supreme War Council resolved on 31 May that if war was declared, industrial targets and oil plants in the northern Italian cities of Turin and Genoa, were to be attacked as soon as possible. Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers could reach their targets from the Channel Islands, while the shorter-ranged Vickers Wellingtons would have to refuel in the south of France and the French Air Command made available the airfield outside Marseilles at Salon-de-Provence and another one nearby. The headquarters of 71 Wing was sent to the Marseilles area on 3 June to prepare reception and refuelling facilities for the British bombers, which were ready on the outbreak of war on 10 June.|$|E

500|$|Finn's {{remaining}} prayers {{also come}} true. Rachel comes to Finn's house one evening, {{and in his}} bedroom she admits that she would prefer to raise her children in the Jewish faith; {{she would not be}} able to have a future with him if he puts his faith in Jesus. Finn agrees that their children would be raised as she chooses, so to confirm her trust and appreciation of him, she allows him to touch <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breast as they make out. Later, Finn is also reinstated as quarterback, but it occurs because his replacement Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) is injured during a game, dislocating his shoulder. Finn feels responsible and confesses his guilt to Emma, who tells him it is unlikely God is communicating specifically with him through a grilled cheese sandwich. A despondent Finn doubts his new-found faith, singing R.E.M.'s [...] "Losing My Religion".|$|E
500|$|The {{last bit}} of news {{yesterday}} morning is the King's anger against Eliza Wednesday (yesterday) night for being impudent to him. He threw a chair at her head and a spitoon also, which made a great cut on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. The nearest Doctor was sent for [...] both McGrew and McKibbin arrived. It seems the King told {{her to come to}} bed — she replied what right has a dog or a bitch there, which instantly gave vent to his ill temper that he had been brooding some days, and used a word of four letters belonging only to Waterclosets. She retorted, [...] "Oh, I suppose that is what you eat to exist on." [...] This brought the King's rage to an instant climax and [...] threw the articles at her head. I had intended to call yesterday to see how he continues to improve, but this domestic fracas of the Royal household puts it out of the question, till a few days more when the King will be settled and not so upset.|$|E
500|$|After Edward's {{death on}} 6 July 1553 Northumberland {{undertook}} {{the enforcement of}} the King's will. Lady Jane Grey accepted the Crown only after remonstrances by her parents and parents-in-law. On 10 July the Duchess of Northumberland accompanied her son and daughter-in-law on their ceremonial entry into the Tower of London, where they were to reside {{for the rest of the}} short reign. According to Jane's own exculpatory letter to Queen Mary a few months later, Guildford now wanted to be made king. The young people agreed on having him declared king by Act of Parliament; but then Jane changed her mind and declared she would only make him a duke. [...] "I will not be a duke, I will be King", Guildford replied and went to fetch his mother. Furious, the Duchess took <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> son, before she told him to leave the Tower and go home. Jane, however, insisted that he remain at court. According to her the Duchess also [...] "induced her son not to sleep with me any more", and it is clear from her writings that Jane disliked her mother-in-law.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange {{was the reason for}} Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to hold your breath on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E
500|$|Evan-Thomas {{continued}} his turn until his ships were steering due north, which interposed the 5th Battle Squadron between Scheer's battlecruisers, which had reversed course around 16:48 to follow Beatty north, and Beatty's ships. While making the turn, Barham {{was struck by}} two 30.5-centimetre shells beginning at 16:58, probably from the battlecruiser [...] The first of these struck the ship's upper deck before detonating upon striking the main deck above the medical store compartment, which was completely burnt out. The detonation blew a [...] hole in the main deck, sent fragments through the middle and lower decks and burned out the casemate for starboard No. 2 six-inch gun. Three minutes later another shell hit the aft superstructure, severing the antenna cables of the main wireless station. One fragment ricocheted off the upper deck and through the side plating {{on the opposite side}} of the ship. Either the first or the fourth of these shells destroyed the ship's sickbay, killing the staff and all of its patients, including eight ship's boys. Barham returned fire at the battlecruisers at 17:02, together with Valiant, the two northernmost of Evan-Thomas's ships, and the two of them made three hits on the battlecruiser [...] and Lützow between 17:06 and 17:13 while Barham was hit twice more by Derfflinger; [...] although neither of them did any significant damage. In contrast, the hit on Lützow flooded a [...] magazine and the hits on Seydlitz blew a [...] hole in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bow. Fragments from this hit caused flooding that spread throughout the bow, while the ship's speed caused water to enter directly though the hole in the side. Other fragments from the second hit caused damage that allowed the water to spread even further. These two hits were ultimately responsible for the massive flooding that nearly sank the ship after the battle. The third shell detonated on the face of the starboard wing turret, although some fragments entered the turret and caused minor damage.|$|E
