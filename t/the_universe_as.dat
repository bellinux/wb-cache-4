5|$|The age of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> {{estimated}} {{from the}} Hubble expansion and the CMB {{is now in}} good agreement with other estimates using {{the ages of the}} oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of stellar evolution to globular clusters and through radiometric dating of individual Population II stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{invariant}} mass of {{an electron}} is approximately kilograms, or atomic mass units. On {{the basis of}} Einstein's principle of mass–energy equivalence, this mass corresponds to a rest energy of 0.511MeV. The ratio between the mass of a proton and that of an electron is about 1836. Astronomical measurements show that the proton-to-electron mass ratio has held the same value for {{at least half the}} age of <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> <b>as</b> is predicted by the Standard Model.|$|E

Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin sometime in 2014, and that casting would begin towards the end of 2013. In July 2013, Wright said that he and Cornish had completed the script for the film and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so that he could complete The World's End, as that film's producer Eric Fellner was diagnosed with cancer.|$|E
5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> a whole, the safest environments for life {{similar to that}} on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of galaxy types and their distribution suggests that {{life as we know}} it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for {{life as we know it}}, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>as</b> a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E
5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in <b>the</b> <b>Universe,</b> <b>as</b> clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster {{is in the form}} of dark matter, with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolTe and atomic number52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium {{is far more}} common in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, {{comparable to that of}} platinum, is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused it to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.|$|E

5|$|The more matter {{there is}} in the Universe, the {{stronger}} the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass density of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> observed today.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} Shiva as a beggar {{is not unique}} to the Bhikshatana icon and his legends. Shiva is often {{described}} as wandering <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> a homeless beggar-ascetic with his consort Parvati's raison d'être being to bring him back to his marital and home life. Shiva is also depicted as asking for alms from the goddess Annapurna, a form of Parvati as the goddess of food. The Satarudriya describes Shiva as gathering food through begging, evocative of his Bhikshatana form. In spite of this he is described as a sustainer of the universe and of life-sustaining food.|$|E
5|$|Using the Big Bang model it is {{possible}} to calculate the concentration of helium-4, helium-3, deuterium, and lithium-7 in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen. The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of photons to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of CMB fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for /, about 10−3 for /, about 10−4 for / and about 10−9 for /.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} {{the age of}} the Universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of the age of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>as</b> of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Back at Stonehenge, the Doctor {{discovers that}} the {{volunteer}} legionaries, including Rory, are Autons, {{and he is}} quickly captured as his other orbiting foes materialise around him. Above ground, as Rory fights to retain his human identity, Amy suddenly remembers him, but as his Auton identity emerges he unwillingly shoots her in the stomach and she dies. The Doctor struggles against his captors, who reveal that they have formed an alliance to imprison him in the Pandorica. Knowing the TARDIS exploding would cause the cracks destroying reality, they believe only the Doctor can operate the TARDIS, and thus removing him will prevent the explosion and save <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> <b>As</b> the Doctor is sealed into the Pandorica, explosions surround the Earth in space before everything fades to black and silence.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{at a time}} {{known as}} recombination, {{electrons}} and nuclei formed stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated era. Light from this era could travel freely, and it can still be seen in <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>as</b> {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB). After around 100 million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive, luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. The Universe also contains a mysterious energy called dark energy, the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era. In this era, the expansion of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy.|$|E
