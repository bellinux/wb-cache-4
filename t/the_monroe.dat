5|$|Although {{used before}} his presidency, Roosevelt used {{military}} muscle several times throughout his two terms {{with a more}} subtle touch to complement his diplomatic policies and enforcing <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Doctrine throughout multiple interventions in Latin America. This included the Great White Fleet, 16 battleships which peacefully circumnavigated the globe as an illustration of United States' rising yet neutral prestige under Roosevelt's direction.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Venezuelan {{boundary}} dispute asserted {{for the first}} time a more outward-looking American foreign policy, particularly in the Americas, marking the United States as a world power. This was the earliest example of modern interventionism under <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Doctrine in which the USA exercised its claimed prerogatives in the Americas.|$|E

5|$|A 2014 study {{examined}} the effects of combined NVC and mindfulness training on 885 male inmates of <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washington. The training was found to reduce recidivism from 37% to 21%, and the training was estimated as having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs. The training was found to increase equanimity, decrease anger, and lead to abilities to take responsibility for one's feelings, express empathy, and to make requests without imposing demands.|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{maintained}} friendly {{relations and}} {{trade with the}} Seminole Indians in the area. In the early nineteenth century, Creek Indians had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> County Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E
5|$|During the elections, Ohio {{officials}} were harassed by Michigan {{authorities and the}} area residents were threatened with arrest if they submitted to Ohio's authority. On April 8, 1835, <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> County, Michigan sheriff arrived {{at the home of}} Major Benjamin F. Stickney, an Ohio partisan. In the first contact between Michigan partisans and the Stickney family, the sheriff arrested two Ohioans under the Pains and Penalties Act on the basis that the men had voted in the Ohio elections.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Coolidge {{signed the}} bill, {{which became the}} Act of February 24, 1925, authorizing all three coins. This {{was the first time}} {{commemorative}} coin legislation covered more than one issue. A total of 300,000 for the California piece was authorized, with the coins to be drawn at face value on behalf of the Citizens' Committee by the San Francisco Clearing House Association or the Los Angeles Clearing House Association. The latter group of banks had in 1923 distributed <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Doctrine Centennial half dollar.|$|E
5|$|Taft and his Secretary of State, Philander Knox, {{instituted a}} policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America, believing U.S. {{investment}} would benefit all involved, while diminishing European influence in regions where <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Doctrine applied. The policy was unpopular among Latin American states that {{did not wish to}} become financial protectorates of the United States, {{as well as in the}} U.S. Senate, many of whose members believed the U.S. should not interfere abroad. No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's policy more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the Mexican Revolution.|$|E
5|$|It remains {{close to}} the Interstate Highway for about , {{intersecting}} NY237 {{less than a mile}} (1.6km) north of the overpass taking that highway over the Thruway, but leaves it behind for good shortly thereafter as it turns even more to the north, taking it into the town of Bergen and the small village of the same name in the county's northeast corner. Here, NY33 crosses NY19, a long north–south route. Shortly afterward, NY33A begins to the east while the main route turns to the north yet again and becomes Buffalo Road. Just east of this point, NY33A connects to I-490, which briefly runs along <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> County line through this area. From the west end of NY33A to the county line, NY33 and I-490 follow virtually identical northeasterly alignments.|$|E

5|$|Like NY33 before it, NY441 officially {{ended at}} NY21 in Marion {{when it was}} first assigned. By 1970, the east end of the route was moved to NY350 in Walworth. The change in NY441's {{alignment}} had no effect on the maintenance of the Walworth–Marion highway, however, as the Wayne County portion of NY441 was entirely county-maintained. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY441 from <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> County line to NY350 was transferred from Wayne County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the county received a part of NY21 in Williamson that connected to a state highway at only one end.|$|E
5|$|Natural gas and {{electricity}} {{are provided by}} the local utility, Avista Utilities, while CenturyLink and Comcast provide television, internet, and telephone service. Spokane hosts three hydroelectric generation facilities on the Spokane River: the Upriver Dam, the Upper Falls Dam, and <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Street Dam. The Upriver Dam is {{owned and operated by}} the City of Spokane, and generates the electricity needed to operate the municipal water supply's pressure pumps. The power generated in excess of that is sold to Avista Utilities. The Upper Falls and Monroe Street dams are owned and operated by Avista Utilities, and have respective generation capacities of 10 and 15 MW.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route31F (NY31F) is an eastwest {{state highway}} {{located in the}} {{vicinity}} of Rochester, New York, in the United States. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY96 north of <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> County village of Pittsford. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY31 in the Wayne County village of Macedon. Along the way, NY31F serves the villages of East Rochester and Fairport and connects to Interstate490 (I-490) in the town of Pittsford. From Fairport eastward, NY31F roughly parallels the Erie Canal, which the route crosses over twice: once west of Fairport and again north of Macedon.|$|E

5|$|Some of Spokane's best-known {{neighborhood}}s are Riverside, Browne's Addition, and Hillyard. The Riverside neighborhood consists primarily of downtown Spokane {{and is the}} central business district of Spokane. The neighborhoods south of downtown Spokane are collectively known as the South Hill. Downtown Spokane contains many of the city's public facilities, including City Hall, Riverfront Park (site of Expo '74), and the Spokane Convention Center and INB Performing Arts Center, {{as well as the}} Spokane Arena and Spokane County Courthouse across the river in the historic West Central neighborhood. <b>The</b> <b>Monroe</b> Street Bridge, a city icon, connects the two areas. To the east of downtown is East Central and the adjacent University District and International District. To the west of downtown is one of Spokane's oldest and densest neighborhoods, Browne's Addition.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} of the United States was also influenced by <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Doctrine, a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, and which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region. The stated aim of the doctrine was to maintain order and stability and {{to make certain that}} access to resources and markets was not limited. The historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. The US government did not need to engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US; nevertheless, the doctrine was used to justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
5|$|There was broad {{agreement}} between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force {{if necessary to}} enforce <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Doctrine in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided United States {{foreign policy in the}} Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went a step further and used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties to arbitrators.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Chicago, Brundage {{accepted}} a position as construction superintendent for John Griffith and Sons Contractors. Among the structures he worked on for Griffith were the Cook County Hospital, the Morrison Hotel, <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Building, and the National Biscuit Company warehouse. In 1915, he struck {{out on his own}} in construction, founding the Avery Brundage Company, of which his uncle Edward was a director. Brundage continued his athletic career as well. He was US all-around champion in 1914, 1916, and 1918. Once he had ceased to be a track star, he took up handball. As a young man, he was ranked in the top ten in the country and even in 1934, at the age of 46, he won one game out of two against Angelo Trulio, who had recently been the US national champion.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, Cleveland {{adopted a}} broad {{interpretation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Doctrine {{that not only}} prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere. When Britain and Venezuela disagreed over the boundary between Venezuela and the colony of British Guiana, Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney protested. British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington, Julian Pauncefote, misjudged how important successful resolution of the dispute was to the American government, having prolonged the crisis before ultimately accepting the American demand for arbitration. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter, and in 1899 awarded {{the bulk of the}} disputed territory to British Guiana. But by standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of a colonial power, Cleveland improved relations with the United States' southern neighbors, and at the same time, the cordial manner in which the negotiations were conducted also made for good relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|East of I-405, SR522 enters Woodinville {{and follows}} Little Bear Creek {{as it turns}} north away from the city's downtown, {{intersecting}} SR202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It continues in a stairstep pattern, moving north and east with sharp turns to parallel the Eastside Rail Corridor, through a predominantly rural area In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a dogbone interchange near <b>the</b> <b>Monroe</b> Correctional Complex. SR522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR522 to eastbound US2.|$|E
