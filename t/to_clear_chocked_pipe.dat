40|$|Transportation {{safety of}} {{supercritical}} CO 2 pipeline {{is a key}} aspect of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS). For reducing the high pressure in supercritical pipeline when accidental cases arise, man-made release will be applied using chocking process. The downstream parameters of chocking process can be predicted based on the adiabatic process assumption. In the critical chocking process, the critical velocity at outlet is sonic. A <b>chocking</b> <b>pipe</b> can be designed for buffering between different chocking orifices according to the length of turbulence area produced by jetting momentum. For the effect of noise hazard produced by large jetting velocity, a muffler can be applied at the outlet of final stage orifice to atmosphere. For the influence of impurities on the chocking process of anthropogenic CO 2 pipeline, the presence of SO 2 as an impurity is helpful for increasing the downstream temperatures through the chocking device to prevent the frozen hazard, whereas the presence of N 2 as an impurity indicates a lower downstream temperature. The higher initial temperature can prevent the dry ice formation at the outlet of vent pipe when the multistage chocking is applied...|$|R
