The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. <b>Those</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> {{had to make it}} appear that the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 two thirds of the remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down to the beach and were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E

Accepted as such by most islanders, when broadcast from Germany it was viewed differently in Britain, coming as it did in the midst of the Battle of Britain.

25|$|That same evening, {{his fellow}} friends, about 25 {{students}} from the medical and dental faculties of the College of Medicine decided to give Yoong a proper burial within {{the grounds of the}} hospital. One of the five trenches dug out earlier for air raid purposes was converted into a grave for Yoong. As the grave was being prepared, they were spotted by Japanese gunners which began pouring a heavy barrage of shells at the defenceless students. Some quick-footed students managed to flee to safety towards the College building. However, <b>those</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> only had time to leap into the trenches and Yoong's grave. As a result, 11 of the students were killed, three were wounded and only two managed to escape injury in the aftermath. Those who were killed instantaneously were given a burial on the morning of 16 February, a day after the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese, in the trenches where they fell.|$|E
25|$|According {{to their}} plan, Gyulai would assault Bar-sur-Aube {{at the same}} time that the Crown Prince {{attacked}} Colombey-les-Deux-Églises and Platov turned Mortier's left flank. To trap Letort's force, Ludwig von Stockmayer with three light infantry battalions, four cavalry squadrons and one horse artillery battery set out from Juzennecourt at 9:00 am and marched west to Montheries. At that village, they planned to turn north through the Dhuits Forest and come into the main highway west of Colombey-les-Deux-Églises while other forces would attack Letort frontally. At 10:00 am, Karl August Maxmilian von Jett with two battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment, four squadrons of Jäger cavalry, one squadron of hussars and one horse battery began to advance along the Chaumont-Bar highway. Jett was supported by one battalion of the 6th Infantry, the 3rd Dragoons and one foot artillery battery. Inexplicably, eight battalions, one cavalry regiment and one foot battery were left at Chaumont without orders. Including <b>those</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind,</b> the IV Corps numbered 12,000–13,000 men. The Crown Prince directed the support column in person. At 11:00 am Gyulai's columns began to come into action against the Mortier's southern defenses.|$|E

In order {{to lighten the}} helicopter, Sawyer jumps out after whispering something in Kate's ear and kissing her. The helicopter {{makes it to the}} Kahana in the nick of time; they refuel it, fix the leak, pick up Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Sun and Aaron and leave seconds before the C4 detonates. The resulting explosion kills Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), who is told that [...] "he can go now" [...] by a vision of Christian Shephard. The status of Jin, who is still on the boat, is left uncertain as a cliffhanger. Sawyer swims back to the island and laments the destruction of the boat with Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell). The people on the helicopter decide to return to the island, but as they approach, they see the island vanish in the white-yellow light. With nowhere to land, the helicopter runs out of fuel and the survivors are forced to ditch into the ocean. They drift in a rescue raft for several hours, where Hurley suggests that Locke succeeded in moving the island, but Jack refuses to believe it. At night, the survivors are rescued by Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), Desmond's girlfriend, with whom he is finally reunited. Jack then convinces the other survivors that they must lie about their experiences on the island, to protect <b>those</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind.</b> In keeping with the faked wreckage of Flight 815 found in the Java Trench, the Oceanic Six are dropped off near the island of Sumba, where they are found by local villagers.|$|E

Race director Karel Van Wijnendaele insisted on including the coast to the course because of his sentimental vision of Flanders. The stretches of road along the sea were often accompanied by strong winds that inhibited attacks but scattered the peloton and spelled the end for <b>those</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> {{the shelter of the}} main pack.

2500|$|In {{response}} to the recent Criterion Collection release, Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk review, had the following to say about it: [...] "I wouldn't call Kon Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain – Criterion Collection an anti-war film so much as I'd call it a realist's war film. Rather than build his story around big explosions and the thrill of battle, Ichikawa instead brings the human drama front and center, directing his spotlight on a soldier who is left to his own devices when the guns stop blazing. He poses the question, 'When stranded on the bombed-out landscape after the fighting has calmed, what will <b>those</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> do to survive?' It's bleak and it's chilling, and yet Fires on the Plain is also completely engrossing. It's the post-action picture as morality play, the journey of the individual recast with Dante-esque overtones. Ichikawa doesn't have to hit you {{over the head with}} a message because the story is so truthfully crafted, to state the message outright would be redundant. Once you've seen Fires on the Plain, the movie will get under your skin, and you'll find it impossible to forget." ...|$|E
