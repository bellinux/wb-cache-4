40|$|Background: Parents' {{physical}} activity associates with <b>their</b> children's <b>physical</b> activity. Prospective designs assessing this association are rare. This study examined how parents' {{physical activity}} {{was associated with}} <b>their</b> children's <b>physical</b> activity from childhood to middle adulthood in a 30 -year pro'spective, population-based setting. Methods: Participants (n = 3596) were from the ongoing Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study started in 1980. Participants' physical activity was self-reported at 8 phases from 1980 to 2011, and <b>their</b> parents' <b>physical</b> activity at 1980. Analyses were adjusted {{for a set of}} health-related covariates assessed from 1980 to 2007. Results: High levels of mothers' and fathers' physical activity were systematically associated with increased levels of <b>their</b> children's <b>physical</b> activity until offspring's age of 24. Longitudinal analyses conducted from 1980 to 2011 showed that higher levels of parents' physical activity were associated with increased levels of <b>physical</b> activity within <b>their</b> offspring until midlife, but the association between parents' and <b>their</b> children's <b>physical</b> activity weakened when participants aged (...|$|R

5|$|A further twelve bodies, pending {{refinements}} {{of knowledge}} regarding <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> properties, were possible candidates {{to join the}} list under this definition. Some objects in this second list were more likely eventually to be adopted as 'planets' than others. Despite what had been claimed in the media, the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the definition, and that a complete survey would probably reveal more than 200.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen on the basis of <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|Double Dare 2000 {{introduced}} the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed {{a team to}} make <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.|$|E

5|$|Niobium, {{formerly}} columbium, is {{a chemical}} element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41.

Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, who {{was the daughter of}} Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> and chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.|$|E

5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
5|$|Alphonse {{is one of}} {{the protagonists}} from the series {{alongside}} his older brother Edward. Alphonse loses his entire body while he and Edward are trying to revive his mother Trisha using alchemy. Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. Edward later becomes an alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse to search for a method to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which would allow them to restore <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter; having been trained by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot feel anything because he has no body, he is nearly invincible as long as the blood mark made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> isolation, {{the islanders}} {{maintained}} a lively community. A school {{had been established}} in 1723 by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SPCK), with sixty children on its initial attendance roll. The demands of island life conflicted to some extent with those of schooling. The SPCK's inspector found only eighteen out of seventy pupils present when he visited in 1824. He found {{that many of the}} children were fully occupied helping their families in summer and only attended school in winter. Two places of worship were built within a couple of years of each other, a Baptist chapel in 1877 and a Church of Scotland church in 1878 (at a cost of £900). Although they soon became focal elements of community life, there seems to have been some bad blood between the two congregations, perhaps due to a clash between the missionary zeal of local Baptists and the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) {{is in the}} holosuite {{playing a}} secret agent program in the 1960s. Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) intrudes and convinces Bashir to let him tag along.

Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell), Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), and Chief Petty Officer Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) are on a runabout, {{returning}} to Deep Space Nine. As they arrive they find that their vessel has been sabotaged and that a warp core breach is imminent. Lt. Cmdr. Michael Eddington beams them out, but the ship is destroyed during transport and Eddington is forced to store their patterns while he repairs the transporter, but doing so uses {{almost all of the}} station's memory, putting many station systems off-line. <b>Their</b> <b>physical</b> patterns end up in the computer controlling the holosuite, where they appear as characters in Bashir's program.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed.|$|E
