5|$|During {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} campaign, Nansouty's {{division}} was at first attached <b>to</b> <b>Marshal</b> Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps, with which it crossed the Rhine and then the Danube, before rejoining Murat's cavalry reserve. Nansouty had a first opportunity to lead his men into combat at the Battle of Wertingen, where his men were noted for their excellent manoeuvring. Detaching his two Carabiniers-à-Cheval regiments, which {{he had to leave}} with Murat, Nansouty and his reduced division followed the Emperor at Augsburg, where he was attached <b>to</b> <b>Marshal</b> Jean Lannes's V Corps. In this capacity, they supported Walther's division at the Battle of Schöngrabern. Then, at the Battle of Wischau on 25 November 1805, the 9th Cuirassiers participated in a major cavalry action, alongside d'Hautpoul's cuirassier division, Walther's dragoons and Bessières's Grenadiers à Cheval and Chasseurs à Cheval of the Guard cavalry.|$|E

5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used <b>to</b> <b>marshal</b> trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E

5|$|Also {{the victory}} led to {{promotions}} for Govorov, who {{was promoted to}} colonel-general on January 15, and Zhukov, who was promoted <b>to</b> <b>marshal</b> of the Soviet Union on January 18. In addition Govorov and Meretskov were awarded the Order of Suvorov 1st Class on January 28. The 136th and 327th Rifle Divisions were awarded the designation of 63rd and 64th Guards Rifle Divisions, while the 61st Tank Brigade was designated the 30th Guards Tank Brigade.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the War of the Third Coalition, a cavalry reserve corps was organised in the Grande Armée, with command given <b>to</b> <b>Marshal</b> Joachim Murat. This cavalry reserve included Nansouty's heavy cavalry division, another heavy cavalry division under Jean-Joseph d'Hautpoul, three dragoon divisions, a foot dragoon division and a light cavalry brigade. Nansouty's six-regiment division soon acquired the reputation of being the best administered and most exact in its manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the Marne-Rheims offensive, the German {{manpower}} advantage {{had been}} spent and their supplies and troops were exhausted. The Allied general, General Ferdinand Foch, ordered a counteroffensive which led to the Second Battle of the Marne, after which victory he was promoted <b>to</b> <b>Marshal</b> of France. The Germans, recognising their untenable position, withdrew from the Marne to the north. Foch now tried to move the Allies back onto the offensive.|$|E

5|$|Having subdued German defences on the beach, {{the next}} {{task of the}} landed forces was to clear Juno of obstacles, debris and undetonated mines then {{establish}} the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division's headquarters in Bernières. Movement Control Units came ashore just before noon, with military policemen beginning <b>to</b> <b>marshal</b> vehicles through to Bernières and Courseulles. Sappers of 619 Independent Field Company also moved in to begin clearing the minefields surrounding the beach, so as to free up the advance south towards Carpiquet. Keller himself established divisional headquarters in Bernières shortly after noon.|$|E
5|$|In 1392, King Richard II of England {{created the}} first in a {{succession}} of Ireland kings of arms. It is unknown why such an office was called into being. Froissart notes the creation of Chandos le Roy d'Ireland, but does not give any clues as to the reasoning. It does, however, fit into the general English policy in Ireland at the time. Richard II sought to re-establish English control in those areas where the native Irish had reasserted their independence. The appointment {{can be seen as a}} necessary part of the preparations for the appointment of the Duke of Gloucester as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1392. Richard intended Gloucester to lead a major military campaign, and such a campaign would have necessitated the involvement of heralds <b>to</b> <b>marshal</b> arms and provide advice and evidence in case of heraldic disputes.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon had {{previously}} sent dispatches <b>to</b> <b>Marshal</b> Soult, {{commander of the}} Army of the South, urging him to send assistance to Masséna in Portugal. However, the Emperor's orders, which called for only a small force, were based on outdated intelligence and the situation had changed considerably by the time Soult received them. Thirty thousand Allied troops and six major fortresses now stood between the French army and the Portuguese capital, making an attack against Lisbon virtually impossible. Nevertheless, compelled to act, Soult instead gathered an army of 20,000 men, mainly from VCorps, and launched an expedition into Extremadura {{with the aim of}} capturing the Spanish fortress at Badajoz, thereby drawing some of the Allied forces away from Masséna and the Lines of Torres Vedras.|$|E

5|$|Of noble Burgundian descent, he was {{a student}} at the Brienne {{military}} school, then was a graduate of the Paris military school. Nansouty began his military career in 1785, as a sub-lieutenant in the regiment Bourgogne-Infanterie, where his father had served during the wars of Louis XV. A cavalry officer at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792, Nansouty was commissioned as an aide-de-camp <b>to</b> <b>Marshal</b> Nicolas Luckner. During the First Coalition, he saw service as a lieutenant-colonel and squadron commander in the 9th (heavy) Cavalry Regiment, campaigning with the French armies on the Rhine and in Germany. Promoted to Colonel in 1793 and given the command of the 9th Cavalry, he was noted for several well-led cavalry actions. Finally made a Brigadier General in 1799, after he had refused the promotion several times in the past, Nansouty fought the next year under General Jean Victor Moreau in southern Germany, in a decisive campaign of the Second Coalition.|$|E
5|$|With a {{large part}} of the French Empire's forces now {{entangled}} in the bloody Peninsular War, the Austrian Empire believed that its best opportunity to avenge the humiliating defeat of 1805 had finally come. The Austrians were looking to defeat France and regain their former influence in Italy and Germany. In early 1809, the Austrian war preparations were so intense that Napoleon was forced to leave Spain and head back to Paris to reorganise his main army in Germany. In spring, Nansouty was therefore recalled to the command of 1st of the three heavy cavalry divisions of the Cavalry Reserve, placed this time under the command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières. As the War of the Fifth Coalition broke out, Nansouty's division was soon detached from the Reserve and temporarily attached <b>to</b> <b>Marshal</b> Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps, the force that was assigned the most difficult tasks during the early military operations of this war. As Napoleon then ordered a concentration of the army at Ratisbon, Nansouty's division was once again put under the command of Bessières and sent to serve with the Bavarian army. After his initial victories at Abensberg and Landshut, Napoleon concentrated the bulk of his army, including Nansouty's men, at Eckmühl, where Davout was waiting.|$|E

50|$|The 1944 {{insignia}} featured four Nakhimov stars, {{but when}} the rank was declared equivalent <b>to</b> the <b>marshal</b> of the Soviet Union in 1945, they were replaced with a single, bigger star to look similar <b>to</b> <b>marshals</b> shoulder boards. The two existing admirals of the fleet were given this new big marshals star. So from 1945 to 1962, there was no intermediate rank equivalent to general of the army in between admiral and admiral of the fleet.|$|R

25|$|Just {{like the}} Vichy police agents, the {{national}} police forces collaborated with the German authorities, the French Youth Workings alumni had to claim allegiance <b>to</b> <b>Marshal</b> Pétain with a serment.

25|$|When Beria finally {{realized}} {{what was happening and}} plaintively appealed to Malenkov to speak for him, his old friend and crony silently hung his head and refused to meet his gaze.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the Second World War, the Admiral of the Fleet rank (which, from 1945 {{was already}} {{equivalent}} <b>to</b> <b>Marshal)</b> was later renamed Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union in 1955.

25|$|Therefore, another {{ceremony}} was organized in a surviving manor in {{the outskirts of}} Berlin late on 8 May, when it was already 9 May in Moscow due to the difference in time zones.
