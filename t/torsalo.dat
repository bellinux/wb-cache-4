It is also known as the <b>torsalo</b> or American warble fly, even though the warble fly is in the genus Hypoderma and not Dermatobia, and is a parasite on cattle and deer instead of humans. An infestation of cattle is shown in the article Parasitic flies of domestic animals.|$|E

Farmers in Latin America often wash their livestock with a paste made of crushed G. sepium leaves to ward off <b>torsalos</b> (botflies). In the Philippines, the extract obtained from its leaves is used to remove external parasites.|$|R
