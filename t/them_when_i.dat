I didn't know what the beat was for; I just knew Eminem asked me for the files and I sent it to <b>them....</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' I was like, 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E

So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|... "In the Dark" [...] {{was written}} by Dev {{alongside}} The Cataracs, a group that consists of Niles Hollowell-Dhar and David Singer-Vine, who also produced the track. Dev described the song as [...] "very flavorful" [...] and [...] "hot". In an interview with music blog Idolator, she talked in-depth about the conception of the song, stating, [...] "The idea behind 'In The Dark' was {{for me to make}} a sexy song. I'm a grown woman now. I've been working with The Cataracs {{for the past three years}} and I met <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was kind of young and from a small town. I was like, dammit, I'm gonna make a sexy song! So that's what I did." [...] She explained that she wanted the song to be [...] "tasteful, yet sexual" [...] and described it as [...] "very sexy, but very musical at the same time". She said, [...] "The songs I had before, even though they were explicit to an extent, they were just fun. It was time when we just wanted to make that sort of record, and we did. It's probably one of the sexier songs on the record, but I think it needed that!" [...] "In the Dark" [...] was recorded during a session in January 2011; it was one of the first songs to be recorded for Dev's debut album and it was eventually also recorded by Demi Lovato. It was later mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|In the meantime, California Pictures had {{put another}} film into production, Vendetta. [...] At Hughes' behest, Sturges {{had written the}} script {{as a vehicle for}} Hughes' protégé, Faith Domergue. [...] Max Ophüls was hired to direct, but after only a few days of filming, Hughes demanded that Sturges fire Ophüls and take over the {{direction}} himself. Seven weeks later, Sturges himself was fired or quit (accounts differ). [...] The promising partnership between the two iconoclasts was dissolved after just one completed picture. [...] As Sturges later recalled, [...] "When Mr. Hughes made suggestions with which I disagreed, as he had a perfect right to do, I rejected <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> rejected the last one, he remembered he had an option {{to take control of the}} company and he took over.

2500|$|When Guan Yu {{embarked}} on the Fancheng campaign, he left Mi Fang and Shi Ren behind {{to defend his}} key bases in Jing Province – Nan Commandery (南郡) and Gong'an (公安). Guan Yu had all along treated them with contempt. During the campaign, Mi Fang and Shi Ren sent insufficient supplies to Guan Yu's army at the frontline, and Guan remarked, [...] "I'll deal with <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> return." [...] Mi Fang and Shi Ren felt uneasy about this. When Sun Quan invaded Jing Province, Lü Meng showed understanding towards Mi Fang and successfully induced him into surrendering while Yu Fan also persuaded Shi Ren to give up resistance. Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province fell under Sun Quan's control after the surrenders of Mi Fang and Shi Ren.|$|E

Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy.

2500|$|Gabbard, a {{vice-chair}} of the Democratic National Committee, {{was critical}} of the decision by DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to hold only six debates during the 2016 Democratic Party primary season, compared with 26 in 2008 and 15 in 2004. Some {{have argued that the}} number of debates was intentionally limited in order to bolster Secretary Hillary Clinton's position as the Democratic front-runner, citing Wasserman Schultz's previous position as co-chair of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign as a conflict of interest and a newly created penalty barring further participation in sanctioned debates for any candidate who participates in an unsanctioned debate as an effort to limit public exposure to other candidates. Gabbard appeared on multiple news outlets to express her dissatisfaction with the number of debates. Following her public criticisms, she claimed she was uninvited from attending the Democratic debate in Las Vegas as a result. In a telephone interview with The New York Times, Gabbard stated, [...] "It's very dangerous when we have people in positions of leadership who use their power to try to quiet those who disagree with <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> signed up to be vice-chair of the DNC, no one told me I would be relinquishing my freedom of speech and checking it at the door." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> played the beat that you sent me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E
