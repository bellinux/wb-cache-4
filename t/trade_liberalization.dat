5|$|The {{disastrous}} {{effects of}} the Smoot–Hawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the 32nd U.S. president and the Democratic Party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of <b>trade</b> <b>liberalization.</b> As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average tariff rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential tariff rates. The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral trade agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates.|$|E
5|$|The Uruguay Round of GATT {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were <b>trade</b> <b>liberalization</b> in agricultural goods and textiles, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of this round was the Marrakech Agreement signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement. In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{builds a}} dynamic general {{equilibrium}} trade model, in which heterogeneous intermediate goods are produced and traded in a Melitz (2003) type sector. These intermediate goods {{are used in}} the production of a final good, which can be used for consumption, capital accumulation, or investment in market entry. Therefore capital accumulation is the direct alternative to investing in firm entry. This has a number of implications. First, in the short run following <b>trade</b> <b>liberalizations</b> a higher interest rate will prevail, which will tend to shelter incumbent firms from increased competition by discouraging investment in entry of new firms. Second, different forms of <b>trade</b> <b>liberalizations</b> with the same impact on the share of expenditure on domestic variety will have different effects on consumption, and thus welfare, both during transitions and in steady-state, due to different effects on aggregate investment. Third, the accumulation of capital will add a time dimension to the anti-variety effects of <b>trade</b> <b>liberalizations.</b> In effect, capital accumulation generates rich adjustment dynamics both in the aggregate and at the firm level. Further, the study of transitions in this framework provides important insights regarding the effects of different forms of <b>trade</b> <b>liberalizations</b> in general and on welfare and individual firms in particular. ...|$|R
40|$|In partial equilibrium, a {{reduction}} in import barriers may be thought to {{lead to an increase}} in imports and {{a reduction}} in trade surplus. However, the general equilibrium effect can go in the opposite direction. For example, China’s accession to the WTO in 2001 could lead to a surge in its current account surplus (and the conclusion of the trade reform phase by 2007 could lead to a subsequent reduction in its surplus). We study how trade reforms affect current accounts by embedding a modi…ed Heckscher-Ohlin structure and an endogenous discount factor into an intertemporal model of current account.

We show how (i) productivity heterogeneity across firms, (ii) endogenous selection of firms into production and export markets, and (iii) endogenous firm entry — the determinants of endogenous comparative advantage — affect {{the response of}} factor allocation and the skill premium to <b>trade</b> <b>liberalizations.</b> The impact of these three margins on the skill premium, however, is fully reflected in sectoral trade patterns, which determine the factor content of trade...|$|R
25|$|Dobson and Ramlogan’s {{research}} {{looked to}} identify the relationship between inequality and <b>trade</b> <b>liberalization.</b> There have been mixed findings with this idea – some developing countries have experienced greater inequality, less inequality, or no difference at all, due to <b>trade</b> <b>liberalization.</b> Because of this, Dobson and Ramlogan suggest that perhaps trade openness {{can be related to}} inequality through a Kuznets curve framework.|$|E

25|$|A trade liberalization-versus-inequality graph has a {{measures}} trade openness {{along the}} x-axis and inequality along the y-axis. Dobson and Ramlogan determine trade openness by {{the ratio of}} exports and imports (the total trade) and the average tariff rate; inequality is determined by gross primary school enrolment rates, the share of agriculture in total output, the rate of inflation, and cumulative privatization. By studying data from several Latin American countries that have implemented <b>trade</b> <b>liberalization</b> policies in the past 30 years, the Kuznets curve seems {{to apply to the}} relationship between <b>trade</b> <b>liberalization</b> and inequality (measured by the GINI coefficient). However, many of these nations saw a shift from low-skill labour production to natural resource intensive activities. This shift would not benefit low-skill workers as much. So although their evidence seems to support the Kuznets theory in relation to <b>trade</b> <b>liberalization,</b> Dobson and Ramlogan assert that policies for redistribution must be simultaneously implemented in order to mitigate the initial increase in inequality felt.|$|E

50|$|These issues fully {{illustrate}} the profound impact that <b>trade</b> <b>liberalizations,</b> among other issues, can create {{in a rural}} atmosphere. These consequences are often inherently negative and particularly impact those located in developing nations. Haiti has remained the poorest nation in the Caribbean despite, and mostly likely because, it is the least trade restrictive country in the Caribbean. There are many that claim a status of defense towards the <b>trade</b> <b>liberalizations</b> policies, claiming {{that they are more}} helpful than hurtful. While there are many factors to consider before broadly stating whether these policies improved or decreased the status of the economy in Haiti, it cannot be denied that the leading beneficiaries of this type of trade are the relatively wealthy both abroad and within Haiti; though the wealthier Haitians tend to reside in the urban areas of the country. It also cannot be denied that these liberalizations are directly linked to the harmful practices the rural population in Haiti has faced. Many in these rural areas find it next to impossible to earn a decent wage working in the rice industry.|$|R
40|$|No other {{international}} trade negotiations {{have been so}} comprehensive as the Uruguay Round, in which participants agreed to liberalize trade in agricultural products, to reduce tariffs on industrial products {{by an average of}} more than one-third, and to establish a World Trade Organization. This article examines the effects of the Uruguay Round agreements to liberalize trade in goods, focusing primarily on the United States. The analysis suggests that the agreements will have only a negligible impact upon employment in nearly every U. S. manufacturing sector, in every state, and in the country as a whole. The agreed <b>trade</b> <b>liberalizations</b> (as represented by the sectoral employment changes likely to result) seem to bear little relationship to the nation's revealed comparative advantages (weighted by employment). By and large, both the United States and its trading partners apparently resisted granting sizable <b>trade</b> <b>liberalizations</b> in sectors where the other possessed a marked comparative advantage. If so, both parties will be impeded from further specializing in the sectors of their greatest comparative advantage, and world income will grow by less than if both had been more forthcoming.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{bilateral}} trade patterns of countries involved in significant <b>trade</b> <b>liberalizations</b> using detailed {{data on the}} value of trade flows by commodity. We find a striking relationship between a good's pre-liberalization share in trade and its growth subsequent to liberalization. The goods that were traded the least before the liberalization account for a disproportionate share in trade following the reduction of trade barriers. The set of goods that accounted for only 10 percent of <b>trade</b> before the <b>liberalization</b> may account for as much as 40 percent of <b>trade</b> following the <b>liberalization.</b> This new finding cannot be accounted for by the standard models of trade, which rely on increases in previously traded goods to produce trade growth.

Getúlio Dorneles Vargas (president, 1930–45, 1951–54) was overthrown, democratic rule was reestablished, and the foreign-exchange reserves accumulated during the war made possible a reduction of trade restrictions. However, <b>trade</b> <b>liberalization</b> was short-lived. The overvalued foreign-exchange rate, established in 1945, remained fixed until 1953. This, combined with persistent inflation and a repressed demand, meant sharp increases in imports and a sluggish performance of exports, which soon led again to a balance of payments crisis.|$|E

25|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the {{collapse}} of the social liberal coalition was a challenge in the 1970s from financial interests that could operate independently of national governments. Another cause was the decline of organized labor which had formed part of the coalition, but was also a support for left-wing ideologies challenging the liberal consensus. Related to this was the decline of working class consciousness and the growth of the middle class. The push by the United States, which had been least accepting of social liberalism, for <b>trade</b> <b>liberalization</b> further eroded support.|$|E
25|$|Revenues from a {{value-added}} tax are frequently lower than expected {{because they are}} difficult and costly to administer and collect.
