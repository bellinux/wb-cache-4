Introduction Contribution T 1 E 1. 4 / 99 - 494 R 1 [1] has defined the simulation parameters to be used while determining the ADSL target data rates on the four reference loops {{in the presence of the}} reference noise. <b>Those</b> <b>data</b> rates <b>shall</b> be used later on to test the spectral compatibility of candidate transmission systems against ADSL as per the draft standard on spectral compatibility. Questions 5 and 6 of the action items listed in the breakout report, T 1 E 1. 4 / 99 - 494 R 1 [1], requested as many as possible to simulate ADSL performance in order to define <b>those</b> target <b>data</b> rates and to explore the proper mix of disturbers. 2.
