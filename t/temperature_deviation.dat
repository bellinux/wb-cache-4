50|$|Burn-up {{compensation}} is achieved automatically by the LEMs, achieving 80% of the nominal {{power at the}} end-of-life of the fuel cartridge. The LEM is a thermometer-like device actuated by the volume expansion of the Li6. This “liquid control rod” can keep the reactor power almost constant throughout the design life.Partial load operation is possible by adjusting the primary coolant flow rate. Reactor power will be in proportional with the primary coolant flow rate due to LEMs reactivity feedback. The LRM is composed of an envelope divided by a frozen seal into two chambers. The lower chamber, within the active core, has a 95% enriched Li6 reservoir, while the upper chamber is a vacuum prior to reactor startup.Reactor startup can be done automatically if the primary coolant temperature reaches its standby temperature. Coolant heating {{can be achieved by}} heat release from the primary pump circulation. Then the frozen seal of the LRM will melt at the hot standby temperature (approximately 780 °C), and Li6 is released slowly from lower level (active core level) to the upper level to achieve a positive reactivity increase.It will take 7(11) hours to complete startup. The LIMs assure sufficient negative reactivity feedback in unprotected transients. The LRMs enable an automated reactor startup by detecting the hot standby temperature of the primary coolant. All these systems use Li6 and are actuated by highly reliable physical properties (volume expansion of Li6 for LEM, and frozen seal melting for LIM and LRM). A configuration with Quick LEMs requires 3+(1) LEMs of smaller size than a configuration with Slow LEMs requiring 24 LEMs.The RAPID-L is equipped with 28 LEMs, 16 LIMs and 16 LRMs in the design concept. Two of the 16 LRM are reserves or dummies. It is a very redundant system. Failure of some of these devices would result in only a slight <b>temperature</b> <b>deviation</b> of the coolant. In case that most of the LEMs fail, the burn-up compensation by the LEMs could be impossible, and the reactor would shut down.|$|E

40|$|An actual {{process of}} a {{two-phase}} parallel-flow of a binary mixture with heat exchange to its surroundings {{is followed by}} an internal entropy production due to several kinds of irreversibilities which occur inside the flow. Such irreversibilities in actual processes provoke mass fraction <b>deviations</b> from equilibrium, <b>temperature</b> <b>deviations</b> between the two phases and pressure drop. In the present work the flow {{is assumed to be}} inviscid (no pressure drop) and the mass fraction and <b>temperature</b> <b>deviations</b> from equilibrium are related to mass and heat exchange delay between the two phases. Based on this criterium of `delay', a thermodynamic method is developed, according to which the determination of an actual state of the process is governed by two parameters: (i) the `degree of vapour delay' or the `degree of liquid delay' and (ii) the `degree of liquid-vapour heat exchange delay'. These two parameters both confine the actual process between two extreme processes: the process of no delay (reversible-successive equilibrium states) and the process of total delay (irreversible of maximum delay).

The study is based on the finite element analysis of the product <b>temperature</b> <b>deviations</b> as a result from deviations of the surface {{heat transfer coefficient}}, combined with existing dimensionless correlations for the surface heat transfer coefficient.
