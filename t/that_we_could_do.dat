5|$|Basil was no {{more than}} the name of {{bachelor}} uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few of us knew how to eat spaghetti or pick a globe artichoke to pieces.... Then came Elizabeth David like sunshine, writing with brief elegance about good food, that is, about food well contrived, well cooked. She made us understand <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> better with what we had.|$|E
25|$|It {{was really}} like a cry of survival. There won't be another album like it, put it like that. It was a cry from the depths, the only thing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|You {{do not put}} {{someone in}} {{detention}} for {{this period of time}} then not pursue the matter against him in the courts without some sort of... acknowledgement that a mistake was made, That's the least <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} about that boat," [...] he remarked. [...] "Though I don't know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> it, <b>we</b> ought to have tried to pull her out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{well she}} had {{estimated}} the sum necessary! Four {{hundred and fifty}} each, she thought. And I have no doubt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> it on that, with care.' ...|$|R
500|$|Since {{several members}} of the team enjoyed racing games and had also worked on Diddy Kong Racing, they decided to include the futuristic Ant racing {{featured}} in the campaign and the top-down arcade racing games in the multiplayer. Developers initially considered the possibility to use the 4MB Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, but the idea was eventually dropped. According to Mountain, [...] "we wanted to deliver the same experience to all players and were confident <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this using the standard 4MB of RAM on the console." [...] This led to some confusion as the box cover for the original release stated that it did support such a feature. Nintendo provided a quick-fix to the mislabeled covers by providing stickers declaring its Rumble Pak compatibility and fixed later printings of the boxes.|$|E
500|$|The band's lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump {{stated that}} the band had not planned to cover the song. [...] "Basically, I just started playing the riff in sound-check one day, and then we all started playing it, and then we started playing it live, and then we figured we'd record {{it and put it}} out with our live DVD." [...] Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not {{originally}} intended for the song to be released as a single either. [...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> our own take on", he said. Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song, Wentz eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo. [...] "We were trying to think about who is a contemporary guitar guy who's going to go down as a legend", Wentz later noted.|$|E
500|$|Excited at the prospect, Åkerfeldt agreed without {{consulting}} his bandmates or record label. While his bandmates {{liked the idea}} of recording two separate albums, Åkerfeldt had to convince the label: [...] "I had to lie somewhat... saying <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this recording very soon, it won't cost more than a regular single album." [...] With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering Nacksving Studios in 2002, and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously, Åkerfeldt said the recording process was [...] "the toughest test of our history." [...] After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album, Deliverance, with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios. [...] "Deliverance was so poorly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever," [...] Åkerfeldt claimed, that Sneap [...] "is credited as a 'saviour' in the sleeve, as he surely saved much of the recording." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say," [...] {{interrupted}} Dr. Spencer, [...] "it {{strikes me}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> better than get up our S. P. G. demonstration {{on the day}} of the stone--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You say truly, brother," [...] {{cried the}} prince, his eyes {{kindling}} at the thought. [...] "Methinks <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> anything more pleasing to Our Lady than {{to drive the}} heathen Moors out of the country." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "For the {{building}} of his statue, we had to pay. We were forced {{to pay tribute to}} Shinto Shrine (Japanese custom). There were some who resisted and said <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do,</b> because <b>we</b> were Christians. Some of them died in a prison." ...|$|R
500|$|Connie Talbot {{entered the}} public eye appearing, aged six, on the first series of the reality {{programme}} Britain's Got Talent, reaching the final. After briefly recording with Sony BMG, Talbot was signed to Rainbow Recording Company, {{an offshoot of the}} label Rhythm Riders made specifically for her. To produce Over the Rainbow, Talbot worked with John Arnison, then-manager to Gabrielle and Billy Ocean, and Marc Marot, a former managing director of Island Records. It was produced and mixed by Simon Hill and Rob May. A recording schedule was worked out so that Talbot could continue with her normal school activities while recording the album in her aunt Vicky's spare bedroom, which her mother described as [...] "a better solution" [...] than the one offered by Sony BMG, [...] "which has not robbed her of her childhood". Talbot said that [...] "it was just amazing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it in my auntie's house". Arnison and Marot asked the Talbot family to [...] "write down a list of the songs that Connie would sing at her birthday party" [...] to help choose the track listing, and then [...] "thought long and hard" [...] about including more adult songs on the album. Talbot herself insisted that they should.|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, Larter and {{her then}} {{longtime}} boyfriend, Hayes MacArthur, were engaged to marry. They had {{met on the}} set of National Lampoon's Homo Erectus. In a 2007 interview with Cosmo, Larter said [...] "I told my boyfriend after three weeks that I wanted to marry him and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it tomorrow." [...] On August 1, 2009, Larter married MacArthur in an intimate outdoor ceremony which took place at MacArthur's parent's estate in Kennebunkport, Maine. During the ceremony, guests arrived via trolleys to the sounds of Irish music playing in honor of MacArthur's heritage; among the invited was Larter's close friend Amy Smart. The couple later purchased a three-story home in the Hollywood Hills for $2.9 million. On July 20, 2010, Larter announced that she and MacArthur were expecting their first child and later, on the September 10 episode of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, announced that she was expecting a boy. Larter admitted that she and MacArthur left the country for Europe in an effort to hide the news of the pregnancy. Larter gave birth to the couple's son, Theodore Hayes MacArthur, on December 20, 2010. In August 2014, Larter confirmed that she and MacArthur were expecting their second child that winter. She gave birth to her second child, a girl named Vivienne Margaret on January 15, 2015.|$|E
2500|$|More recent {{artistic and}} {{cinematic}} portrayals {{have also made}} an effort to characterize Jesus as an ancient Middle Eastern resident. In the 2004 movie, The Passion of the Christ, Jesus was portrayed by Jim Caviezel who wore a prosthetic nose during filming and had his blue eyes digitally changed to brown to give him a more Middle Eastern appearance. According to designer Miles Teves, who created the prosthesis: [...] "Mel (Gibson) wanted to make the actor playing Jesus, James Caviezel, look more ethnically Middle Eastern, and it was decided <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it best by changing the shape of his nose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, my Tina,' {{answered}} Maynard slowly, {{waiting a}} little between each sentence; 'we {{mean to do}} wicked things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> never <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> just as <b>we</b> mean to do good or clever things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> never <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> Our thoughts are often worse than we are, {{just as they are}} often better than we are. And God sees us as we are altogether, not in separate feelings or actions, as our fellow-men see us. We are always doing each other injustice, and thinking better or worse of each other than we deserve, because we only hear and see separate words and actions. We don't see each other's whole nature. But God sees that you could not have committed that crime.' ...|$|R
3000|$|... “We then {{discussed}} the rest {{and then said}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> definitely <b>do</b> something there. … We soon reached the decision that there simply {{has to be a}} new platform. … And this major project was created from this working group…. They were all really hooked on this subject.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know. I {{felt that}} I should be quite old before I had finished. But the last part, you see, {{is all about}} wills, and bequests, and homeopathy, and things of <b>that</b> kind. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it later. It is the early part that I want to learn now--but it IS so hard.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The small budget {{dictated}} much of {{the production}} process. According to Hardman, [...] "We knew {{that we could not}} raise enough money to shoot a film {{on a par with the}} classic horror films with which we had all grown up. The best <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to place our cast in a remote spot and then bring the horror to be visited on them in that spot". Scenes were filmed near Evans City, Pennsylvania, [...] north of Pittsburgh in rural Butler County; the opening sequence was shot at the Evans City Cemetery on Franklin Road, south of the borough. The interior upstairs scenes were filmed in a downtown Evans City home that later became the offices of a prominent local physician and family doctor (Allsop). This home is still standing on South Washington St. (locally called Mars-Evans City Road), between the intersecting streets of South Jackson and Van Buren. The cemetery chapel was under warrant for demolition; however, Gary R. Steiner led a successful effort to raise $50,000 to restore the building, and the chapel is currently undergoing renovations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to set the}} game four thousand years before [...] {{was one of the}} first details about the game made known. LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game. [...] "LucasArts came to us and said <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> an [...] game," [...] BioWare CEO Raymond Muzyka said. [...] "Or LucasArts said we could go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before." [...] BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom. They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor. Concept work had to be sent to [...] "the ranch" [...] to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: [...] "It was more like, 'Can you just make his head like this rather than like that.' So it was all very feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so we were happy to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with." [...] Zeschuk said that [...] "Overall, we were really happy with the results. We felt like we had enough freedom to truly create something wonderful." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{perceived}} we {{must get}} our chains loose, and <b>that</b> before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this these Selenites had to be beaten off. I faced towards the group of the three goad-bearers. Instantly one threw his goad at me. It swished over my head, and I suppose went flying into the abyss behind.|$|R
60|$|Now I {{thought of}} trying to make the land, but found <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> so with the oars, because of the current that set out towards the ocean against which it was {{impossible}} to urge our clumsy craft. Therefore we must content ourselves with trying to keep her head straight with the steering oar, but even then we were often whirled round and round.|$|R
5000|$|Kat {{recalled}} that initially [...] "we couldn't play, {{so we just}} did it. I was told I {{was the one who}} would be playing guitar - I didn't know if it was serious and I didn't want to spend any money, so I borrowed a guitar, and after six months I realised <b>that</b> maybe <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this." [...] The group played their first show as a support for fellow punk band, Mach Pelican.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] said Andrew. [...] "I'll have to tax your {{patience}} {{with some more}} figures. They show <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> the work cheaper without wronging anybody we employ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dennis,' {{said the}} {{governor}} of the jail, 'you know what the course is, and that the order came with the rest. You know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing, even if we would.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{will our}} having an office-boy {{increase}} our circulation?" [...] demanded Peter Hope. [...] "Besides, {{it was agreed}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> without one for the first year. Why suggest more expense?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so proud," [...] she was saying, [...] "that at last, {{after you}} have done so much for me, I can do a little thing for you. For it is {{something}} to free you, Tommy. You have always pretended, for my sake, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> without each other, but we both knew {{all the time that}} it was only I who was unable to do without you. You can't deny it." ...|$|R
6000|$|One day the {{man said}} to his wife, 'I wonder, now, whether our parish clerk could teach Peter to talk; in <b>that</b> case <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> better than adopt him as our son, and let him inherit all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> possess.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Sahib, if {{only our}} food were so {{condensed}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> carry a supply for twelve days about us, {{what would we}} {{not be able to}} <b>do?</b> <b>We</b> <b>could</b> rout the fiercest tribe on the frontier, without difficulty. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> march about fifteen or twenty miles a day, and more than <b>that,</b> if necessary. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> wonders, indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, mother, it is that," [...] said Joe, {{laughing}} a little, in his {{relief that}} the plunge was made. [...] "I don't see <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> better for your happiness or mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Gordon, perhaps. But our Nelsons and Napiers and Havelocks-- {{to think}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{no better than}} that for them! Now, dear, {{we have seen the}} man--let us look at the house!' ...|$|E
60|$|The Bart was {{of opinion}} {{that this was}} the best <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> but, when we came to talk it over, the Abbot made us see that there were {{difficulties}} in the way.|$|E
60|$|The act {{suggested}} the idea <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> better, so we placed two portmanteaus end to end, and thus made a couch {{about six feet}} long. A box, somewhat higher, placed at one end, served for a pillow, and on {{this one of the}} ladies lay down, flat on her back of course, that being the only possible position under the circumstances. A shawl was thrown over her, and she went to sleep like an effigy on a tombstone.|$|R
6000|$|I {{took a deep}} breath, {{with almost}} sightless {{eyes fixed on the}} beautiful, mysterious glades {{stretching}} beneath us. [...] "He came again. Why, it was not very many days ago. And we talked and talked, and I grew tired, yes, and angry at last. I told him you were only making use of me. You were. I said <b>that</b> all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was just to go on loving you--and keep away. I know, Fanny, I cannot be of any account; I don't understand very much. But that is true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A noble example!" [...] {{the queen}} said warmly. [...] "I would <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> afford to <b>do</b> the same {{through all the}} royal domains.
