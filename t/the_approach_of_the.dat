5|$|Aaron Ward and Sterett, {{independently}} {{searching for}} targets, both sighted Yūdachi, who appeared unaware of <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two U.S. destroyers. Both U.S.ships hit Yūdachi simultaneously with gunfire and torpedoes, heavily damaging the destroyer and forcing her crew to abandon ship. The ship did not sink right away, however. Continuing on her way, Sterett was suddenly ambushed by Teruzuki, heavily damaged, {{and forced to}} withdraw from the battle area to the east. Aaron Ward wound up in a one-on-one duel with Kirishima, which the destroyer lost with heavy damage. She also tried to retire from the battle area to the east but soon stopped dead in the water because the engines were damaged.|$|E
5|$|By July 1918, it {{was clear}} that the German Spring Offensive on the Western Front, which had forced the {{postponement}} of offensive plans in Palestine, had failed, resulting in a return to trench warfare on the Western Front.

One of them {{was given to the}} camp Commandant as promised and another puppy was smuggled into the women's camp along with any food that the men could spare. A further puppy was given to the Red Cross in Medan, one more was beaten to death by a drunken guard, and the final one remained in the camp after Judy and Williams left.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they {{went back and forth}} from the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|In 1947 Constantine became {{chairman}} of the League of Coloured Peoples, a position he held until the League was discontinued in 1951.

Also in 1950, he became involved in a controversy over the interracial marriage of Seretse Khama, the future president of Botswana. Constantine lobbied the government on Khama's behalf, organised meetings and even approached the United Nations. Little was achieved, and Constantine disapproved of <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Labour government and its Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, but declined an opportunity to become a Liberal parliamentary candidate.|$|E
5|$|In October, the Japanese again {{tried to}} {{recapture}} Henderson Field by delivering 15,000 more men—mainly from the Army's 2nd Infantry Division—to Guadalcanal. In addition to delivering {{the troops and}} their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese also successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on 14 October that heavily damaged the airfield's runways, destroyed half of the CAF's aircraft, and burned most of the available aviation fuel. In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two runways to service and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its pre-bombardment level {{over the next few}} weeks.|$|E

40|$|Against <b>the</b> {{background}} <b>of</b> {{a broadly}} shared perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US and the EU as very {{different kinds of}} international actors, and a related assumption that <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US Supreme Court and <b>the</b> European Court <b>of</b> Justice towards <b>the</b> internalization <b>of</b> international law are also very different, this article takes a systematic look at <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Court <b>of</b> Justice and <b>the</b> US Supreme Court to <b>the</b> internalization <b>of</b> international law over the decade 2002 - 2012. <b>The</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US in recent decades has been as a frequently unilateralist and exceptionalist actor in international relations, with the Supreme Court remaining resistant to law which emanates from outside the American legislative process, or which lacks a clear domestic imprimatur as applicable US law. The EU, by comparison, is seen as having a greater commitment to multilateralism and to the development and observance of international law, and <b>the</b> case-law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> Justice has until recently been broadly viewed – with WTO jurisprudence seen as an exception – as actively contributing to shaping that image through its embrace and internalization of international law norms. The analysis over a ten-year period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two courts dealing with international law suggests that, rather than a simplified picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court as the skeptical judicial arm of an internationally exceptionalist United States and the CJEU as the embracing judicial arm of an open and internationalist European Union, {{there are many more}} commonalities between <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two courts than conventional depictions acknowledge...|$|R

Indian intelligence became aware—after the expedition had already been Kabul for some time—that they carried with them highly inflammatory letters from the Kaiser and the Turkish Sultan.

5|$|The Allied {{story for}} FUSAG {{was that the}} army group, based in {{south-east}} England, would invade the Pas-de-Calais region several weeks after a smaller diversionary landing in Normandy. In reality, the main invasion force would land in Normandy on D-Day. As D-Day approached, the LCS moved on to planning tactical deceptions to help cover {{the progress of the}} real invasion forces. As well as naval operations, the LCS also planned operations involving paratroopers and ground deceptions.

5|$|The {{opposing}} armies met at {{the village}} of Albuera. Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing struggle and the French finally withdrew on 18 May.

5|$|While Allied naval {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German strike force and were successful in sinking {{two of the four}} submarines dispatched, efforts to locate and sink U-862 once she reached Australian waters were continually hampered by a lack of suitable ships and aircraft and a lack of personnel trained and experienced in anti-submarine warfare. As the southern coast of Australia was thousands of kilometres behind the active combat front in South-East Asia and had not been raided for several years, it should not be considered surprising that few anti-submarine assets were available in this area in late 1944 and early 1945.|$|E
