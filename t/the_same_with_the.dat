5|$|After {{the player}} completes {{the game with}} either the bad ending or the best ending, Julius Mode is unlocked, similar to the Julius Mode in Aria of Sorrow. Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the {{assumption}} that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord. A new game can then be started {{from the main menu}} in Julius Mode. In Julius Mode, the playable characters include Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades, and Alucard. Each character has a weapon and an assortment of abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up. The castle layout and enemies are <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of the final battle, which is against Soma.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to emphasise good {{relations}} with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. However, throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals would remain unemployed, with unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.|$|E
5|$|For {{a second}} series running, the revamped theme tune {{introduced}} back in January 2014 during Series 28 remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of episode two {{that saw the}} use of the first ever theme tune and title card, with the original 1986 theme tune playing over a montage of Series 1 and Series thirty characters. Albeit with the closing credits remaining the same. The titles are modified as characters arrive or depart throughout the course of the series.|$|E

5|$|In post-production, Embassy's self-imposed role {{in making}} Crimewave was even greater. Although Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell {{insisted that they}} had made the film as partners, the studio refused — because of the already {{ballooning}} costs — to pay for Campbell to stay in Los Angeles during post-production (although the executives later compromised). The studio replaced Raimi's music composer, Joseph LoDuca, with {{one of its own}} choosing. It did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> editor, removing Raimi's influence over the film's final cut.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May, Paulus, {{on orders}} from Bock, began a general {{offensive}} {{from the area}} of Merefa {{in the north of}} the bulge in an attempt to encircle the remaining Soviet forces in the Izium salient. Only then did Stalin authorize Zhukov to stop the offensive and fend off German flanking forces. However, it was already too late. Quickly, the Germans achieved considerable success against Soviet defensive positions. The 20 May saw more of <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> German forces closing in from the rear. More German divisions were committed to the battle that day, shattering several Soviet counterparts, allowing the Germans to press forward. The Luftwaffe also intensified operations over the Donets River to prevent Soviet forces escaping. Ju 87s from StG 77 destroyed five of the main bridges and damaged four more while Ju 88 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3) inflicted heavy losses on retreating motorised and armoured columns.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, {{the playoff}} format changed once again, {{expanding}} the Finals to a best-of-3 series.

25|$|After the 2003 success, Canavan relinquished his captaincy, and Mickey Harte {{appointed}} 24-year-old Cormac McAnallen {{to be the}} captain, {{because of}} his attitude, and leadership skills.

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that he did this. Combining the calculations of Book 2 and the account of Theon of Smyrna yields a lunar distance of 60.5 earth radii.

25|$|This is {{the final}} variant developed. The AI-20DM is {{essentially}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> AI-20D series 5, the only difference being in the power setting.

The Time before overhaul (TBO) is consequently increased to 8000 hrs with a Service life of 22,000 hrs.|$|E
