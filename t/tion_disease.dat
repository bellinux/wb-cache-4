40|$|Obesity is {{a chronic}} disease in which adipose tissue accumulates {{in such a}} way that it affects the health of the patient and is {{associated}} with a myriad of alterations such as systemic hypertension (HTN). The mechanisms by which obesity causes HTN are complex and involve several organic mechanisms. The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between obesity to HTN in dogs in accordance with recent international protocols (systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg) relating to age, genre, gonadal status, breed and other diseases commonly associated with HTN. A total of 244 dogs were studied, 105 non-obese controls and 139 in the obese group. For both groups, healthy and a variety of diseased dogs were observed; the correlations between pathologies and obesity were studied, paying special atten- <b>tion</b> to <b>diseases</b> whose pathophysiologies could lead to HTN. We conclude that obesity is not a risk factor for dogs to develop HTN, and that HTN present in these patients was related to comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, cardiopathies and endocrinopathies.

Fish were vaccinated by injection of an inoculum containing attenuated virus, individually marked, stocked in communal earthen ponds, and cultured to market size. Data on resistance to the disease and growth rates were col- lected. The two Hungarian strains and their crossbreeds had no advantage in specific resistance to KHV but contributed to heterosis when crossed with Dor- 70. This was expressed by an increase of more than 10 % and 20 % in growth rate, compared to the commercial Israeli cross- breed (Nasic x Dor- 70) ...|$|R

40|$|The lung, in {{addition}} to its main role as the organ of external gas exchange, serves as a metabolic regu lator of substances circulating in the blood (1, 2). The lung has been shown to change many circulating vasoactive substances either by activation, inactiva tion, or removal and storage for subsequent metab olism or release (3 â€” 6). This function has been es tablished mainly through in vitro studies of isolated perfused lung tissue (7). While there has been considerable speculation in the literature as to the importance of this newly discovered pulmonary func <b>tion</b> in <b>disease</b> states, to date no diseases {{have been found to be}} directly related to the failure of this function (4). A major barrier to the study of lung function in disease states has been the lack of non invasive techniques to assess lung function in vivo both in normal subjects and in patients with various abnormal conditions. For many years the techniques of nuclear medi cine have been used for the noninvasive study of pulmonary blood flow and the patterns and dynamics of gaseous diffusion. However, no studies of the metabolic aspects of lung function have been re ported. Therefore, we sought to develop a radio pharmaceutical that, {{in addition}} to indicating blood perfusion patterns. would be taken up and metab olized by lung tissue. Such an agent could be used to determine the lung's ability to regulate circulating substances and could provide information on re gional metabolic activity. Compounds having an amine function are seques tered by lung â€˜tissue(6). The site of uptake of bio genic amines by lung has been shown to be the capillary endothelium (8 â€” 1). In vivo, amines are oxidized by monoamine oxidase to aldehydes that can undergo subsequent metabolism (12). Unlike most biogenic amines, which are metabolized to water-soluble products, aliphatic amines are ulti mately metabolized to CO 2 through the following pathway: Râ€•CH 2 NH 2 @ Râ€•CHO-) â€...|$|R

Although some hypotheses favour {{a disruption of}} fron- tal/executive functions operating at retrieval, the respective involvement of encoding and retrieval processes in confabulation is still controversial. The present study sought to investigate experimentally the involvement of encoding and retrieval processes and the interference of over-learned information in the confabulation of Alzheimer’s disease patients. Twenty Alzheimer’s disease patients and 20 normal controls encoded and retrieved unknown stories, well-known fairy tales (e. g. Snow White) and modified well-known fairy tales (e. g. Little Red Riding Hood is not eaten by the wolf) under three experimental conditions: (i) full attention at encoding and at retrieval; (ii) divided attention at encoding (i. e. performing an attention demanding secondary task) and full attention at retrieval; (iii) full attention at encoding and divided attention at retrieval. We found that confabula- <b>tions</b> in Alzheimer’s <b>disease</b> patients were more frequent for the modified well-known fairy tales and when encoding was weakened by a concurrent secondary task (61 %), compared with the other types of stories and experimental conditions. Confabulations in the modified fairy tales always consisted of elements of the original version of the fairy tale (e. g. Little Red Riding Hood is eaten by the wolf). This is the first experimental evidence showing that poor encoding and over-learned information are involved in confabulation in Alzheimer’s disease...|$|R

IgA type antibody to H. pylori possessed a secretory component. In addition, IgA type antibody was preferentially detected in the gastric juice of patients infected with H. pylori rather than non-infected patients. These observations suggest that H. pylori coexists with a specific IgA antibody in gastric juice, although the IgA anti body has a functional form, that is, being a secretory IgA. 2) The titer of IgA type CP 3 antibody in gastric juice was correlated with the histological grade of gastritis, suggesting that a local immune response to H. pylori in gastric mucosa might be associat ed with the formation of gastritis. 3) The IgA type H. pylori antibody in gastric juice reacted specifically with H. pylori itself and the antibody was capable of agglutinating H. pylori in vitro, however, in the presence of a rather high concentration of the antibody. Further investigations are required to elucidate whether the IgA type antibody in gastric juice inhibits H. pylori from attaching to and invading the gastric mucosa and from forming colonies in the gastric mucosa...|$|R
40|$|Critical {{transitions}} {{exist in}} many dynamical systems, {{ranging from the}} Earth’s cli- mate system to microcosm populations. During a critical transition, the state of a dynamical system abruptly changes from one stable state to another, typically without obvious prior warning. Preventing such abrupt changes remains a chal- lenge, however recently, several metrics were suggested as early warning signals. These indicators {{are thought to have}} predictive value for upcoming critical transi- <b>tions.</b> In Parkinson’s <b>disease,</b> there are no detectable motor symptoms in a patient until neuronal dopaminergic cell death exceeds 60 – 70 %. Being able to define early warning signals in a disease context could open new avenues for both preventive and disease modifying treatments. We hypothesize that the dynamics of progression of some disorders including Parkinson’s disease could be manifested by critical tran- sitions. However, before rushing into medical applications, a thorough framework needs to be developed that aims to describe such nonlinear dynamics in cellular systems. In this thesis, we set out to study critical transitions in a simple cellular model using mitochondrial membrane potential ∆Ψ m as readout. To identify criti- cal transitions, we established a modular high-content screening platform allowing systematic perturbation of oxidative phosphorylation. To increase the probability for detecting a critical transition in ∆Ψ m, five inhibitory compounds were combined in multiple pairwise concentration landscapes. We show that critical transitions, de- tectable via ∆Ψ m, are an intrinsic property of the cellular system studied and that two-component Gaussian mixture models adequately capture the dynamics of the critical transition occurring for the combination of Oligomycin A and Antimycin A. Adding to that, we identified the coefficient of variation as a strong early warning signal for the upcoming of the critical transitions. This thesis should serve as a foundation for a broader application of critical transitions and early warning sig- nals in both cell culture systems and translational studies aiming to understand the nonlinear dynamics of biological systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} soft tissue injury repair at the {{cellular}} level can be decomposed into three phases: acute inflammation including coagulation, proliferation and remodelling. While the later phases are well understood the early phase is less so. We produce {{a series of}} new math- ematical models for the early phases coagulation and inflammation. The models produced are relevant not only to soft tissue injury repair {{but also to the}} many disease states in which coagulation and inflammation play a role. The coagulation cascade and the subsequent formation of the enzyme thrombin are central to the creation of blood clots. By focusing on a subset of reactions that occur within the coagu- lation cascade, we develop a model that exhibits a rich asymptotic structure. Using singular- perturbation theory we produce a sequence of simpler time-dependent models which enable us to elucidate the physical mechanisms that underlie the cascade and the formation of thrombin. There is considerable interest in identifying new therapeutic targets within the coagulation cas- cade, as current drugs for treating pathological coagulation (thrombosis) target multiple factors and cause the unwelcome side effect of excessive bleeding. Factor XI is thought to be a poten- tial therapeutic target, as it is implicated in pathological coagulation but not in haemostasis (the stopping of bleeding), but its mechanism of activation is controversial. By extending our previ- ous model of the coagulation cascade to include the whole cascade (albeit in a simplistic way) we use numerical methods to simulate experimental data of the coagulation cascade under nor- mal as well as specific-factor-deficient conditions. We then provide simulations supporting the hypothesis that thrombin activates factor XI. The interest in inflammation is now increasing due to it being implicated in such diverse condi- <b>tions</b> as Alzmeimer's <b>disease,</b> cancer and heart disease. Inflammation can either resolve or set- tle into a self-perpetuating condition which in the context of soft tissue repair is termed chronic inflammation. Inflammation has traditionally been thought gradually to subside but new bi- ological interest centres on the anti-inflammatory processes (relating to macrophages) that are thought to promote resolution and the pro-inflammatory role that neutrophils can provide by causing damage to healthy tissue. We develop a new ordinary differential equation model of the inflammatory process that accounts for populations of neutrophils and macrophages. We use numerical techniques and bifurcation theory to characterise and elucidate the physiological mechanisms that are dominant during the inflammatory phase and the roles they play in the healing process.
