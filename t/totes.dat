25|$|For x-ray, {{gamma ray}} and {{electron}} irradiation, shielding is required when the foods are being irradiated. This {{is done to}} protect workers and the environment outside of the chamber from radiation exposure. Typically permanent or movable shields are used. In some gamma irradiators the radioactive source is under water at all times, and the hermetically sealed product is lowered into the water. The water acts as the shield in this application. Because of the lower penetration depth of electron irradiation, treatment to entire industrial pallets or <b>totes</b> is not possible.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] or tate, meaning [...] "to carry", can {{be traced}} back to the 17th century but was not used to {{describe}} bags until 1900. However, the <b>tote</b> bag craze in the United States began in the 1940s with the release of L.L. Bean's Boat Bag in 1944. Because they were easier than carrying luggage, most people opted for using <b>tote</b> bags. During the 1950s, <b>tote</b> bags began to enter into the main culture. Women primarily utilized them as practical handheld bags because they didn't require much care. It wasn't until the 1960s when the <b>tote</b> bag embraced personal style. Bonnie Cashin released her own line of <b>tote</b> bags called Cashin Carry <b>Tote</b> Bags which combined style and functionality. In the 1990s, Kate Spade ultimately transformed how American culture embraced <b>tote</b> bags when she began carrying them as fashion bags. Today, fashion lovers and consumers can find <b>tote</b> bags in a variety of decorations and themes.|$|R

25|$|The cost of food {{irradiation}} {{is influenced by}} dose requirements, the food's tolerance of radiation, handling conditions, i.e., packaging and stacking requirements, construction costs, financing arrangements, and other variables particular to the situation. Irradiation is a capital-intensive technology requiring a substantial initial investment, ranging from $1million to $5million. In the case of large research or contract irradiation facilities, major capital costs include a radiation source, hardware (irradiator, <b>totes</b> and conveyors, control systems, and other auxiliary equipment), land (1 to 1.5acres), radiation shield, and warehouse. Operating costs include salaries (for fixed and variable labor), utilities, maintenance, taxes/insurance, cobalt-60 replenishment, general utilities, and miscellaneous operating costs. Perishable food items, like fruits, vegetables and meats would still require to be handled in the cold chain, so all other supply chain costs remain the same.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as <b>totes),</b> or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and wollastonite.|$|E
25|$|Gamma {{irradiation}} involves {{packets of}} light (photons) that originate from radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. Gamma rays {{are used for}} products that are too thick for treatment with electron beams. Every radioactive element gives rise to Gamma rays with specific energies characteristic of the source element, these rays have zero mass and no electrical charge. The ones used for food irradiation are able to penetrate through food products. The radioactive isotope radioisotope cobalt-60 is used as the source in all commercial scale gamma irradiation facilities. Gamma irradiation is most widely used technology because the deeper penetration of the gamma rays enables administering treatment to entire industrial pallets or <b>totes</b> (reducing the need for material handling) and it is significantly less expensive than using an X-ray source. Cobalt-60 is bred from cobalt-59 using neutron irradiation in specifically designed nuclear reactors. In limited applications caesium-137, a less costly alternative recovered during the processing of spent nuclear fuel, {{is used as a}} radioactive source. Insufficient quantities are available for large scale commercial use. An incident where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool requiring NRC intervention has led to near elimination of this radioisotope.|$|E

500|$|Friedrich's landscapes {{exercised}} {{a strong}} influence {{on the work of}} German artist Max Ernst (1891–1976), and as a result other Surrealists came to view Friedrich as a precursor to their movement. In 1934, the Belgian painter René Magritte (1898–1967) paid tribute in his work The Human Condition, which directly echoes motifs from Friedrich's art in its questioning of perception {{and the role of the}} viewer. A few years later, the Surrealist journal Minotaure featured Friedrich in a 1939 article by critic Marie Landsberger, thereby exposing his work to a far wider circle of artists. The influence of The Wreck of Hope (or The Sea of Ice) is evident in the 1940–41 painting <b>Totes</b> Meer by Paul Nash (1889–1946), a fervent admirer of Ernst. Friedrich's work has been cited as an inspiration by other major 20th-century artists, including Mark Rothko (1903–70), Gerhard Richter (b. 1932), Gotthard Graubner and Anselm Kiefer (b. 1945). Friedrich's Romantic paintings have also been singled out by writer Samuel Beckett (1906–89), who, standing before Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon, said [...] "This was the source of Waiting for Godot, you know." ...|$|E

It follows the <b>tote’s</b> history including its production, purchase, and transfer. This thesis briefly recounts the Stockbridge-Munsee Indians’ history and focuses on a few examples of craft objects produced prior to the 1960 s, when the Stockbridge-Munsee <b>tote</b> was made. Wisconsin Indian Craft, a craft cooperative formed in the 1960 s, produced objects such as the Stockbridge-Munsee <b>tote.</b> This <b>tote,</b> along with seventeen other Wisconsin Indian Craft souvenirs, was purchased by the Department of the Interior Indian Arts and Crafts Board in 1964 and transferred to the National Museum of the American Indian’s collection in 2000.
