50|$|The most {{sophisticated}} form of cooperative foraging exhibited by caterpillars is recruitment communication in which caterpillars recruit siblings to their trails {{and to their}} food-finds by marking pathways with pheromones much {{in the manner of}} ants and termites. The {{most sophisticated}} examples of recruitment communication have been described from the <b>tent</b> <b>caterpillars</b> (Malacosoma). Eastern <b>tent</b> <b>caterpillars</b> (M. americanum), for example, utilize a trail-based system of elective recruitment communication that enables the colonies to exploit the most profitable feeding sites.|$|R

25|$|Forest <b>tent</b> <b>caterpillar</b> {{outbreaks}} tend to recur at reasonably {{regular intervals}} every decade or so, with the precise interval varying somewhat {{in time and}} space. Outbreaks usually last two to four years. Although the insect's distributional range is quite large, the area over which decadal outbreak cycles are synchronized (i.e. oscillating with the same phase) varies substantially. Outbreak cycles are more strongly synchronized in eastern Canada than in western Canada. Where spatially separated populations are phase-synchronized, the synchronization {{is thought to be}} due to the process of entrainment, that is, the synchronization of a circadian clock with the external environment.|$|E
500|$|Wēkiu bugs feed on dead insect {{carcasses}} that drift up Mauna Kea on {{the wind}} and settle on snow banks. This is a highly unusual food source for a species in the genus Nysius, which consists of predominantly seed-eating insects. They can survive at extreme elevations of up to [...] because of natural antifreeze in their blood. They also stay under heated surfaces most of the time. Their conservation status is unclear, but the species {{is no longer a}} candidate for the Endangered Species List; studies on the welfare of the species began in 1980. The closely related Nysius aa lives on Mauna Loa. Wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and forest <b>tent</b> <b>caterpillar</b> moths have also been observed in the same Mauna Kea ecosystem; the former survive by hiding under heat-absorbing rocks, and the latter through cold-resistant chemicals in their bodies.|$|E

500|$|Breeding grey jays build nests and {{lay eggs}} in March or even February, when snow is {{deep in the}} boreal forest. Male grey jays choose a nest site in a mature conifer tree; the nests are found most {{commonly}} in black spruce, with white spruce and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) also used, in Ontario and Quebec. With the male taking a lead role in construction, nests are constructed with brittle dead twigs pulled off of trees, as well as bark strips and lichens. The cup is just large enough to contain the female and her eggs, measuring about [...] wide and [...] deep. Insulation is provided by cocoons of the forest <b>tent</b> <b>caterpillar</b> (Malacosoma disstria) filling the interstitial spaces of the nest, and feathers used to line the cup. Nests are usually built on the southwestern side of a tree for solar warming and are usually less than one nest diameter from the trunk. Nest height is typically [...] above the ground. The average height of 264 nests surveyed in Algonquin Provincial Park was [...] above ground.|$|E

2500|$|Females begin ovipositing the {{day after}} {{copulation}} and do so in one batch during a single oviposition event. Shorter and longer oviposition durations are associated with smaller and larger egg masses, which {{are directly related to}} female size. Just before beginning to oviposit, females exhibit dispersal behavior. They position themselves on a branch, spread their wings, and extend their abdominal tip around the branch to prepare for oviposition. As they oviposit, they move around the branch aligning the eggs, forming a ring-like structure around the branch. [...] They then cover their eggs with a foamy substance known as spumaline. It has been hypothesized that the spumaline cover protects eggs from predation and parasitism. [...] Offspring pass the winter inside their eggs. Although cold tolerant, they are susceptible to freezing in extreme cold temperatures, with the risk of mortality varying seasonally with changes in temperature and physiology. Not much is known about parental effects on offspring survival during the winter. The only source of energy for overwintering forest <b>tent</b> <b>caterpillar</b> eggs comes from the parental generation. As a result, overwintering performance of the insect should be viewed in the context of parental fitness.|$|E

25|$|The larvae of {{this species}} are notorious <b>tent</b> <b>caterpillars.</b> <b>Tent</b> <b>caterpillars</b> do not make tents, but rather, weave a silky sheet where they lie {{together}} during molting. They lay down strands of silk as they move over branches and then travel along them like tightrope walkers. They follow pheromones secreted by other larvae rather than following the silk lines themselves. The caterpillars are social, traveling together to feed. The caterpillars live in deciduous trees, which they strip off leaves after emerging from their eggs. The adult moth {{of this species}} favors oak, sweetgum, tupelo, aspen, and sugar maple for oviposition, but the larvae can be found feeding on many other species of woody trees or shrubs. The females lay eggs in masses of up to 300, which are stuck to twigs {{and covered with a}} gluey cement called spumaline, which prevents them from desiccating and freezing. The eggs hatch the following winter.|$|R

INTRODUCTION: Group living confers fitness benefits but also incurs costs (Despland & Huu 2007). Many lepidopterans spend their larval stages as colonies, which may speed up their development (Shiga 1976; Rothman 1997). Gregarious caterpillars often maintain group cohesion, as well as recruit others to food sources, via silk trails marked with pheromone...|$|R
