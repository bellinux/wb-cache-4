To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} of the Australian shows, Minister for Fair Trading for New South Wales Virginia Judge, said she was aware that Spears would lipsync during the concerts and was {{considering}} to include disclaimers on promotional materials and tickets, indicating that portions of the show would be pre-recorded. This measures would mean a change in the country's legislation similar to the debacle of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Judge further explained her position saying, [...] "Let's be clear– live means live. If you are spending up to $200 I think you deserve better than a film clip". Tour director Steve Dixon defended Spears, claiming, [...] "This is a pop spectacular, this is a showband show. You come for the experience. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> see about this show, there's nothing like this in the world. Britney Spears will entertain you, that's what people come for. We absolutely give them a show". After opening night in Perth, The Advertiser writer Rebekah Devlin reported that a number of fans had walked out of the show. They were apparently [...] "disappointed" [...] and [...] "outraged" [...] regarding Spears's lip syncing and subdued dancing.

500|$|A femme fatale, Kim {{was among}} several fictional {{characters}} and pop culture icons to debut towards the [...] "end of the 'Girl Power' era" [...] and third-wave feminism. Thus, some critics perceive the character {{as a combination}} of Buffy Summers from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sydney Bristow from Alias, and The Powerpuff Girls. As an animated series, Kim Possible was revolutionary for its diverse cast of strong female characters, namely Kim and Shego. Many of the character's typically [...] "girly" [...] belongings double as powerful weapons, namely her lip gloss and compact mirror. In his book Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture, author Jeffrey A. Brown believes that [...] "Kim may be the epitome of a Girl Power-derived heroine", while reinforcing [...] "that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> be learned from female elders." [...] Like Kim herself, her grandmother Nana Possible also fought crime when she was young, from whom Kim {{is believed to have}} inherited her abilities. Kim's entire family is very intelligent, and constantly reiterate the phrase [...] "anything is possible for a Possible". Therefore, the character is spared [...] "the burden of being the only brain on the show." [...] The character's relationship with her parents is atypically healthy for a teenager. Kim's father James [...] "views women as equals", and thus has a good relationship with Kim although he struggles {{to come to terms with}} the reality that she is growing up and dating. Her mother Ann is essentially a [...] "grown up" [...] version of Kim. At one point, Ann insists that Kim invite her on one of her missions as her Mother's Day present, and Kim also admits to being impressed by her mother's work as a brain surgeon. The Artifice observed that Kim and Shego are strikingly similar in appearance. Metacritc believes that Shego is essentially [...] "Kim's dark reflection"; both characters are smart, athletic and attractive with green eyes, but Shego chooses to use her powers for evil instead. Despite their bitter rivalry, Kim and Shego have mutual respect for each other to the point of which they occasionally work together when the situation demands it. According to Metacritic, Kim's [...] "fiery" [...] red hair symbolizes [...] "her attitude that is best summed up by the phrase, 'I can do anything.'" [...] The character is infamous for her puppy dog pout, which she often uses to get her way.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} for BBC.co.uk, Lisa Haines praised {{the sound of}} Pushing the Senses, stating [...] "The brand of raucous rock anthem which catapulted them to fame is {{virtually}} absent here, the band's new sound is far more thoughtful and understated. 'Feeling A Moment' and 'Tumble And Fall' are prime examples. Both have Coldplay inspired soaring vocals and catchy melodies, but a little of their lyrical hand wringing seems to have crept in too", and later said [...] "That's {{not to say the}} album is bad, because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> like here. 'Pilgrim Soul' and title track 'Pushing The Senses' see Feeder thrash furiously away at their instruments, which should appease those who prefer their earlier work".|$|E

The Slopes are {{just across the street}} from the hotel, and when it doesn't happen to be raining we can go and sit there on a bench and see lively times enough. People are being trundled about in their bath-chairs in every direction; there is always a crowd at St. Ann's well, where the pump is; all sorts of cabs and carts are being driven up and down just as fast as they can go, for the streets are as smooth as floors, and in the morning and evening there are about half a dozen coaches with four horses, and drivers and horn-blowers in red coats, the horses prancing and whips {{cracking}} as they start out for country trips or come back again. And as for the people on foot, they just swarm like bees, and rain makes no difference, except that then they wear mackintoshes, and when it's fine they don't. Some of these people step along as brisk as if they hadn't anything the matter with them, but a good many of them help out their legs with canes and crutches. I begin to think I can tell how long a man has been at Buxton by the number of sticks he uses.|$|E
