5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E
5|$|Love in Several Masques was Fielding's first play. It was advertised on 15 January 1728 in the London Evening Post {{and first}} ran on 16 February 1728 at the Theatre Royal. Performances were held on 17, 19 and 20 February, {{with the third}} night being the author's benefit. The play was never revived. The cast {{included}} four members {{among some of the}} most talented of the Theatre Royal actors. Although it only ran for four nights, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> feat because John Gay's popular The Beggar's Opera was performed during the same time and dominated the theatrical community during its run. It was first printed on 23 February 1728 by John Watts, and a Dublin edition appeared in 1728. The play was later collected by John Watts in the 1742 and 1745 Dramatick Works and by Andrew Millar in the 1755 edition of Fielding's works. It was later translated and printed in German as Lieb unter verschiedenen Larven in 1759.|$|E

5|$|The main {{production}} company behind Audition was the Japanese company Omega Project. Omega were originally behind {{the production of}} Hideo Nakata's film Ring; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success in Japan and, subsequently, the rest of Asia. Omega had problems setting up the release of Ring in Korea and had the company AFDF Korea work on a Korean re-adaptation of the Ring. The following year, in 1998, Omega partnered again with AFDF Korea and other production companies including Creators Company Connection, Film Face, and Bodysonic to make the adaptation of Ryū Murakami's 1997 novel Audition. Omega {{wanted to create a}} film different than supernatural-themed Ring, and chose to adapt Murakami's novel, which lacked this trait. To attempt something different, they hired a screenwriter (Daisuke Tengan) and a director (Takashi Miike) who were not known for working on horror films. Prior to Audition, Tengan was best known as a screenwriter for working with his father (Shohei Imamura) on The Eel, which won the Palme d'Or in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Yet arguably his {{greatest}} diplomatic achievement was negotiating with Phraates IV of Parthia (37–2BC) in 20BC {{for the return}} of the battle standards lost by Crassus in the Battle of Carrhae, a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome. Werner Eck claims that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus' defeat by military means. However, Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue Augustus of Prima Porta and in monuments such as the Temple of Mars Ultor ('Mars the Avenger') built to house the standards.|$|E

25|$|The night before, {{a terrific}} storm lashed {{the entire area}} badly. Prior to the battle, General Hill, seeing the rough terrain of the area as a hazard, had his men place a white cloth around their hats as a {{precaution}} {{to serve as a}} battle-badge.

25|$|In 1866, citing {{excessive}} costs, the Portuguese government {{withdrew the}} garrison. Pedro continued his rule, however, though he faced increasing rivalry from clan-based trading magnates who drained his authority from {{much of the}} country. The most dangerous of these was Garcia Mbwaka Matu {{of the town of}} Makuta. This town had been founded by a man named Kuvo, who probably obtained his wealth through trade, since he and Garcia made a great deal of controlling markets. Though <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> challenge in the 1870s, after Garcia's death in 1880, Makuta became less problematic.|$|E

25|$|After Sheridan, {{the next}} Irish dramatist of {{historical}} importance was Dion Boucicault (1820–1890). Boucicault {{was born in}} Dublin but went to England to complete his education. At school, he began writing dramatic sketches and soon took up acting under the stage name of Lee Morton. His first play was Legend of Devil's Dyke 1838 in which he acted himself in Brighton. His first London production was London Assurance 1841. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success and he seemed set to become the major writer of comedies of his day. However, his next few plays were not as successful and Boucicault found himself in debt. He recovered some of his reputation with The Corsican Brothers (1852), a well constructed melodrama.|$|E
25|$|When he {{approached}} Pearson and the English university system, Georgescu was amazed with the informality and openness he found. There {{was no more}} feeling like a métèque, a stranger. Studying with Pearson {{for the next two}} years and reading Pearson's work on the philosophy of science, titled The Grammar of Science, further shaped Georgescu's scientific methodology and philosophy. The two men even made a friendship, and Pearson encouraged Georgescu to carry on with his studies in mathematical statistics. They co-pioneered research on the so-called 'problem of moments', one of the most difficult topics in statistics at the time, but neither of them were able to solve the problem. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> disappointment to Pearson, but Georgescu was pleased about experiencing their joint effort nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|On April 6, 1914, {{during the}} administrations of Presidents Restrepo and Woodrow Wilson, and {{after months of}} negotiations, the United States Ambassador to Colombia Thaddeus Austin Thompson and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco José Urrutia, signed the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty, where Colombia {{recognized}} Panama's independence, and received free access to the Panama Canal, and the United States offered an official apology for its involvement in the separation, and offered to pay $25million as compensation to the Colombian government. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> victory for the Colombian government as it resolved the conflict with Panama and mended the ties with its neighbors.

25|$|While Ahmed Shah Abdali {{was engaged}} in a {{campaign}} against the Marathas at Panipat in 1761, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia plundered Sirhind and Dialpur, seized towns in the Ferozepur district, and took possession of Jagraon and Kot Isa Khan on the opposite bank of the Sutlej. He captured Hoshiarpur and Naraingarh in Ambala and levied tribute from the chief of Kapurthala. He then marched towards Jhang. The Sial chief offered stout resistance. However, when Ahmad Shah left in February 1761, Nawab Jassa Singh Ahluwalia again attacked Sirhind and extended his territory as far as Tarn Taran. When he crossed the Bias and captured Sultanpur in 1762, Ahmad Shah again appeared and a fierce battle took place. The ensuing holocaust was called Ghalughara. Following the rout of Sikh forces, Nawab Jassa Singh fled to the Kangra hills. After the departure of Ahmad Shah Abdali, Nawab Jassa Singh Ahluwalia again attacked Sirhind, razing it and killing the Afghan Governor Zen Khan. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> victory for the Sikhs who now ruled all the territory around the Sirhind.|$|E
25|$|On December 19, 2006, Federal Judge Henry Kennedy {{ruled that}} the Freedmen {{descendants}} could sue the Cherokee Nation for disfranchisement.

On July 29, 2008, the Washington D.C. Circuit Court Of Appeals unanimously {{ruled that the}} Cherokee Nation was protected by sovereign immunity and could not be listed as a defendant in the lawsuit. But, it stated that the Cherokee Nation's officials were not protected by the tribe's sovereign immunity, and Freedmen descendants could proceed with a lawsuit against the tribe's officers.
