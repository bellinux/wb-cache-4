40|$|The closed <b>testing</b> <b>principle</b> {{provides}} a general and simple framework to con-struct powerful multiple test procedures for k elementary null hypotheses while controlling the familywise error {{rate in the}} strong sense. However, the closed <b>testing</b> <b>principle</b> has the disadvantage of leading to the evaluation of O(2 k) inter-section hypotheses. Multiple test procedures based on the closed <b>testing</b> <b>principle</b> may thus require substantial computational efforts. Consonant closed test pro-cedures for unrestricted hypotheses {{have the advantage of}} rejecting at least one elementary null hypothesis whenever the global null hypothesis is rejected and thus admit shortcuts of size k. If the elementary null hypotheses are restricted by logical constraints, the closure of common tests, such as max-t or min-p tests, may not be consonant in the usual sense. In this paper we introduce a weaker consonance property, denoted as local consonance, and show that many closed test procedures with restricted hypotheses satisfy this condition. We describe a general algorithm to construct related shortcuts and illustrate the results with several applications. ...|$|R

40|$|A new <b>test</b> <b>principle</b> for the {{simultaneous}} detection of total approximate titers and immunoglobulin M antibodies {{has been developed}} and applied to the detection of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. The method {{is based on the}} combination of a competition radioimmunoassay, for the determination of total antibody titer, with an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the determination of single class antibodies. The interference of the rheumatoid factor was avoided by including heat-aggregated immunoglobulin G in the dilution buffer. The specificity, sensitivity, and clinical application of the test are discussed. The results presented suggest that {{the simultaneous}} detection of total and immunoglobulin M antibody to hepatitis B core antigen might be helpful in the differentiation between previous and recent or ongoing hepatitis B infection, {{as well as in the}} differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis, in monitoring viral activity in chronic infections, and in helping to differentiate acute from chronic infections.

40|$|The {{fast growing}} of In-Car {{entertainment}} application {{leads to an}} increasing challenge for both data computation and data communication, which are managed by the microprocessor. The thesis project is the third stage of a continuous Direct Memory Access(DMA) Controller project in NXP Semiconductors {{for the purpose of}} specifying and implementing a DMA Controller to take over data communication tasks from the microprocessor. In the first step of the thesis, a <b>test</b> <b>principle</b> was investigated to fully test the existing results, but the simulation results of the Core Unit did not satisfy the requirements. The Core Unit of the DMA Controller is responsible for the sequential-single transfer and burst transfer involving wait states. The existing specification and implementation were analyzed, and a number of possible approaches for improvements were identified. During the second step, the Core Unit was re-specified according to these approaches, and fully implemented using VHDL to fulfill the requirements. After the Core Unit design, the functions of Linked List transfer was specified with Hatley and Pirbhai methodology. The Linked List Unit, which manages the Linked List transfer, was specified to support both the Static and Dynamic Linked List transfer. This specification provides an essential base for the future implementation. The implementation of the Core Unit was tested with Simvision following the proposed <b>test</b> <b>principle.</b> The results satisfied the function requirements. Thus, the specification was proved to be feasible. Additionally, the Core Unit was synthesized using Cadence Ambit. The number of the equivalent gates of a Core Unit Cell is 3 k, which is smaller than the currently used DMA Controller in NXP Semiconductors.
