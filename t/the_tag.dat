40|$|How do you {{summarize}} {{the content of}} a fictional work, let’s say Lord of the Rings, into a few "telling" words that may represent it? This master’s thesis is a comparative study of how library users’ freely chosen tags/keywords deviate from controlled vocabulary made by professional indexers when representing fiction. The thesis answers four main questions:  Do <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> that <b>the</b> library users give fictional works correspond to the categories used in professional indexing in Sweden?  Do <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> follow <b>the</b> standards for vocabulary, semantics and syntax used when indexing professionally?  Do <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> add something to document representations?  Are there differences between <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> used for adult fiction and <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> used for children’s literature? With a starting point in indexing theories of Frederick W. Lancaster, Annelise Pejtersen, and the semiotic theory of the indexing process of Jens-Erik Mai, 383 tags from totally 70 fictional works are analyzed. <b>The</b> <b>tags</b> come from <b>the</b> online catalogue of Umeå public library, accessible through the website www. minabibliotek. se. The results show tendencies of <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> corresponding {{to a great extent}} with categories used in the controlled vocabulary Att indexera skönlitteratur (Indexing fictional works). However, some tags form a separate category, which may be described as a Reading experience- category. <b>The</b> <b>tags</b> also add abstract terms to the online catalogue...|$|R

At the Judgment Day pay-per-view in May 2006, MNM lost <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> team championship to London and Kendrick. After the match, Nitro and Mercury started brawling, disbanding the group. Later that night, Melina lost a singles match against Jillian Hall and after slapping General Manager Theodore Long in anger, she and Nitro were fired from the SmackDown! brand in storyline. Off-screen, Nitro and Mercury did not get along, and WWE management decided to split <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> team and send Nitro and Melina to the Raw brand.

In early 2006, they defended their titles against Místico and Black Warrior twice. In the first match, they won by disqualification when Black Warrior interfered in the match after being pinned. In the second match two weeks later, Black Warrior turned on Místico, starting a long-running storyline between the two.

On July 10, 2000, the APA were scheduled to face Edge and Christian for <b>the</b> <b>Tag</b> Team Championship, but Edge announced that he would face Bradshaw one-on-one in a match, which Bradshaw lost. Later that week on SmackDown!, Edge and Christian were scheduled to defend their Tag Team Championship against the APA, but they again made a one-on-one match, where Christian was defeated by Faarooq. At Fully Loaded, the APA won <b>the</b> <b>Tag</b> Team match by disqualification; due to WWF rules, Edge and Christian retained <b>the</b> <b>Tag</b> Team Championship. On the September 7, 2000 edition of SmackDown!, the Dudley Boyz and the APA formed an alliance. The following week on Raw, the APA faced Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) in a losing effort. Then, on the September 18, 2000 edition of Raw, the Dudley Boyz also lost to Buchanan and The Goodfather. After the match, all the members of the Right to Censor (Buchanan, The Goodfather, Steven Richards, and Val Venis) attacked the Dudley Boyz, which resulted in the APA coming out to help the Dudley Boyz, as a part of their alliance. The Dudley Boyz and the APA were then booked in an Eight-man Tag Team match against Right to Censor at Unforgiven, which Right to Censor won via pinfall.|$|E
