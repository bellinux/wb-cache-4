5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer.

5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>process.</b> The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E
5|$|Meluha is a near perfect empire, created {{many centuries}} earlier by Lord Ram, {{one of the}} {{greatest}} kings that ever lived. However, the once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe crisis as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis who have joined forces with the Nagas, a cursed race with physical deformities. The present king of Meluha, Daksha, sends his emissaries to North India in Tibet, to invite the tribes that live there to Meluha. One of those invited are the Gunas, whose chief Shiva is a brave warrior and protector. Shiva accepts the proposal and moves to Meluha with his tribe. They reach the city of Srinagar and are received there by Ayurvati, the Chief of Medicine of the Meluhans. Shiva and his tribe are impressed with the Meluhan way of life. On their first night of stay at Srinagar, the Gunas wake up amid high fever and sweating.

The Meluhans announce Shiva as the Neelkanth, their fabled saviour.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore and gain an {{in-depth}} understanding of <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> experiences encountered by Malaysian women survivors who had gone through childhood sexual abuse. A qualitative research using transcendental-phenomenological research design was used to explore <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> experiences encountered by 7 women survivors {{with a history of}} childhood sexual abuse. The process of collecting data involved 3 stages of in-depth interview sessions with each of the survivors. A total of 21 in-depth interview sessions were carried out with each session ranging from 40 to 100 minutes. The method of data analysis was based on Moustakas’s (1994) phenomenology data analysis. Outcome of this study unveiled 9 themes of healing experiences encountered by the 7 women survivors. Among the 9 themes of healing, 5 themes were <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> <b>the</b> women survivors had gone through in their healing journey. They were: “confronted with struggles,” “channels to express and reflect,” “forgiveness,” “acceptance,” and “let go and move on. ” The other 4 themes were <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> contributors: “receive social support,” “helping self (resiliencies),” “helping other,” and “spirituality. ” The study revealed women survivors had gone through several <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> in <b>the</b> journey of recovering from childhood sexual abuse. A smooth <b>healing</b> <b>process</b> required <b>the</b> presence of <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> contributors, which {{played a significant role in}} facilitating <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>processes.</b> <b>Healing</b> <b>processes</b> and <b>healing</b> contributors are interconnected and both worked hand in hand to assist women survivors to obtain healing from childhood sexual abuse. Research outcomes provide additional insights into understanding healing from childhood sexual abuse, in particular from the women survivors’ perspective.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} phathophysiological role of {{macrophage}} colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) in <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> of inflammation, we studied chronological changes in serum concentrations of M-CSF and other reactants during the acute phase of inflammation {{in patients who}} underwent open heart surgery, since these patients showed a precise point of tissue damage. The number of neutrophilic leukocytes increased {{in the very early}} postoperative stage, reached a peak 48 h after surgery and declined to the basal level at day 14. The chronological changes in serum C-reactive protein level after surgery were similar to these of neutrophic leukocytes.

Based on these phenomena, it is assumed that M-CSF plays a pathophysiological role in <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>processes</b> of an inflammation.

A circular excisional wound was created in the oral palatal region, and <b>the</b> wound <b>healing</b> <b>process</b> was observed. <b>The</b> rats were divided into two experimental groups in which either hydrogen-rich water or distilled water was consumed. In the drinking hydrogen-rich water, <b>the</b> palatal wound <b>healing</b> <b>process</b> was accelerated compared to that in the control group. As molecular hydrogen upregulated the Nrf 2 pathway, systemic oxidative stresses were decreased by the activation of antioxidant activity. Furthermore, hydrogen-rich water intake reduced proinflammatory cytokine levels and promoted the expression of healing-associated factors in rat palatal tissue. In conclusion, hydrogen-rich water intake exhibited multiple beneficial effects through activation of the Nrf 2 /antioxidant defense pathway. The results of this study support the hypothesis that oral administration of hydrogen-rich water benefits <b>the</b> wound <b>healing</b> <b>process</b> by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses...|$|R

40|$|Oral {{administration}} of royal jelly (RJ) promotes wound healing in diabetic mice.

Migration of fibroblasts peaked at 24 hrs after wounding. RJ treatment significantly accelerated the migration of fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner at 8 hrs. Although RJ also accelerated the migration of fibroblasts at both 20 hrs and 24 hrs after wounding, the efficacy was less potent than at 8 hrs. Among various lipid classes within fibroblasts, the level of cholesterol was significantly decreased at 8 hrs following {{administration of}} both 0. 1 ug/ml and 5 mg/ml RJ.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of low-intensity laser therapy on <b>the</b> wound <b>healing</b> <b>process</b> treated with steroid. Background Data: Various biological effects have been associated with low-level laser therapy (LLLT). Materials and Methods: Forty-eight rats were used, and after execution of a wound on the dorsal region of each animal, they were divided into 4 groups (n = 12), receiving the following treatments: G 1 (control), wounds and animals received no treatment; G 2, wounds were treated with LLLT; G 3, animals received an intraperitoneal injection of steroid dosage (2 mg/kg of body weight); G 4, animals re-ceived steroid and wounds were treated with LLLT. The laser emission device used was a GaAIAs (904 nm), in a contact mode, with 2. 75 mW gated with 2. 900 Hz during 120 sec (33 J/cm 2). After the period of 3, 7, and 14 days, the animals were sacrificed and the parts sent to histological processing and dyed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson trichromium (MT) techniques. Results: The results have shown that the wounds treated with steroid had a delay in healing, while LLLT accelerated <b>the</b> wound <b>healing</b> <b>process.</b> Also, wounds treated with laser in the animals treated with steroid presented a differentiated <b>healing</b> <b>process</b> with a larger collagen deposition and also a decrease in both the inflamatory infiltrated and the delay on <b>the</b> wound <b>healing</b> <b>process.</b> Conclusion: LLLT accelerated <b>healing,</b> caused by <b>the</b> steroid, acting as a biostimulative coadjutant agent, balancing the undesirable effects of cortisone on <b>the</b> tissue <b>healing</b> <b>process.</b> 19...|$|R
