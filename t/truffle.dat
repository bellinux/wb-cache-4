5|$|Kalapuya brunnea is {{a species}} of <b>truffle</b> in the {{monotypic}} fungal genus Kalapuya. The <b>truffle</b> occurs only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, in western Oregon and northern California. Known locally as the Oregon brown <b>truffle,</b> it was formerly thought to be an undescribed species of Leucangium until molecular analysis demonstrated that it was distinct from that genus. The <b>truffle</b> is reddish brown with a rough and warty outer skin, while the interior spore-producing gleba is initially whitish before developing greyish-brown mottling as it matures. Mature truffles have an odor resembling garlicky cheese, similar to mature Camembert. The species has been harvested for culinary purposes in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet oregonense {{derives from}} the name Oregon and the Latin suffix -ense (relating to), in reference to western Oregon being its central region of abundance. The fungus {{is commonly known as}} the Oregon white <b>truffle.</b> <b>Truffle</b> authority James Trappe initially intended to name the species as a variety of Tuber gibbosum (i.e., as Tuber gibbosum var. oregonense) before molecular analysis revealed that genetic differences warranted distinction at the species level.|$|E
5|$|French {{regional}} cuisines use {{locally grown}} fungi, such as truffe (<b>truffle),</b> champignon de Paris (button mushroom), chanterelle ou girolle (chanterelle), pleurote (en huître) (oyster mushrooms), and cèpes (porcini).|$|E
50|$|Desert <b>truffles</b> do {{not have}} the same flavor as European <b>truffles,</b> but tend to be more common and thus more affordable. Forest <b>truffles</b> (Tuber genus) {{typically}} cost $100 per kilogram, and Italian <b>truffles</b> may sell for up to $2200 per kilogram, while Terfezia <b>truffles</b> sold as of 2002 in Riyadh for $80 to $105 a kilo, and in recent years have reached, but not yet exceeded, $270.|$|R

5|$|Leucangium carthusianum, the Oregon black <b>truffle,</b> {{is roughly}} similar in appearance, habitat, and growing season, {{but can be}} {{distinguished}} by its darker (charcoal black) peridium. Microscopically, the spores of Leucangium are larger (60–90μm) and have a single large oil droplet. L.carthusianum is also edible and prized for its taste and aroma.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 2010, based on specimens collected in February, 2009 from Benton County, Oregon. Before this, {{it had been}} known locally for several years as the Oregon brown <b>truffle,</b> and assumed to be an undescribed species of Leucangium, based on its overall resemblance to and similar habitat as the Oregon black <b>truffle,</b> Leucangium carthusianum; it was given the provisional name Leucangium brunneum. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences revealed that the species {{is not related to}} the <b>truffle</b> genera of the family Tuberaceae, including Tuber, Dingleya and Reddellomyces. Rather, it has close affinity with the hypogeous (below the soil surface) genera of the Morchellaceae, including Fischerula, Imaia, and Leucangium, but both genetic and morphological characters are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as a distinct genus. All four hypogeous Morchellaceae genera produce huge spores, with sizes ranging from 32 to 100micrometers (μm). Both Kalapuya and Imaia have asci (spore-bearing cells) that have thick cell walls when young, but become thin when mature—a trait not shared with Fischerula. The authors explain that although the hypogeous Morchellaceae genera share the trait of large spore size, striking differences in spore structure and other morphological difference in microscopic characters would have ruled out placing them in the same family as Morchella, {{were it not for the}} convincing molecular evidence proving their relatedness.|$|E

Options include a tiger prawn and watercress salad, and roast beef with <b>truffle</b> with a green bean salad. Desserts include a chocolate and pecan brownie with crème Chantilly.|$|E
50|$|With a {{price of}} about 1,000 to 2,000 euros per kilogram, black <b>truffles</b> are the second most {{expensive}} <b>truffles</b> after white <b>truffles,</b> {{and one of the}} most sought after edible mushrooms in the world.|$|R
50|$|In cooking, black <b>truffles</b> {{are used}} to refine the taste of meat, fish, soups and risotto. Unlike white <b>truffles,</b> the aroma of black <b>truffles</b> does not {{diminish}} when they are heated, but becomes more intense.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that [...] "Chocolate <b>truffles</b> were virtually {{unknown in the}} United States when, in 1973, Alice Medrich started making and selling them {{from her home in}} Berkeley." [...] Because Medrich's <b>truffles</b> have soft centers, when coated they have a characteristic larger, [...] "lumpy" [...] shape compared to French <b>truffles,</b> and have {{come to be known as}} California <b>truffles.</b>|$|R
5|$|The menu {{is created}} by Bosi. He has been {{described}} as an innovator and his work has been compared to that of Heston Blumenthal at The Fat Duck. One of the new dishes Bosi introduced following his move to London was a two-part pork dish. The first part was roasted suckling pig served with sea urchin, kohlrabi and a fondant of sweet potato. The second, inspired by his daughter, featured a sausage roll with a salad and a <b>truffle</b> dressing. Other dishes have included roast chicken with an onion fondue and licorice, and desserts include a chocolate tart served with basil ice cream.|$|E
5|$|Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{was designated}} the type species of Ramaria in 1933 by Marinus Anton Donk. Modern molecular analysis indicates that Ramaria is a polyphyletic assemblage of species with clavarioid fruit bodies. According to the infrageneric classification scheme proposed by Marr and Stuntz, R.botrytis {{is included in}} the subgenus Ramaria, which includes species that have grooved spores, clamps present in the hyphae, and fruit bodies with a large, profusely branched cauliflower-like appearance. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA suggests that R.botrytis is closely related to R.rubripermanens and R.rubrievanescens, and that these species form a clade that is sister (sharing a recent common ancestor) to the false <b>truffle</b> genus Gautieria, the most derived group within the studied taxa.|$|E
5|$|Sarcosphaera is {{classified}} in the family Pezizaceae of the order Pezizales. Phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences suggests that Sarcosphaera forms a clade with the genera Boudiera and Iodophanus, and that the three taxa are a sister group to Ascobolus and Saccobolus (both in the family Ascobolaceae). Species in the families Pezizaceae and Ascobolaceae are distinct from other Pezizalean taxa in the positive iodine reaction of the ascus wall. In a more recent (2005) phylogenetic analysis combining the data derived from three genes (the large subunit ribosomal rRNA (LSU), RNA polymerase II (RPB2), and beta-tubulin), Sarcosphaera was shown to be {{closely related to the}} <b>truffle</b> genus Hydnotryopsis, corroborating earlier results that used only the LSU rDNA sequences.|$|E
2500|$|However, <b>truffles</b> can be cultivated. As {{early as}} 1808, there were {{successful}} attempts to cultivate <b>truffles,</b> known in French as [...] People had long observed that <b>truffles</b> were growing among {{the roots of}} certain trees, and in 1808, Joseph Talon, from Apt (département of Vaucluse) in southern France, had the idea of transplanting some seedlings that he had collected {{at the foot of}} oak trees known to host <b>truffles</b> in their root system.|$|R

5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and <b>truffle,</b> while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
25|$|The bulk of <b>truffle</b> oil on {{the market}} is made with a {{synthetic}} ingredient, as are many other <b>truffle</b> products. However, alcohol is now being used to carry the <b>truffle</b> flavour {{without the need for}} synthetic flavourings. The first <b>truffle</b> vodka, Black Moth Vodka, is a natural vodka infused with black Périgord truffles (Tuber melanosporum). Although primarily used as a spirit in its own right and mixed in a range of cocktails, <b>truffle</b> vodka is also used by various chefs to flavour dishes by evaporating the alcohol through cooking whilst retaining the <b>truffle</b> aroma.|$|E

5000|$|Set {{prior to}} the events of Enslaved, Pigsy {{currently}} lives a solitary life in the scrap yard with his only companion, a small flying robot named [...] "Truffles" [...] that helps Pigsy scout scraps and advice in combat. Due to his loneliness, Pigsy decides to build himself a friend, yet it would require three key components that he along with <b>Truffles</b> must find in the scrap yard populated by mechs. While <b>Truffles</b> helps throughout his search, Pigsy seems unappreciative and prioritizes his new creation. As Pigsy retrieves the final component, <b>Truffles</b> is damaged and shuts down in the process. With his new friend nearly complete, Pigsy learns that what his creation actually needs is a [...] "heart", inserting <b>Truffles</b> inside. When activated however, his creation runs amok before being gathered up by a salvaging mech. Pigsy gives chase and fights his way into the main scrap collector.
