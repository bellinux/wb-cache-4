5|$|Bénouville was the {{farthest}} forward {{point of the}} British advance on 6 June 1944. On 9 June, the German Air Force attacked <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> with 13 aircraft. The British had positioned light and medium-sized anti-aircraft guns around <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> and {{in the face of}} intense anti-aircraft fire the attack failed, although they did claim one of <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> was destroyed by a direct hit.|$|E
5|$|Of the 181 men (139 infantry, 30 {{engineers}} and 12 pilots) of 'D' Company {{involved in the}} capture of <b>the</b> <b>bridges,</b> two were killed and an additional fourteen wounded. The 7th Battalion's losses during the defence of <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> amounted to 18 dead and 36 wounded.|$|E

5|$|As the day progressed, the 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment counterattacked in the Bénouville area in {{an attempt}} to get through to <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b> The coup-de-main force and the 7th Parachute Battalion held their position, {{knocking}} out 13 of the 17 tanks trying to get through. The British troops moved forward into Bénouville and cleared the Germans in house to house fighting. By midday, most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion had arrived at <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b> Despite the ferocity of the attacks, the battalion and the coup-de-main force were able to hold <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> until 19:00, when the leading elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division arrived and began to relieve the airborne troops, a process that was completed around 01:00 7 June.|$|E
5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began blowing the morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, to help guide the 7th Parachute Battalion to <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b> The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries moving around in Bénouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the rallying point but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of <b>the</b> <b>bridges,</b> decided they could not wait any longer and, at 01:10, left for <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} {{stage of the}} Normandy invasion, {{the decision was made}} to land the 6th Airborne Division (Major-General Richard Gale) on the left flank of the invasion beaches between the River Orne and the River Dives. Their primary objective was to capture the two road bridges over the River Orne and the Caen Canal and prevent a German flanking attack on the landing area. Failure to capture <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> would leave the 6th Airborne Division cut off in enemy territory, so the 5th Parachute Brigade were earmarked to defend <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> against counter-attacks. Gale decided that the only way to capture <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> intact was by a glider coup de main assault. He then asked Brigadier Hugh Kindersley of the 6th Airlanding Brigade to nominate his best company for the operation.|$|E

5000|$|Loys Station Covered Bridge was {{originally}} built in 1848. [...] Between 1929 and 1930 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was reinforced with a concrete pier and steel beams. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> gets {{its name from}} a Western Maryland Railroad station that stopped nearby <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in Loys. In 1978 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. In 1991 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was burned down by an arsonist who was trying to fraudulently collect insurance money. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> took three years and $300,000 to rebuild and was rebuilt to match <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> as it was in 1930 after having been reinforced. Most of the cost of reconstructing <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was covered by insurance. On 4 July 1994 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> officially reopened for the public. [...] In October 2013 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was damaged twice by vehicles, but quickly repaired both times.|$|R
5|$|Except for {{the iron}} or steel {{included}} in <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> {{and the water}} tower, the structures are built in brick or stone. The stone is almost invariably red sandstone, obtained from local quarries in the Runcorn, Weston, and Halton areas. Unless stated otherwise, the buildings (except <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> and the water tower) are constructed in local red sandstone with slate roofs. Their locations {{can be found on}} the map of all coordinates.|$|E
5|$|Just after midday, the 21st Panzer Division {{received}} {{permission to}} attack the landings. Luck ordered the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment, east of the River Orne, towards <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b> The column was quickly spotted, and engaged {{for the next two}} hours by Allied artillery and aircraft causing heavy losses. The 1st Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment and the 100th Panzer Regiment, attacking from west of the canal, had more success reaching the beaches between the British landing area of Sword and the Canadian Juno. At 13:30, the men at <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> heard the sound of bagpipes, played by Bill Millin of the 1st Commando Brigade. As the commandos arrived, they crossed <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> and joined the rest of 6th Airborne Division defending the eastern perimeter. Some of the tanks accompanying the commandos moved into Bénouville to reinforce its defences, while others crossed <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> with the commandos. At 15:00, a boat loaded with German infantry approached from Caen. It was engaged with the anti-tank gun manned by number One Platoon, hit in the stern by the second round fired and then retreated back toward Caen.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Petrofka <b>Bridge</b> is a Canadian <b>bridge</b> {{that spans}} <b>the</b> North Saskatchewan River south of Blaine Lake, Saskatchewan.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is powered}} by an {{electric}} motor beneath <b>the</b> road. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> has engine rooms on either side, which operate the wire ropes and counterweights that lift and lower <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> has been raised over 100,000 times and every lift has to be recorded. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> can only be lifted when the Sittingbourne railway signalman gives authorization, once a train travelling across <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> has passed <b>the</b> relevant track section.|$|R
5000|$|Loyn Bridge {{was damaged}} during Storm Desmond on 5 December 2015. [...] Further damage due to debris caused <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{to be closed}} for an {{extended}} period. [...] Extensive temporary protection for <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and bank were required, along with infill in <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> piers. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> finally reopened on 22 April 2016. Even after <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> repairs, significant damage to the hedges and fences along the road between <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and Gressingham is apparent.|$|R
5|$|Supply {{problems}} {{in the aftermath of}} the war meant that the concrete piers were founded on jarrah timber piles, rather than concrete. Additionally, a steel plate shortage forced the bridge's designers to avoid the use of steel to design the forms in the bridge's superstructure. Also, the cement that was used on <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> had to be sourced from seven different sources, which led to different durability for different parts of <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} {{vital to the}} success of Operation Tonga, the overall British {{airborne}} landings in Normandy. Failure to capture <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> intact, or to prevent their demolition by the Germans, would leave the British 6th Airborne Division cut {{off from the rest of}} the Allied armies with their backs to the two waterways. If the Germans retained control over <b>the</b> <b>bridges,</b> they could be used by their armoured divisions to attack the landing beaches of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Unpredictable traffic {{congestion}} and its functionally obsolete design make the Skyway {{one of the}} most unreliable roads in the United States. , <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> handle about 74,000crossings per day, none of which were by trucks since they had been barred from the road in 1934. <b>The</b> <b>bridges</b> have been altered little since opening. In 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) began a rehabilitation program, which it estimates will cost more than $1billion, It closed the two eastbound (northbound US1/9) lanes for traffic on April 12, 2014, with the project expected to be completed in the spring of 2018.|$|E
25|$|The Anacostia's floodwaters had {{undermined}} <b>the</b> <b>bridge's</b> central piers, causing <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to sag and {{the rails}} to separate. <b>The</b> <b>bridge's</b> destruction had been swift: A track foreman had inspected <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> 90 {{minutes before the}} wreck and found it sound, and a track walker had crossed <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> just 10 minutes earlier and saw no damage.|$|R
50|$|Access to <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> for boaters {{became a}} problem after <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> keeper was no more. There were no bridge {{moorings}} below or above <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> and often crew {{would need to}} be let off on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> base. In 2006 a landing stage was constructed by DNAA above <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{to make it easier to}} operate.|$|R

5|$|A survey {{conducted}} by the LNWR found that <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> and culverts were in a fair condition, but the stations were dirty.

5|$|About 18:00, Nedeljković {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from Simović and reported that Bosanska Dubica, Bosanski Novi and Prijedor had all fallen, but that <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> on the Sava and Una would be demolished later that night, and that he and his remaining staff would be leaving at 20:00 for Jajce. By this time, Serb officers and soldiers were also deserting in significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no part of}} the Chesham branch was in Greater London, the Greater London Council, as one of {{its last}} acts, granted £1,180,000 to replace <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b> New bridges were built {{alongside}} the existing bridges to minimise disruption, and were rolled into place on 24 March 1986 and 14 April 1986.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{navigation}} ceased to operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock remained in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main river channel just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> over {{the navigation}} were owned by the navigation, and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that the navigation would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at this point it was agreed that the navigation had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{operation}} approached, training became more intensive. Glider units spent hours aloft every day circling over airfields as they practiced the manoeuvers required to land the airborne forces next to <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> over the Orne River, the Caen canal, the Dives, and the Merville battery. Once the pilots had practiced this sufficiently during the day, they were then switched to night operations. In the landing grounds used by the division for their operations, dozens of poles similar to those in Normandy were erected, with engineering units then timed on how fast they could demolish the obstacles. The battalion assigned to neutralising Merville spent two weeks at a special camp, where they built a replica of the battery and carried out several rehearsal exercises in and around it. The force assigned to the coup-de-main operation, to capture <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> over the Orne River and Caen canal, were transferred to Exeter. There, they conducted intensive exercises around the River Exe and the nearby canal that stood in place for their real objective. The pilots of the gliders and transport aircraft were also constantly briefed with thousands of maps and photographs of the landing zones and the surrounding areas, as well as dozens of scale models of the zones and the primary objectives, such as <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> and the Merville battery. A coloured film was produced from aerial reconnaissance photographs which, when played at the correct speed and height over the scale models, realistically simulated the paths the glider pilots would take towards their landing-zones.|$|E
5|$|Between Bow Bridge and Channelsea Bridge {{there were}} three others, said in 1303 to have been built to fill the gaps caused by the cutting of mill streams through Maud's causeway, {{although}} {{there is evidence that}} the mills pre-dated the causeway. However, the mill owners took responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>bridges,</b> which crossed the mill streams for St Thomas's, Spileman's and Saynes mills. The last two were owned by the City of London, and <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> were called Pegshole and St Michael's Bridges. An administrative mistake around 1814 resulted in the City of London taking responsibility for St Thomas's Bridge, but the miller did not complain as Pegshole bridge was smaller and therefore less costly to maintain. The names were eventually swapped, and all three were replaced by Groves Bridge in 1933, which crossed the widened Three Mills Wall River, the two branches of the Waterworks River having been combined into Three Mills Wall River, while Three Mills Wall Back River was filled in.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{opened in}} 1856, a {{steamboat}} hit <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and steamboat companies sued to have <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> dismantled. <b>The</b> M&M and Rock Island hired private attorney Abraham Lincoln to defend <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> <b>The</b> case {{was to work}} {{its way through the}} courts to reach U.S. Supreme Court in 1862 during the American Civil War when the court decided in <b>the</b> <b>bridge's</b> favor.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge's</b> {{movements}} {{were caused by}} a 'positive feedback' phenomenon, known as synchronous lateral excitation. The natural sway motion of people walking caused small sideways oscillations in <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> which in turn caused people on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to sway in step, increasing the amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> oscillations and continually reinforcing the effect. On the day of opening, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was crossed by 90,000 people, with up to 2,000 on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> at any one time.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge's</b> truss {{is made of}} 400 steel tubes, welded {{together}} and painted red. The truss's rectangular cross-section twists through a 90 degree angle along the span of <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> {{so that it is}} nearly horizontal at both ends of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> but diamond-shaped in <b>the</b> <b>bridge's</b> center. This design creates an illusion from some points of view that <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> has collapsed, but it also serves a functional purpose, damping vibrations from traffic on <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
