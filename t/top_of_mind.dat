People appear to apply separate principles of ‘fairness’ and ‘mutuality’ to the structures of taxation and public spending.

40|$|In {{the past}} several years, as wind energy {{development}} expanded from the plains and west, into rural areas with fewer working farms and ranches and higher population densities, complaints about wind turbine noise have become more common.

But {{over the past year}} or two, as it’s become clear that some residents are experiencing genuine annoyance and stress responses to “normal ” wind turbine noise levels, developers have been seeking new ways of working with noise concerns.

40|$|In the past, the {{microfinance}} industry focused {{mainly on}} growth and outreach. Addressing financial exclusion implied a huge supply gap. Recent over-indebtedness crises {{in several countries}} have shown that this gap can turn into over-supply. The industry urgently requires research to understand the magnitude and consequences of this shift. This chapter reveals the broad spectrum of consequences over-indebtedness can have on borrowers and other stakeholders, mainly MFIs. It emphasizes that over-indebtedness consequences reach far beyond the risk management concerns that MFIs and investors have on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> their <b>mind.</b> In a second step the chapter reviews the existing empirical research on microfinance over-indebtedness and examines how prevalent over-indebtedness is in microfinance markets today. It highlights the evidence for over-indebtedness in crisis markets and non-crisis markets, especially when markets mature. Only if {{the extent of the}} problem is known and its effects are properly understood, can the microfinance industry develop appropriate measures against over-indebtedness and adapt to the challenge of oversupply. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - In this {{research}} the authors attempt {{to test the}} plausibility of human and corporate analogies through the analysis of naturalistic descriptions of people and corporations. Design/methodology/approach - The descriptions are analyzed via morpheme and semantic clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Research was carried out on 243 respondents. The {{respondents were asked to}} name one company and one personality and to list five positive attributes for each. Respondents were instructed to use <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mind</b> recollection and to promptly list the first responses that occurred to them. Findings - There are two main categories that people use for describing companies and other people - identity characteristics and determinants of identity characteristics. From the analysis authors conclude that notable similarities as well as differences exist in descriptions of humans and companies inside the three-dimensional space of identity characteristics of extraversion, agreeableness and dynamism. The configuration suggests that the first (extraversion) and the third (dynamic) dimensions are similar for humans and companies. Both categories and all three dimensions can be applied for corporate branding. Research limitations - The study has several limitations, such as the problem of codification of open ended data.
