5|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir (Out of {{the depths}} I call, Lord, to You), , is a church cantata by the German {{composer}} Johann Sebastian Bach. It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, {{which makes it}} one of Bach's earliest cantatas. Some sources suggest {{that it could be}} his earliest surviving work in this form, but current <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there are one or two earlier examples.|$|E
5|$|The enzymes trypsin and {{chymotrypsin}} {{were first}} purified in the 1930s. A serine {{in each of}} trypsin and chymotrypsin was identified as the catalytic nucleophile (by diisopropyl fluorophosphate modification) in the 1950s. The structure of chymotrypsin was solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1960s, showing {{the orientation of the}} catalytic triad in the active site. Other proteases were sequenced and aligned to reveal a family of related proteases, now called the S1 family. Simultaneously, the structures of the evolutionarily unrelated papain and subtilisin proteases were found to contain analogous triads. The 'charge-relay' mechanism for the activation of the nucleophile by the other triad members was proposed in the late 1960s. As more protease structures were solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1970s and 80s, homologous (such as TEV protease) and analogous (such as papain) triads were found. The MEROPS classification system in the 1990s and 2000s began classing proteases into structurally related enzyme superfamilies and so acts as a database of the convergent evolution of triads in over 20 superfamilies. Understanding how chemical constraints on evolution led to the convergence of so many enzyme families on the same triad geometries has developed in the 2010s. Of particular contention during the 1990s and early 2000s was the contribution of low-barrier hydrogen bonding to catalysis; however, current <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ordinary hydrogen bonding is sufficient to explain the mechanism. The massive body of work on the charge-relay, covalent catalysis used by catalytic triads has led to the mechanism being the best characterised in all of biochemistry.|$|E
25|$|The key {{assumption}} underpinning Black's <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{because people}} are living longer {{they will have to}} work longer - hence the need for more effective intervention when working people fall ill, so that they can remain in the workforce instead of retiring on medical grounds or going onto benefits.|$|E

5000|$|Montesquieu, in The Spirit of Laws, was {{possibly}} {{the first to}} suggest a universal explanation for history. [...] Another innovative aspect of Montesquieu's <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he included changes in mores and manners {{as part of his}} explanation of political and historic events.|$|R
25|$|The sweet potato, called kūmara in Māori {{and kumar}} in Quechua, {{is native to}} the Americas and was {{widespread}} in Polynesia when Europeans first reached the Pacific. Remains of the plant in the Cook Islands have been radiocarbon-dated to 1000, and current <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was brought to central Polynesia c. 700 and spread across Polynesia from there, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} in the Cook Islands of sweet potato that is a plant native to the Americas (called kūmara in Māori), which have been radiocarbon-dated to 1000 CE, has been cited as evidence that Americans could have traveled to Oceania. The current <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> sweet potato was brought to central Polynesia circa 700 CE and spread across Polynesia from there, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back. An alternative explanation posits biological dispersal; plants and/or seeds could float across the Pacific without any human contact.|$|E
25|$|This {{leaves the}} {{question}} of when these works were created. Scholars {{in the first half}} of the 20th century came to the conclusion that the Yahwist was produced in the monarchic period, specifically at the court of Solomon, 10th century BC, and the Priestly work in the middle of the 5th century BC (the author was even identified as Ezra), but more recent <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Yahwist was written either just before or during the Babylonian exile of the 6th century BC, and the Priestly final edition was made late in the Exilic period or soon after.|$|E

50|$|The Pontiac Solstice was {{received}} {{very well at}} the 2002 NAIAS. The drivable roadster concept car shown had been cobbled together from many different components, using a heavily modified portion of the Delta. The <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this architecture might be heavily modified and used to produce the Solstice in the near future.|$|R
50|$|The {{release and}} {{development}} of several strong cryptographic software packages such as Nautilus, PGP and PGPfone {{was in response to}} the government push for the Clipper chip. The <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if strong cryptography was freely available on the internet as an alternative, the government would be unable to stop its use.|$|R
25|$|It was {{originally}} {{thought that the}} island, believed to be 2–3thousand years old, developed from an offshore shingle ridge, and had thus always been an island, but current <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the island {{was originally}} a spit extending west from Holkham dunes. Support for this theory comes from boreholes and from radiocarbon dating of a shell to 837AD, that appeared to indicate the existence of saltmarshes behind the shingle barrier at that time. A 1585 map also appears to show a spit at this location, and a 1630 inventory of the lands of Robert of Brancaster, the local Lord of the Manor, did not show list the island as a separate entity.|$|E
25|$|The {{sweet potato}} was grown in Polynesia before western exploration. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the Cook Islands to 1000 AD, and current <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it was brought}} to central Polynesia around 700 AD, {{possibly}} by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, and spread across Polynesia to Hawaii and New Zealand from there. It is possible, however, that South Americans {{brought it to the}} Pacific, although this is unlikely as it was the Polynesians who had a strong maritime tradition and not the native South Americans. The theory that the plant could spread by floating seeds across the ocean is not supported by evidence. Another point is that the sweet potato in Polynesia is the cultivated Ipomoea batatas, which is generally spread by vine cuttings and not by seeds.|$|E
500|$|Brown clouds {{have been}} found to amplify global warming {{according}} to Veerabhadran Ramanathan, an atmospheric chemist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, CA. [...] "The conventional <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> brown clouds have masked as much as 50 percent of global warming by greenhouse gases through so-called global dimming... While this is true globally, this study reveals that over southern and eastern Asia, the soot particles in the brown clouds are in fact amplifying the atmospheric warming trend caused by greenhouse gases by as much as 50 percent." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 8 Division’s Brigades were disbanded in 1992 and the battalions and regiments came {{to answer}} {{directly}} to the divisional headquarters - the <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these would <b>be</b> grouped into task forces as required. The concept was never put to a serious test. The Formation was also renamed 8 South African Division.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{principles}} of Cobbenhagen's economic <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the economy <b>is</b> inherently linked to sociology and psychology. He believed that an economic science isolated from the rest of human knowledge contributed to human materialism and mechanization of life. A second important point was his philosophical and ethical treatment of economic issues, inspired on Catholic moral theology.|$|R
60|$|Overwhelmed {{with disgust}} {{at his own}} stupidity, and at the utter impossibility of doing {{anything}} to mend matters, the unfortunate Lieutenant sat down to think, {{and the result of}} his <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he resolved at all events to look well after Azinte, and see <b>that</b> she should <b>be</b> cared for on her arrival at the Seychelles.|$|R
500|$|While {{returning}} to Hershel's farm, Shane stares at a walker {{in an abandoned}} field. Kirkman stated the walker symbolizes the growing scope of the zombie virus. [...] "We're really just trying to show {{that that kind of}} thing is inescapable," [...] he said. [...] "You're just driving down the street, you look over and, 'Oh, there you go, there’s a zombie.' We're trying to show that this world {{is becoming more and more}} populated by zombies. Our <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> large population centers like Atlanta are really where the heart of this began and as [...] moved out to Hershel’s farm they didn’t really encounter very many walkers because they are moving out of the city center at a faster rate than the zombie population. And that zombie population is starting to catch up with them. The area is starting to become more and more dense with walkers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} there was {{speculation}} {{that he had}} also had a period in a more progressive workshop, and both that of the Pollaiuolo brothers and Verrochio have been suggested, based on some undoubted influence these had on Botticelli's style. [...] Current <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no actual period in a different workshop is needed to account for this.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence of LeMay's <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in his 1965 {{autobiography}} (co-written with MacKinlay Kantor) LeMay {{is quoted}} as saying his response to North Vietnam would be to demand that [...] "they've got to draw in their horns and stop their aggression, or we’re going to bomb them back into the Stone Age. And we would shove them back into the Stone Age with Air power or Naval power—not with ground forces".|$|E

50|$|Although early <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{a higher}} ratio of a cation's ion charge to ionic radius, or the charge density, {{resulted}} in more solvation, this does not stand up to scrutiny for ions like iron(III) or lanthanides and actinides, which are readily hydrolyzed to form insoluble (hydrous) oxides. As these are solids, it <b>is</b> apparent <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> not solvated.|$|R
50|$|H. pylori {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the stomachs of patients with gastritis and ulcers in 1982 by Drs. Barry Marshall and Robin Warren of Perth, Australia. At the time, the conventional <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no bacterium could live in the acid environment of the human stomach. In recognition of their discovery, Marshall and Warren were awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|R
2500|$|Another critic, Abdullah Saeed, {{complains}} {{that the schools}} of Islamic jurisprudence have ignored [...] "rationale/wisdom" [...] (hikmah) and arrived at a legal [...] "cause" [...] (`illa) for riba [...] "which {{had nothing to do}} with the circumstances of the transaction, the parties thereto, or the importance of the commodity to the survival of society." [...] One result of this legalistic <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> hiyal could be and has been used [...] "from the medieval period to the present day", to create loans based on [...] "fictitious transactions" [...] charging [...] "exorbitant rates of interest" [...] with the blessings of orthodox jurists.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basis of}} all Taoist <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> qi {{is part of}} {{everything}} in existence. Qi is related to another energetic substance contained {{in the human body}} known as jing (精), and once all this has been expended the body dies. Jing can be lost in many ways, but most notably through the loss of body fluids. Taoists may use practices to stimulate/increase and conserve their bodily fluids to great extents. [...] The fluid believed to contain the most Jing is semen. Therefore, Taoists believe in decreasing the frequency of, or totally avoiding, ejaculation in order to conserve life essence.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Dewey was alarmed {{by many of}} the [...] "child-centered" [...] excesses of educational-school pedagogues who claimed to be his followers, and he argued that too much {{reliance}} on the child could be equally detrimental to the learning process. In this second school of thought, [...] "we must take our stand with the child and our departure from him. It is he and not the subject-matter which determines both quality and quantity of learning" [...] (Dewey, 1902, pp.13–14). According to Dewey, the potential flaw in this line of <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it minimizes the importance of the content as well as the role of the teacher.|$|E
50|$|The 1964-65 Yugoslav First League had an {{odd number}} of teams because FK Vardar {{was allowed to}} compete in the top league despite getting relegated the {{previous}} season. The state and FA authorities made this decision due to the major earthquake (6.1 Richter Scale) that hit Skopje on 26 July 1963. The <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> having a team in top-flight would boost the citizens' morale.|$|R
60|$|There was a tense silence. What Albert <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> one cannot say. The {{thoughts}} of Youth are long, long thoughts. What George <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the late King Herod had been unjustly blamed for a policy {{which had been}} both statesmanlike and {{in the interests of}} the public. He was blaming the mawkish sentimentality of the modern legal system which ranks the evisceration and secret burial of small boys as a crime.|$|R

2500|$|One mode of <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this {{tendency}} of acetylation {{to be associated}} with [...] "active" [...] transcription is biophysical in nature. Because it normally has a positively charged nitrogen at its end, lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the DNA backbone. The acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral amide linkage. This removes the positive charge, thus loosening the DNA from the histone. When this occurs, complexes like SWI/SNF and other transcriptional factors can bind to the DNA and allow transcription to occur. This is the [...] "cis" [...] model of epigenetic function. In other words, changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the DNA itself.|$|E
2500|$|Convergent {{thinking}} {{is the type}} of thinking that focuses on coming up with the single, well-established answer to a problem. [...] It is oriented toward deriving the single best, or most often correct answer to a question. Convergent thinking emphasizes speed, accuracy, and logic and focuses on recognizing the familiar, reapplying techniques, and accumulating stored information. [...] It is most effective in situations where an answer readily exists and simply needs to be either recalled or worked out through decision making strategies. [...] A critical aspect of convergent <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it leads to a single best answer, leaving no room for ambiguity. In this view, answers are either right or wrong. The solution that is derived {{at the end of the}} convergent thinking process is the best possible answer the majority of the time.|$|E
2500|$|... don't think I'm {{going to}} make albums in the old-fashioned way, meaning 12–15 songs, etc. in one small package. My desire at this point would be to release one song at a time, {{over a period of}} 2–3 years, with it all adding up to a box set/album of sorts that would also include an art movie of the album... My <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if I focus on one song at a time I would {{approach}} them as beautiful, distinct paintings that would each require the attention they deserve. This would also mean I would choose what I am recording quite carefully as there would be tremendous internal pressure to get it just right, and {{that is the kind of}} pressure I like, which is to make the most beautiful thing possible.|$|E
