5|$|After their {{training}} had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to an RAF airfield at Skitten in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later. On {{the evening of}} 19 November, Group Captain Cooper, {{with the aid of}} a Norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from the SOE agents stationed near the landing zone, decided that although the weather was not perfect, it would be best to launch the operation that night; Cooper believed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> delayed, the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely. The first aircraft–glider combination took off from the airfield at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective.|$|E
5|$|Dawson relayed {{this story}} to Bulawayo, where Company {{authorities}} made enquiries. No {{man who had been}} attached to the column corroborated the account. The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war). Lawyers appointed by the Company launched a formal investigation early in 1894.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, Isaac Beeckman {{proposed}} {{an experiment in}} which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei {{proposed an}} experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. In 1667, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about onemile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microseconds.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Castillo Armas {{had begun}} to intensify his aerial attacks, with the extra planes that Eisenhower had approved. They had limited {{material}} success; many of their bombs were surplus material from World War II, and failed to explode. Nonetheless, they had a significant psychological impact. On 25 June, {{the same day that}} he received the army's ultimatum, Árbenz learned that Castillo Armas had scored what later proved to be his only military victory, defeating the Guatemalan garrison at Chiquimula. Historian Piero Gleijeses has stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> not for U.S. support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although they were not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the U.S. would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win.|$|E
5|$|Putnam himself {{may be his}} own most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E

25|$|The sterile insect {{technique}} was proposed by scientists Edward F. Knipling and Raymond C. Bushland, and was rapidly {{adopted by the}} United States Department of Agriculture in 1958.

The scientists reasoned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> possible to clinically sterilize and release huge numbers of males as breeding time approached, fertile males might be outcompeted {{and the majority of}} female flies would lay sterile eggs. Irradiating the males was used for sterilization.|$|E
