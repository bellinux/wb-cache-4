5|$|Corporate {{support for}} the Heritage Classic {{exceeded}} expectations; Chief Operating Officer John Collins announced that the league had gained more sponsorship revenue for Calgary's game than it had the Winter Classic. While the league would not commit to holding a third Heritage Classic, Collins admitted <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> every team had expressed interest in holding their own game and that title sponsor Tim Hortons had signed a multi-year deal with the league.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Bethe, {{along with}} IBM {{physicist}} Richard Garwin, {{published an article}} criticising in detail the anti-ICBM defense system proposed by the Department of Defense. The two physicists described in the article <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> any measure taken by the US would be easily thwarted with the deployment of relatively simple decoys. Bethe {{was one of the}} primary voices in the scientific community behind the signing of the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty prohibiting further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|Many {{tropical}} {{tree species}} have seeds that are dispersed by ants. Seed dispersal by ants or myrmecochory is widespread and new estimates suggest <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> 9% of all plant species may have such ant associations. Some plants in fire-prone grassland systems are particularly dependent on ants for their survival and dispersal as the seeds are transported to safety below the ground. Many ant-dispersed seeds have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food.|$|E
5|$|Mohorič {{was passed}} by Alexey Tsatevich (Katusha) and Primož Roglič (LottoNL–Jumbo), {{who went on to}} contest a two-man sprint. Tsatevich won the sprint, despite an early celebration <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> allowed Roglič to come past him. The peloton {{finished}} together, 14 seconds behind, with Jarlinson Pantano (IAM) winning the sprint for third place. Quintana therefore sealed his overall victory, with Contador second and Martin third.|$|E
5|$|Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in and individual’s overall health; {{psychological}} and physical health status is often dramatically impacted by the presence of malnutrition. India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E

5|$|The Games {{have grown}} so much <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> every nation is now represented.

The coin is catalogued at between $200 and $1,300, though exceptional specimens have sold for more.|$|E

In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political rally to an audience of 50,000 partisans of candidate Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the divisive 2001 presidential elections <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which {{was recorded}} in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future. The same year he toured extensively in France, the United States and Canada.|$|E

5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|By February 1944, {{the reactor}} was {{irradiating}} {{a ton of}} uranium every three days. Over the next five months, {{the efficiency of the}} separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. Modifications over time raised the reactor's power to 4,000kW in July 1944. Unfortunately, the effect of the neutron poison xenon-135, one of many fission products produced from the uranium fuel, was not detected during the early operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor. Xenon-135 subsequently caused problems with the startup of the Hanford B reactor <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> halted the plutonium project.|$|E
5|$|By {{the close}} of the first day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> all the {{fighting}} was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.|$|E

In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{spirited}} {{resistance from}} the largest British merchant ship, Windham, {{the failure of the}} other Indiamen to support their leader and the size and power of the French ships forced the British to withdraw: all the HEIC ships were subsequently captured by the larger, faster French warships. A month later, Hamelin's raiding campaign skirted disaster when a winter hurricane on the voyage back to Île de France almost wrecked his flagship Vénus. Vénus only survived with the co-operation of the British prisoners aboard, who brought the ship safely to port. Only two of the captured Indiamen were successfully brought to Ile de France: the same storm <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> destroyed Vénus scattered the squadron and its prizes, allowing a patrolling British frigate to recapture Windham {{just a few miles from}} the French island.|$|E

Under Licio Gelli's leadership, in the late 1970s, P2 {{became involved in the}} financial scandals <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> bankrupted the Vatican Bank.
