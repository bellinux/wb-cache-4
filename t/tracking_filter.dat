40|$|Strong <b>tracking</b> <b>filtering</b> (STF) is {{a popular}} {{adaptive}} estimation method to effectively deal with state estimation for linear and nonlinear dynamic systems with inaccurate models or sudden change of state. The key of the STF {{is to use a}} time-variant fading factor, which can be evaluated based on the current measurement innovation in real time, to forcefully correct one step state prediction error covariance. The strong <b>tracking</b> <b>filtering</b> technology has been extensively applied in many practical systems, but the theoretical analysis is highly lacking. In an effort to better understand STF, a novel analysis framework is developed for the strong <b>tracking</b> <b>filtering</b> and some new problems are discussed for the first time. For this, we propose a new perspective that correcting the state prediction error covariance by using the fading factor can be thought of directly modifying the state model by correcting the covariance of the process noise. Based on this proposed point of view, the conditions for the STF function to be effective are deeply analyzed in a certain linear dynamic system. Meanwhile, issues of false alarm and alarm failure are also briefly discussed for the strong <b>tracking</b> <b>filtering</b> function.

30|$|One {{effective}} {{approach that}} does not suffer from these problems is known as an α- β- γ filter. These are simple <b>tracking</b> <b>filters</b> that assume constant acceleration during the sampling interval [8]. Because of their small computational load, they have been employed in various tracking systems [9 - 12]. Moreover, {{there are only three}} design parameters (the α, β, and γ gains), from which the performance indices can be analytically calculated. Consequently, it is simpler to design an appropriate α- β- γ filter than to construct other <b>tracking</b> <b>filters</b> (e.g., the Kalman filter). Many researchers have studied the analytical performance and design methodology of optimal gains in the α- β- γ filter by assuming simple and practical motion models [8, 13 - 17]. Based on these fundamental studies, recent work has investigated effective gain-setting algorithms for various maneuvering targets [18, 19]. Simple gain-setting algorithms have enabled the effectiveness of α- β- γ filters to be verified in various real-world applications, such as motor position control [9] and human fall detection [10].|$|R
