This included establishing procedures to coordinate such requests between facilities; requiring controllers to instruct pilots to self-announce on the VFR corridor frequency if they are unable to immediately enter Class B airspace; adding information to area Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts reminding pilots to use the self-announce frequency; and ensuring that pilots are provided with <b>traffic</b> <b>advisories</b> if they are in contact with a controller.|$|E

25|$|On August 4, 1968, a Convair CV-580, flying as North Central Airlines flight 261, {{collided}} {{in mid-air}} with a privately owned Cessna 150. The Cessna cabin remained {{attached to the}} Convair's forward baggage compartment. The Convair made a safe emergency landing at Milwaukee. The three Cessna occupants were killed. The Cessna was on a VFR flight from Lombard, Illinois to Sheboygan County Memorial Airport in Sheboygan Falls. It was determined that {{the inability of the}} Convair 580 flight crew to detect the Cessna 150 visually in sufficient time to take evasive action, despite having been provided with three radar <b>traffic</b> <b>advisories,</b> caused the crash. Visual detection capabilities were reduced by the heavy accumulation of insect smears on the windows of the Convair. Visibility was further reduced by haze, smoke and sunglare, and by the inconspicuous colour and lack of relative motion of the Cessna.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} methodology for traffic awareness displays for helicopters and other vertical/short takeoff aircraft was developed. Pilots of vertical/short takeoff aircraft wil 1 require more traffic information than would pilots of conventional aircraft to avoid both other vertical/short takeoff traffic and conventional traffic. The BF Goodrich Skywatch <b>traffic</b> <b>advisory</b> display {{was used as}} a candidate display to develop a procedure for evaluating the usefulness of such displays. Four high-time helicopter pilots participated in a 16 -hour flight evaluation. They flew a closed circuit in the San Francisco Bay Area. In one-half of the flights the evaluation pilot had the <b>traffic</b> <b>advisory</b> display as an aid in detecting and locating traffic. In {{the other half of the}} flights the <b>traffic</b> <b>advisory</b> display was not available to the evaluation pilot. Data examined include measures of <b>traffic</b> <b>advisory</b> display performance and pilot performance in detecting traffic, as well as subjective workload and situation awareness data. The <b>traffic</b> <b>advisory</b> system did not help the pilots to detect more traffic. The importance of detection to traffic awareness is discussed...|$|R

[...] The DOTS, upgraded and frequently referred to as [...] "DOTS +", permits airlines to save fuel by flying random routes, in contrast to structured routes, and permits the air traffic controller to achieve lateral spacing requirements more efficiently. [...] The DOTS generates flexible oceanic tracks that are optimized for best airspace utilization and best time/fuel efficiency. [...] Flexible tracks are updated twice a day using forecasted winds aloft and separation (vertical and lateral) requirements. [...] The DOTS oceanic traffic display gives a visual presentation of tracks and weather. [...] The DOTS sends <b>traffic</b> <b>advisories</b> and track advisories to users and receives aircraft progress reports from the commercial communications service providers (CCSP). [...] These external data exchanges are achieved through interfaces with the National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN) Packet Switch Network (PSN) for Position Reports, Air Traffic Management (ATM) messages, Pilot Reports (PIREPS), and the Anchorage FDP2000. [...] An interface to the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) will improve coordination between the oceanic and domestic Traffic Flow Management (TFM) systems/activities. [...] The DOTS Weather Server, installed at the ATCSCC, receives National Weather Service (NWS) wind and temperature data via the Weather and Radar Processor / Weather Information Network Server (WARP/WINS) system.
