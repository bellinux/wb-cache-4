50|$|The {{advantage}} of tipped tools {{is only a}} small insert of the cutting material is needed to provide the cutting ability. The small size makes manufacturing of the insert easier than making a solid tool of the same material. This also reduces cost because the tool holder can be made of a less-expensive and tougher material. In some situations a <b>tipped</b> <b>tool</b> is better than its solid counterpart because it combines the toughness of the tool holder with the hardness of the insert.|$|E
50|$|Carbide is more {{expensive}} per unit than other typical tool materials, and it is more brittle, making it susceptible to chipping and breaking. To offset these problems, the carbide cutting tip itself is often {{in the form of}} a small insert for a larger <b>tipped</b> <b>tool</b> whose shank is made of another material, usually carbon tool steel. This gives the benefit of using carbide at the cutting interface without the high cost and brittleness of making the entire tool out of carbide. Most modern face mills use carbide inserts, as well as many lathe tools and endmills. In recent decades, though, solid-carbide endmills have also become more commonly used, wherever the application's characteristics make the pros (such as shorter cycle times) outweigh the cons (mentioned above).|$|E
50|$|Incremental {{sheet forming}} (or ISF, {{also known as}} Single Point Forming) is a sheet metal forming {{technique}} where a sheet is formed into the final workpiece {{by a series of}} small incremental deformations. However, studies have shown that it can be applied to polymer and composite sheets too. Generally, the sheet is formed by a round <b>tipped</b> <b>tool,</b> typically 5 to 20mm in diameter. The tool, which can be attached to a CNC machine, a robot arm or similar, indents into the sheet by about 1 mm and follows a contour for the desired part. It then indents further and draws the next contour for the part into the sheet and continues to do this until the full part is formed. ISF can be divided into variants depending on the number of contact points between tool, sheet and die (in case there is any). The term Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) is used when {{the opposite side of the}} sheet is supported by a faceplate and Two Point Incremental Forming (TPIF) when a full or partial die supports the sheet.|$|E

Residual stress fields induced were measured using incremental hole drilling. Compressive residual stress at the surface was- 78 MPa increasing to- 204 MPa {{at a depth of}} 220 μm. Fatigue tests were performed on peened, unpeened, pristine and scribed samples. Scratches reduced fatigue lives by factors up to 22 and LSP restored 74 % of pristine life. Unpeened samples fractured at the scratches however peened samples did not fracture at the scratches but instead on the untreated rear face of the samples. Crack initiation still occurred {{at the root of the}} scribes on or close to the first load cycle in both peened and unpeened samples. In peened samples the crack at the root of the scribe did not progress to failure, suggesting that residual stress did not affect initiation behaviour but instead FCGR.

40|$|Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) is a {{flexible}} sheet forming process which {{is characterized by}} the continuous stepwise forming of a blank sheet through the movement of a small forming tool. In contrast to processes such as spinning and shear forming, incremental sheet forming (ISF) can create both symmetric and asymmetric shapes. Customized three-dimensional parts can be made by the CNC-controlled motion of a hemispherical <b>tipped</b> <b>tool</b> over a metal, polymer or composite sheet. Using the incremental forming method, small series production of sheet components with high customization is possible within short lead times. In this dieless forming technology the time and cost of designing, manufacturing and storing dies for small series production of sheet metal parts can be reduced. In order to allow processing high strength materials or materials with limited formability a Laser Assisted variant of SPIF has been developed (LASPIF). In this process a warm spot is generated {{in the vicinity of the}} contact between the forming tool and the workpiece. By creating a local hot spot around the contact point between tool and sheet, process forces can be reduced while forming limits are increased for most materials. Furthermore, a local hot and ductile spot in a rigid cold sheet results in more local deformation of the sheet and therefore increased control and accuracy. The LASPIF process has proven to offer advantages in terms of increased formability, reduced inaccuracy due to undesirable elastic springback and reduced process forces. However, the use of a laser beam adds several degrees of freedom to the forming process in comparison to single point incremental forming at room temperature. Enhancing the formability and accuracy achievable with LASPIF requires a strategic choice for the many process parameters involved. The work reported in this dissertation aims to investigate the relations between the different process parameters and the resulting process output in order to better understand the process mechanisms under heat-assisted forming conditions. For this purpose, it is necessary to model the process and to explore the influence of the respective process parameters. Apart from finite element modelling, a design of experiments (DOE) is used to define optimal laser scanning and laser-tool offset conditions to maximize formability of the material. Moreover, an in-depth study on the use of tailored microstructures through local, thermally induced hardening or softening transformations to influence the LASPIF process performance has been performed. Furthermore, the possibility of using a laser for post stress relief-annealing of SPIF formed parts to remove residual stresses of SPIF formed part was investigated. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In our {{previous}} work, a scale-up fabrication approach to cost effectively manufacturing nano-gratings over large {{area has been}} developed through diamond turning by using a multi-tip diamond tool fabricated by Focus Ion Beam. The objective {{of this study is}} to gain an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of machining nanostructures on single crystal copper through diamond turning when using a single tip and a multi-tip nanoscale diamond tool. For this purpose atomistic models of a single <b>tip</b> <b>tool</b> for multi-pass cutting and a multi-tip tool for single-pass cutting were built, respectively. The nature of the cutting chip formation, dislocation nucleation and propagation, cutting forces, and temperature distribution during nanometric cutting processes were studied through MD simulations. Results show that nanostructure generation process at steady cutting stage was governed by a strong localization of the dislocation movement and the dynamic equilibrium of chip-tool contact area. Except the apparent improvement of machining efficiency that proportional to the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> numbers, the nano-grooves generated by multi-tip tool also have higher centre symmetry than those machined by single <b>tip</b> <b>tool.</b> While the average tangential cutting force per tip were calculated all around 33. 3 nN, a larger normal cutting force per tip being 54. 1 nN was observed when using a multi-tip tool. A concept of atomistic equivalent temperature was proposed and used to analysis the important features of temperature distribution during the machining process. The advantage, disadvantage and applicability of diamond turning using multi-tip tool were discussed in comparison with those of using single-tip tool. The findings suggest that diamond turning using multi-tip tool might be more applicable than using single <b>tip</b> <b>tool</b> when apply to scale-up fabrication of periodic nanostructures...|$|R
40|$|During {{manufacture}} and maintenance the fuselage skin of aircraft {{are susceptible to}} damage {{in the form of}} scratches. Normally not considered to be of major concern to aircraft structural integrity some airlines discovered fatigue cracks had initiated at the root of scratches. Crack propagation was in the through thickness direction and if left untreated could cause rapid decompression of the passenger cabin. Standard repair methodology requires patches be riveted around scratch damage and in extreme cases could require entire replacement of affected skin panels. Laser shock peening (LSP) is an emerging surface treatment that has been shown to improve fatigue performance of safety critical components by inducing a surface layer of compressive residual stress. In this work LSP was applied along the scratch damage in an effort to restore pristine fatigue performance. The aim of the project was to model the effect on fatigue crack growth rate of residual stress fields induced via LSP and to validate predictions by comparison to experimental test results. The scratches were recreated under controlled laboratory conditions using a diamond <b>tipped</b> <b>tool.</b> This process allowed creation of reproducible V shaped scribes to controlled depth, wall angle and root radius. Scribes of depth 50 and 150 μm with root radius 5 μm were created in dogbone shaped samples of 2 mm thick 2024 ‐T 351 clad aluminium. Samples were tested in fatigue at an R = 0. 1 and maximum stress of 200 MPa. The scribe damage reduced fatigue life compared to the pristine material by a factor of 22. Scribed samples were processed using LSP treatment from different providers that created known residual stress fields in the material. The fatigue life of scribed samples after peening varied from a further decrease to a 13 times increase dependent on the residual stress field induced. An elastic‐plastic crack closure based finite element model was created to determine the effect on stress intensity factor and stress ratio of residual stress. Fatigue lives calculated were within a factor of 2 of experimental lives. It was predicted that crack closure was present during up to 80 % of the applied load cycle due to the compressive residual stress field. However plasticity induced crack closure actually reduced after peening because the compressive residual stress field induced a smaller plastic zone at the crack tip and hence reduced the plastic wake. A residual stress based fatigue life sensitivity study was performed to optimise the profile of the residual stress field for improved fatigue performance. The required profile was created in test samples using LSP. The fatigue life of peened samples increased by a factor of up to 15 however pristine life was not fully recovered. A restriction imposed by the industrial application was peening applied to one face only. This created an unbalanced stress field that resulted in sample distortion to maintain equilibrium. The distortion induced out of plane bending stresses during testing and caused premature crack initiation on the unpeened face. However using interrupted fatigue tests it was found that although crack initiation also occurred {{at the root of the}} scribes the cracks were arrested after 24 μm of propagation. This was consistent with the findings of the crack growth prediction model...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical damages, like scratches, are {{commonly}} detected on {{the surfaces of}} aircraft components and structures. They can be accidentally introduced during machining or maintenance operations or {{be the result of}} wear and impacts during aircraft service. Under the action of service loads, such mechanical damage can generate fatigue cracks reducing the component fatigue life and compromising the aircraft structural integrity. The evaluation of the effect of scratches and other small mechanical defects on the structure and component fatigue lives is therefore necessary to define an inspections programme and ensure the structural safety. Conventional fatigue life prediction methods generally consider scratches tents of microns deep too shallow to appreciably affect the fatigue performances of structural components. However the discovery of the scribe marks on fuselage joints disproved that prediction. In fact several commercial airlines discovered during inspections that aircraft which have been repainted showed multiple scratches on the fuselage skin along longitudinal and circumferential joints. Those scratches, referred to scribe marks, appear to have been caused by use of sharp tools during sealant removal process prior repainting. Scratches less than 200 μm deep were capable of severely reducing the fatigue life performance under service load rendering some aircraft beyond economical repair. This thesis investigates the fatigue performances of 2024 -T 531 aluminium alloy sheets weakened by mechanically machined scratches. 2 mm thick clad and unclad samples were scribed at their gauge section using a diamond <b>tipped</b> <b>tool.</b> The scribing process produced very regular rounded V-shaped notches with an included angle of 60 ° across the sample width. Scratches from 25 μm to 185 μm deep, with 5 μm, 25 μm and 50 μm root radii were cut on the sample surfaces. Scribed sample were subsequently fatigue tested under constant amplitude tensile and bending load with a stress ratio of R= 0. 1 at a maximum stress of 200 MPa. Scribes were found to reduce the fatigue life of tension and bending samples up to 97 % compared to that of smooth unscribed specimens. Both scribe shape and size affected the fatigue life of tensile and bending aluminium samples. The sharper and the larger the notch, the shorter the fatigue life. Post failure fractography investigations were performed on sample fracture surfaces by means of optical and scanning electron microscope. Crack nucleation sites, fracture morphology and peculiar features left during crack propagation were analysed. Finally crack propagation data under different loading conditions were obtained by striation counting performed on fracture surfaces. Multiple crack initiation occurred at scribe roots usually from inclusions, defects or weak points along the root. The number and density of crack nucleation sites appeared to be determined by the scribe; increasing for notches with larger stress concentrations. Scribe geometry did not affect the fatigue growth rate but the propagation life for cracks deeper than 50 - 100 μm was influenced. Cracks nucleated from scribe marks showed a typical short crack behaviour growing faster than long cracks with the same linear elastic stress intensity factor. Finite element calculations were performed on scribed samples evaluating how the presence of scribes altered the local stress and strain fields. Monotonic elastic and elastic-plastic and cyclic elastic-plastic analyses were carried out under tensile and bending loads. Local elastic-plastic stress and strain fields in the neighbourhood of different scribes were determined by the notch shape and size. According to the occurrence of mechanical similitude conditions, scribes with the same shape but different size showed similar plastic zone and stress and strain distributions. A stabilised cyclic plastic zone was developed just at the root of scribes with a ratio between the root radius and depth ρ/d≤ 0. 2. No correlations were observed between the occurrence of a stabilised cyclic plastic zone and the sample nucleation lives defined as the number of cycles to obtain an initial crack 50 μm deep from the notch root. Traditional fatigue life prediction methods, based on the notch sensitivity factor, were not able to correctly characterise the effect of scratches few tens of microns deep on the fatigue life of 2024 -T 351 aluminium alloy components. An approach based on the critical distance theory was developed to characterise the total fatigue life reduction produced by the introduction of scribes relating the fatigue live to a critical stress range Δσlm. The critical stress range was capable of describing the effect of the elastic stress distribution produced by dissimilar notches on the nucleation and propagation of fatigue crack considering also the effect of the variation of the fatigue load nominal applied stress...|$|E
