5|$|Almost 35,000 South Australians {{served in}} the First World War. This number {{amounted}} to 8.5% of the South Australian population at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> 37.7% of men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 44. Of those who served, over 5,000 South Australians died. In response to these deaths, Archibald Peake, the premier of South Australia, asked the state parliament to fund a memorial commemorating the victory and the sacrifice of those who had fought and fallen. The motion was presented in March 1919, and it received unanimous support in the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council. With the passing of this motion, the South Australian Government became the first in Australia to elect to build a memorial to the soldiers of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|As of 2001, {{there were}} 18,878 homes in El Hatillo, of which 13,545 were occupied; the {{remaining}} homes were either unoccupied, occasionally used, under construction, or for sale. An average of four people made up each household. Regarding wealth, 74.7% {{of the population}} were above poverty level, 21.5% were poor, and 3.8% were extremely poor. According to the 2001 census, each household in the municipality received an average of 1,316,906 Venezuelan bolívares (1316.906 bolívares fuertes) per month, equal to US$1,832 at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> US$21,984 per year.|$|E

5|$|It remains likely, however, {{that it was}} {{constructed}} by Gundulf, based primarily {{on the history of}} the land holdings during the period. After the founding of the abbey, which Gundulf granted some of his lands around West Malling, St Leonard's became the administrative centre of Gundulf's remaining estates, before also being given to the nuns a few years later, shortly after his death in 1108. In practice, probably only Gundulf would therefore have had <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> motivation to build such a keep during this period.|$|E
5|$|Nikephoros appears for {{the first}} time in Emperor Basil II's Bulgarian wars, in 999/1000, 1000/1 or 1002, {{depending}} on the source. At the time he was a protospatharios, and along with the patrikios Theodorokanos, he commanded a campaign deep into Bulgarian lands. Setting out from Mosynopolis, the two generals crossed the Balkan Mountains and captured the old Bulgarian capitals of Pliska and Great Preslav, along with Little Preslav. They then plundered the Dobruja, left behind garrisons and returned to their base. It is unclear whether he was already the military governor (strategos) of Philippopolis at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> was appointed to it after the successful conclusion of the campaign, as John Skylitzes reports, when Theodorokanos, who is known to have previously held the post, retired due to his advanced age.|$|E
5|$|Squadron Leader Harris of 149 Squadron and Wing Commander Kellett {{were the}} only {{experienced}} combat leaders. However, Kellett had not flown with No. 9 or 37 Squadrons as a group and {{had never had a}} chance to practice formation flying or bombing with these squadrons. He had not been given <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> opportunity to discuss or formulate a plan for bombing naval targets, whether as a group, squadron, or even as flight sections. Nor had he even been able to discuss or pass on any tactical advice about what the formation should do in the event of fighter attack. He was given command of an incoherent group of squadrons which were highly inexperienced. For the 18 December mission, 24 Wellington Bombers from No. 9, 37 and 149 Squadrons were given to Kellet. The British bombers flew in a diamond shape formation.|$|E

5|$|The {{group of}} animals most {{integral}} to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places in the Everglades stay submerged {{from one year to}} the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal community as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also {{play an important role in}} the food chain. Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E
5|$|A {{protracted}} South Florida {{labor dispute}} between the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) and growers of tomatoes in the region expanded to include Burger King and other major fast food companies, including McDonald's and Yum! Brands. In 2001, the CIW sought a pay raise for tomato pickers in the region and, starting with its Boot the Bell campaign aimed at Yum! subsidiary Taco Bell, began to target the chains with protests, letter writing campaigns, and petitions demanding that the companies purchase tomatoes only from suppliers who agree to the pay increase. The campaign, which eventually attracted the support of religious groups, labor organizations, student groups and anti-slavery activists, {{became known as the}} Campaign for Fair Food with a stated goal to increase the wages of the pickers by 1¢ per pound picked above the 45¢ paid per bucket at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> about 77¢ for each 32-pound (14.5kg) bucket in 2005 US dollars. In 2005, McDonald's Corporation and Yum! signed agreements acquiescing to the group's purchasing demands, although implementation was put on hold due to threats by the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange to fine its members $100,000 if they complied; however, Burger King corporate parent Burger King Brands declined to enter into a similar agreement with the group.|$|E

5|$|Devil's Den {{was located}} at the extreme left of the III Corps line, manned by the large brigade (six regiments and two {{companies}} of sharpshooters, 2,200 men in all) of Brigadier General J. H. Hobart Ward, in Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division. It was {{the southern end of}} Houck's Ridge, a modest elevation on the northwest side of Plum Run Valley, made distinctive by piles of huge boulders. These boulders were not the direct avenue of approach used by the Confederates. The 3rd Arkansas and the 1st Texas drove through Rose Woods and hit Ward's line head-on. His troops had lacked <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> inclination to erect breastworks, and for over an hour both sides participated in a standup fight of unusual ferocity. In the first 30 minutes, the 20th Indiana lost more than half of its men. Its colonel, John Wheeler, was killed and its lieutenant colonel wounded. The 86th New York also lost its commander. The commander of the 3rd Arkansas fell wounded, one of 182 casualties in his regiment.|$|E
5|$|Homo sapiens sapiens, or modern man, came to Somerset {{during the}} Early Upper Palaeolithic. There is {{evidence}} of occupation of four Mendip caves 35,000 to 30,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, {{it is probable that}} Somerset was deserted as the area experienced tundra conditions. Evidence was found in Gough's Cave of deposits of human bone dating from around 12,500 years ago. The bones were defleshed and probably ritually buried though perhaps related to cannibalism being practised in the area at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> making skull cups or storage containers. Somerset {{was one of the first}} areas of future England settled following the end of Younger Dryas phase of the last Ice Age c.8000 BC. Cheddar Man is the name given to the remains of a human male found in Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge. He is Britain's oldest complete human skeleton. The remains date from about 7150 BC, and it appears that he died a violent death. Somerset is thought to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from about 6000 BCE; Mesolithic artefacts have been found in more than 70 locations. Mendip caves were used as burial places, with between 50 and 100 skeletons being found in Aveline's Hole. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BCE, there {{is evidence of}} farming.|$|E
