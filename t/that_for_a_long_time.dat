They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|The British bands Seventh Angel and Detritus {{introduced}} Christian thrash metal to Europe. Seventh Angel {{were considered}} to be thrash metal pioneers, and their albums achieved mainstream distribution through the Music for Nations label. Cross Rhythms states <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> Seventh Angel {{were considered to}} be the best metal act in the UK. Seventh Angel also has included aspects of doom metal on some recordings. In the 1990s, New Mexico based Ultimatum and Oklahoman group called Eternal Decision gained some attention, the latter with its thrash and groove metal style. The 1997 album Eternal Decision hit the record stores in the U.S. and 16 other countries, achieving considerable acclaim and providing the band with even more notice.|$|E

25|$|According to Chertok, {{after the}} U.S. {{developed}} its Space Shuttle programme, the Soviet military became suspicious {{that it could}} be used for military purposes, due to its enormous payload, several times that of previous U.S. launch vehicles. The Soviet government asked the TsNIIMash (ЦНИИМАШ, Central Institute of Machine-building, a major player in defense analysis) for an expert opinion. Institute director, Yuri Mozzhorin, recalls <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> the institute could not envisage a civilian payload large enough to require a vehicle of that capacity.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} argue <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> {{the collective}} security doctrine was a sincere and unanimous {{position of the}} Soviet leadership, pursuing a purely defensive line, whereas others contend that {{from the very beginning}} the Soviet Union intended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, collective security being merely tactical counter to some unfriendly German moves. However, perhaps Moscow sought to avoid a great war in Europe because it was not strong enough to fight an offensive war; but there was much disagreement over the policy between Litvinov and Molotov about how to attain that goal, and Stalin alternated between their positions, initially pursuing both contradictory lines simultaneously quite early and abandoning collective security only at some point in 1939.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} of the Roman vicariate, as described above, rested largely on usage; it was not constructed as a compact whole at one single time. The most important ordinances respecting it were issued at various times {{during the course of}} the last two centuries, showing <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> the inadequacy of its organization, especially as regards the great length of time necessary for the settlement of matters brought before it, had been severely felt, more, however, by the subordinates of the vicariate than by its higher officials. It could not be said that its methods of business were in any way compatible with modern ideas as to efficient management. The lack of harmony was doubly evident after the entire central administration of the Church had been reformed by the Constitution Sapienti Consilio, of 29 June 1908. During the past various difficulties had stood in the way of a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate. Not the least of these was the lack of space in the former office of the vicariate. It was not until after the purchase of the Palazzo Mariscotti near San Francesco alle Stimmate, which was assigned to the cardinal vicar and his officials and arranged for their use, that Pius X was able to carry out his long cherished plan for a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate.|$|E

Cameron eventually reveals himself. He had murdered Sharon's ex-boyfriend (and Cassie's biological father) Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), who was visiting town, and hid the body in Sharon's car trunk. Cameron's crimes are revealed; he is jailed, absolving Sharon of wrongdoing. Although Sharon did not actually murder Cameron, Case praised the storyline and called Sharon a heroine.
