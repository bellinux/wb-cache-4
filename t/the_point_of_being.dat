5|$|Today, {{the legend}} of Henry is {{challenged}} by historians to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> labelled as pure imagination. Completely invented saints were not exceptional in Europe, and in the lack of evidence of either the crusade or Henry, that possibility may not be fully denied.|$|E
5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{had arisen}} before the Giro {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that many of 's sponsors in Kazakhstan had not paid their full obligations to the team, and that the riders had therefore not been paid their full salaries to that point in the season. In protest, the team wore new jerseys beginning with this stage, that had the names of those underpaying sponsors faded out to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> unreadable.|$|E

5|$|The Northwest Territories {{political}} system used {{at this time}} was run by an early form of consensus government. Candidates stood for election independent of the political parties that exist in other provinces and territories and the federal level within Canada. The government had not yet developed to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a Responsible government as the majority of members were appointed and not elected. The district was served by three representatives during its eight-year history.|$|E
5|$|The {{free zinc}} ion is a {{powerful}} Lewis acid up to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.|$|E
5|$|Dendrocollybia is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Tricholomataceae of the order Agaricales. It is a {{monotypic}} genus, containing the single species Dendrocollybia racemosa, {{commonly known as the}} branched Collybia or the branched shanklet. The somewhat rare species is found in the Northern Hemisphere, including the Pacific Northwest region of western North America, and Europe, where it is included in several Regional Red Lists. It usually grows on the decaying fruit bodies of other agarics—such as Lactarius and Russula—although the host mushrooms may be decayed to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> difficult to recognize.|$|E

5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown–roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E
5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, even to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2005, Cotto {{faced the}} last man to beat him as an amateur, former Olympic gold {{medalist}} Mohamed Abdulaev from Uzbekistan. As amateurs, Abdulaev eliminated Cotto from {{the first round of}} the 2000 Sydney Olympics. This time they met as professionals in New York City's Madison Square Garden. Before the beginning of the fight Cotto received a positive ovation from the public. During the first round Miguel went on the offensive scoring hits on Abdullaev's head and body while he was in a defensive stance. In the fourth round a left hook by Miguel hurt Abdullaev, who proceeded to focus his hits on Cotto's body. Abdullaev's offense was effective in the sixth and seventh rounds and as a result of this Cotto assumed a defensive stance. Following the eighth round Abdullaev's eye was swollen to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> almost entirely closed. In the ninth round following accurate punches by Cotto the fight's referee paused the fight and asked the ringside doctor to examine Abdullaev's eye. After being examined by the doctor Abdullaev indicated to the referee that he could not continue, this way Cotto retained the Welterweight division championship.|$|E

5|$|Shaw is {{the only}} {{religious}} believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.|$|E
5|$|Coastal areas {{provide a}} {{constant}} food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures {{of the genus}} Cathartes—the turkey vulture (C. aura), the lesser yellow-headed vulture (C. burrovianus), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (C. melambrotus)—to carcasses. The Cathartes vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with {{the efficiency of the}} larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. Black vultures (Coragyps atratus), king vultures (Sarcoramphus papa) and even mammalian scavengers may sometimes track Cathartes vultures for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it {{plays an important role in}} its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} has interbred {{extensively}} with the eastern wolf producing a hybrid population termed Great Lakes boreal wolves. Unlike {{the red and}} eastern wolf, the gray wolf does not readily interbreed with coyotes. Nevertheless, coyote genetic markers {{have been found in}} some wild isolated gray wolf populations in the southern United States. Gray wolf Y-chromosomes have also been found in Texan coyote haplotypes. In tests performed on a Texan canid of ambiguous species, mtDNA analysis showed that it was a coyote, though subsequent tests revealed that it was a coyote–gray wolf hybrid sired by a male Mexican gray wolf. In 2013, a captive breeding experiment in Utah between gray wolves and western coyotes produced six hybrids through artificial insemination, making this the very first hybridization case between pure coyotes and northwestern gray wolves. At six months of age, the hybrids were closely monitored and were shown to display both physical and behavioral characteristics from both species. Although hybridization between wolves and golden jackals has never been observed, evidence of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in Bulgaria. Although there is no genetic evidence of gray wolf-jackal hybridization in the Caucasus Mountains, there have been cases where otherwise genetically pure golden jackals have displayed remarkably gray wolf-like phenotypes, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> mistaken for wolves by trained biologists.|$|E
50|$|The false scorpionfish appears {{very similar}} to the true scorpionfish, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> {{originally}} <b>being</b> described as a species of Scorpaena. This similarity protects the false scorpionfish from predators, which would not prey upon the very venomous true scorpionfish.|$|R
