5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} Mary Lincoln whispered to Lincoln, {{who was holding}} her hand, [...] "What will Miss Harris <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hanging on to you so?" [...] Lincoln replied, [...] "She won't think {{anything}} about it". In following years these words were traditionally considered Lincoln's last, though N.W. Miner, a family friend, claimed in 1882 that Mary Lincoln told him that Lincoln's last words expressed a wish to visit Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|Innis {{also tried}} to defend {{universities}} from political and economic pressures. He believed that independent universities, as centres of critical thought, were essential {{to the survival of}} Western civilization. His intellectual disciple and university colleague, Marshall McLuhan, lamented Innis's premature death as a disastrous loss for human understanding. McLuhan wrote: [...] "I am pleased to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own book The Gutenberg Galaxy as a footnote to the observations of Innis {{on the subject of the}} psychic and social consequences, first of writing then of printing." ...|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{was largely}} a self-taught musician, and his {{approach}} was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as [...] "by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored... produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony". McCartney commented, [...] "I prefer to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> approach to music as... rather like the primitive cave artists, who drew without training." ...|$|E

Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, should I say, often irritated? If you feel like it, you can download the sound file of my new single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message {{and let me know}} what you <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> new song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
500|$|The real Abagnale {{never saw}} his father again after he ran away from home. Spielberg [...] "wanted to {{continue}} to have that connection where Frank kept trying to please his father; by making him proud of him; by seeing him in the uniform, the Pan-American uniform". However, Abagnale praised the idea. [...] "Even though I didn't see my dad again, every night after living a brilliant day and meeting many women, and making much money, I'd come back alone to a hotel room and I would just <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mom and dad and fantasize about getting them back together again, and cry. It's the justification of a fantasy." [...] Carl Hanratty (portrayed by Tom Hanks) is based on FBI agent Joseph Shea. In the shooting script the character {{was referred to as}} Joseph Shea, but was changed to Carl Hanratty for unknown reasons.|$|E

500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2016 Taylor {{announced}} that he cancelled his upcoming February 2017 concert in the Philippines. He stated that although [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> music as being particularly political but sometimes one is called upon to make a political stand." [...] The cancellation was in protest of alleged extrajudicial killings by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011 he apologised to sumo fans {{on behalf}} of the Sumo Association for the {{cancellation}} of the March tournament in Osaka due to an ongoing investigation into match-fixing by 14 wrestlers and stablemasters. [...] In that tournament Kaiō would have been hoping to break Chiyonofuji's record of 1045 career wins, of which he was at that time just ten shy. He told reporters, [...] "I can no longer <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> personal career. I must focus on what I should do for the sumo world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sturgis died at his London {{house in}} Knightsbridge on 13 April 1904, aged 55, {{after a long}} illness. [...] Sturgis was cremated and his ashes were buried in Compton Cemetery, near his country house in Surrey. [...] Henry James wrote to Sturgis's widow of her husband's [...] "beautiful, noble, {{stainless}} memory, without the shadow upon him, or {{the shadow of a}} shadow, of a single grossness or meanness or ugliness – the world's dust on the nature of thousands of men. Everything that was high and charming in him comes out as one holds on to him, and when I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friendship of so many years with him I see it all as fairness and felicity." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is also {{difficult}} to classify Tyler {{in terms of}} themes; as she herself notes, “I don’t <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work in terms of themes. [...] I’m just trying to tell a story.” [...] Tyler goes on to say, “Any large 'questions of life’ that emerge in my novels are accidental—not a reason for writing the novel {{in the first place}} but either (1) questions that absorb my characters, quite apart from me, or (2) on occasion, questions that may be thematic to my own life at the moment, even if I’m not entirely aware of them. Answers, if they come, come from the characters’ experiences, not from mine, and I often find myself viewing those answers with a sort of distant, bemused surprise.” ...|$|E
2500|$|During a 1971 {{conference at}} Columbia University, a {{creative}} writing student asked Borges what he regarded as [...] "a writer's duty to his time". Borges replied, [...] "I think a writer's {{duty is to}} be a writer, and if he can be a good writer, he is doing his duty. Besides, I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own opinions as being superficial. For example, I am a Conservative, I hate the Communists, I hate the Nazis, I hate the anti-Semites, and so on; but I don't allow these opinions to find their way into my writings—except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the Six Days' War. Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments. Everybody knows my opinions, but as for my dreams and my stories, they should be allowed their full freedom, I think. I don't want to intrude into them, I'm writing fiction, not fables." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carlisle is a {{supporter}} of several causes. She has been an ardent supporter of LGBT rights, which she made public after her son, James, came out to her at age fourteen. Carlisle is also a vegetarian and {{a supporter}} of animal rights. She and her bandmates were the first stars to pose for PETA's [...] "Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" [...] campaign in 1990. In a 2013 interview, she talked {{about going back to}} vegetarianism after a long break, stating that [...] "I fell off the vegetarian wagon and never felt good about it. I wouldn't let myself <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> plate of meat as an animal, but I knew deep inside it was, and actually it was gross, especially chicken. I was full of shame. Then I started practicing yoga, which is all about nonviolence, and realized eating meat isn't compatible with that. Now I teach yoga, and I'm so full of pride not to support factory farms and to be socially responsible." [...] She contributed her song [...] "Bless the Beasts and the Children" [...] to the album Tame Yourself to benefit PETA.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{deciding}} {{to become a}} full time storyteller, Irwin worked as a stand-up comedian [...] "for a few minutes". [...] During this time, Irwin won the Farber Invitational stand-up competition at the Punchline comedy club in Atlanta. [...] However, Irwin came {{to see that the}} days of storytelling comedians had passed. Irwin also realized that his style of performance was at odds with the main venue available to comedians today: comedy clubs. (Irwin joking refers to comedy clubs as [...] "evil, smelly places".) [...] Some of his stories are an hour in length, and Irwin notes, [...] "here was a time when comedians could do that but they can't anymore because the clubs give them three minutes, and they are timing the laughs per minute." [...] Using storytelling as a theatrical form allows Irwin to create more fully drawn characters and to explore darker subject matters as well. [...] "Although I like to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> storytelling as funny, I can have these serious moments. I’m not depending on the audience to laugh the whole time... I hope there’s content with the form." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopkins {{was born}} on New Year's Eve 1937, in Margam, a suburb of Port Talbot, Glamorgan. His parents were Annie Muriel (née Yeates) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker. He stated his father’s working class values have always underscored his life. “Whenever I get a feeling that I may be special or different, I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father and I {{remember}} his hands – his hardened, broken hands". His school days were unproductive; he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School in Pontypool. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at Cowbridge Grammar School in the Vale of Glamorgan. In a 2002 interview he stated: [...] "I was a poor learner, which left me open to ridicule and gave me an inferiority complex. I grew up absolutely convinced I was stupid." [...] In desperation, his parents sent him off to boarding school, where the headmaster {{told him he was}} [...] "hopeless" [...] and he developed a [...] "sheer contempt for authority." [...] He stumbled into acting at 17 with a YMCA group (his one line: [...] "").|$|E

2500|$|McLuhan met Corinne Lewis (1912–2008) in St. Louis, {{a teacher}} and {{aspiring}} actress from Fort Worth, Texas, and they were married on August 4, 1939. They spent 1939–40 in Cambridge, where he completed his master's degree (awarded in January 1940) and began {{to work on his}} doctoral dissertation on Thomas Nashe and the verbal arts. While the McLuhans were in England, war had broken out in Europe. For this reason, he obtained permission to complete and submit his dissertation from the United States, without having to return to Cambridge for an oral defence. In 1940, the McLuhans returned to Saint Louis University, where he continued teaching and they started a family. He was awarded a Ph.D. in December 1943. [...] He next taught at Assumption College in Windsor, Ontario from 1944 to 1946, then moved to Toronto in 1946 where he joined the faculty of St. Michael's College, a Catholic college of the University of Toronto. Hugh Kenner was one of his students and Canadian economist and communications scholar Harold Innis was a university colleague who had a strong influence on his work. [...] McLuhan wrote in 1964: [...] "I am pleased to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own book The Gutenberg Galaxy as a footnote to the observations of Innis {{on the subject of the}} psychic and social consequences, first of writing then of printing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brando {{acknowledged}} {{his professional}} decline, writing later, [...] "Some {{of the films}} I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't. Some, like The Night of the Following Day, I made only for the money; others, like Candy, I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down... In some ways I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> middle age as the Fuck You Years." [...] Candy was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand {{and based on the}} 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the movie satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. The Washington Post observed: [...] "Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents." [...] In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando [...] "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and others like him had become [...] "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations." [...] In an earlier review of The Appaloosa in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was [...] "trapped in another dog of a movie... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner." [...] Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film Listen to Me Marlon, [...] "They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot." ...|$|E
