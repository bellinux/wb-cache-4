5|$|Del Potro {{began his}} 2015 season with wrist pain {{and was not}} sure whether he would play Sydney and the Australian Open. However, {{at the last minute}} he decided to play both tournaments. He had not played a tournament since February 2014, but he started the 2015 Apia International Sydney with a straight-sets win against Sergiy Stakhovsky. In the second round, his {{opponent}} was world No. 19 and top seed Fabio Fognini. It was a tough test for del Potro, but he proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stronger</b> than the Italian. Del Potro was through to the quarterfinals, but lost to Mikhail Kukushkin in two tiebreakers. After his Sydney campaign, he was drawn to play Jerzy Janowicz {{in the first round of}} the 2015 Australian Open, del Potro withdrew due to his wrist injury. Del Potro played in Miami and was not seen for nearly a year, undergoing surgery again in June 2015.|$|E

5|$|In {{training}} camp, Allen {{competed with}} Wes Lysack and Eric Fraser for the starting safety position. Lysack and Fraser were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stronger</b> players than Allen physically, but Allen was both quicker and possessed greater ability in coverage. Allen started the first preseason game at safety but also spent significant {{time on the}} field as a cornerback, his previous position. After making the regular season roster, Allen spent the month of July moving {{on and off the}} roster but playing in no games. Allen made his CFL debut on July 31, 2010 in a 23–20 win against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, in which he played off the bench. He continued to spend most of his time on the inactive list or the practice squad throughout the season, playing sporadically. Allen also missed playing time due to a leg injury. He finished the season with seven tackles in six games. Allen's contributions were largely on special teams, where he performed five of his tackles. He played in the West Final against the Saskatchewan Roughriders.|$|E
5|$|The {{team from}} the University of Mainz were {{planning}} to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,xn). This compound {{is analogous to the}} lighter ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene. Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stronger</b> in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound.|$|E

5|$|While {{there were}} several changed to the playing staff, {{the core of the}} team that had played in the Second Division {{remained}} intact. Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top goalscorer in each of the previous three seasons, was retained along with captain Clem Rigg, Welsh half-back Jack Newnes and goalkeeper Harry Abbott. The two most senior squad members, David Wilson and goalkeeper Joseph Birds, retired from professional football aged 40 and 36 respectively. Inside forward Dick Crawshaw, who had been the team's second-highest scorer in 1923–24 with five goals, moved to Stalybridge Celtic. Scottish forward Mike McCulloch ended his two-year association with the club by joining Chesterfield on a free transfer, while half-back Leigh Collins signed for New Brighton. Other players, including William Lammus and Ernest Gillibrand, left Nelson having failed to establish themselves in the first-team during their time with the club. Manager Wilson spent a total of £750 (£ as of 2011) on new players in the summer of 1924. Billy Bottrill and Bill Ellerington arrived from Middlesbrough, while Barrow full-back James Phizacklea was signed to bolster the defensive line. Several young players were acquired from local non-League football during the close season, including Ambrose Harris from Briercliffe and Billy Harper, formerly of Feniscowles. The Nelson squad was considered by the local newspaper <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stronger</b> than the one which had won the Third Division North two seasons earlier.|$|E

25|$|Tornadoes vary in {{intensity}} regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes.

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used woods are Sitka spruce and Douglas fir, which offer excellent strength-to-weight ratios. Wooden structural members are joined with adhesive, usually epoxy. Unlike the wood construction techniques used in other applications, virtually all wooden joints in aircraft are simple butt joints, with plywood gussets. Joints are designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stronger</b> than the members. After the structure has been completed, the aircraft is covered in aircraft fabric (usually aircraft-grade polyester).

25|$|The {{effect of}} isotopes, {{both on the}} {{vibration}} and the decay dynamics, has been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stronger</b> than previously thought. In some systems, such as silicon and germanium, the decay of the anti-symmetric stretch mode of interstitial oxygen involves the symmetric stretch mode with a strong isotope dependence. For example, it was shown that for a natural silicon sample, the lifetime of the anti-symmetric vibration is 11.4 ps. When the isotope {{of one of the}} silicon atoms is increased to 29Si, the lifetime increases to 19 ps. In similar manner, when the silicon atom is changed to 30Si, the lifetime becomes 27 ps.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of predation rates also varies between pre- and post-dispersal predation. Although {{both types of}} predation can be extremely high, studies simultaneously evaluating both pre- and post-dispersal seed predation suggest that the latter is often more severe than the former. However, seeds already dispersed and not consumed {{have a chance to}} germinate, and seeds consumed could die regardless of predation due to constraints imposed by unsuitable germination sites. On the other hand, all non-dispersed seeds predated would be no more than a waste of energy by the parent plant. Therefore, the demographic impacts of pre-dispersal predation on plant populations are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stronger</b> than the impacts of post-dispersal predation.|$|E
