40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to yield more {{plausible}} rural <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> for China and then assess the determinants of rural poverty using these newly revised rural <b>poverty</b> <b>lines.</b> Design/methodology/approach – In this paper it is argued that <b>the</b> Chinese official <b>poverty</b> <b>line</b> substantially misestimates <b>the</b> actual rural <b>poverty</b> situations. <b>The</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> are derived with Ravallion's method with a rural household survey data of China's two provinces, Hubei, and Inner Mongolia. <b>Poverty</b> determinants using <b>the</b> derived as well as <b>the</b> other rural <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> are compared. Findings – The results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> derived from a pan-country level food bundle cannot fully reflect <b>the</b> regional <b>poverty</b> situation. Merely adjusting rural <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> at <b>the</b> country-level consumer price index without fully considering changes in the structure of food consumption and food prices with respect to different regions may also lead to wrong <b>poverty</b> estimates. <b>The</b> comparisons between the model regression results using <b>the</b> newly derived <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> with <b>the</b> alternative rural <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> suggest that <b>the</b> current literature uses the World Bank or the Chinese official rural <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> to assess how <b>the</b> rural <b>poverty</b> determinants might yield implausible policy implications. Practical implications – China needs to adjust <b>the</b> rural <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> with full consideration to the structure of food consumption and food prices with respect to different regions. Originality/value – It is indicated that <b>the</b> Chinese official <b>poverty</b> <b>line</b> substantially misestimates <b>the</b> actual rural <b>poverty</b> situations in China and this in turn affects the associated policy implications.

5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>line.</b> Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level.

30|$|Regarding poverty measures, we {{adopt the}} {{following}} three Foster–Greer–Thorbecke (FGT) measures: (1) the headcount (H) index, a measure of <b>poverty</b> incidence, (2) <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> gap (PG) index, a measure of poverty depth, and (3) <b>the</b> squared <b>poverty</b> gap (SPG) index, a measure of poverty severity. To compile poverty measures, we use <b>the</b> official <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> designated by <b>the</b> Government of Mexico. There are three types of official poverty lines: “food,” “extreme,” and “basic-needs” (Iniguez-Montiel 2014). <b>The</b> food <b>poverty</b> <b>line</b> is <b>the</b> lowest of the three, and it is calculated {{as the cost of}} a basic-food basket for the poor to survive; <b>the</b> extreme <b>poverty</b> <b>line</b> additionally considers education and health necessities; <b>the</b> basic-needs <b>poverty</b> <b>line</b> is <b>the</b> highest as it covers the costs of three additional commodities/services (clothing, housing, and transportation) that are not included in <b>the</b> other two <b>poverty</b> <b>lines.</b> Although these official <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> are meant to capture <b>the</b> absolute <b>poverty</b> level that is constant over time, in reality, their purchasing powers changed over time, because of higher inflation rates for the goods that were considered to estimate <b>the</b> official <b>poverty</b> <b>lines,</b> compared to <b>the</b> goods that were included in the basket used to estimate the CPI in Mexico. In other words, the poor in Mexico suffered from inflation rates that were higher than those indicated by the national CPI. This is the reason we apply the triple decomposition methodology proposed by Günther and Grimm (2007).|$|R
