5|$|North American birds {{most closely}} {{resemble}} those of Eurasia, which {{was connected to the}} continent as part of the supercontinent Laurasia until around 60 million years ago. Many groups occur throughout the Northern Hemisphere and worldwide. However some groups unique to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> have also arisen; those represented in this list are the hummingbirds, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> vultures, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> quail, the tyrant flycatchers, the vireos, the mimids, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> warblers, the tanagers, the cardinals and the icterids.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> warblers are a {{group of}} small often {{colorful}} passerine birds restricted to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World.</b> Most are arboreal, but some are more terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivores.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{the paucity}} of {{morphological}} differences between the Old World mallards and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> mallard demonstrates {{the extent to which}} the genome is shared among them such that birds like the Chinese spot-billed duck are highly similar to the Old World mallard, and birds such as the Hawaiian duck are highly similar to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> mallard.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{systematic}} {{placement of}} the king vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear.
