Meat has more {{calories}} than fruits and vegetables, which some individuals may need fewer of in summer than winter.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>words</b> used in Acta Cirurgica Brasileira from 1997 to 2012. METHODS: All <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>words</b> of all {{articles published}} in regular issues between 1997 and 2012 were analyzed, ensuring that these <b>key</b> <b>words</b> were in <b>the</b> MeSH database (Medical Subjects Headings) and the most used subject headings and most wrong repeated <b>key</b> <b>words</b> were ranked. RESULTS: > 4230 <b>key</b> <b>words</b> used in 990 articles were analyzed. Only 579 <b>key</b> <b>words</b> (13. 68 %) {{were not in the}} MeSH database, considering that there was a statistically significant decrease over the years (p< 0. 001). The three most used <b>key</b> <b>words</b> were Rats, Dogs and Wound healing. Among the wrong ones, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>words</b> were Adhesions, Experimental surgery and Anatomosis.

25|$|Essentially all ciphers {{remained}} {{vulnerable to}} cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until {{the development of}} the polyalphabetic cipher, most clearly by Leon Battista Alberti around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi. Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device, a wheel which implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the polyalphabetic Vigenère cipher, encryption uses a key word, which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>word</b> is used. In the mid-19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigenère cipher was vulnerable to Kasiski examination, but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich Kasiski.|$|E

500|$|Parkinson defines tales as [...] "...non-commemorative, non-functional, fictional narratives" [...] {{that usually}} employ <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>word</b> [...] "narrate" [...] (sdd). He {{describes}} it as the most open-ended genre, since the tales often incorporate elements of other literary genres. For example, Morenz describes the opening section of the foreign adventure tale Sinuhe as a [...] "...funerary self-presentation" [...] that parodies the typical autobiography found on commemorative funerary [...] The autobiography is for a courier whose service began under Amenemhat I. Simpson states that the death of Amenemhat I in the report given by his son, coregent, and successor Senusret I (r. 1971–1926 BC) to the army {{in the beginning of}} Sinuhe is [...] "...excellent propaganda". Morenz describes The shipwrecked sailor as an expeditionary report and a travel-narrative myth. Simpson notes the literary device of the story within a story in The shipwrecked sailor may provide [...] "...the earliest examples of a narrative quarrying report". With the setting of a magical desert island, and a character who is a talking snake, The shipwrecked sailor may also be classified as a fairy tale. While stories like Sinuhe, Taking of Joppa, and the Doomed prince contain fictional portrayals of Egyptians abroad, the Report of Wenamun is most likely based on a true account of an Egyptian who traveled to Byblos in Phoenicia to obtain cedar for shipbuilding during the reign of Ramesses XI.|$|E

With <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>word</b> [...] "sufferbus" [...] already having been recently used on the 1992 album Sunrise on the Sufferbus by Masters of Reality, and rejecting the lyrical draft of [...] "I'm gonna send my love to the universe", the search for a similar-sounding word ultimately also yielded an accompanying ancient mythos.

The assignment of a specific information to a certain category (coding) was induced by the particular text passage (coding unit). Parts without relevant information were ignored. As a result of our extraction process, a vast amount of data from 235 different literature sources were collected in a table to answer our research questions. For information evaluation, we compared the found information in each category to identify communalities or differences.|$|R
2500|$|Ich und Du {{has been}} {{translated}} from the original German into many other languages. However, because Buber's use of German was highly idiomatic and often unconventional, there has naturally been debate {{on how best to}} convey the complex messages in his text. One critical debate in the English-speaking world has centered on the correct translation of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>word</b> pairs Ich-Du and Ich-Es. In the German, the word [...] "Du" [...] is used, while in the English two different translations are used: [...] "Thou" [...] (used in Ronald Smith's version) and [...] "You" [...] (used by Walter Kaufmann). The key problem is how to translate the very personal, even intimate German [...] "Du", which has no direct equivalent in Modern English. Smith argued that [...] "Thou" [...] invokes the theological and reverential implications which Buber intended (e. g., Buber describes God as the eternal [...] "Du"). Kaufmann asserted that this wording was archaic and impersonal, offering [...] "You" [...] because (like the German Du) it has colloquial usage in intimate conversation.|$|E

The positions of {{the words in the}} `company' and `non-company' sets across the text were computed. The results indicated that the `non-company' sets referred to `company' implicitly. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>words</b> were compared to an automatic abridgment of the text which revealed that nearly all <b>key</b> <b>words</b> were present in the ahridgment.

30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{different}} test formats, no {{significant difference was found}} among the three types examined here. There is only one example that shows that differences in test format might affect students’ performance. In Conversation 2 of Test 4, the percentage of correct answers to Question 2 was low in Classes 1 and 3 (25.0  % in Class 1 and 35.0  % in Class 3) but relatively high in Class 2 (65.0  %), while in Question 1, the results were completely opposite: The percentage of correct answers was higher in Classes 1 and 3 (75.0  % in Class 1 and 70.0  % in Class 3) than in Class 2 (65.0  %). A possible {{reason for this is that}} <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>words</b> to Question 2 appear before <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>words</b> to Question 1.

In the case of Class 2, the students listened to the three questions in both English and their L 1 before listening to the spoken text. However, the students in Class 1 did not read or listen to the questions prior to listening to the text, and those in Class 3 were allowed to read the questions but were not told to read all three questions beforehand. As a result, they might have concentrated on Question 1, and thus missed <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>words</b> to Question 2.
