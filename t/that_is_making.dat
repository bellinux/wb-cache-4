5|$|The Prince of Lobkowitz, who in 1854 {{became the}} head of Mezőhegyes, {{stressed}} the importance of fixing the type– <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>making</b> the characteristics of a breed of animal genetically homogenous– of the horses. This goal was achieved by linebreeding, though the one season that Nonius Senior served his own daughters was notably unsuccessful: of the 33 foals, 11 died while only 2 were broodmare-quality and 1 was stallion-quality. However, with more experimentation, the Nonius breed emerged as a uniformly heavy but elegant military driving and carting horse. In 1865, Arabian and Thoroughbred stallions were bred to Nonius Senior's female descendants in the hopes of correcting a lack of balance and elegance among the Nonius horses. Nonius Senior stood at stud for 22 years. By the end of his breeding life, he had served mares of Arabian, Lipizzan, Thoroughbred, Spanish and Norman blood. Fifteen of Nonius's sons in turn stood at stud, and 122 of his daughters were used as broodmares.|$|E

He returns in the sequel to Degeneration, , where he is sent to investigate the use of the T-virus during a civil war in Eastern Europe. Unlike the live-action film series, the animated films are canonically set in the same universe as the game series, serving as the prequels to Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6, respectively. Another computer-animated film starring Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield and Rebecca Chambers is slated for 2017.

On {{the topic of}} O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: [...] "What's {{going to be very}} interesting to see is what he's going to do with Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her." [...] He also added that, [...] "I think George has a lot of growing up to do.

500|$|During {{the first}} stages of development, the designers' {{priority}} was purely on streamlining and polishing the shooting aspects; RPG elements were not added until {{this process was}} complete. According to lead designer Christina Norman, [...] "we wanted more satisfying combat and {{a big part of}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>making</b> weapons more accurate and powerful at level one—basically saying 'let's take the RPG out of the shooter.'" [...] Since BioWare had no experience with shooter games, the team spent roughly three months tuning how combat would work using the original Mass Effect as a basis. The camera was improved to offer a more precise aiming that included body-specific targeting like headshots. Norman explained that they wanted the weapons to have their own identity, noting that the final build of the game has 19 weapons with 108 tuning variables. The inclusion of limited ammunition was not initially part of the main game design and was simply implemented for some early playtesting. However, the developers ultimately felt it improved the tension and pacing of combat. The pacing of the story was also improved, especially in the opening, as developers wanted to get players into the action faster.|$|E

[...] Carlos Delgado of If Magazine said the episode plot was too silly and lacked laughs: [...] "All in all, I was left feeling a little cheated. [...] "Pinewood Derby" [...] wasn’t funny, it was just weird." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said the episode was told with [...] "the warp-speed storytelling style <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>making</b> this season one of South Parks best". Travis Fickett of IGN said {{he was happy to}} see an episode centered on Randy Marsh, who he said is an excellent character; Fickett said of [...] "Pinewood Derby", [...] "This isn't a great episode but its fast-paced lunacy in the South Park tradition and most of the genre tropes it riffs on are dead on." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{trail is}} about 0.5 {{miles long and}} a low {{challenge}} trail. The trail is well maintained, but the natural pool that it leads to is open during summer months only. Starting from the visitor's parking area, hikers get on PR-143 walking northeast bound (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>making</b> a left from the parking area to head [...] "East" [...] on PR-143) about 0.25 miles, then make a right into the forest at the sign ("Verada #6 - Piscina") to get on Trail #6.

Continuing south on the trail, there are two eye-catching waterfalls visible from the trail. Continuing southbound and uphill, the trail goes through two flat and open areas with picnic tables. After this, the trail continues uphill and southbound for about 0.6 miles where it comes to its end, reaching Trail #1. Once at Trail #1, hikers either make a left or a right to get onto Trail #1 (trail #1 is a loop trail) or, of course, may turn around to return to the parking area via Trail #6. The entire length of Trail #6 is 0.8 miles.|$|E

Trail #3 does not start at the visitor's parking area, so hikers must first hike on other trails to get to Trail #3.

Hikers get on PR-143, walking northeast bound (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>making</b> a left from the parking area to head [...] "East" [...] on PR-143) about 0.25 miles, make a right into the forest at the sign ("Verada #6 - Piscina") to get on Trail #6, hike the 0.8 mile of Trail #6 to its end, make a left into Trail #1 and hike about 0.3 mile {{to the beginning of}} Trail #3.

This situation continues until the case goes into the legal system, which can have substantial economic costs, prompting some developers to settle.

The daycare center is wildly successful, and Homer earns a nomination for the [...] "Good Guy Awards". But during a video tribute at the awards ceremony, Bart and Lisa splice in home movie footage of Homer at his worst. The video shows Homer passed out on the floor drunk and almost naked during Christmas, losing Maggie to Moe in a poker game, and chasing Bart down the street while wielding a flail). The audience becomes outraged and Homer angrily strangles Bart on stage. Everyone in the audience becomes horrified by Homer's behavior, and decide to prevent their kids from being watched over by him. Homer escapes from the ceremony with all the kids in a van, until he crashes the van into a tree, and tries to escape before Chief Wiggum stops him. After three mistrials, Homer apologizes to Bart and Lisa for neglecting them, and promises to care for his own children (including the perpetually ignored Maggie) instead of the neighborhood kids. The family then helps themselves to the craft table, which the Teamsters left behind in their house but are supposedly picking up later that day.|$|E
