Some of the houses in the Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} part of October, the British troops with their {{supplies}} and artillery made their way with difficulty up the road to prepare for the siege. When they were all in place the First Bombardment took place, starting on October 17. It had been expected that the bombardment would be effective and that the siege would be short-lived; certainly over before the winter. However, the Russians blew up one of the French magazines and the damage done by British gunfire was soon repaired. The British were running out of ammunition and supplies, winter was approaching and with the onset of bad weather the road became virtually impassable. Supplies were arriving at <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> port of Balaclava but it was impossible to convey them to the besieging troops who were increasingly suffering from disease, frostbite and malnutrition. Conditions in Balaclava itself were also deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, French {{officials}} {{decided to}} build a satellite museum {{on the site of}} an abandoned coal pit in the former mining town of Lens to relieve <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> Paris Louvre, increase total museum visits, and improve the industrial north's economy. Six cities were considered for the project: Amiens, Arras, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Lens, and Valenciennes. In 2004, French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin chose Lens to be the site of the new building, the Louvre-Lens. Japanese architects SANAA were selected to design the Lens project in 2005. Museum officials predicted that the new building, capable of receiving about 600works of art, would attract up to 500,000visitors a year when it opened in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{medieval times}} trades {{were carried out}} in {{workshops}} {{in and around the}} owners' premises in the City. By the time of the Great Fire these were becoming industries and some were particularly noisome, such as the processing of urine to perform tanning; or required large amounts of space, such as drying clothes after process and dying in fields known as tentergrounds; and rope making. Some were dangerous, such as the manufacture of gunpowder or the proving of guns. These activities came to be performed outside the City walls in the near suburbs of the East End. Later when lead making and bone processing for soap and china came to be established, they too located in the East End rather than <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> streets of the City.|$|E

40|$|Exposure to {{crowding}} {{is said to}} be aversive, {{yet people}} also seek out and enjoy crowded situations. We surveyed participants at two crowd events to test the prediction of self-categorization theory that variable emotional responses to crowding are a function of social identification with <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> In data collected from participants who attended a crowded outdoor music event (n = 48), identification with <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> predicted feeling less crowded; and there was an indirect effect of identification with <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> on positive emotion through feeling less <b>crowded.</b> Identification with <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> also moderated <b>the</b> relation between feeling less crowded and positive emotion.

40|$|Abstract The {{problem of}} “approximating <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> ” {{is that of}} {{estimating}} <b>the</b> <b>crowd’s</b> majority opinion by querying only a subset of it. Algorithms that approximate <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> can intelligently stretch a limited budget for a crowd-sourcing task. We present an algorithm, “CrowdSense, ” that works in an online fashion where items come one at a time. CrowdSense dynamically samples sub-sets of <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> based on an exploration/exploitation criterion. The algorithm produces a weighted combination of the subset’s votes that approximates <b>the</b> <b>crowd’s</b> opinion. We then introduce two variations of CrowdSense that make various distributional approximations to handle distinct crowd characteristics. In particular, the first algorithm makes a statistical independence approxi-mation of the labelers for large <b>crowds,</b> whereas <b>the</b> second algorithm finds a lower bound on how often the current sub-crowd agrees with <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> major-ity vote. Our experiments on CrowdSense and several baselines demonstrate that we can reliably approximate <b>the</b> entire <b>crowd’s</b> vote by collecting opinions from a representative subset of <b>the</b> <b>crowd...</b>|$|R
5|$|Opponents of dam removal {{state that}} the {{estimated}} demolition cost of $3–10 billion is a poor investment, especially in regards of the resulting loss of renewable hydroelectric power, which {{would have to be}} replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. Although there are several options available to replace San Francisco's water, none are of the purity currently supplied by Hetch Hetchy. There is also no guarantee that the valley can be successfully restored, as the original valley floor was actually the product of thousands of years of intensive controlled burning and management by the native Paiute and Miwok peoples that once lived in the area. Without this intervention, a forest would grow in the place of the valley's renowned meadows. Finally, the increased pressure of new tourism could cause its own environmental damage, as has been demonstrated in <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|Several agencies, {{including}} the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed {{plans for a}} better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> streets, {{and the number of}} response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.|$|E
5|$|Since 2006, {{there have}} been a number of {{terrorist}} attacks, including explosions in a landmark holy place, a court and a temple. The 2006 Varanasi bombings were a series of bombings that occurred across the Hindu holy city of Varanasi on 7 March 2006. At least 28 people were killed and as many as 101 others were injured. The blasts occurred simultaneously shortly after 18:00 IST. The first blast took place at 18:20 in <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near the Banaras Hindu University.

5|$|The {{high levels}} of poverty in the East End have, {{throughout}} history, corresponded with {{a high incidence of}} crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the East India Company built high-walled docks at Blackwall and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice {{led to the creation of}} ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.|$|E

His right-footed snap-shot was weak and poorly struck, but it went straight to Sheringham, who swiped at the shot with his right foot, and nestled the ball in the bottom corner of the net.

5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides a}} microscopic {{experimental study of}} pedestrian motion {{in front of the}} bottleneck. Identification of individual pedestrians in conducted experiments enables to explain the high variance of travel time by heterogeneity of <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Some pedestrians are able to push effectively through <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> some get trapped in <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> for significantly longer time. This ability to push through <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> is associated with the slope of individual linear model of the dependency of the travel time on the number of pedestrians in front of the bottleneck. Further detailed study of the origin of such ability is carried out by means of the route choice, i. e. strategy whether to bypass <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> or to walk directly through it. The study has revealed that the ability to push through <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> is a combination of aggressiveness in conflicts and willingness to overtake <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Comment: To appear in Transportmetrica A: [URL]...|$|R
