5|$|Among ectoparasites, bats carry fleas and mites, {{as well as}} {{specific}} parasites such as bat bugs and bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae). However, {{they are one of}} the few non-aquatic mammalian orders that do not host lice. This may be due <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> from more effective, specialized parasites which occupy the same niche.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, Salford began to decline due <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> from outside the UK. A survey in 1931 {{concluded}} that parts of Salford were amongst the worst slums in the country. Salford was granted city status in 1926. During World War II, Salford Docks were regularly bombed.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1973 oil crisis, world {{production}} of oil shale reached a peak of 46million tonnes in 1980 before falling to about 16million tonnes in 2000, due <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> from cheap conventional petroleum in the 1980s.|$|E

He withdrew after aggravating a groin injury. On November 20, 2012, Lysacek underwent surgery to repair a torn muscle in his lower abdomen, i.e. a sports hernia, with an expected period of six weeks off the ice.

5|$|After World War II, North Philadelphia {{suffered}} from the failure of its industries, and the PRR reduced both local and long-distance service due <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> from private autos, further reducing {{the importance of the}} station. Escalators and a new drop ceiling were added around 1955, the former due to the insistence of the city council. The surrounding parking lots and ground were rearranged in 1968.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the {{popularity}} of cinemas waned as more people acquired televisions, and by 1965 there were only 40 cinemas left in Manchester. Cine City was threatened with closure in 1997 when Geoff Henshaw, the owner at the time, died. It was purchased by David Babsky, who kept the cinema open until July 2001, when it closed due <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> from a new multiplex cinema in nearby East Didsbury.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1950s, British Railways {{had begun}} to operate in {{regional}} units, and responsibility for services on the former Great Central routes in the Chilterns {{was transferred to the}} London Midland Region. Services on the branch were generally hauled by LMS Ivatt Class locomotives, although passenger trains continued to use the 1898 Ashbury cars. British Railways continued to operate goods services on the branch, although these declined steadily owing <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> from road haulage to the point at which coal deliveries were the only significant business.|$|E

50|$|In racing sports, {{sports teams}} usually compete against {{more than one}} team at a time. Further, {{programs}} have less control over whom they compete against. They can control who comes <b>to</b> <b>competitions</b> they host, and they can control which <b>competitions</b> they travel <b>to,</b> but they have little to no influence on what other teams come <b>to</b> <b>competitions</b> that others host. These factors cause teams from each Division to compete with more teams both in their Division and in other Divisions.|$|R
5|$|Chambers {{was cleared}} {{to compete on}} 10 June 2006, {{although}} his return was dependent on an agreement to repay prize money he won while using banned substances. He returned <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> on 11 June 2006 at the British Grand Prix and took third in 10.07s, behind Asafa Powell who equalled his own world record. Chambers stated that his training regime with Bolt had helped him make a strong opening performance despite a long absence from competition. The result placed Chambers {{at the top of}} the British rankings and was the second fastest time by a European sprinter in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with intermodal container traffic growing due <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> between private operators.|$|E
5|$|Farming was {{the main}} {{occupation}} in Urmston until the early 19th century, when weaving became {{a significant source of}} employment, although this later declined due <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> from large industry. In 1848, the population was recorded as being 771, with around 80% of the land being farmed. The opening of the Cheshire Lines Railway in 1873 allowed the town to grow as a commuter town: between 1871 and 1901 the population grew by over 650%, from 996 to 6,594. By 1901, farming had virtually died out, and the town became a residence for the middle classes.|$|E

5|$|He {{qualified}} for the U.S. Olympic Team in 1980, {{as a member of}} the U.S. team in the men's 4×200-meter freestyle relay, but was unable to compete because of the United States-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. After completing his college career in 1981, Larson was tired of swimming and quit, only to return <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> a year later because he missed the focus. Larson continued his training with the program that coach Randy Reese had created for post-college swimmers in Gainesville, Florida.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{there were}} nearly 25,000 filling {{stations}} in the UK, of which 10,000 were independents (typically, privately owned and supplied by a major or jobber while using a brand under license). By the end of 1999, the number of filling stations had dropped to 13,700 and to 9,700 {{at the end of}} 2005. In recent years, filling stations have been closing at a rate of 50 per month. Many of the smaller and independent stations have succumbed <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> from out-of-town supermarkets that undercut local enterprises through sheer volume of sales and shared overheads.|$|E

5|$|Later in the century, the {{production}} declined due <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> from imported European glass-ware. However, {{the products of}} Hebron continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace, particularly by travelling Jewish traders from the city. At the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna, Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained {{an important source of}} income for Hebron with four factories making 60,000 francs per annum.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about sivaladapid ecology. Gingerich and Sahni {{suggested}} that Indraloris was probably arboreal and {{that it may have}} been more frugivorous (eating fruit) than Sivaladapis, which they interpreted as a folivore (leaf-eater). Flynn and Morgan interpreted I.kamlialensis as a mixed feeder. The Late Miocene extinction of Indian sivaladapids may be related to a decline in forest cover in Asia and <b>to</b> <b>competition</b> by immigrating colobine monkeys.|$|E
