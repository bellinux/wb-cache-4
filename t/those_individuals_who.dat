5|$|The Vietnam Campaign Medal was {{an award}} of South Vietnam for <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> served in Vietnam {{for a period}} of at least six months. Although it was a {{personal}} award, Coast Guard regulations permitted its display on a cutter's port and starboard bridge wings since Squadron One's cutters served during the eligibility period of 1 March 1961 to 28 March 1973.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} {{decrease}} the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> have already formed a blood clot (thrombus). Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help {{reduce the risk of}} embolism (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).|$|E
50|$|Surtitles {{can be a}} distraction, {{focusing}} attention on the titles instead of the stage. Therefore, several systems {{have been developed to}} provide captions visible only to <b>those</b> <b>individual</b> viewers <b>who</b> wish to see them.|$|R

25|$|According to Glass, Holmgren, et al., {{those in}} the O blood group have an {{increased}} risk of infection with cholera, and <b>those</b> O-group <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> are infected have more severe infections.

25|$|On July 15, 1983, ASALA {{carried out}} another attack at the Orly Airport near Paris, in which 8 people were killed, {{most of them}} not being Turks.

25|$|To these succeeds {{the fourth}} decree, by which God decreed {{to save and}} damn certain {{particular}} persons. This decree has its foundation in the foreknowledge of God, by which he knew from all eternity <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> would, through his preventing grace, believe, and, through his subsequent grace would persevere, according to the before described administration of those means which are suitable and proper for conversion and faith; and, by which foreknowledge, he likewise knew those who would not believe and persevere.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest associations between emotional approach coping and psychological well-being. In a study of individuals who met DSM-IV criteria for anxiety disorder and healthy controls, levels of emotional approach coping were lower in <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> met the criteria than in controls. Another study examined veterans and found that higher levels emotional expression (but not emotional processing) were associated with lower depressive symptoms and decreased post-traumatic stress disorder, even when statistically controlling for age, gender, and race.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those persons}} who have been {{bereaved}} within the previous three months of a given report, those who report many intrusive thoughts about the deceased show ventral amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex hyperactivity to reminders of their loss. In {{the case of the}} amygdala, this links to their sadness intensity. In <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> avoid such thoughts, there is a related opposite type of pattern {{in which there is a}} decrease in the activation of the dorsal amgydala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.|$|E
40|$|Thanatophoric {{dysplasia}} {{is typically}} a neonatal lethal condition. However, for <b>those</b> rare <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> do survive, {{there is the}} development of seizures, progression of craniocervical stenosis, ventilator dependence, and limitations in motor and cognitive abilities. Families must be made aware of these issues during the discussion of management plans...|$|R

25|$|PTSD became first evident due to <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> {{suffered}} extremely horrible experiences from war. Society {{noticed that}} those {{who took part in}} war, or had family members who took part in war, became distant from themselves and suffered terribly and found it very difficult to cope with the tragedies. Researchers took note of this and aimed to evaluate the situation and come to a conclusion with how to rehabilitate these victims, and while doing this they determined that these people had post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|These immigrants, {{who were}} mostly {{constituted}} of families, established {{several of the}} earliest colonies in New England, of which the Massachusetts Bay Colony was {{the largest and most}} economically important. They intended to build a society based on their religious beliefs. Colonial leaders were elected by the freemen of the colony, <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> had had their religious experiences formally examined and had been admitted to one of the colony's Puritan congregations. The colonial leadership were prominent members of their congregations, and regularly consulted with the local ministers on issues facing the colony.|$|E
25|$|Sciascia {{wrote of}} his unique Sicilian experience, linking {{families}} with political parties, the treachery of alliances and allegiances, and the calling of favors {{that result in}} outcomes that do not benefit society, but <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> are in favor. His books are rarely characterized by a happy ending or by justice for the ordinary man. A prime {{example of this is}} Equal Danger (1973; Uguale pericolo), in which the police's best detective is drafted to Sicily to investigate a spate of murders of judges. Focusing on the inability of authorities to handle such investigation into the corruption, Sciascia's hero is finally thwarted.|$|E

25|$|Herd {{immunity}} is {{an important}} supplement to vaccination. Among <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> receive oral polio vaccine, only 95 percent will develop immunity. That means five of every 100 given the vaccine will not develop any immunity and will be susceptible to developing polio. According to the concepts of herd immunity this population whom the vaccine fails, are still protected by the immunity of those around them. Herd immunity can only be achieved when vaccination levels are high. It is estimated that 80–86 percent of individuals in a population must be immune to polio for the susceptible individuals to be protected by herd immunity. If routine immunization were stopped, the number of unvaccinated, susceptible individuals would soon exceed the capability of herd immunity to protect them.|$|E
25|$|The {{mainstream}} view is {{that the}} Quran accepts the institution of slavery. It may be noted that the word 'abd' (slave) is rarely used, being more commonly replaced by some periphrasis such as ma malakat aymanukum ("that which your right hands own"). However the meaning and translation of this term has been disputed. W.G. Clarence-Smith has highlighted {{the point of view of}} Ghulam Ahmed Pervez on this issue, who argued that the term is used in the past-tense in the Quran, thus signalling only <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> were already enslaved at the dawn of Islam. This slight change in tense is significant, as it allowed G.A. Parwez to argue that slavery was never compatible with the commandments of the Quran and is in fact outlawed by Quranic Law.|$|E
25|$|<b>Those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> {{participated in}} the Expo project were also impacted; Mexican interim {{ambassador}} Federico Gamboa tells in his memoirs that Spanish sculptor Justo de Gandarias, and elderly man when he met him on 20 June 1899, was still in Guatemala {{two years after the}} failed Expo because the government had not paid him for his services. Two years after that, Gamboa met with the sculptor again, and this time he tells that Gandarias had lost all hope of ever getting paid and that was in Guatemala barely surviving by selling cigarettes in Guatemala City; Gamboa visited Gandarias at his home and tells how the sculptures place was in total disarray, but kept some old paintings and sculptures that he was hoping to sell if he ever went back to Spain.|$|E

25|$|The Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory {{includes}} creativity as {{a subset}} of intelligence. Specifically, it {{is associated with the}} broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include: ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al. conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests, and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level Glr factor. Martindale extended the CHC-theory {{in the sense that it}} was proposed that <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.|$|E
25|$|While the Persians {{were making}} headway in their {{conquest of the}} eastern provinces, Phocas chose to divide his {{subjects}} rather than unite them against {{the threat of the}} Persians. Perhaps seeing his defeats as divine retribution, Phocas initiated a savage and bloody campaign to forcibly convert the Jews to Christianity. Persecutions and alienation of the Jews, a frontline people in the war against the Persians helped drove them into aiding the Persian conquerors. As Jews and Christians began tearing each other apart, some fled the butchery into Persian territory. Meanwhile, it appears that the disasters befalling the Empire led the Emperor into a state of paranoia — although it must be said that there were numerous plots against his rule and execution followed execution. Among <b>those</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> were executed was the former empress Constantina and her three daughters.|$|E
