As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as advances in metal coverings (known as flux) were made.

For the current normal rail thermite weld-ing conditions, it is found that shrinkage cavity formation can be avoided but cold-lap and centre-line defects are likely to occur. This study also shows that increasing the preheating time or the liquid temperature can suppress the development of cold-lap and centre-line defects but can lead to a slightly higher microporosity content in the railhead as well. Alternatively, it is found that instead of increasing the preheating time or the liquid temperature, the same effect can be achieved by increasing the 25 mm weld gap (standard) to a slightly larger value...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{kingdom of}} Morocco {{has become the}} first African country to adopt a {{high-tech}} rail infrastructure, for the mega (giant) project “Morocco High Speed Train ” (TGVM). Reducing the noise levels of rail traffic is an extremely important issue for the environment and for rolling stock as well. Therefore, research and development in this field in Morocco is very important. The elimination of rail joints is a crucial factor in the reduction of rail noise. The junctions of rails in the railways should be designed {{in a way to}} obtain a great continuity of the raceway. Currently, the rails connections are made by two methods: (1 - Resistance welding) and (2 - aluminothermic welding). The second method is considered the most reliable in Morocco’s railways. For this purpose, this paper aims to present a set of experimental studies of mechanical behaviour, where various samples are recorded from base metal zones and areas of <b>thermite</b> <b>weld.</b> These samples are taken from broken rails that have been used in service. After the benchmarking a microstructural differences have been identified by the optical microscope and the scanning electron microscope between the area of the base metal and the rail <b>thermite</b> <b>weld...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} an {{evaluation}} of <b>thermite</b> rail <b>welding</b> {{with the goal of}} the development of welds with improved mechanical properties. The first part of the study involved an in-depth evaluation of 14 <b>thermite</b> rail <b>welds</b> produced by the Department of Transportation using current production practices. These welds were produced using CrMo, CrV and Cr alloy rails, AREA CC rails (i. e., standard rails) and head-hardened rails which were welded with weld metal produced by the aluminothermic reaction of "standard" and "alloy" thermite charges. Temperature at various locations was measured during welding for both the rails and the weld metal. After welding, mechanical properties, macro- and microstructure, inclusion levels and residual stresses induced by the welding operation were all determined. Low impact properties and ductility (2 - 6 percent reduction in area) were observed in the <b>thermite</b> rail <b>weld</b> metal. These low properties were attributed to microstructure and, to a lesser extent, inclusion content. In order to improve the process by reducing the inclusion content, attempts were made to filter the molten thermite steel by passing it through zirconia/mullite filters. This was included {{in the second part of}} the study in which 9 plate welds we made using "standard" thermite charges. Filtering, at best, was only partly successful. However, it was observed that a 30 percent increase in yield strength and hardness was achieved in weld metal containing approximately 0. 55 percent carbon and 0. 06 percent vanadium. Normalization of the plate welds resulted in a significant improvement in the tensile ductility of as-cast weld metal. Weld metal of 0. 55 percent carbon and 0. 06 percent vanadium had ductilities in the range of 10 - 20 percent when the cooling rate exceeded 37 K(DEGREES) /min. through the transformation range. At cooling rates of four times this level, tensile properties equivalent to those of the "alloy" weld metal were obtained along with the enhanced tensile ductility. It was concluded that it is possible to produce a <b>thermite</b> <b>weld</b> with both improved strength and ductility by the judicious control of composition, the addition of microalloying elements and the application of an appropriate post-weld heat treatment, such as normalization...|$|R

In this modeling, we took the effect of the preheating of the rail ends into account. The preheating temperature generates residual stresses.

50|$|The reaction, {{also called}} the Goldschmidt process, is used for <b>thermite</b> <b>welding,</b> often used to join rail tracks.

50|$|<b>Thermite</b> <b>welding</b> {{is widely}} used to weld railway rails. One of the first railroads to {{evaluate}} the use of <b>thermite</b> <b>welding</b> was the Delaware and Hudson Railroad in the United States in 1935 The weld quality of chemically pure thermite is low due to the low heat penetration into the joining metals and the very low carbon and alloy content in the nearly pure molten iron. To obtain sound railroad welds, the ends of the rails being thermite welded are preheated with a torch to an orange heat, to ensure the molten steel is not chilled during the pour. Because the thermite reaction yields relatively pure iron, not the much stronger steel, some small pellets or rods of high-carbon alloying metal are included in the thermite mix; these alloying materials melt from the heat of the thermite reaction and mix into the weld metal. The alloying beads composition will vary, according to the rail alloy being welded.|$|E
50|$|Exothermic welding, {{also known}} as {{exothermic}} bonding, <b>thermite</b> <b>welding</b> (TW), and thermit welding, is a welding process that employs molten metal to permanently join the conductors. The process employs an exothermic reaction of a thermite composition to heat the metal, and requires no external source of heat or current. The chemical reaction that produces the heat is an aluminothermic reaction between aluminium powder and a metal oxide.|$|E

30|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of track and rail {{is seen as}} a significant contributor in preventing delays to trains and derailments of vehicles, thus achieving an improvement on the capacity of railway systems. Early detection and assessment of track defects are very important for timely maintenance. A more cost-effective approach is to estimate these short-wavelength defects using a small number of robust sensors such as rail vehicle axle box-mounted accelerometers. An attempt to determine a quantitative relationship between the characteristics of the accelerations and the track defects, axle box acceleration at a squat and a <b>thermite</b> <b>weld</b> were simulated through finite element modelling [5]. The simulated magnitude and frequency results of axle box acceleration at squats agreed with measurements. Furthermore, an automatic detection algorithm for squats using axle box acceleration measurements on trains was developed [6], which was based on wavelet spectrum analysis. The method can determine the squat locations, is sensitive to small rail surface defects and allows the detection of squats in their initial stages.|$|R
50|$|The {{sections}} of rail are <b>welded</b> together using <b>thermite.</b> Conventional <b>welding</b> (using {{some type of}} flame) does not work well on large metal pieces such as rails, since the heat is conducted away too quickly.

When the <b>thermite</b> <b>welding</b> process is complete, the weld is ground to the profile of the rail, resulting in a seamless join between rail sections. Stress in the rail due to temperature variations is absorbed without longitudinal strain, except near bridges where an expansion joint is sometimes used.|$|E

In this study, the maximum stress that works on Haz metal and weld metal due to the imposition of the wheel locomotive D 300, CC 202 and CC 203 will be calculated by computational. Some parameters used in the simulation of static loading rail- 54 using Finite Element Method (FEM) with ANSYS APDL include Yield Strength (σy), Modulus of Elasticity (E) and Poisson's Ratio (υ). The parameters used are the result of tensile test results of material rail- 54 <b>thermite</b> <b>welding,</b> with Rail- 54 test sample obtained from the PT.

The result showed that the von misses stress (σeq) on the weld metal at a maximum of 361. 638 MPa while value of material yield strength (σy) is 552. 8211 MPa and the von misses stress (σeq) on the areas haz metal maximum of 445. 877 MPa while the value of material yield stress / yield strength (σy) is 542. 2 MPa.

40|$|<b>Thermite</b> <b>welding</b> {{is widely}} used in heavy haul railway systems for {{in-track}} welding due to the low capital cost of equipment and the flexibility it provides. However thermite welds typically exhibit variable and often inferior performance compared to flashbutt welds. Fatigue failure {{as a result of}} surface defects or harsh geometrical features in the presence of high axle loads and tractive forces gives rise to the so-called straight break and horizontal split web fractures. In this study, the reduction of fatigue performance due to the geometrical inhomogeneity and the presence of defects is investigated using a multi-axial high cycle fatigue criterion based on the concept of critical plane. A thermo-structural finite element model of a track containing a thermite weld is linked with a customized computer code to perform fatigue crack initiation analysis; the effect of inclusions and defects is implicitly invoked through their effect on material fatigue parameters. Two geometrically different thermite welds which are widely used in Australian heavy haul railways are investigated in terms of fatigue probability, to facilitate a better insight into the effect of weld collar shape and toe geometrical parameters on fatigue behaviour. The effect of track support conditions on fatigue damage is also included in the analysis, which enables the effect of ballast deterioration, a common problem at the vicinity of thermite welds, to be quantified. The results show that the amount of fatigue damage critically depends on the geometrical features of the collar edge, especially at the underhead fillet which undergoes severe fatigue at some operational conditions. The condition of track support also shows to be highly influential in the probability of fatigue crack nucleation at regions of the weld foot...|$|E
