5|$|Insect {{wings are}} {{fundamental}} in identifying and classifying species {{as there is}} no other set of structures in studying insects more significant. Each order and insect family has distinctive wing shapes and features. In many cases, even species may be distinguished from each other by differences of color and pattern. For example, just by position one can identify species, albeit to a much lesser extent. Though most insects fold <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> when at rest, dragonflies and some damselflies rest with <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> spread out horizontally, while groups such as the caddisflies, stoneflies, alderflies, and lacewings hold <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> sloped roof-like over their backs. A few moths wrap <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> around their bodies, while many flies and most butterflies close <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> together straight upward over the back.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of <b>their</b> <b>wings,</b> and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E

50|$|The {{two models}} {{available}} are each named for <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> area in square feet.|$|R
5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> over the abdomen when stationary, {{and the eyes}} are well separated {{on the sides of}} the head.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds {{are small}} birds capable of {{hovering}} in mid-air {{due to the}} rapid flapping of <b>their</b> <b>wings.</b> They are the only birds that can fly backward.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> for communication. The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly how this sound was created. The sound could be heard 200 yards (182 m) away, and this may therefore be {{the size of the}} territory of an individual. Other species of birds are also known to use <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> to create sounds that attract mates or mark their territory.|$|E
50|$|Fountainea is a genus of Neotropical leaf butterflies. <b>Their</b> <b>wing</b> undersides usually mimic dead leaves.|$|R
50|$|Both {{males and}} females undergo a {{complete}} postnuptial moult, dropping all <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> feathers simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Anaeini is a {{tribe of}} Neotropical brush-footed butterflies. <b>Their</b> <b>wing</b> undersides usually mimic dead leaves.|$|R
5|$|Many insects can hover {{by beating}} <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> rapidly, {{requiring}} sideways stabilization {{as well as}} lift.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{butterflies}} are diurnal, {{have relatively}} bright colours, and hold <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> vertically above their bodies when at rest, unlike {{the majority of}} moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> flat (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or fold them closely over their bodies. Some day-flying moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth, are exceptions to these rules.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the worker}} and soldier castes lack wings and thus never fly, and the reproductives use <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> {{for just a}} brief amount of time, {{termites}} predominantly rely upon their legs to move about.|$|E
50|$|Malachites {{often are}} {{confused}} with Philaethria dido. They have similar coloration, but <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> shapes are different.|$|R
50|$|The {{models are}} each named for <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> area in square metres and {{decimals}} of square metres.|$|R

5|$|Hummingbirds {{are small}} birds capable of {{hovering}} in mid-air {{due to the}} rapid flapping of <b>their</b> <b>wings.</b> They are the only birds that can fly backwards. Eleven species have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Only {{reproductive}} ants, queens, and males, have wings. Queens shed <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> {{after the}} nuptial flight, leaving visible stubs, a distinguishing feature of queens. In a few species, wingless queens (ergatoids) and males occur.|$|E
5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping <b>their</b> <b>wings,</b> sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{flight of}} giant petrels is {{aided by a}} shoulder-lock that holds <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> out without effort.|$|R
50|$|When foraging, {{their flight}} paths are low and direct. They fly with slow, deep wingbeats {{interspersed}} with periods of gliding. It usually feeds over water and occasionally over land. They are insectivores, feeding {{almost exclusively on}} flying insects. Although this is true, there is a report of some feeding on cracked corn. To drink, they skim {{the surface of the}} water with <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> and then drink on <b>their</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1938, three Gloster Gladiators flew with <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> tips tied together. Formation {{aerobatics}} largely stopped {{during the}} Second World War.|$|R
5|$|Early species had long, fully toothed {{jaws and}} long tails, while later forms had a highly reduced tail, and some lacked teeth. Many sported furry coats {{made up of}} hair-like {{filaments}} known as pycnofibers, which covered their bodies and parts of <b>their</b> <b>wings.</b> Pterosaurs spanned {{a wide range of}} adult sizes, from the very small anurognathids to the largest known flying creatures of all time, including Quetzalcoatlus and Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
5|$|If seen {{flying at}} a {{distance}} from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger common ravens (C. corax) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads. They also fluff their throat feathers when calling like fish crows, only more so. Ravens also soar for extended periods, unlike crows, which rarely fly more than a few seconds without flapping <b>their</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many Gobioolithus minor {{specimens}} contain embryonic {{remains of}} the enantiornithine genus Gobipipus. The embryos have well-ossified skeletons, implying that they were at a late stage in development when they died. <b>Their</b> <b>wings</b> and shoulders are especially well-developed. Only the modern megapodes and the little tern exhibit a comparable degree of embryonic ossification in the arm and shoulder bones. It is likely that Gobipipus hatchlings, like megapodes and little terns, {{would be able to}} fly very soon after hatching.|$|E
50|$|During World War I, Nieuport {{aircraft}} {{were sometimes}} referred to by <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> area (in square meters) rather than their official designations.|$|R
50|$|The Scorpion was {{designed}} as an advanced cross country glider. The models are each named for <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> area in square metres.|$|R
50|$|Sonication {{can also}} refer to buzz {{pollination}} - {{the process that}} bees use to shake pollen from flowers by vibrating <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> muscles.|$|R
5|$|Procellariids {{generally}} have weak legs that are set back, and many species move around on land by {{resting on the}} breast and pushing themselves forward, often {{with the help of}} <b>their</b> <b>wings.</b> The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). The feet of shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little use when on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were moved}} {{on a system}} of wheeled trolleys running on Décauville rails that extended throughout each half-hangar to the quarterdeck {{at the rear of}} the ship. The torpedo bombers would be moved to the quarterdeck where <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> would be extended and then they would be lowered into the water by the large crane at the very stern of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} {{is usually}} seen singly {{or in small}} groups as it stalks about in shallow lakes or drying lake beds and garbage dumps. It is often found {{in the company of}} kites and vultures and will sometimes sit hunched still for long durations. They may also hold <b>their</b> <b>wings</b> outstretched, presumably to control their temperature. They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings.|$|E
5000|$|Free-tailed bats, {{unlike other}} bats, have tails that are {{detached}} from <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> membrances. Species include the European free-tailed bat, La Touche's free-tailed bat and the wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bat.|$|R
50|$|Before they dive, {{they collect}} air bubbles in <b>their</b> <b>wing</b> cases which {{goes through the}} spiracles. The jaws of a great diving beetle are strong {{compared}} to their body size.|$|R
50|$|Non-breeding {{birds of}} this species have greenish heads, dark-streaked greenish upperparts and {{yellowish}} breasts, with the yellow extending to the belly in young birds. <b>Their</b> <b>wing</b> bars are always present.|$|R
