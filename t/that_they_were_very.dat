25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} he was {{involved}} in underground activity against the Shah's regime, calling for the 1954 Majlis elections to be free and fair and attempting to revive the nationalist movement. In 1960, the Second National Front was formed and Bakhtiar {{played a crucial role in}} the new organization's activities as the head of the student activist body of the Front. He and his colleagues differed from most other government opponents in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> moderate, restricting their activity to peaceful protest and calling only for the restoration of democratic rights within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. The Shah refused to co-operate and outlawed the Front and imprisoned the most prominent liberals. From 1964 to 1977, the imperial regime refused to permit any form of opposition activity, even from moderate liberals like Bakhtiar. In the following years Bakhtiar was imprisoned repeatedly, a total of six years, for his opposition to the Shah. He was also one of the prominent members of central council of the illegal Fourth National Front in late 1977, when the group was reconstituted as the Union of National Front Forces with Bakhtiar as head of the Iran Party (the largest group in the Front).|$|E

25|$|The {{second part}} of the season started in early March, after nearly three months pause due to the winter break. Maribor played their first spring match in Kranj where they were {{surprisingly}} defeated by Triglav, a team {{from the bottom of the}} table. The club then faced Domžale and Mura 05 in two consecutive home matches. Maribor defeated both of them and won all six points available. They then faced their rivals Olimpija at the Stožice Stadium, where the club suffered their highest defeat of the season when they were defeated 4–1 in the seventh round. In front of 8,000 spectators Maribor pressed from the start and Velikonja scored in the sixth minute. The score did not change until early in the second half when Cvijanović increased Maribor's lead, with a superb long distance effort. During the rest of the match, which was at one point suspended for about ten minutes due to crowd trouble, Olimpija tried to make a comeback and in the 88th minute they lowered the score with a penalty shot by Dare Vršič. However, this was not enough as the time eventually ran out and Maribor won with the score 2–1. The club increased their league on the table to over 20 points and it was clear <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> close in securing their 10th title. Maribor then won their fourth consecutive match when they defeated Celje 3–1, at home. History repeated itself in early April when Maribor traveled to the Primorska region to face Koper and Gorica in two consecutive away games for the second time in the season. Similarly to the two matches in September, Maribor again only managed to win two points in Koper and Nova Gorica. The team bounced back, however, and managed to win the next seven consecutive matches, making the longest winning run of any club during the 2011–12 Slovenian PrvaLiga season. During this period Maribor scored 26 goals and conceded only four. In addition, the run included two dominant home victories over Nafta 6–0 and Triglav 8–0, and also a 3–2 victory over Olimpija. The win over Triglav in the 31st round also secured the title and Maribor became the first club in history of the PrvaLiga, who won the title with five rounds remaining.|$|E

500|$|It is {{difficult}} to fit chancelloriids into classifications of sponges or more complex animals. An analysis in 1996 concluded that they were closely related to sponges {{on the grounds that}} the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites ("armor plates") is similar to that of fibers of spongin, a collagen protein, in [...] modern keratose (horny) demosponges such as Darwinella. However another analysis in 2002 concluded that chancelloriids are not sponges and may be intermediate between sponges and more complex animals, among other reasons because their skins were thicker and more tightly connected than those of sponges. In 2008 a detailed analysis of chancelloriids' sclerites concluded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> similar to those of halkieriids, mobile bilaterian animals that looked like slugs in chain mail and whose fossils are found in rocks from the very Early Cambrian to the Mid Cambrian. If this is correct, it would create a dilemma, as it is extremely unlikely that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the huge difference in the structures of their bodies makes it hard to see how they could be closely related.|$|E

500|$|As no {{complete}} dodo specimens exist, its external appearance, such as plumage and colouration, {{is hard to}} determine. Illustrations {{and written}} accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (1598–1662) are the primary evidence for its external appearance. According to most representations, the dodo had greyish or brownish plumage, with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end. The head was grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and yellowish, with black claws. Subfossil remains and remnants of the birds that were brought to Europe in the 17th century show <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> large birds, [...] tall, and possibly weighing up to [...] The higher weights {{have been attributed to}} birds in captivity; weights in the wild were estimated to have been in the range [...] A later estimate gives an average weight as low as [...] This has been questioned, and there is still some controversy.

500|$|At E3 2014, Ubisoft {{executive}} Tony Key claimed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> {{satisfied with}} the sales of the first game, and that the brand would {{be turned into a}} long-running franchise. According to creative director Jonathan Morin, the first game's main goal was to establish the Watch Dogs brand. It was intended that they take risks with the sequel, instead of creating a more polished version of the previous game. To improve the game, Morin and his team read the reviews of the first game, and visited NeoGAF and various forums to study player feedback. Their priorities included creating a [...] "believable" [...] environment, giving players more freedom, and introducing a new leading character, whose personality would be completely {{different from that of the}} protagonist of the first game, Aiden Pearce. The primary developer Ubisoft Montreal worked with other subsidiaries Ubisoft Toronto, Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft Bucharest, Ubisoft Kiev and Ubisoft Reflections to aid in the production. The driving mechanic was completely overhauled to make it more accessible to players, and was developed by Ubisoft Reflections, the developer of Ubisoft's own Driver series. In light of complaints about a graphical downgrade in Watch Dogs from what was seen at E3 2012, Ubisoft assured that Watch Dogs 2 would not suffer the same outcome because, unlike the first installment, it was developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from the start. Another improvement from the first game was a more prominent thematic connection to the narrative. Main operations are structured like story arcs that last up to ninety minutes each, advancing the plot with each completion.|$|E
