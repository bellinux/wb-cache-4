A sequel, South Park: The Fractured but Whole, was announced in June 2015. The game was developed by Ubisoft San Francisco, replacing Obsidian Entertainment, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. The sequel was released worldwide on October 17, 2017 to generally positive reviews. In it, the player again controls the New Kid, joining the children of South Park as they role-play superheroes.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet of the Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
5|$|Isaac {{began to}} curve northwestward {{due to its}} {{location}} between a large deep-layer low pressure area in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and a mid-tropospheric ridge over the western Atlantic. After briefly moving into the Gulf of Gonâve, the tropical storm made a second landfall near Cajobabo, Guantánamo, in Cuba at 1500UTC later on August25, where damages were comparatively less severe than in Haiti. The storm paralleled the northern coast of the island prior <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> close pass of Key West, Florida, where it caused minor flood damage across the Florida Keys and South Florida upon entry into the Gulf of Mexico. The threat of tropical cyclone impacts in Tampa forced the postponing of the 2012 Republican National Convention. In the gulf, the tropical storm curved to the northwest and attained hurricane strength on August27 near the southern Louisiana coast. Another ridge of high pressure caused Isaac to move towards the west and slow down as it made two landfalls on the state. Once it moved inland, the hurricane weakened before dissipating over Missouri on September1.|$|E
5|$|John Jeremy Thorpe {{was born}} in 1929, the son and {{grandson}} of Conservative MPs. After school at Eton, he studied law at Trinity College, Oxford, where, having decided on a political career, he devoted his main energies <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> personal impact rather than to his studies. Rejecting his Conservative background, he joined the small, centrist Liberal Party, by the late 1940s a declining force in British politics but still offering a national platform and a challenge to an ambitious young politician. He became secretary, and eventually president, of the university's Liberal Club, and met many of the party's leading figures. In the Hilary term (January–March) of 1950–51 Thorpe {{served as president of}} the Oxford Union.|$|E

MS172 leaves Iuka and heads back into forests as an unnamed road, running a short distance to the southwest of a Norfolk Southern railroad line. Further southeast, the route draws closer to US72 and curves to the east, passing a few fields. MS172 makes a sharp turn south away from the railroad tracks and comes to its eastern terminus at US72 immediately west of the Alabama border near Oldham. MS172 is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3.|$|E
5|$|The 1920 Louisiana {{hurricane}} was {{a strong}} tropical cyclone that caused significant damage in parts of Louisiana in September1920. The second tropical storm and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, it formed from an area of disturbed weather on September16, 1920, northwest of Colombia. The system remained a weak tropical depression as it made landfall on Nicaragua, but later intensified to tropical storm strength as it moved across the Gulf of Honduras, prior <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> second landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, the storm quickly intensified as it moved towards the north-northwest, reaching its peak intensity as a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (160km/h) prior to making landfall near Houma, Louisiana with no change in intensity. Afterwards, it quickly weakened over land, before dissipating on September23 over eastern Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The Effects of Hurricane Isaac in Florida were severe local {{flooding}} in South Florida and tornadoes {{in the central}} and northern portions {{of the state in}} August2012. Hurricane Isaac formed from a tropical wave while located east of the Lesser Antilles on August21, 2012. The storm moved westward, crossed through the Leeward Islands, and entered the Caribbean Sea on August22. Isaac initially struggled to intensify and defied predictions of it strengthening into a hurricane. The storm made its first landfall in Haiti as a midgrade tropical storm prior <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> second one in Cuba later that day. It remained somewhat disorganized while moving through the Straits of Florida and passed near the Florida Keys on August27. The storm threatened to strike the Tampa Bay Area during the 2012 Republican National Convention and move ashore in the Florida Panhandle as a major hurricane. However, it continued northwestward and avoided landfall in the state. The storm finally became a hurricane late on August28. Isaac made two landfalls in Louisiana on August29, the first near the mouth of the Mississippi River and the other near Port Fourchon. The storm steadily weakened and eventually dissipated over Missouri on September1.|$|E

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public has been reduced <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of {{the homes of the}} ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not feel confident that he could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and oversteer en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.|$|E
