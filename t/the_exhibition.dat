The methods {{used in the study}} are Thick Description and Wera Grahn’s analyticcal tool, Five Questions to an <b>Exhibition.</b> As <b>the</b> theoretical foundations of my study I have used Hirdman's gender system and Butler’s concepts of performance and the heterosexual matrix.   The results of the study show that women and men are displayed in different places in <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions.</b> <b>The</b> language and the way of speaking about women in <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> often differed from how the men were presented. It also became clear that there were few items related to women in <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions.</b> Based on how women {{are represented in}} <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions,</b> one can conclude that museums are part of the gender system as maintainers and co-creators...|$|R

5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for <b>the</b> <b>Exhibition</b> of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> in Hyde Park. Opponents of <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E

5|$|Aquarists also {{propagate}} animals {{behind the}} scenes for the aquarium’s exhibits. Since 1985, the aquarium has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent aquarium gallery within the Open Sea wing. In August 2016, aquarists cultured comb jellies {{for the first time}} in a laboratory, which may allow them to become a model organism. For the aquarium's temporary exhibition that opened in 2014, the aquarium cultured many cephalopods because of their short life cycles. A display in <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> showcased how aquarists rear different species of cephalopods, including the bigfin reef squid. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea cephalopod species have been displayed in <b>the</b> <b>exhibition,</b> including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.|$|E

40|$|The {{cultural}} venue of European <b>exhibitions</b> in <b>the</b> late-nineteenth century {{enabled the}} promotion of the modern nationhoods of imperial powers. This study examines the official attempts of Britain to project its imperial power and modern nationhood through exhibits of colonial Indian “tradition ” in London. It traces the historical dynamics of such Indian displays in three exhibitions: the 1886 Colonial and Indian <b>Exhibition,</b> <b>the</b> 1908 Franco-British <b>Exhibition,</b> and <b>the</b> 1924 Empire <b>Exhibition.</b> <b>The</b> juxtaposition of Indian “tradition ” and British “modernity ” at <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> denoted India’s inferior “difference ” from Britain, and thus the necessity of imperial rule in India. <b>The</b> <b>exhibitions</b> also evidenced <b>the</b> tensions of such notions with those of Indian modernity, especially by the inter-war period. Chapter One examines how the spatial and architectural landscapes of <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> made visible <b>the</b> hierarchies of British imperial rule in India. Chapter Two discusses exhibits of India’s supposedly pre-industrial socio-economic conditions. Chapter Three assesses the ethnography of <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions,</b> and how they denoted the racial inferiority of Indian “natives ” {{at the same time that}} the...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{analyzes}} {{the content and}} intermediation in two Swedish museums’ <b>exhibitions</b> about <b>The</b> Great Migration by using the didactic questions what, how and why. Using observations and interviews as methods, the results are compared afterwards to the Upper Secondary school’s national curriculum and to the concepts of learning and knowledge, by applying the theories of Arfwedsons and Hein. These theories help the reader to understand to what level <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> give <b>the</b> visitors possibilities to produce their own learning and knowledge or if <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> have a claim to present the truth and want the information to be reproduced by the visitors. In simplified terms, the study investigates how justified a school visit is to one of <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> for <b>the</b> various history courses. The conclusions show that <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> differ among themselves, which will make school visits relevant in different ways, depending on which exhibition and which history course you have in mind. One of <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> focus on showing The Great Migration from a local history perspective and with connections to today’s refugees while <b>the</b> other <b>exhibition</b> instead makes an effort to show the same migration through several perspectives, {{on all kinds of}} levels in society. Based on the results and the connections to the school’s curriculum a conclusion can be made: The more advanced a course is, the more relevant it becomes for schools to visit <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions.</b> Having put <b>the</b> concepts of learning and knowledge into the results, the study shows that both exhibitions have a claim to present the truth and in that way sees the visitors as reproducers of that information. Aside from the fact that only one of <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> intermediate through different kinds of channels, both exhibitions lack in source criticism giving the visitors no chance of questioning the material. ...|$|R
