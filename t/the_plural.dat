5|$|In English, when unit {{names are}} {{combined}} to denote multiplication {{of the units}} concerned, they are separated with a hyphen or a space (e.g. newton-metre or newton metre). <b>The</b> <b>plural</b> is formed by converting the last unit name to <b>the</b> <b>plural</b> form (e.g. ten newton-metres).|$|E

5|$|Hananu's {{subordinate}} {{officers and}} rank-and-file fighters were all Sunni Muslims, but were ethnically heterogeneous. Hananu {{himself was a}} Kurd as were field commanders Najib Uwaid and Abdullah ibn Umar, while Umar al-Bitar was an Arab and field commander Sha'ban Agha was a Turk. The ′isabat led by al-Bitar and al-Qassam were dominated by Arabs. The localized nature of the revolt reflected the rebels' sense of defending their homeland and community. Despite the eventual organization of the revolt and coordination between rebel commanders for major military decisions, most political decisions and military operations were local initiatives. As such, al-Sa'dun referred to the revolt in <b>the</b> <b>plural</b> as thawrat al-Shimal (Northern revolts) rather than the singular thawra, and referred to {{the leadership of the}} revolt as <b>the</b> <b>plural</b> quwwad al-thawra rather than qiyadat al-thawra, which refers to a central command.|$|E
5|$|Most count nouns are inflected for plural number {{through the}} use of <b>the</b> <b>plural</b> suffix -s, but a few nouns have {{irregular}} plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised {{through the use}} of a count noun classifier, e.g. one loaf of bread, two loaves of bread.|$|E

5|$|English verbs are inflected for {{tense and}} aspect, and marked for {{agreement}} with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb {{to be is}} still inflected for agreement with <b>the</b> <b>plural</b> and first and second person subjects. Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in {{that they can be}} followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} the 20th century that a common, {{standardized}} national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, {{with the exception of}} some minor deviations, {{by the time of the}} spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. <b>The</b> <b>plural</b> verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.|$|E
5|$|The euro {{is divided}} into 100 cents (sometimes {{referred}} to as euro cents, especially when distinguishing them from other currencies, and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins). In Community legislative acts <b>the</b> <b>plural</b> forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s, notwithstanding normal English usage. Otherwise, normal English plurals are sometimes used, with many local variations such as centime in France.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{making a}} rapid recovery, the Belgian Workers' Party was still penalized by the Belgian electoral system, which based {{suffrage}} on wealth, stopping {{most of the}} party's support base among industrial workers from voting. In August 1885, the party began its Antwerp Programme, which called for universal suffrage while confirming the party's intention to pursue its goals through parliamentary democracy rather than revolution. The culmination of this policy was the 1893 Belgian General Strike, involving some 250,000 workers. Fearing a revolution, the government adopted universal male suffrage in 1894, but only with plural voting, which allowed up to two additional votes for wealthy or educated citizens. Nevertheless, {{the percentage of the}} population eligible to vote rose from 3.9 to 37.3 percent, and in the 1894 elections the socialists won 28 of 152 seats. The Belgian Workers' Party called two further unsuccessful general strikes in 1902 and 1913 in an attempt to end <b>the</b> <b>plural</b> voting system.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plural</b> form of {{the common}} name {{narcissus}} has caused some confusion. British English sources such as the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary give two alternate forms, narcissi and narcissuses. In contrast, in American English the Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides for a third form, narcissus, used for both singular and plural. The Oxford dictionaries only list this third form under American English, although the Cambridge Dictionary allows of all three in the same order. However, Garner's Modern American Usage states that narcissi is the commonest form, narcissus being excessively sibilant. For similar reasons, Fowler prefers narcissi in British English usage. Neither support narcissus as a plural form. Common names such as narcissus do not capitalise the first letter {{in contrast to the}} person of that name and the Latin genus name.|$|E
5|$|The {{published}} work was criticised {{on the grounds}} that the unmodified potatoes were not a fair control diet and that any rats fed only potatoes would suffer from protein deficiency. Pusztai responded to these criticisms by saying that all the experimental diets had the same protein and energy content, and that the food intake of all rats was the same. In an interview, Pickett later said that Lancet editor Richard Horton must have had a political motive for publishing the paper because the referees had rejected it. According to Pusztai this claim was repeated by academic critics who assumed that Pickett's use of <b>the</b> <b>plural</b> suggested that the study had failed peer review.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> {{nominative}} <b>plural</b> of hryvnia is hryvni (...) , while <b>the</b> genitive <b>plural</b> is hryven′ (...) [...] In Ukrainian, <b>the</b> nominative <b>plural</b> form is {{used for}} numbers ending with 2, 3, or 4, as in dvi hryvni (дві гривні, [...] "2 hryvni"), and <b>the</b> genitive <b>plural</b> {{is used for}} numbers ending with 5 to 9 and 0, for example sto hryven’ (сто гривень, [...] "100 hryven’"); for numbers ending with 1 the nominative singular form is used, for example dvadtsiat’ odna hryvnia (двадцять одна гривня, [...] "21 hryvnia"). An exception for this rule is numbers ending in 11, 12, 13 and 14 for which <b>the</b> genitive <b>plural</b> is also used, for example, dvanadtsiat’ hryven’ (дванадцять гривень, [...] "12 hryven’").

25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>plural</b> is not {{one that}} is formed by adding s, an s is added for the possessive, after the apostrophe: children’s hats, women’s hairdresser, some people’s eyes (but compare some peoples’ recent {{emergence}} into nationhood, where peoples is meant as <b>the</b> <b>plural</b> of the singular people).

50|$|<b>The</b> {{most common}} <b>plural</b> form in English is descended from <b>the</b> {{masculine}} nominative-accusative <b>plural</b> (Old English -as) {{and is also}} cognate with <b>the</b> Old Saxon <b>plural</b> -os and <b>the</b> Old Norse <b>plural</b> -ar. However, <b>the</b> widespread use of <b>the</b> -s <b>plural</b> may suggest French influence.
