In this paper, we propose a new method of text steganography, called MIMIC-PPT, which combines text mimicking technique with characteristics of PPT documents. Firstly, a dictionary and some <b>sentence</b> templates <b>are</b> automatically created by parsing the body text of a PPT document. Then, cryptographic information is converted into innocuous <b>sentences</b> by using <b>the</b> dictionary and <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> templates. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> <b>written</b> into <b>the</b> note pages of the PPT document. With MIMIC-PPT, {{there is no need for}} the communication parties to share <b>the</b> dictionary and <b>sentence</b> templates while <b>the</b> efficiency and security are greatly improved...|$|R

It is proposed to model the elementary meanings which assist the machine to autonomously undertake the analysis and synthesis processes of meaning. Approach: In the proposed methodology, the disambiguation process was performed in context manner. Starting from natural text, the context of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> identified, then <b>the</b> actual meaning identified using correlation of elementary object meanings existed in object-net database. It was because even ambiguous word will have only one meaning based on the context or object or domain on which <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> <b>written.</b> Results: This object-net approach disambiguates original text with high precision of 96 % of the verbs and 97 % of nouns for data extraction from the database and reporting in terms of graphs. Conclusion: The accuracy of finding {{the sense of a}} word and extracting data from the database and projecting into graphs was based on number of trained objects in object-net database.
