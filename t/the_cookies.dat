5|$|Though {{the episode}} itself was penned by Jeremy Carver, the writing staff contributed their {{ideas to the}} storyline. Within five minutes of brainstorming, they envisioned three scenes they had to do: the teaser, where a {{grandfather}} pretending to be Santa is pulled up the chimney and slaughtered; a boy witnessing the Santa-dressed villain brutally killing his father and then eating one of <b>the</b> <b>cookies</b> for Santa; and the Winchesters killing someone with a Christmas tree.|$|E

25|$|Before any procedures, the oreo {{cookies are}} frozen for 3 hours {{and the oil}} is {{preheated}} to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

25|$|Each Girl Scout council {{operates}} its own cookie sale. Approximately 70% of {{the proceeds}} stay in the local Girl Scout council to support Girl Scouting in that area, including a portion, approximately 15%, that goes directly to the group selling <b>the</b> <b>cookies.</b> The profits are divided by a formula, with local troops receiving about 10-15% of the retail price, the council more than 50%, and the manufacturer the remainder. In 1992 Girl Scouts sold 175 million boxes of cookies nationwide.|$|E
25|$|Another cross-site {{vulnerability}} is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser {{into taking}} actions the user didn't intend at a target site (like transferring {{money at a}} bank). It works because, if the target site relies only on cookies to authenticate requests, then requests initiated by code on the attacker's site will carry the same legitimate login credentials as requests initiated by the user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in <b>the</b> <b>cookies,</b> to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.|$|E

25|$|In 2012 and 2013, Google reached two {{settlements}} over tracking consumers online {{without their}} knowledge after bypassing privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser.

The second was a November 2013 settlement for $17 million with 37 states and the District of Columbia. In addition to the fines, Google agreed to avoid using software that overrides a browser's cookie-blocking settings, to avoid omitting or misrepresenting information to consumers about how they use Google products or control the ads they see, to maintain for five years a web page explaining what cookies are and how to control them, {{and to ensure that}} <b>the</b> <b>cookies</b> tied to Safari browsers expire.

25|$|Hazumu's parents, {{her father}} , {{and her mother}} , are almost always shown {{together}} throughout the series. When Hazumu goes missing after getting rejected from Yasuna, both of Hazumu's parents are completely distraught, and {{do not know what}} to do. After Hazumu's transformation, both parents become overjoyed to have a daughter in place of a son which is shown through their eccentricities. Toru works as a magazine photographer and loves to take pictures of Hazumu any chance he gets; often this is after his wife has already dressed Hazumu in some feminine garment. Additionally, Hazumu's father repeatedly attempts to take a bath with Hazumu, but is always stopped by his wife. Kahoru loves to buy feminine clothes for Hazumu to wear, and buys these clothes without consulting Hazumu herself, though regardless she finds herself wearing them anyway. Directly after Hazumu turned into a girl, her mother even goes ahead and buys her a female school uniform to wear from now on. Hazumu becomes annoyed by her parents' new behavior toward her, and finds trying on her new clothes very tiring. When Hazumu bakes cookies for the first time, Kahoru loves it, but Toru simply wolfs down most of <b>the</b> <b>cookies</b> for himself. Since his mother had always wanted a daughter instead of son, she often dressed Hazumu up in young girl's clothes, saying that gender discrimination is not a good thing.|$|E

[...] "Ramen Rock" [...] was inspired by Taneda's habit of eating ramen after every show.
