However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> their trial phase and diminished as conflict grew in {{the region in the}} early 1980s.

At 5–4 up on Ronnie O'Sullivan in the semis, Fu got a huge kick on a red when in the balls and also missed a green with the rest later on as O'Sullivan levelled and then made a 130 break in the deciding frame to win. Before the end of 2016, Fu reached the final of the Scottish Open, with his closest game being a 4–3 victory over Neil Robertson in the fourth round as Fu did not lose more than a frame in his other five matches. In the final John Higgins opened the match with three centuries, before Fu added one of his own. He came from 4–1 down by winning eight frames in a row to land his third ranking tournament title. Throughout the tournament, Fu made 11 centuries and 21 more breaks over 50 in seven matches.|$|E

500|$|The 18-foot (5.5m) high Roman wall {{enclosing}} the City put {{the fleeing}} homeless {{at risk of}} being shut into the inferno. Once the riverfront was on fire and the escape route cut off by boat, the only exits were the eight gates in the wall. During the first couple of days, few people had any notion of fleeing the burning City altogether. They would remove what they could carry of their belongings to the nearest [...] "safe house", in many cases the parish church or the precincts of St Paul's Cathedral, only to have to move again hours later. Some moved their belongings and themselves [...] "four and five times" [...] in a single day. The perception of a need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> the walls only took root late on the Monday, and then there were near-panic scenes at the narrow gates as distraught refugees tried to get out with their bundles, carts, horses, and wagons.|$|E
500|$|Basehead {{released}} its debut album, Play with Toys in 1992 {{on the small}} independent label Emigre. Vocalist Michael Ivey recorded much of the album at his home on a four-track with various friends. The album received favorable reviews and frequent airplay on college radio. Rolling Stone reviewer Kevin Powell wrote that [...] "Without being preachy, Basehead's unconventional style challenges listeners <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> their basic instincts and open their minds, search their souls." [...] Assembling a five-member touring band, Ivey toured the United States and Europe, opening for the Beastie Boys, Stone Temple Pilots, and Ween. [...] After College Music Journal featured Basehead on its cover, the group received attention from major labels, and signed with Imago Records, a former subsidiary of BMG the following year, releasing its second studio album, Not in Kansas Anymore. Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith called the album [...] "an alternative to the benign bullshit music that floods the chain stores and commercial radio waves." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "Although it retains {{many of the same}} qualities of their critically acclaimed debut [...] there's nothing that has the same sense of discovery that made Play with Toys an interesting record." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Third Way was {{not just}} a work of {{abstract}} theory, but influenced a range of left of centre political parties across the world – [...] in Europe, the US, Latin America and Australasia. Although close to New Labour in the UK, Giddens dissociated himself from many of the interpretations of the third way made in the sphere of day-to-day politics. For him it was not a succumbing to neoliberalism or the dominance of markets. The point was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> both free market fundamentalism and traditional top down socialism – to make the values of the centre-left count in a globalising world. He argued that ‘the regulation of financial markets is the single most pressing issue in the world economy’ and that ‘global commitment to free trade depends upon effective regulation rather than dispenses with the need for it’.|$|E

When the weather broke, the next attack had to be postponed until 7 October, when six British and a French division attacked and mostly failed except at Le Sars, because the lack of air reconnaissance led to an inaccurate bombardment, German reverse-slope defences had disguised new defences and long-range machine-gun fire was not suppressed by the creeping barrage. On 12 October, the Fourth Army attacked with five divisions and had similar results, with some battalions managing to advance [...] but none gaining the first objective, due to the weather hampering air reconnaissance and artillery-observation and because German long-range machine-gun fire came from guns dispersed evenly around the battlefield to evade British artillery bombardments.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{separate}} museum district within Budapest was a Fidesz campaign platform during the 2010 elections. It included plans for the area from the Western Railway Station to the current Museum of Fine Arts, located on Heroes' Square, to house a newly built Museum of Hungarian Modern Art, {{as well as a}} House of Europe for all the countries represented on the continent. The Museum of Ethnography would also be moved to this newly planned district. The project was intended by the party to [...] "serve as a cultural–touristic–gastronomic centre with an exhibition and music hall and information centre" [...] and be realized over a period of 15 years. [...] The proposal was unveiled by István Tarlós, who at the time was chairman of the Fidesz party and who became mayor of Budapest later that same year. Consequently, a consensus developed during a series of professional debates that a museum master plan was essential because there was a real need for: a modern 21st century institution; an emphasis to collect and exhibit 20th century Hungarian art in an international context; and the expansion of media to include architecture, design, photography and media arts. Speculation by the press as to why none of these proposals seemed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> the discussion and debate stage included the observation that [...] "the prevailing cultural policy since the political transformation has been to continue with the old model — that is, the use of direct control instead of a structural transformation based on dialogue".|$|E
