5000|$|Linus <b>Pauling</b> {{proposed}} <b>that</b> DNA {{might be}} a triple helix. This hypothesis was also considered by Francis Crick and James D. Watson but discarded. When Watson and Crick learned of Pauling's hypothesis, they understood from existing data <b>that</b> <b>Pauling</b> was wrong and <b>that</b> <b>Pauling</b> would soon admit his difficulties with that structure.

5000|$|The heptazine {{derivative}} with an azide substituent and two hydroxyl {{groups is}} called Linus Pauling's mystery molecule. It {{is the last}} molecule he drew on his chalkboard (preserved for posterity) before he died in 1994. Two theories attempt to lift the mystery. It is suggested <b>that</b> <b>Pauling</b> failed to solve the double helix structure of DNA before Watson and Crick because he viewed uracil as an amide and not as the tautomeric hydroxy compound. The other theory suggests <b>that</b> <b>Pauling</b> intended to use the compound as a potential spectroscopic label for binding to DNA.

5000|$|Defenders of this view, such as Ronald Fung, {{disagree}} with both parts of Lightfoot's statement, insisting a) Paul received his [...] "Apostolic Office" [...] at his conversion (Gal. 1:15-17; Ac. 9). Fung holds, then, <b>that</b> <b>Paul's</b> apostolic mission began almost immediately in Damascus (Acts 9:20).

Historical accounts of Chicago claim <b>that</b> <b>Paul</b> Schulze, 1910-11 {{president of the}} National Association of Master Bakers, started the Schulze Baking Company in 1893 with his brothers.

2500|$|The Bible says <b>that</b> <b>Paul's</b> {{conversion}} {{experience was}} {{an encounter with}} the resurrected Christ.
