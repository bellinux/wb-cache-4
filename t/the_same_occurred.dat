On one occasion the governor asked him to certify (on behalf of the Royal Guinea Company) that a ship had not returned, after it arrived from St. Thomas loaded with an illegal haul, but Enríquez refused to commit fraud.

500|$|From 825 {{control of}} Kent {{fell to the}} kings of Wessex, and a {{compromise}} was reached between Archbishop Ceolnoth and King Egbert in 838, confirmed by his son Æthelwulf in 839, recognising Egbert and Æthelwulf as [...] lords and protectors of monasteries and reserving spiritual lordship, particularly over election of abbots and abbesses, to bishops. One copy of the record of this agreement was preserved either at Reculver or at Lyminge. A factor leading to this abandonment of Wulfred's strict policy {{may have been the}} increasing intensity of Viking attacks, which had begun in Kent in the late 8th century and had seen the ravaging of the Isle of Sheppey in 835. An army of Vikings spent the winter of 851 on the Isle of Thanet and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>occurred</b> on the Isle of Sheppey in 855.

In a charter of 949 King Eadred of England gave Reculver back to the archbishops of Canterbury, at which time the estate included Hoath and Herne, land at Sarre, in Thanet, and land at Chilmington, about [...] south-west of Reculver.|$|E
2500|$|Some writers {{say that}} {{towards the end}} his reign, Kulottunga lost the {{province}} of Gangavadi to Hoysala Vishnuvardhana who attacked this major Chola province (c. 1116 CE) in Kannada country from the times of and defeated the Chola Viceroy Adigaiman, the controller of Kongu and Kannada country there, but this proposition seems to stand on very fragile ground considering the massive power of chola empire during the period and its domination of Asia during Kulottunga's time. The disintegration of empire seem to have begun only after the rule of Kulottunga Chola III (1178–1216 CE), who was once again praised as a very powerful ruler and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>occurred</b> not due to the excellence or power of the enemies but due to vicissitudes of time only.

6000|$|Wonderful {{feats of}} rain-prophecy are done by Australian seers, {{according}} to Mrs. Langloh Parker and others. As {{soon as we}} meet Zeus in Homer, we find that he is looked on, not as the sky, but as the deity who [...] "dwells in the heights of air," [...] and who exercises supreme sway over all things, including storm and wind and cloud. He casts the lightning forth (--------) he thunders on high (--------), he has dark clouds for his covering (--------) all these imposing aspects he is religiously regarded by people who approach him in prayer. These aspects would be readily explained by the theory that Zeus, after having been the personal sky, came to be thought a powerful being who dwelt in the sky, {{if we did not}} find such beings worshipped where the sky is not yet adored, as in Australia. Much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>occurred</b> if, as M. Maspero points out, in Egypt the animals were worshipped first, and then later the gods supposed to be present in the animals. So the sky, a personal sky, was first adored, later a god dwelling in the sky. But it is less easy to show how this important change in opinion took place, if it really occurred. A philological theory of the causes which produced the change is set forth by Mr. Keary in his book Primitive Belief. In his opinion the sky was first worshipped as a vast non-personal phenomenon, [...] "the bright thing"(Dyaus). But, to adopt the language of Mr. Max Müller, who appears to hold the same views, [...] "Dyaus ceased to be an expressive predicate; it became a traditional name";* it [...] "lost its radical meaning". Thus where a man had originally said, [...] "It thunders," [...] or rather [...] "He thunders," [...] he came to say, [...] "Dyaus" [...] (that is, the sky) [...] "thunders".|$|E
