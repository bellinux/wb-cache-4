Cephalopods such as European squid (Loligo vulgaris) and elegant cuttlefish (Sepia elegans) are a minor secondary food source. There {{is a single}} record of an individual that had swallowed a penaeid prawn, Penaeus kerathurus, and a study of captive rays found that they reject live Macropodia crabs.

50|$|The shore {{rockling}} is often {{confused with the}} five-bearded rockling (Ciliata mustela) and the larger <b>three-bearded</b> <b>rockling</b> (Gaidropsarus vulgaris), due to their similar colourings, shape, and habitat. As the name suggests, the main visual differences are the five-bearded rockling having five barbels around its mouth, whereas the <b>three-bearded</b> <b>rockling</b> has a significant redness to its brown colouring {{when compared to the}} {{shore rockling}}. Shore rocklings live in and around rocky areas throughout the English Channel, feeding on both worms and crustaceans. Other than in the English Channel, they are also found in the Atlantic (Europe) and Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|The <b>three-bearded</b> <b>rockling</b> (Gaidropsarus vulgaris) {{is found}} in European waters from the central Norwegian coast and the Faroe Islands, through the North Sea, and around the British Isles to the region around the western Mediterranean. They can grow to a maximum length of 60 cm (2 ft). Their {{coloration}} varies from dusky to pale, with large chocolate-brown spots {{on the head and}} body, and fin coloration varies with location. Three barbels, one on the bottom jaw and two on the snout, provide the fish with its common name.|$|E
