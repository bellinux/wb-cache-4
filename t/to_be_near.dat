5|$|The heat {{needed for}} geyser {{formation}} comes from magma that needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>near</b> {{the surface of}} the earth. The fact that geysers need heat much higher than normally found near the earth's surface is the reason they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas. The pressures encountered at the areas where the water is heated make the boiling point of the water much higher than at normal atmospheric pressures.|$|E
5|$|The spot-billed pelican has an {{estimated}} population between 13,000 and 18,000 {{and is considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Numbers declined substantially during the 20th century, one crucial factor being the eradication of the important Sittaung valley breeding colony in Burma through deforestation {{and the loss of}} feeding sites. The chief threats it faces are from habitat loss and human disturbance but populations have mostly stabilised following increased protection in India and Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|About 90 {{atoms of}} flerovium have been observed: 58 were {{synthesized}} directly, {{and the rest}} were made from the radioactive decay of heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms {{have been shown to}} have mass numbers from 284 to 290. The most stable known flerovium isotope, flerovium-289, has a half-life of around 2.6seconds, but {{it is possible that the}} unconfirmed flerovium-290 with one extra neutron may have a nuclear isomer with a longer half-life of 19seconds; this would be one of the longest half-lives of any isotope of any element at these farthest reaches of the periodic table. Flerovium is predicted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>near</b> the centre of the theorized island of stability, and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly doubly magic flerovium-298, may have even longer half-lives.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{speech or}} text is used {{anywhere}} in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the main menu, the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>near</b> the ending location of the previous one, and {{through the course of}} the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E

5|$|An {{advertisement}} in The Guardian led Rowling {{to move to}} Porto, Portugal, {{to teach}} English as a foreign language. She taught at night and began writing in the day while listening to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. After 18 months in Porto, she met Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar and found they shared an interest in Jane Austen. They married on 16 October 1992 and their child, Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford), was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal. Rowling had previously suffered a miscarriage. The couple separated on 17 November 1993. Biographers have suggested that Rowling suffered domestic abuse during her marriage, although the extent is unknown. In December 1993, Rowling and her then-infant daughter moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>near</b> Rowling's sister with three chapters of what would become Harry Potter in her suitcase.|$|E
5|$|During {{the penalty}} {{phase of the}} trial, Bundy took {{advantage}} of an obscure Florida law providing that a marriage declaration in court, {{in the presence of}} a judge, constituted a legal marriage. As he was questioning former Washington State DES coworker Carole Ann Boone—who had moved to Florida <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>near</b> Bundy, had testified on his behalf during both trials, and was again testifying on his behalf as a character witness—he asked her to marry him. She accepted, and Bundy declared to the court that they were legally married.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Funeral (2004), which had been {{recorded}} in an attic studio known as Hotel2Tango, Arcade Fire decided a permanent recording location was necessary. Following their tour in support of Funeral, the band bought the Petite Église in Farnham, Quebec. Being used as a café {{at the time of}} purchase, the Petite Église had once been a church and a Masonic Temple. Once renovation of the church was complete, the band spent the latter half of 2006 recording a majority of the album there. Michael Pärt produced additional recordings in Budapest, recording the Budapest Film Orchestra and a military men's choir. Other sessions included one in New York, where the band recorded along the Hudson River <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>near</b> water.|$|E

5|$|Harold Brighouse's play Hobson's Choice {{takes place}} in the Salford of 1880, and the 1954 film version was shot in the town. Walter Greenwood's 1933 novel Love on the Dole was set in a fictional area known as Hanky Park, said in the novel <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>near</b> Salford, but in reality based on Salford itself. A more modern fictional setting {{influenced}} by the area is Coronation Streets Weatherfield. The Salford of the 1970s was the setting for the BAFTA award winning East is East.
