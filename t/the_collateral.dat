25|$|Excessive {{tension on}} the tendons, ligaments, and joint {{capsules}} of the pastern area can strain the periosteum. The body compensates by growing bone at the stresspoint. Strain on the extensor tendon, the superficial digital flexor tendon branches, <b>the</b> <b>collateral</b> ligaments, and the distal sesamoidean ligaments are all common factors. If these tissues are stretched or torn, and the joint is instabilized by the injury, new bone is produced to help to stabilize the joint.|$|E
