5|$|A {{major change}} in the {{training}} programme occurred in 1943. From that point on training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in southeastern Laos was unlike any yet {{seen in the}} Vietnam War, since the PAVN abandoned its old hit-and-run tactics and launched a conventional counterattack. The PAVN first launched massed infantry attacks supported by armor and heavy artillery to crush ARVN positions on the flanks of the main advance. Coordinated anti-aircraft fire made <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> and resupply difficult and costly, with 108 helicopters shot down and 618 others damaged.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{existing}} {{command and control}} arrangement between the CIA, the AIRA, and the Seventh Air Force, the Air Force wielded little actual control over air support. In order to increase its dominance, {{a reduction in the}} role of the Raven FACS was called for. Instead, greater use was to be made of Nail FACs from Nakhon Phanom's 23rd <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Support</b> Squadron which had recently begun transitioning to OV-10 Bronco aircraft. In the end, the Nails made increasing appearances over Military Region 2, but they never seriously encroached on the role of the Ravens.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:50, 107mm rocket fire began impacting in {{the vicinity}} of LZ Hotel. Less than 10 minutes later, the LZ also received 82mm mortar fire. As soon as the Khmer Rouge fire commenced, the controllers in the zone notified the Air Force forward air controllers (FACs) flying overhead in 23d <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Support</b> Squadron OV-10s. The FACs immediately made low passes over the east bank of the Mekong, but could not spot any fire coming from known enemy positions in that location. At 10:59, the last element of 2nd Battalion 4th Marines left the zone and the last marine helicopter landed on the USS Okinawa at 12:15.|$|E
5|$|At 7 am on 7 April, the Viet Cong massed {{for another}} ground assault {{from the north}} and west of Lộc Ninh, with support from heavy artillery, tanks and armored {{personnel}} carriers. As the Viet Cong closed in, Vinh and his bodyguards ran out the opened gate and surrendered. Several South Vietnamese soldiers also tried to surrender, but they all returned to their positions after Smith stopped a South Vietnamese officer from raising a white T-shirt up the flagpole. By 8 am, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment was completely overwhelmed when the Viet Cong overran the southern compound with their superior numbers. At around 10 am, all <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> was called off in order to clear the way for B-52 strikes against Viet Cong formations west of Lộc Ninh. However, the B-52 strikes could not prevent the Viet Cong from overrunning Lộc Ninh. By 16:30, the Viet Cong were in complete control of Lộc Ninh District.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to halt the North Vietnamese assault, Luat ordered two squadrons of M-113 {{armoured}} personnel carriers to confront the enemy at Nga Sau, but {{they were forced to}} turn back by tanks from the North Vietnamese 3rd Tank Battalion, 273rd Armoured Regiment. At around 5:30pm, a South Vietnamese ranger battalion was forced to abandon the nearby installation at Dac Lac after continuous assaults from the 95B Regiment. In the northeast, the South Vietnamese 9th Ranger Battalion held off the North Vietnamese 95B Regiment until they abandoned their positions on the next day. In the western outskirts of Ban Me Thuot, eight A-37 Dragonfly bombers from the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division inflicted light casualties on the North Vietnamese 24th Regiment, but failed to stop their enemies’ momentum. In the southwest, Quang tried to retake Mai Hac De by mobilising his reserve units with <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>support.</b> Meanwhile, in the south-eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, the North Vietnamese 149th Regiment defeated the South Vietnamese 53rd Infantry Regiment, after they sustained heavy casualties from repeated air attacks from A-37 bombers.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that the}} American plan for waging the Laotian Civil War was a {{defensive}} one, the American ambassador had {{run counter to}} policy by approving an offensive drive. This provoked a reaction from his superiors. The short notice request for additional USAF <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> had brought about a directive on 18 August that requests for <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> for a planned operation had to be submitted at least ten days in advance. In reality, the process would take 20 to 30 days. The directive, issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and agreed to by both the CIA and the State Department, required coordination of planned operations with both 7th Air Force and CINCPAC. These requirements were meant to limit offensives {{under the guise of}} coordination.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the 343d Composite Wing was redesignated a Tactical Fighter Wing. Seven years later, in 1991, it was redesignated as the 343d Wing. Also that year, the 343d {{gained a}} second flying unit, the 11th <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Support</b> Squadron (11 TASS), which flew OA-10s.|$|E

25|$|The 505th Tactical Air Control Group was {{assigned}} to Tan Son Nhut on 8 April 1964. The Unit was primarily responsible for controlling the tactical air resources of the US and its allies in South Vietnam, Thailand, {{and to some extent}} Cambodia and Laos. Carrying out the mission of providing <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> required two major components, radar installations and forward air controllers (FACs).|$|E
25|$|On 8 February, six PAVN tanks {{backed by}} {{infantry}} assaulted Paksong.

Vogt, Jr. laid on an air campaign to recapture Paksong. He directed 76 preliminary B-52 Stratofortress strikes in the area. <b>Tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> for the Royalist counter-attackers amounted to 254 sorties expended.

25|$|Foul weather, {{unusual for}} February, {{hindered}} flight operations. Taking {{advantage of the}} cloud cover, a battalion from the 866th Independent Regiment and a company of 41st Dac Cong Battalion moved down the Nam Bleung Valley. On 7 February, they struck GM 22. With the huge Operation Lam Son 719 offensive beginning against the Ho Chi Minh Trail on 8 February in southern Laos, the fighting in northern Laos suddenly rated only 24 sorties of <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> per day.|$|E
25|$|A {{new chapter}} for the base began 1 October 1981 when the 343d Composite Wing {{replaced}} the 5010th as Eielson's host unit. Flying squadrons {{assigned to the}} new wing included the 25th <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Support</b> Squadron (TASS) and the 18th Fighter Squadron (18 FS). The 25 TASS, at Eielson since 1971, flew O-2 Skymaster and OV-10 Bronco aircraft until its inactivation in 1989; the newly assigned 18 FS operated A-10 Thunderbolt IIs until it converted to F-16 Fighting Falcons in 1991.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mission was}} {{launched}} in September and construction was begun on a new C to be located at Ban Me Thuot, in the Central Highlands. The RTs inserted into Cambodia faced even more restrictions than those in Laos. Initially, they had {{to cross the border}} on foot, had no <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> (either helicopters or aircraft), and were not to be provided with FAC coverage. The teams were, therefore, to rely on stealth and were usually smaller in size than those that operated in Laos.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Support's</b> flight {{operations}} began in 2008 {{when it became}} the first non-government company outside of Sukhoi trained to fly, operate, and maintain the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker.

25|$|In early June, Savannakhet Unit of the CIA planned Operation Black Lion {{to retake}} Khong Sedone. On 15 June 1972, Groupement Mobile 32 (GM 32) was helilifted into Pakxe Site 47, {{unloading}} {{on the fly}} and without their heavy weapons company. This placed GM 32 11 kilometers north of Khong Sedone. Only two hours after re-forming their ranks, GM 32 moved south toward their objective. Less than two kilometers out, they ran headon into the 3rd Battalion of the PAVN 39th Regiment.
