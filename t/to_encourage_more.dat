Ireland, which {{for many years}} had not {{exploited}} the tourist potential of its castle heritage, began <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>more</b> tourists in the 1960s and 1970s and Irish castles are now a core part of the Irish tourist industry.

5|$|Lansdale {{employed}} {{a variety of}} stunts <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>more</b> northerners to move south. South Vietnamese soldiers in civilian clothing infiltrated the north, spreading rumours of impending doom. One story was that the communists had a deal with Vietnam's traditional enemy China, allowing two communist Chinese divisions to invade the north. The story reported that the Chinese were raping and pillaging with the tacit approval of the communists. Lansdale hired counterfeiters to produce bogus Viet Minh leaflets on how to behave under communist rule, advising them to create a list of their material possessions so that the communists {{would be able to}} confiscate them more easily, thereby fomenting peasant discontent.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{announced}} {{that one of}} the top priorities of his government was to eliminate racism against the country's indigenous population. To do this, he {{announced that}} all civil servants were required to learn one of Bolivia's three indigenous languages, Quechua, Aymara, or Guaraní, within two years. His government encouraged the development of indigenous cultural projects, and sought <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>more</b> indigenous people to attend university; by 2008, it was estimated that half of the students enrolled in Bolivia's 11 public universities were indigenous, while three indigenous-specific universities had been established, offering subsidized education. In 2009, a Vice Ministry for Decolonization was established, which proceeded to pass the 2010 Law against Racism and Discrimination banning the espousal of racist views in private or public institutions.|$|E

In EastEnders: E20, he helps his friend Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu) with a project <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>more</b> young people to the church, but his ideas leave them both humiliated. They meet Leon Small (Sam Attwater) and ZsaZsa Carter (Emer Kenny) and start squatting in a flat. Fatboy tells ZsaZsa and Leon both his parents {{were killed in a}} drive-by shooting. He finds out Mercy is pregnant and accuses Leon of being the father. During an argument, Mercy reveals that Fatboy's parents are alive, angering ZsaZsa, who throws Fatboy's laptop out of the window. On their last night in the flat, he arranges a party but leaves before the police arrive. Knowing they can no longer stay there, he invites ZsaZsa, Mercy and Leon to stay at his house in Wanstead, but Mercy decides to go home to her grandmother.|$|E

5|$|However, when {{a country}} is {{suffering}} from high unemployment or wishes to pursue a policy of export-led growth, a lower exchange rate {{can be seen as}} advantageous. From the early 1980s the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has proposed devaluation as a potential solution for developing nations that are consistently spending more on imports than they earn on exports. A lower value for the home currency will raise the price for imports while making exports cheaper. This tends <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>more</b> domestic production, which raises employment and gross domestic product (GDP) – though the effect may not be immediate due to the Marshall–Lerner condition. Devaluation can be seen as an attractive solution to unemployment when other options, like increased public spending, are ruled out due to high public debt, or when a country has a balance of payments deficit which a devaluation would help correct. A reason for preferring devaluation common among emerging economies is that maintaining a relatively low exchange rate helps them build up foreign exchange reserves, which can protect against future financial crises.|$|E

40|$|With {{the recent}} shift in Government {{transport}} policy, {{more and more}} local councils are developing cycling strategies for their districts. However, {{a significant increase in}} cycling is not likely if such strategies are implemented in isolation from other council policies and actions. This is particularly a concern in locations where it appears that "providing for cyclists" is being interpreted as just "providing cycle facilities". A number of existing cycling strategies have certainly been fairly limited in both their scope of cycling-specific issues (such as education and promotion) and in their actual implementation. However, <b>to</b> really <b>encourage</b> <b>more</b> cycling, councils also need to seriously review and implement other "sustainable transport-friendly" policies for land use planning, speed limits, general road construction and maintenance, parks & reserves planning, travel demand management, traffic calming, and parking management, to name but a few. This paper discusses some of the pitfalls observed in local council cycling strategies and policies to date. It also identifies other policy areas that have an impact on cycling and suggests practical ways that councils can truly make a difference <b>to</b> <b>encouraging</b> <b>more</b> cycling...|$|R
