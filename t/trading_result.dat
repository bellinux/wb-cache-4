40|$|Industrial {{competitiveness}} {{is becoming}} an increasingly important issue. In years of recession, some companies perform worse on domestic markets or lose export shares. Most investigations of the competitiveness of nations are based on macroeconomic data. However, a country is not much like a business. A paper tries to provide a new answer based on science and technology indicators and econometric analysis. Competitiveness is studied on the microeconomic level for a sample of 161 domestic or foreign-owned companies located in western Germany. Their competitiveness is measured by 2 indicators: 1. the <b>trading</b> <b>result</b> (that is, either net profit or loss), and 2. the export share of (local) production. Statistics on investment and patents do not sufficiently explain competitiveness, but the scientific potential of the firms significantly explains the profit-turnover ratio. Thus, {{it seems to be}} the science base of technological activities that determines competitiveness. Public subventions facilitate scientific and technological activities in industry. It is particularly interesting to note that government support is oriented towards the science base of the client companies...|$|E

After Roger mentioned the optimized outcome by Response Surface Methodology in pairs trading, one may wonder if the same works given he/she has a favorite pair, but also limited money. Especially, can we apply the same model in Hong Kong market. In this study, as an application of Roger’s work to Hong Kong market, we are going to test the model only with time being the independent variable, so as to find out the time effect on pairs trading. If the result is positive, we also wonder what the best strategy is. And also {{we are going to see}} if this method works on individual pairs instead of the entire pool of pairs. The result shows that Response Surface Methodology failed to optimize the return of selected pair. But it inspires us that to the selected pair, time is a favorable and significant factor to the <b>trading</b> <b>result.</b> In future, we can add more variables so that we can actually test if this method gives us the best combination of time...|$|E

40|$|Around the world, the {{allocation}} of individual rights in the fisheries {{has proved to be}} a successful fisheries management tool. To date, the Individual Transferable Quota [ITQ] approach has been adopted for only a few fisheries in the U. S., although there is strong support for extending the approach to others. The basic goal of the ITQ approach is to create well-defined, exclusive property rights in a fishery, giving holders of those rights the incentive to fish efficiently and manage the resource for long-term sustainable yield. The property rights allocated are often percentage shares of the total annual allowable harvest or quota for the particular fishery. The transferability of these shares is key to the ITQ approach-being marketable, the shares will come to be owned by those who will most efficiently utilize them. Analysis of the ITQ approach, however, gives rise to the question of whether ITQ programs will have effects resulting in violations of U. S. antitrust law. The Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act all serve to protect consumers from anticompetitive activity. Once shares in a fishery are placed on the market, will <b>trading</b> <b>result</b> in single-owner accumulation of shares approaching monopoly in violation of these statutes? Will impermissible domination of competition and pricing result from concentrations of shares in the hands of a few? This Article examines the legal implications of ITQs with regard to antitrust law. It begins by identifying the benefits of the ITQ approach and considering the potential anticompetitive effects of an ITQ system. It then discusses the legal requirements for finding of monopoly, illegal price restraints and other impermissible restraints on competition. The Article concludes that ITQ systems can be designed to avert the possibility of excessive accumulation of shares in the hands of a few, and that such ITQ systems are unlikely to have effects that will result in antitrust violations...|$|E
40|$|With rapid {{digitalization}} of {{mass media}} and successive evolution of computational modeling, applying data mining techniques in the stock forecasting has been a prevailing topic that is being explored by numerous computer scientists. Presently, researchers focus on studying how {{to make use of}} more powerful modeling techniques to improve the forecasting accuracies, but relatively few researchers consider the essence of correct features selection (effective factors identification). In the financial market, whether the stock price is going up or going down is mainly driven by the expectation of investors and speculators. The correct problem formulation achieved by considering effective factors is superior to making improvement on model complexities. In the real financial world, most of the investment decisions rely on textual information (for instance, news articles) and human perceptions (trends of stock price) to predict market price movement. Most of these features, especially textual information, are unstructured and fuzzy in nature and are not able to be readily processed in computational models. For the text mining methods, they also remain many of technical challenges in the literature. In this thesis, we propose feasible solutions to process and select useful features in our cutting edge forecasting models. A support vector machine (SVM) based prediction system, using multiple feature based forecasting framework (MFF), has been developed to process news, stock trend components, and technical indicators as well as Volatility Index (VIX) in order to improve the prediction performance. At the same time, based on the shortcomings of current approaches in text mining and trend components extraction, some new methods are also discussed and verified. Apart from processing and utilizing additional features, the improvement of stock forecasting accuracy is also attempted through studying inter-relationships among multiple financial time series, traditionally believed to be useful for investors to optimize portfolios, and speculators to capture the chance of statistical arbitrage (most likely, pair trading). Existing researchers, advocate utilizing statistical correlations (co-movement in prices) between different stock entities as a factor mining method. However, high correlation in financial time series data does not imply causality. Therefore, we should reasonably address the later rather than the former. Notwithstanding the foreseeable improvement through modeling causalities, relatively few works are concerned with studying it and therefore explore the potential of lagging effects to boost accuracies of stock prediction. In this thesis, we propose a novel leading stock based prediction framework (LSPF), dedicated to mining leading stocks. By definition in this study, a stock is considered as a leader once it precedes other stocks in rising or falling. In other words, the predictive power of any data modeling over lead stocks can arise by considering these leading stocks as factors in the modeling process. LSPF tracks the inter-leading and lagging relationships between stock entities by investigating three feasible leading stock mining models, linear Granger causality test, non-linear Granger causality test, and lagged correlation measurement. A leadership ranking approach is suggested to weigh the importance of discovered leading and lagging stocks after the mining processes. In studies of multiple features, our extensive experiments, using the Dow Jones consistent stock daily basis data in the New York Exchange (NYSE), show that our approaches with additional features obviously outperform those with price and volume only. More importantly, a profitable simulation <b>trading</b> <b>result</b> is gained (reaching over 200 % annual return on several stock entities, in comparison with the same period Dow Jones Index performance of - 25 %) during the sub-prime mortgage crisis, justifying the effectiveness and robustness of our system against the economic depression. On the other hand, LSPF is evaluated in terms of its boosted accuracies over different prediction models, including neural network (NN) and support vector regression (SVR). Examined by the high frequency market microstructure data in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), it has shown that the LSPF is robust to volatile stock markets with its promising improvement in prediction accuracies, which confirms the presence and significance of leading stocks...|$|E
