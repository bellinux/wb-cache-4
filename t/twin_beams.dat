In this paper, we look at the role of the phase-matching condition in the trade-off that occurs between the efficiency of the nonlinear process and the absorption of the <b>twin</b> <b>beams.</b> To this effect, we develop a semi-classical model by deriving the atomic susceptibilities in the relevant double-lambda configuration and by solving the classical propagation of the twin-beam fields for parameters close to those found in typical experiments. These theoretical results are confirmed by a simple experimental study of the nonlinear gain experienced by the <b>twin</b> <b>beams</b> {{as a function of the}} phase mismatch. The model shows that the amount of phase mismatch is key to the realization of the physical conditions in which the absorption of the <b>twin</b> <b>beams</b> is minimized while the cross-coupling between the <b>twin</b> <b>beams</b> is maintained at the level required for the generation of strong quantum correlations.
