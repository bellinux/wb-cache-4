If left alone for too long, they can become destructive and mischievous through boredom. They love the water, and tend <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>wet</b> whenever they have the chance.|$|E
25|$|In this game, Tim Tebow {{also created}} an iconic image {{of himself and}} the Gators for 2008. Because of the rainy {{conditions}} in Tallahassee that day, the field was extremely wet and slippery, affecting play on both sides. On a 4-yard TD run into the endzone, Tebow slid in on the wet turf, causing {{the front of his}} white Away jersey <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>wet</b> red paint on it. The paint also got on his face and helmet and stayed on {{for the majority of the}} game. The red paint resembled blood to many people which provided Tebow with a bravado of bravery and passion, which also highlighted his intense sideline celebrations and enthusiasm. The image of Tebow's paint-stained Jersey became one of the lasting and memorable images in sports for 2008 and for the decade at large.|$|E
500|$|Sigler, who {{was offered}} the role only days before filming commenced, {{said that she had}} always been a fan of Carey, and {{accepted}} the offer immediately. She described that the shoot was set in the 1960s, and that she played the singer's mother during and after her pregnancy. Sigler described the plot: [...] "With my character, she's basically going against her parent's wishes to be with this gentleman. She's pregnant with a baby, which is Mariah, and they run away together. So it's kind of an epic love story, it's nice." [...] Carey revealed that the video would incorporate a rainstorm scene in New York City. Carey jokingly explained how she originally did not intend <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>wet,</b> but felt it added a lot to the video.|$|E

5000|$|Choosing a bird feeder {{is just as}} {{important}} as choosing the bird seed to offer. For those wanting to attract large amounts of small songbirds, a tube feeder is best. [...] Hopper feeders attract a wide variety of species, and allow for large quantities of bird seed to be stored. Platform feeders attract the greatest number of bird species, but the bird seed is more prone <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>wet</b> or blown off the feeder from the wind.|$|R
50|$|The Gully Washer has one lift {{hill and}} several ways <b>to</b> <b>get</b> you <b>wet</b> during the ride. The water ride is open from Opening Day to Fright Fest. During Fright Fest, {{the water on}} the ride get dyed with the color red to {{represent}} blood for Halloween. In 2010, Six Flags added more ways <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the riders <b>wet</b> during the ride.The Gully Washer is themed to a raging river {{in the town of}} Crackaxle Canyon.|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{leaving the}} ride, guests are led through a building, named [...] "Pier 13", {{situated}} {{directly in front}} of the splash pool and above the track. As the boat hits the water, the wave travels straight towards this building and often continues on to the pathway behind. Two windows of the Pier 13 building have no glass, presenting another opportunity for riders <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>wet.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Mississippi River are clearly defined by a [...] long outlet dam {{at the north end}} of Lake Itasca. This setup allows tourists to wade in shallow water or cross over it by way of the bridge constructed of logs. In 1903 a 24-year-old park commissioner named Mary Gibbs played a significant role in saving the tall pine forests and shoreline of the Mississippi River Headwaters by resisting efforts to log the area. In honor of her efforts, the Mary Gibbs Visitor Center, which encloses a restaurant, gift shop, various displays and exhibits of the park's features, and an outdoor plaza now exists. [...] Visitors can walk across the rocks connecting the sides of the Mississippi. [...] There is also a bridge, for those who don't want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>wet.</b>|$|E

Active metals such as titanium {{can be added to}} a ductile filler metals such as copper <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>wetting</b> via a reduction reaction. Conclusions All alloy conditions wet the tungsten carbide/cobalt substrates. Two different interfacial reaction types were observed: dissolution and reduction reactions. An important issue has been identified: the braze interface reactions change the chemistry of the braze alloy which change the interaction between the braze alloy and the other material substrate.

25|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{variable}} climatic regimes across the Great Plains, {{many aspects of}} climate change {{are not expected to}} affect all areas of the ecoregion equally. In regards to precipitation, this means an exacerbation of extremes where dry areas in the south are expected <b>to</b> <b>get</b> drier and <b>wetter</b> areas in the north <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>wetter.</b> In turn this will increase the intensity of already problematic droughts across the region as well as creating the potential for flooding in the wetter north. The percent change in precipitation for both areas is dependent upon different emission scenarios; with higher emission levels in the future being conducive to greater extremes. Dramatic increases in average annual temperature are also expected, with average winter temperatures already having risen 7°F in the past 30 years. These increased temperatures are expected to cause warmer winters with warmer springs as well as hotter summers in the south-central plains.|$|R

50|$|Regardless, using a hat as a water {{container}} is apt {{to seriously}} damage a modern hat. On one hand, fur felt hats were designed in part {{so they could be}} used in the rain. However, wool felt hats were designed for dry climates, and most straw hats can only handle a light rain for a brief time. While a very high quality felt hat made from animal fur may hold water, over time, any cloth container will leak. Furthermore, modern hats may react <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>wet</b> differently, though this depends {{on the quality of the}} materials used in construction. They are generally likely to lose shape, and the felt may also soften up if they are completely drenched.|$|R
5000|$|Aquaphobia or waterfright is a {{persistent}} and abnormal fear of water. Aquaphobia {{is a specific}} phobia that involves a level of fear that is beyond the patient's control or that may interfere with daily life. People suffer aquaphobia in many ways and may experience it even though they realize the water in an ocean, a river, or even a bathtub poses no imminent threat. They may avoid such activities as boating and swimming, or they may avoid swimming in the deep ocean despite having mastered basic swimming skills. [...] This anxiety commonly extends <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>wet</b> or splashed with water when it is unexpected, or being pushed or thrown into a body of water.|$|R
