5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and <b>Trypanosome</b> protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.|$|E

25|$|Biological {{transmission}} {{requires a}} period of incubation of the <b>trypanosomes</b> within the tsetse host. The term 'biological' is used because <b>trypanosomes</b> must reproduce through several generations inside the tsetse host {{during the period of}} incubation, which requires extreme adaptation of the <b>trypanosomes</b> to their tsetse host. In this mode of transmission, <b>trypanosomes</b> reproduce through several generations, changing in morphology at certain periods. This mode of transmission also includes the sexual phase of the <b>trypanosomes.</b> Tsetse are believed to be more likely to become infected by <b>trypanosomes</b> during their first few blood meals. Tsetse infected by <b>trypanosomes</b> are thought to remain infected for the remainder of their lives. Because of the adaptations required for biological transmission, <b>trypanosomes</b> transmitted biologically by tsetse cannot be transmitted in this manner by other insects.|$|R

Phylogenetic trees based on maximum likelihood and parsimony corroborated the positioning of all new anuran <b>trypanosomes</b> in the aquatic clade but {{did not support the}} monophyly of anuran <b>trypanosomes.</b> However, all analyses always supported four major clades (An 01 - 04) of anuran <b>trypanosomes.</b> Clade An 04 is composed of <b>trypanosomes</b> from exotic anurans. Isolates in clades An 01 and An 02 were from Brazilian frogs and toads captured in the three biomes studied, Amazonia, the Pantanal and the Atlantic Forest.

Another parasite is the praniza larval stage of the isopod Gnathia pantherina, which infests the nares, mouth, and gills.

25|$|The {{cycle of}} {{biological}} transmission of trypanosomiasis involves two phases, one inside the tsetse host {{and the other}} inside the vertebrate host. <b>Trypanosomes</b> are not passed between a pregnant tsetse and her offspring, so all newly emerged tsetse adults are free of infection. An uninfected fly that feeds on an infected vertebrate animal may acquire <b>trypanosomes</b> in its proboscis or gut. These <b>trypanosomes,</b> depending on the species, may remain in place, move to {{a different part of}} the digestive tract, or migrate through the tsetse body into the salivary glands. When an infected tsetse bites a susceptible host, the fly may regurgitate part of a previous blood meal that contains <b>trypanosomes,</b> or may inject <b>trypanosomes</b> in its saliva. Inoculation must contain a minimum of 300 to 450 individual <b>trypanosomes</b> to be successful, and may contain up to 40,000 cells.|$|R
40|$|<b>Trypanosomes</b> are {{veterinary}} and {{medically important}} parasites causing serious diseases and significant losses in livestock farming. Two subgenuses of <b>trypanosomes</b> were identified from ungulates in Europe. Trypanosoma evansi and T. equiperdum, flagellates of the subgenus Trypanozoon, could cause fatal infections to their hosts. Other Trypanosoma theileri, T. cervi, T. stefanskii, T. melophagium and T. theodori {{were discovered in}} European ungulates from the second subgenus Megatrypanum. These <b>trypanosomes</b> are common parasites in Europe, especially Trypanosoma theileri and T. cervi. On the other hand, T. evansi and T. equiperdum are occuring rather sporadically. <b>Trypanosomes</b> of the subgenus Megatrypanum are less significant because their lower medical and economical impact.

25|$|The {{relative}} importance of these two modes of transmission for the propagation of tsetse-vectored trypanosomiases is not yet well understood. However, since the sexual phase of the <b>trypanosome</b> lifecycle occurs within the tsetse host, biological transmission is a required step in the lifecycle of the tsetse-vectored trypanosomes.|$|E
25|$|Some strains {{are much}} more virulent. Infected flies have an altered salivary {{composition}} which lowers feeding efficiency and consequently increases the feeding time, promoting <b>trypanosome</b> transmission to the vertebrate host. These trypanosomes are highly evolved and have developed a lifecycle that requires periods in both the vertebrate and tsetse hosts.|$|E
25|$|Animal trypanosomiasis, {{also called}} nagana when {{it occurs in}} bovine cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in {{domestic}} pigs, is caused by several <b>trypanosome</b> species.

Certain species of cattle are called trypanotolerant because they can survive and grow even when infected with trypanosomes although they also have lower productivity rates when infected.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between bovine peripheral blood monocytes and Trypanosoma brucei organisms {{in the presence}} of immune whole serum or specific purified IgM or IgG 1 antibodies from infected cattle was investigated. Adherence of antibody-sensitized <b>trypanosomes</b> to freshly isolated monocytes from non-infected animals was not observed, confirming the absence of receptors for IgM and IgG 1 on fresh monocytes. After in-vitro cultivation of the monocytes for at least 3 hr, adherence of IgM-sensitized <b>trypanosomes</b> was consistently demonstrable, while the adherence of IgG 1 -sensitized <b>trypanosomes</b> was not observed until the monocytes had been cultured for 7 days. The adherence of IgM-sensitized <b>trypanosomes</b> occurred in the absence of bovine complement and was Ca++-dependent, indicating that the {{interaction between}} sensitized <b>trypanosomes</b> and bovine monocytes was mediated through a specific combining site for monocytes in the Fc region of the IgM molecule rather than through a C 3 b receptor. In contrast to the monocytes from uninfected animals, freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes from T. brucei- or T. congolense-infected cattle were capable of binding IgM- or IgG 1 -sensitized <b>trypanosomes</b> after only 30 min and 24 hr of in-vitro cultivation, respectively, suggesting that peripheral blood monocytes from infected animals were already in an "activated' state.

40|$|Background: Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) {{is caused}} by several species of <b>trypanosomes</b> {{including}} Trypanosoma congolense, T. vivax, T. godfreyi, T. simiae and T. brucei. Two of the subspecies of T. brucei also cause Human African Trypanosomiasis. Although some {{of them can be}} mechanically transmitted by biting flies; these <b>trypanosomes</b> are all transmitted by tsetse flies which are the cyclical vectors of Trypanosoma congolense, T. godfreyi, T. simiae and T. brucei. We present here the first report assessing the prevalence of <b>trypanosomes</b> in tsetse flies in Nigeria using molecular tools. Methods: 488 tsetse flies of three species, Glossina palpalis palpalis, G. tachinoides and G. morsitans submorsitans were collected from Wuya, Niger State and Yankari National Park, Bauchi State in 2012. <b>Trypanosomes</b> were detected and identified using an ITS 1 PCR assay on DNA purified from the ‘head plus proboscis’ (H[*]+[*]P) and abdomen (ABD) parts of each fly.

25|$|The {{tsetse fly}} (genus Glossina) is a large, brown, biting fly {{that serves as}} both a host and vector for the <b>trypanosome</b> parasites. While taking blood from a {{mammalian}} host, an infected tsetse fly injects metacyclic trypomastigotes into skin tissue. From the bite, parasites first enter the lymphatic system and then pass into the bloodstream. Inside the mammalian host, they transform into bloodstream trypomastigotes, and are carried to other sites throughout the body, reach other body fluids (e.g., lymph, spinal fluid), and continue to replicate by binary fission.|$|E
500|$|The dark shyshark is a generalist {{predator}} {{whose main}} food sources are, {{in descending order}} of importance, small benthic crustaceans, bony fishes, and molluscs. Larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans. Polychaete worms and echinoderms are also taken on occasion, and algae may be swallowed incidentally. This species is preyed upon by the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and potentially also other large fishes and marine mammals. When threatened, it adopts a characteristic defense posture in which it curls into a ring with its tail over its eyes; this behavior likely makes the shark harder to swallow and is {{the origin of the}} common names [...] "shyshark" [...] and [...] "doughnut". In captivity, the whelks Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria have been documented piercing the egg cases of this species and extracting the yolk. A known parasite of the dark shyshark is the <b>trypanosome</b> Trypanosoma haploblephari, which infests the blood.|$|E
2500|$|Tsetse flies have {{an arsenal}} of immune {{defenses}} to resist each stage of the <b>trypanosome</b> infectious cycle, and thus are relatively refractory to <b>trypanosome</b> infection [...] Among the host flies’ defenses is the production of hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species that damages DNA.

40|$|<b>Trypanosomes</b> are {{blood-borne}} parasites {{that can}} cause severe disease in both humans and animals, resulting in very large economic losses worldwide. In contrast to the wealth of information on pathogenic species such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei, little is known of the pathogenicity, prevalence and life-cycles of <b>trypanosomes</b> in native Australian mammals. The aim of this thesis was to characterise <b>trypanosomes</b> and other protozoans from the critically endangered Gilbert’s potoroo (Potorous gilbertii) and the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) from Western Australia using morphological and molecular analysis. A novel Trypanosoma species, Trypanosoma copemani was identified in Gilbert’s potoroos and quokkas using molecular and morphological analysis. Further molecular characterisation of T. copemani in quokkas at both the 18 S rRNA and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) loci identified multiple T. copemani genotypes revealing that the parasite is genetically variable. Given the phylogenetic grouping of T. copemani as a stercorarian (requiring faecal transmission by vector), the fact that ticks are common ectoparasites of Gilbert’s potoroos and quokkas and the previous identification of <b>trypanosomes</b> in ticks, ticks were examined as potential vectors of T. copemani. Motile <b>trypanosomes</b> were detected in both the haemolymph and midgut sections of Ixodes australiensis ticks removed from quokkas and Gilbert’s potoroos and stained <b>trypanosomes</b> were detected within a faecal smear.

He tells about these experiences in Africa view (1931), and so does his wife. She reveals that {{he fell in love}} with an 18-year-old American girl on board ship (when Juliette was not present), and then presented Juliette with his ideas for an open marriage: [...] "What Julian really wanted was… a definite freedom from the conventional bonds of marriage." [...] The couple separated for a while; Julian travelled to the US, hoping to land a suitable appointment and, in due course, to marry Miss Weldmeier. He left no account of what transpired, but he was evidently not successful, and returned to England to resume his marriage in 1931.

2500|$|Ethidium bromide {{is thought}} {{to act as a}} mutagen because it intercalates double {{stranded}} DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA.

The lack of detected mutagenicity without liver homogenate indicates that ethidium bromide is not directly mutagenic, but that its metabolites are. [...] The identity of these mutagenic metabolites are unknown. [...] The National Toxicology Program states it is nonmutagenic in rats and mice. These conclusions are supported by a subchronic carcinogenicity study in mice, whereby no mutagenic effects were detected. Ethidium bromide (Homidium brand) use in animals to treat <b>trypanosome</b> infection suggests that toxicity and mutagenicity are not high. [...] Studies have been conducted in animals to evaluate EtBr as a potential antitumorigenic chemotherapeutic agent. Its chemotherapeutic use is due to its toxicity to mitochondria.
