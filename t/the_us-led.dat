5|$|On 7 April 1991, Iraq {{accepted}} United Nations (UN) cease-fire {{conditions and}} resolutions, thereby officially ending the Gulf War. This same day, a large multinational, multiple-agency humanitarian effort {{under the authority}} of UN Security Council Resolution No. 688 began to aid the approximately 500,000 Kurdish refugees who had fled from Iraqi military forces into the hills of northern Iraq. On 18 April 1991, John Shalikashvili took command of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.-led</b> operation to ensure security for UN relief operations and the Kurdish refugees, called Operation Provide Comfort (OPC).|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Gulf War in 1990–91, {{when the}} Intifada's {{intensity}} began to wear down, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and opposed <b>the</b> <b>US-led</b> coalition attack on Iraq. He made this decision {{without the consent}} of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO. Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the Abu Nidal Organization. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported <b>the</b> <b>US-led</b> coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO and began providing financial support for the organization's rival Hamas and other Islamist groups. Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992, when an Air Bissau aircraft he was a passenger on crash-landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm. Two pilots and an engineer were killed; Arafat was bruised and shaken.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of most of Australian New Guinea the RAAF and RAN participated in <b>the</b> <b>US-led</b> Western New Guinea campaign, which had the goal of {{securing}} bases {{to be used to}} mount {{the liberation of}} the Philippines. Australian warships and the fighter, bomber and airfield construction squadrons of No.10Operational Group RAAF participated in the capture of Hollandia, Biak, Noemfoor and Morotai. After western New Guinea was secured No.10Operation Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF) and was used to protect the flank of the Allied advance by attacking Japanese positions in the NEI and performing other garrison tasks. The losses incurred whilst performing these relatively unimportant roles led to a decline in morale, and contributed to the 'Morotai Mutiny' in April 1945.|$|E

5|$|The CIA's base at Camp Chapman {{was set up}} at the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.-led</b> offensive against al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban in 2001. It began as an improvised center for operations. A military base at {{the beginning}}, it was later transformed into a CIA base. Camp Chapman was also used as a base for the Khost Provincial Reconstruction Team, a military-led development group. In recent years, the base evolved into a major counter-terrorism hub of the CIA's paramilitary Special Activities Division, used for joint operation with U.S. special operations forces and Afghan allies. It also had a housing compound for U.S. intelligence officers.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45 on 10 May, in {{conjunction}} with the ground assault on the Ngok Tavak outpost, elements of the VPA 2nd Division subjected Khâm Đức to a heavy barrage of mortar fire. The North Vietnamese 21st Regiment, later reinforced by the VC 1st Regiment, were in position to attack <b>the</b> <b>U.S.-led</b> Detachment A-105. At 08:30, the Americal Division activated Operation Golden Valley to reinforce the beleaguered Khâm Đức Special Forces Camp, and at 8:45am the division requested permission from III MAF to change the reaction force so the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, 196th Light Infantry Brigade (2–1st Inf) would replace the 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment, 198th Light Infantry Brigade (1–46th Inf). In the meantime, however, Company A of 1–46th Inf provide the needed reinforcement, until the 2–1st Inf was in position. At around 10:50 Company A of 1–46th Infantry – led by Lieutenant Bobby Thompson – arrived in Khâm Đức along with some supporting artillery and ammunition, and they were immediately assigned to their task.|$|E
5|$|During March and April, U.S. {{military}} intelligence began to detect {{elements of the}} PAVN 2nd Division moving towards Khâm Đức, but their opponent's true intentions were largely unknown. In response to {{what could be a}} major attack, General William Westmoreland decided to build up the defenses of the Khâm Đức Special Forces, by sending in U.S. Army engineers to upgrade the local airstrip for sustained use by large transport aircraft, as well as airlifting weapons and ammunition for <b>the</b> <b>U.S.-led</b> Detachment A-105. Australian-led 11th Mobile Strike Force (MSF) Company was ordered to take up positions in Ngok Tavak (Ngok Ta Vak), an outpost serving Khâm Đức, to boost allied intelligence-gathering capabilities in the area. However, unbeknownst to the United States and other allied forces, the Viet Cong (VC) 1st Regiment had been watching the build-up around Khâm Đức for some time, and were preparing to initiate the assault by taking out Ngok Tavak.|$|E

50|$|France again led {{the charge}} in its trenchant {{criticism}} of the new arrangements emerging after June 2004.

5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 {{attacks on}} the United States, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf {{announced}} his support for <b>the</b> <b>US-led</b> War on Terror. This declaration sparked conflict with the Lal Masjid, whose leadership was openly pro-Taliban. Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rashid denied having any links to banned terrorist organisations but were vehemently opposed to the War on Terror and the conflict in Afghanistan. They openly condemned Musharraf and opposed Pakistani security forces, including the Pakistan Rangers and Islamabad Capital Territory police. The mosque became a source for speeches calling for the assassination of Musharraf. One of these speeches was delivered by Masood Azhar, whose Jaish-e-Mohammed group members were later involved in failed attempts to kill the president. In July 2005, Pakistani authorities attempted to raid the mosque in connection with their investigation into the July 7, 2005 London bombings, but the police were blocked by baton-wielding female students. After the raid, authorities apologised for the behaviour of the police.|$|E
5|$|In August 2004, {{during the}} Iraq War, NATO formed the NATO Training Mission – Iraq, a {{training}} mission {{to assist the}} Iraqi security forces {{in conjunction with the}} US led MNF-I. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established {{at the request of the}} Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the nation. NTM-I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission, under the political control of NATO's North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and <b>the</b> <b>US-led</b> Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who was also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17December 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Borneo Campaign of 1945 was {{the last}} major Allied {{campaign}} in the SWPA. In a series of amphibious assaults between 1 May and 21 July, the Australian ICorps, under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, attacked Japanese forces occupying the island. Allied naval and air forces, centred on the US 7th Fleet under Admiral Thomas Kinkaid, 1TAF and the US Thirteenth Air Force also played important roles in the campaign. The goals of this campaign were to capture Borneo's oilfields and Brunei Bay to support <b>the</b> <b>US-led</b> invasion of Japan and British-led liberation of Malaya which were planned to take place later in 1945. The Australian Government did not agree to MacArthur's proposal to extend the offensive to include the liberation of Java in July 1945, however, and its decision to not release the 6th Division for this operation contributed to it not going ahead.|$|E
25|$|Despite these denials, {{however, the}} Secret War was {{actually}} the largest U.S. covert operation prior to the Afghan-Soviet War, with areas of Laos controlled by North Vietnam subjected to three million tons of bombing, representing <b>the</b> heaviest <b>U.S.-led</b> bombing campaign since World War II.|$|R

5000|$|Since the Airborne was {{designed}} to deploy rapidly into [...] "hot" [...] situations, its 1, 2, and 3 Commando units, with attached support—a total of 900 soldiers—were sent to Somalia late in 1992.

5|$|Many of the RAAF's C-130s were redeployed to South Vietnam {{shortly before}} the end of the war in 1975. The rapid North Vietnamese advance during the Spring Offensive {{displaced}} hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians, and the Australian Government deployed a detachment of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as part of an international aid effort coordinated by the United States. This force, which was designated DetachmentS, had an average strength of seven C-130s and about one hundred air and ground crew, and was initially used to transport civilian refugees away from the front lines. After South Vietnamese soldiers were reported to have been transported alongside civilians, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam directed that the Hercules were to only carry humanitarian cargo. As the North Vietnamese advanced on Saigon, DetachmentS was moved to Bangkok in Thailand, but continued to fly into South Vietnam each day. Overall, DetachmentS had carried 1,100refugees and 900tonnes of supplies by the end of the war. On 4and 17April, aircraft of the detachment flew 271orphaned children to Bangkok as part of <b>the</b> <b>US-led</b> Operation Babylift. In late April, two of No.37 Squadron's C-130Es were assigned to the United Nations to transport supplies throughout Southeast Asia; this force was designated DetachmentN. The C-130Es began operations on 3May, and were mainly used to fly supplies into Laos. The aircraft transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore; by the time this mission ended in early June, the two Hercules had conducted 91sorties for the UN. Aircraft of DetachmentS evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, as well as Saigon, {{shortly before the}}y fell to Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese forces in April 1975, after which the force returned to Australia. DetachmentN also evacuated the Australian embassy in Vientiane, Laos, during early June 1975.|$|E
