40|$|Poster {{presentation}} at Code 4 Lib Conference 2017 Many institutions are creating archives of digital newspapers, {{yet it is}} notoriously challenging to deliver an engaging and uncomplicated end user interface for such content. At the University of Maryland Libraries, we have created a custom portal for our crowdfunded campus newspaper digitization project, {{which is scheduled to}} debut in the spring of 2017. Based on stakeholder feedback, our portal’s newspaper viewer needed to support four unique features: (1) keyword search highlighting from the main portal application, (2) intuitive image clipping, (3) article segmentation highlighting, and (4) side-by-side display of OCR text with the digitized image. After evaluation, we determined that IIIF would be the most appropriate framework to integrate into existing UMD repository systems. In order to deliver the requested features, we chose Loris and Mirador as our server and viewer applications, respectively, and developed customizations for each, which have in turn been contributed back to their respective communities. Furthermore, we developed a PCDM Manifest application to take metadata about each newspaper issue from our Fedora 4 repository, transform it, and deliver IIIF manifests. UMD Libraries has also created a proof-of-concept method for embedding ALTO XML <b>text</b> <b>coordinates</b> in a Solr index, in order to enable dynamic annotation generation within the viewer.

40|$|Previous work on {{text mining}} has almost {{exclusively}} {{focused on a}} single stream. However, we often have available mul-tiple text streams indexed by {{the same set of}} time points (called <b>coordinated</b> <b>text</b> streams), which oer new opportu-nities for text mining. For example, when a major event happens, all the news articles published by dierent agen-cies in dierent languages tend to cover the same event for a certain period, exhibiting a correlated bursty topic pattern in all the news article streams. In general, mining corre-lated bursty topic patterns from <b>coordinated</b> <b>text</b> streams can reveal interesting latent associations or events behind these streams. In this paper, we dene and study this novel text mining problem. We propose a general probabilistic algorithm which can eectively discover correlated bursty patterns and their bursty periods across text streams even if the streams have completely dierent vocabularies (e. g., English vs Chinese). Evaluation of the proposed method on a news data set and a literature data set shows that it can eectively discover quite meaningful topic patterns from both data sets: the patterns discovered from the news data set accurately reveal the major common events cov-ered in the two streams of news articles (in English and Chinese, respectively), while the patterns discovered from two database publication streams match well with the ma-jor research paradigm shifts in database research. Since the proposed method is general and does not require the streams to share vocabulary, it can be applied to any <b>coordinated</b> <b>text</b> streams to discover correlated topic patterns that burst in multiple streams in the same period...|$|R

40|$|Skew angle {{estimation}} is {{an important}} component of optical character recognition (OCR) systems and document analysis systems (DAS). In this paper, a novel and an efficient method to estimate the skew angle of a scanned document image is proposed. The proposed method has two stages. In first stage, using boundary-growing approach, text lines containing characters of the scanned document image are extracted. From each <b>text</b> line, <b>coordinates</b> of the positions of the characters are obtained. In second stage, the obtained coordinates are fed to linear regression analysis (LRA) for the purpose of computation of skew angle. Several experiments have been conducted on various types of documents such as documents containing different language texts, documents with different fonts and documents with noise to reveal the robustness of the proposed method. A comparative study with the well-known methods is presented to show that the proposed method is superior in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
