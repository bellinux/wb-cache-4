5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and <b>their</b> <b>partners,</b> and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E

5|$|Asteroids in the {{asteroid}} belt are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> The asteroid belt also contains main-belt comets, {{which may have been}} the source of Earth's water.|$|E
50|$|People can fake orgasms {{for number}} of reasons, {{such as when}} <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> wants them to orgasm but they are unable, or when they desire to stop having sex but are not {{comfortable}} telling <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> directly, avoiding negative consequences, or for pleasing <b>their</b> <b>partner.</b>|$|R

40|$|Do people benefit {{when they}} think <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> has made a {{sacrifice}} for the relationship? In a multi-method study of 80 couples, we examined whether people can detect when <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> suppresses <b>their</b> emotions and if perceiv d partner suppression is costly for the recipient of sacrifice. When people listened to <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> recall an important sacrifice in the lab and when people thought <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> sacrificed in daily life, they thought that <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> was less authentic the more they perceived them to have suppressed their emotions. In turn, perceived partner inauthenticity during sacrifice was associated with poorer personal well-being and relationship quality. These effects persisted over time with perceived partner suppression predicting poorer relationship quality three months later. The results were independent from the influence of an actor’s projection of their own suppression and <b>their</b> <b>partner’s</b> actual suppression. Implications for research on emotion regulation and close relationships are discussed...|$|R
5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners. DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.|$|E
5|$|Most Lodges {{have some}} sort of social calendar, {{allowing}} Masons and <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> to meet in a less ritualised environment. Often coupled with these events is the obligation placed on every Mason to contribute to charity. This occurs at both Lodge and Grand Lodge level. Masonic charities contribute to many field, such as education or disaster relief.|$|E

5|$|A Mixed Tag Team {{match between}} {{the team of}} Michael Shane and Trinity and the team of Chris Sabin and Traci was held next. The match lasted ten minutes and {{nineteen}} seconds. In the final moments of the bout, Traci hit Sabin in the groin and Shane kicked Trinity in the face, which allowed Shane to gain the pinfall on Sabin. After Traci and Shane betrayed <b>their</b> <b>partners,</b> they united an alliance of their own.|$|E
5|$|Lek breeding, where males congregate {{to display}} to females, has been {{recorded}} {{in at least one}} species Cyrtocara eucinostomus. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes, many butterflyfishes, sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, spawning site position and gamete release synchronisation. This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be done by a female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise drive her away.|$|E
5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> that they find someone able bodied.|$|E

5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International and <b>their</b> <b>partners,</b> {{who run the}} Save the Albatross campaign) {{are working}} with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} rodent are monogamous, {{with an adult}} male and female forming a lasting pair bond. Monogamy can come in two forms; obligate and facultative. In obligate monogamy, both parents care for the {{offspring}} and play {{an important part in}} their survival. This occurs in species such as California mice, oldfield mice, Malagasy giant rats and beavers. In these species, males usually mate only with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> In addition to increased care for young, obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the adult male as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female. In facultative monogamy, the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed. Prairie voles appear to be an example of this form of monogamy, with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{promoted}} a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA X Division Championship between then-champion Christopher Daniels and the challengers Chris Sabin and Michael Shane heading into Slammiversary. At Hard Justice, Sabin teamed with Traci to face the team of Shane and Trinity in a Mixed Tag Team match. The match ended with Traci and Shane turning on <b>their</b> <b>partners,</b> forming an alliance. On the May20 episode of Impact!, Shane attacked Daniels and demanded a championship match; then Sabin attacked Shane, resulting in a brawl between the three wrestlers which was broken up by security. The following week on Impact!, Sabin made an alliance with Trinity and Daniels versus Sabin and versus Shane for the title was promoted for Slammiversary.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined how}} {{low and high}} self-esteem people regulate attention {{in the face of}} uncertainty about <b>their</b> <b>partner’s</b> caring. We primed risk regulation processes by leading experimental participants to believe <b>their</b> <b>partner’s</b> caring and responsiveness was in question. We then assessed directed attention to the partner’s positive and negative qualities using a dot-probe paradigm. High, but not low, automatically directed attention away from <b>their</b> <b>partner’s</b> negative traits in response to uncertainty...|$|R

5|$|The ruling Swedish Social Democratic Party have {{remained}} in favour of neutrality and non-alignment. This preference is shared by <b>their</b> <b>partners,</b> the Green Party, {{as well as the}} Left Party. The centre-right Moderate Party and the Liberal Party are the largest parties by current parliamentary representation in favor of NATO membership. The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea is credited with renewed public calls for NATO membership from notable politicians. The Centre Party was opposed to NATO membership until September 2015, when party leadership under Annie Lööf announced that they would motion to change the party policy in order to push for Sweden to join NATO at their next party conference. The Christian Democrats, also previously opposed, likewise voted to support NATO membership at their party meeting on 9 October 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a tag team elimination match, in which The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) teamed with the Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobbs) to face Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake). The rules stated that when any man was eliminated, his tag team partner {{would also be}} eliminated. Blake Beverly and Typhoon began the match, but Beau and Earthquake soon entered the ring as well. The Natural Disasters gained control of the match by attacking Blake Beverly, and the Nasty Boys entered the ring to assist the Disasters. Blake attacked Sags and tagged out of the match. Beau entered but was bodyslammed by Sags; Sags got distracted, however, which allowed Beau to suplex him and bring DiBiase into the match. Money Inc. took turns attacking Sags until Earthquake entered the ring. Earthquake performed an Earthquake splash by sitting on Beau Beverly to pin him and eliminate both Beverly Brothers. Earthquake fought DiBiase, but both men eventually left the ring and were replaced by <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> Typhoon performed a splash on Schyster but was tripped by DiBiase. Schyster pinned Typhoon to eliminate The Natural Disasters. While Schyster was celebrating, Sags quickly pinned him to win the match for the Nasty Boys.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a tag team match pitting {{the team of}} Christian Cage and Sting against the team of Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown. The {{duration}} of the encounter was 15 minutes and 35 seconds. Jarrett was accompanied by Gail Kim. Cage and Brown started the match before they both quickly tagged in <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> Kim interfered by distracting the referee, allowing Jarrett to hit Cage in the groin and throw him to the ringside mat. Kim then assaulted Cage in the ringside area. After several minutes of Jarrett and Brown having the advantage over a beaten Cage, Sting was tagged into the match and placed Jarrett in his signature Scorpion Deathlock submission maneuver. Jarrett submitted to the maneuver, but the referee was unconscious. Team Canada then interfered in the bout, attacking Cage and Sting. Jarrett bashed Sting {{in the face with}} the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt and covered for a near-fall once the referee regained consciousness. Afterwards, Sting forced Jarrett's head into the ring mat with his trademark Scorpion Death Drop maneuver and covered for the pinfall victory.|$|E

5|$|When St. John recovered, he and Lane {{faced the}} new champions and {{defeated}} {{them for the}} title on November 25. They defended the title against several team and entered into a feud with the Brisco Brothers (Jack and Jerry), who had held the belts together on seven previous occasions. This rivalry also included a singles match between St. John and Jack Brisco, in which <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> were handcuffed together outside of the ring to prevent interference. In March 1980, Jack Brisco teamed with Jim Garvin to win the belts from the Bombers. Lane and St. John had one final reign with the championship after defeating Garvin and Keirn, who was substituting for Brisco, on June 7, 1980. That summer, the Brisco Brothers regained the belts, after which the Blonde Bombers parted ways. St. John soon retired, and Lane focused on building {{a career as a}} singles wrestler in Georgia before forming several other tag teams. Later in his career, he teamed with former rival Steve Keirn to form The Fabulous Ones; he was also a member of The Midnight Express and The Heavenly Bodies.|$|E
5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|Mashek and Sherman report some {{interesting}} {{findings on the}} desire for less closeness with partners. Sometimes too much intimacy can be suffocating. People in this situation desire less closeness with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> On one hand, the relationship between attachment styles and desire for less closeness is predictable. People who have fearful–avoidant and anxious–preoccupied attachment styles typically want greater closeness with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> People who have dismissive–avoidant attachment styles typically want less closeness with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> On the other hand, the relatively {{large numbers of people}} who admit to wanting less closeness with <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> (up to 57% in some studies) far outnumbers the people who have dismissive–avoidant attachment styles. This suggests people who have secure, anxious–preoccupied, or fearful–avoidant attachment styles sometimes seek less closeness with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> The desire for less closeness is not determined by attachment styles alone.|$|E

40|$|Thinking {{about how}} other people {{represent}} {{objects in the}} world around them is thought to require deliberate effort. In recent years, interactive "joint action" paradigms have shown how social context can affect our cognitive processing. We tested whether people would represent <b>their</b> <b>partner's</b> point of view in a simple team game. Participants played a game in which they had to judge the magnitude of a number either sat alone, or opposite a partner. Importantly they were never asked to judge <b>their</b> <b>partner's</b> point of view. Remarkably, when playing the game as a team, people were better when <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> happened to share their view of the number, such as when seeing a number 8, than when <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> viewed the number to be different, such as when seeing a number 6 that looked like a number 9 to <b>their</b> <b>partner.</b> In two further experiments, we identified the conditions under which the effect was present. Experiment two showed that the effect was only present after observing the prior involvement of one's partner in the task. Experiment 3, showed that the aspect of the stimulus (its magnitude) that participants were sensitive to {{did not need to be}} the aspect of the stimulus to which <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> was paying attention...|$|R
