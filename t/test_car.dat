Converted to <b>test</b> <b>car</b> DOTX 220, it {{was used}} during testing of the JetTrain, an experimental high-speed trainset, at Transportation Technology Center, Inc. After the lease expired in 2003, it was returned to Amtrak, then later returned to TTCI as DOTX 222.|$|E
5|$|The first {{pre-production}} <b>test</b> <b>car</b> {{based on}} the final Volt design was built in June 2009, in Warren, Michigan, and by October 2009, 80 Volts had been built and were tested under various conditions. On March 31, 2010, the first factory-built Volt was produced at the Detroit Hamtramck Assembly Plant {{in order to test}} the production line and for quality control purposes, both of the tooling and the pre-production vehicles produced before regular production began.|$|E
5|$|After World of Motion {{had closed}} on January 2, 1996, {{everything}} inside the ride building was removed. After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as the high-speed test for Test Track. Work inside the building also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble {{the look of a}} <b>test</b> <b>car</b> that is used to go through multiple safety tests.|$|E
50|$|Many scale <b>test</b> <b>cars</b> were small, old {{railroad}} cars carrying {{heavy metal}} weights as their superstructure. Scale <b>test</b> <b>cars</b> needed special handling {{so they would}} not suffer damage, which might alter their weight. They were reweighed periodically on accurate scales at the railroad's shops.|$|R

25|$|In the March 1958 {{issue of}} Popular Mechanics, 16% of Edsel owners {{reported}} poor workmanship, with complaints ranging from faulty welding to power steering failure. In its <b>test</b> <b>car,</b> Popular Mechanics tested for {{these problems and}} noted others, such as the trunk leaking badly in a storm and the odometer showing fewer than actual miles traveled.|$|E
25|$|With its {{aluminum}} {{body and}} frame, the Insight was an expensive car {{to produce and}} was never designed for high-volume sales. Instead, {{it was designed to}} be a real world <b>test</b> <b>car</b> for hybrid technology and a gauge to new consumer driving habits. With an aerodynamic fuel-saving shape similar to the Audi A2, and some unconventional body colors it was a bit more than mainstream car buyers could handle, preferring more conservative styles. Production halted announced in May 2006, with plans announced to replace Insight with a new hybrid car, smaller than the eighth generation Civic, but not earlier than in 2009. Ahead of this announcement, Honda stopped selling Insight in the UK, for example, as early as December 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The {{track is}} used {{routinely}} for the Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car and Power Laps segments on Top Gear. It also serves myriad roles in other {{portions of the}} programme, especially in <b>testing</b> <b>cars</b> and in challenges. When <b>testing</b> <b>cars,</b> they are often driven around the airfield by the presenters. [...] Afterwards, they are taken around the test track by The Stig to set a lap time. [...] Occasionally, drag races and speed tests are held on the runway.|$|R

5000|$|Most systems had {{cars that}} were {{converted}} to specific uses on the system, other than simply the carriage of passengers.

25|$|Business slumped with General Motors {{after the}} second {{sponsorship}} deal ended for World of Motion in 1992, and as a result, GM started signing 1-year contracts for the ride. However, a suggested idea to gut the building {{and turn it into}} a new attraction stuck with Disney representatives and GM businessmen. It would take World of Motion, close it down, and refurbish it into a new ride that focused only on cars. Thus, World of Motion was shut down to the public while a new attraction, called Test Track, was taking its place. Scheduled to open 19 months after World of Motion's closing, this new ride would put guests in a <b>test</b> <b>car</b> against vehicle tests that were needed to deem the car safe for road travel.|$|E
25|$|Siemens {{publicly}} {{unveiled a}} full-size mockup of the S200 SF in San Francisco on June 16, 2015. The first 64 S200 SF cars {{will be used}} to expand the Muni fleet to 215 cars; once the fleet reaches 215 cars, Breda cars will be retired as new Siemens cars are accepted. On July 2, 2015, Muni was awarded a grant of $41 million from the California Transportation Agency to eventually pay for 40 of the 64 additional Siemens light rail vehicles. The first car was delivered from the Siemens plant in Sacramento to San Francisco on 13 January 2017; it is expected that deliveries will continue through 2028. In early November 2017, a <b>test</b> <b>car</b> passed a CPUC regulatory inspection with only minor correctable issues and received permission to begin reveue service on November 15. The five additional test cars may be certified by December.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2015, a {{train with}} 16 {{passengers}} {{collided with a}} stationary <b>test</b> <b>car</b> on the track. Four passengers — two male, two female, aged between 17 and 27 — received serious leg injuries and were airlifted to hospital for treatment, one of the casualties had to have her left leg amputated due to her injuries while a second casualty had to have her right leg amputated due {{to the extent of}} her injuries. A fifth person with neck and abdominal injuries was also taken to hospital. The other 11 riders were believed to have only minor injuries and received medical treatment at the scene. This has been stated to be the biggest incident to ever occur at Alton Towers. The theme park was closed until 7 June 2015 pending the completion of the investigation. As of September, it had begun testing with both empty carriages and ones filled with test dummies. Ride staff operating The Smiler {{at the time of the}} incident were questioned, including the ride operator and engineer, after reports that it was manually restarted, in similar fashion to the Alton mouse during its incident in 1991. This accident also caused Sonic Spinball (roller coaster) and three other roller coasters at sister parks Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures to close until additional safety procedures were researched or put in place, these rides reopened shortly afterwards, once deemed safe to continue operating. The Smiler reopened on March 19, 2016. Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd was prosecuted at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on 22 April 2016, in which the firm pleaded guilty, and were sentenced to a £5 million fine on 27 September 2016 after a two-day hearing at Stafford Crown Court.|$|E

The new cars will have three doors on each side (increased from the current two, to speed station stops), bike racks, 54 seats per car, and displays giving next-stop information. The new cars’ couplers are incompatible with all prior cars and must run in separate trains. The first <b>test</b> <b>car</b> was unveiled in April 2016. Upon approval, the first 10 cars were expected to be in service in December 2016, and at least 35 by December 2017. Delivery of all 775 cars is expected to be completed by Fall 2022.|$|E
