The author argues that "culture-fair" tests should rather be called "culture-reduced" since they are not tests that are free of cultural conditionment. There are no such tests. The tests under consideration minimalize to a greater or lesser degree the influence of certain cultural factors. While estimating the value of particular kinds of culture-reduced intelligence tests, attention should be given not only to their reliability and validity, but also cultural variables that have been minimalized and to the degree their influence have been minimalized by an appropriate construction...|$|E

The Kernel Conditional Independence Test (KCIT) is currently {{one of the}} most popular CI tests in the non-parametric setting, but many investigators cannot use KCIT with large datasets because the <b>test</b> <b>scales</b> cubicly with sample size. We therefore devise two relaxations called the Randomized Conditional Independence Test (RCIT) and the Randomized conditional Correlation Test (RCoT) which both approximate KCIT by utilizing random Fourier features. In practice, both of the proposed <b>tests</b> <b>scale</b> linearly with sample size and return accurate p-values much faster than KCIT in the large sample size context. CCD algorithms run with RCIT or RCoT also return graphs at least as accurate as the same algorithms run with KCIT but with large reductions in run time.

Two smaller, <b>scaled</b> <b>tests</b> were run prior to the full-scale test. This report develops the thermal scaling laws, describes the pretest thermal and thermomechanical analysis conducted for these two tests, and discusses the material properties data used in the analyses.
