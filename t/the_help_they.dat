25|$|The CPTSD-RI, {{along with}} all other {{assessments}} attempting to measure the severity of child PTSD, had several limitations. First, the CPTSD-RI did not assess {{for all of the}} PTSD symptoms and thus could not provide an accurate assessment of PTSD severity. Additionally, the CPTSD-RI did not assess for functional impairment related to experience with trauma, a limit of many other self-report assessments. These limitations can be combatted by structured interviews given by trained therapists in schools or in a clinical setting. This, however, is problematic because personal interviews are expensive for the families or schools that take part in them, especially when large groups of children are studied, and time consuming. Thus, the CPSS was created to combat these limitations without the need for a supplemental interview. Validated screening tests like the CPSS tests the efficacy of treatment techniques. Without CPSS, the treatments would have no valid test, and children who have experienced trauma will not get <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>they</b> require.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1949 {{owing to}} shared nuclear research, France and Israel {{started to move}} towards an alliance. Following the {{outbreak}} of the Algerian War in late 1954, France began to ship more and more arms to Israel. In November 1954, Shimon Peres visited Paris, where he was received by the French Defense Minister Marie-Pierre Kœnig, who told him that France would sell Israel any weapons it wanted to buy. By early 1955, France was shipping large amounts of weapons to Israel. In April 1956, following another visit to Paris by Peres, France agreed to totally disregard the Tripartite Declaration, and supply even more weapons to Israel. During the same visit, Peres informed the French that Israel had decided upon war with Egypt in 1956. Peres claimed that Nasser was a genocidal maniac intent upon not only destroying Israel, but also exterminating its people, and as such, Israel wanted a war before Egypt received even more Soviet weapons, and there was still a possibility of victory for the Jewish state. Peres asked for the French, who had emerged as Israel's closest ally by this point, to give Israel all <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>they</b> could give in the coming war.|$|E

500|$|For Ivar Lødemel and Heather Trickey, {{editors of}} An Offer You Can't Refuse': Workfare in International Perspective, {{workfare}} programmes' reliance on compulsion makes them throffers. Citing the Danish model as a particular example, the pair argue that workfare {{involves the use}} of compulsory offers; while the work or education is presented as an offer, because recipients of welfare are dependent upon <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>they</b> would lose if they refuse the offer, they effectively have no choice. The compulsive aspect reveals that at least some recipients of welfare, in the eyes of policy makers, require coercion before they will accept offers of work. Neither the chance of paid work nor participation in labour schemes are, alone, enough to encourage some to freely accept the offers they receive. Such compulsion serves to reintegrate people into the labour market, and serves as a kind of [...] "new paternalism". The authors are concerned about this compulsion, and present several arguments against it which are possible or have been utilised in the literature: Firstly, it impacts the rights of those against whom it is used. This may make it objectionable in and of itself, or it may result in undesirable outcomes. Secondly, {{it can be argued that}} benefits must be unconditional in order to act as a genuine safety net. Thirdly, compulsion undermines consumer feedback, and so no differentiation can be made between good and poor programmes presented to those receiving welfare. Fourthly, such coercion may contribute to a culture of resistance among those receiving welfare.|$|E

He {{demonstrates}} this by healing a sick infant that won't stop crying. After getting a distress call from Samandriel, Naomi summons Castiel to rescue the angel. Castiel enlists Dean's help and repeatedly wonders where Sam is, unaware that Sam and Dean are currently not getting along. After getting the ingredients for a [...] "demon bomb", Castiel gets Sam as they will need all <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>they</b> can get to rescue Samandriel and yells at Sam and Dean for their behavior. At the warehouse, Castiel tells Sam and Dean what symbols to neutralize and where so he can enter and gives Sam his sword so he has a weapon against demons. After Sam and Dean clear the way, Castiel enters, but is weakened by the other sigils in the building. Samandriel's screams cause him to remember being tied down by Naomi who approaches his eye with a mysterious instrument and is unable to help Sam and Dean in breaking into the room where Samandriel is. After they get in, Castiel frees Samandriel while Sam and Dean deal with the demons guarding him and takes the other angel outside. There, Samandriel begs for Castiel not to return him to Heaven and tries to warn him that [...] "they" [...] are controlling him. Before Samandriel can explain, Naomi forces Castiel to kill him for being a [...] "traitor". Castiel is horrified by this, but Naomi reveals that Samandriel telling Crowley about the angel Word of God tablet puts all in angels in danger and Castiel is a hero. Under her orders, he claims to Sam and Dean that {{he was forced to}} kill Samandriel in self-defense and that he is taking him back to Heaven to put him to rest (in reality so Naomi can determine just how much he broke), but his weird behavior and the fact that his eye starts bleeding arouses Sam and Dean's suspicions that he is being controlled.|$|E

Men in particular may perceive women from their own cultural heritage who have assimilated into American society as too [...] "independent" [...] and thus incompatible with the traditional family structures that such men may wish to uphold. This may cause men to seek out spouses from their home countries, believing these women will be more willing to take on the traditional household duties of a wife. When these women come to the United States they may experience isolation, particularly if they do not have family members or friends already in the U.S. In such instances, men often control women's access to outside resources and support systems, creating a power imbalance within the home.
