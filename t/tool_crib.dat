[...] The Massachusetts Trade Shop School had been founded by Gouse’s {{grandfather}}, James Gouse, in the 1930s, and his father, Julian Gouse, succeeded his grandfather in running the school in the 1950s. In 1968 Gouse started at the R.I. Trade Shop School and oversaw the initial accreditation of the school by the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools - an organization in which {{his father was a}} founding Director. In 1971, Gouse and his father came to the rescue of the then New England Technical Institute, which had been founded by Ernest Earle in 1940. Upon {{the death of his father}} that year, Gouse assumed the Presidency of the New England Technical Institute. The school that Gouse inherited had four programs of study, seventy students and ten employees. In 1976, Gouse led the effort to change the New England Technical Institute into a not-for-profit degree granting college and renamed it New England Institute of Technology. Today, over 70 years later, New England Institute of Technology has over 3,000 students, 35 degree-granting programs of study and 534 employees.|$|E

40|$|The {{retrieval}} of items from storage is a chore faced by virtually every business concern. Walk/ride and pick systems are a popular method for performing this chore in many applications. When retrieval requests consist of multiple items, order pickers must travel to numerous storage locations to complete each order. When these requests {{are made in}} sufficient volume, a method of order retrieval known as batch picking is often used. Batch picking is a popular approach in the mail-order industry and is employed in industrial settings such as <b>tool</b> <b>cribs</b> and in warehouses, which service assembly line operations. Batch construction heuristics are developed and tested under three strategies for assigning storage space to individual items that have been suggested in the literature. Our results are derived from the simulation of a single hypothetical warehouse model. Specifically, we employ a model that is square in travel distance and assume the walk and pick method of order retrieval with sequential one-way travel. Sensitivity analysis is performed on workforce level and batch size. Our {{results indicate that the}} methods used for constructing batches of orders and for assigning storage space to individual items can significantly impact order retrieval efforts in warehouses of this type. operations management, warehouse management, order batching, storage assignment strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: If {{there is}} one subject that should be taught on an {{individual}} basis, it is mathematics. But most school children do not receive individualized instruction. The majority of math classes consist of a teacher-led lesson directed at the whole class followed by individual practice and sometimes group-activity reinforcement. New teaching methods that have come up do allow students to work through a text book at their own pace, using the teacher as a resource when necessary. This works well {{for students who are}} strong conceptual learners and can process information through written instructions. But a student who learns better through hands-on experiences will flounder through this type of textbook only learning. Traditional styles of teaching focus almost exclusively on auditory presentation of material to students — in other words, lecturing. With the coming up of varied educational technology, it’s the right time to move away from that traditional model towards methods of teaching that address children’s multiple intelligences and are appropriate to different types of learners, not only auditory learners. Through the premises of this study an E-Learning package called Math For Everyone was developed, including a newly conceived application <b>tool</b> known as <b>CRIB</b> (Concept Reinforcement Idea Board) -a tool to represent a concept in different ways by engaging multiple modalities, t...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an industrial project aiming {{to enhance the}} existing simulation modeling suites used at a car engine factory in the UK. The company continues to enhance its simulation modeling capabilities towards so called the 'total plant modeling ' which not only covers the production facilities but also key ancillary facilities. Tool delivery is one such ancillary process. The existing modeling practices at the company are limited to modeling tool changes and assume that tools meet their expected life and the replacement is always available. In reality, the tools are not always reaching the expected life, the facilities in the <b>tool</b> <b>crib</b> are a limiting resource and the tool inventory has to be minimized. The tool delivery system developed in this project has specific features that model how the <b>tool</b> <b>crib</b> operates, how tools are supplied to the machining lines and various operating strategies. ...|$|E

40|$|Absolute Technologies Inc. (ATI) {{has been}} growing for years, and {{is running out of}} space at their current {{manufacturing}} facility in Yorba Linda, CA. ATI will be moving to a much larger facility this winter. They are looking for an efficient way to utilize this space. The machine positions were taken as fixed, seeing as a lean expert was brought in to give advice on placement. With the machines fixed, the scope was narrowed to other areas. A systematic approach to facilities design is utilized. First, a goal needs to be defined. The goal is to reduce the time wasted during the inspection process. The next step is to define the departments. The departments are broken up into two types, those that were possibly applicable to the project, and those that should be disregarded. Next, the relationships between the possibly applicable departments are quantified. A to-from chart was developed to identify the most important department relationships. This chart yielded three important relationships, but the proposed layout of the machines by the LEED expert showed that there was a large distance between one of these three important relationships. This relationship was between the Tool and Gage Crib, and the Inspection Area. A very important process, which involves these two departments, is the Tool Check-out System. This system was analyzed in depth, and simulated in a software package called ProModel. Once the current system was fully understood, Alternative solutions were discussed, the most viable of which being the implementation of an RFID <b>Tool</b> <b>Crib</b> Portal. This proposed system was defined, analyzed, and simulated using ProModel. The simulations of the two tool checkout systems yielded the following results. Save 6. 89 minutes per job Save 2. 87 hours per day Save 840 feet of walking 84 % less Save $ 22, 386 per year on employee time 78. 5 % less per year An overall payback period of approximately 2. 5 year An A 3 report was then developed, in order to help educate the entire company efficiently. This A 3 shows the entire life-cycle of this problem-solving effort in a user-friendly format. Much was learned during this project. Multiple facets of Industrial Engineering were used in the development of this report, and many more could be applied once ATI moves into the new facility. Implementing the RFID <b>Tool</b> <b>Crib</b> Portal is recommended, as the overall benefits of the system should outweigh the initial costs within {{a matter of a few}} years. Also, the A 3 report should be available to every employee who will be affected by the changes implemented. In order for this proposal to work to its full capacity, everyone should be on-board, and up to date with the overall direction of the company...|$|E
40|$|Boeing South Carolina {{builds the}} Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the world's first composite-skinned {{wide-body}} jet. This new manufacturing facility is evolving {{to meet the}} demands of building this complex aircraft. One of the challenges faced by this site is providing the manufacturing workforce with the best tools for the job in an efficient manner. Two different research streams investigate this high-level problem. First is a technical investigation into the selection of a cutter (drill bit) for use in drilling Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) and titanium stacks found in the door surrounds of the aircraft. It was found that a double margin tungsten carbide (WC) cutter with a 1350 point angle and double margin design had superior cost and quality performance as compared to a 1180 point angle polycrystalline diamond (PCD) cutter with a single margin design that was previously used. For this specific application, changing to the proposed WC cutter resulted in savings of approximately 66 % per airplane in tool costs alone and a 62 % reduction in defects. Second is an investigation into the use of tool kits as a means of providing the manufacturing workforce with commonly needed tools. It was found that kits were not as effective as anticipated in reducing the wasted time from retrieving tools at a central location known as a <b>Tool</b> <b>Crib.</b> To ameliorate this, a series of investigations were conducted, creating analytical tools for identifying shortcomings in the tool kitting distribution system. A team was formed to execute improvements based on the analytical tools developed and achieved a 45 % reduction in tools retrieved from outside mechanics' work areas over a 12 -week period. by Jeffrey N.

40|$|In the {{planning}} process of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), an FMS must not be designed to fulfill its intended functions only, but also to perform the intended functions successfully. The latter requires the design of reliability into the system. The decisions involving the number of tools and tool redundancies need to be carried and executed in real time. This research discusses FMS tooling reliability {{in the context of}} the machine loading and part assignment problem. As manufacturing systems become more and more complex, competition and cost grow even more rapidly. Flexible manufacturing systems became the means to narrow the gap between the various different pressures. FMS promises more efficient and effective ways of utilizing resources, information and assets, due to its capability to carry a variety of different tools so that it can perform different operations required in the production of a variety of low to mid size part types. Integer-programming models are developed. The formulations consider an objective function with a set of governing constraints. A reliability level is decided for the tooling system, the models then will return with optimum number of tools and tool copies for each tool type. The overall objective is cost minimization while achieving maximum desired tooling system for the FMS under consideration. Two distinct scenarios are studied, the first considers an FMS where tool sharing is not allowed which implies that each tool magazine will be required to carry the required tools and tool copies to achieve the reliability levels decided and to carry the required machining operations on the different parts assigned to it during each production period. The second scenario is where tool sharing is permitted; in this case if a tool is not available on a particular tool magazine it can be borrowed from another magazine or from the <b>tool</b> <b>crib.</b> Two Genetic algorithms are developed and used to solve the two cases, the solutions are compared to solutions obtained by LINGO optimization software and conclusions are derived. The research conducted in this thesis is aimed at developing cost minimization models for the part assignment and tool loading in flexible manufacturing systems with reliability considerations. The thesis of this research states that tooling system reliability can be integrated in FMS planning decisions, and that such models will complement some of the apparent limitations in the existing models. The models aim at assessing decision-maker to decide a minimum tooling system reliability and to optimize overall processing and tooling cost of the part assignment and tool loading of FMS. A solution methodology is also presented in this thesis. The solution takes into account part assignment and tool loading along with tooling system reliability of FMS under consideration.
