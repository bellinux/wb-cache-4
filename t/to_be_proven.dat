5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proven</b> whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
5|$|A few {{physicists}} {{persisted in}} developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears {{to obey the}} laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments {{for the existence of}} photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proven.</b>|$|E
5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proven</b> by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E

5|$|Other {{plants that}} are {{considered}} to be protocarnivorous have sticky trichomes on some surface, such as the flower scape and bud of Stylidium and Plumbago, the bracts of Passiflora foetida, and leaves of Roridula. The trichomes of Stylidium, which appear below the flower, have been known to trap and kill small insects since their discovery several centuries ago, but their purpose remained ambiguous. In November 2006, Dr. Douglas Darnowski published a paper describing the active digestion of proteins when they come in contact with a trichome of a Stylidium species grown in aseptic tissue culture, proving that the plant, rather than the surface microbes, was the source of protease production. Darnowski asserts in that paper that given this evidence, Stylidium species are properly called carnivorous, though in order to fulfill the strict definition of carnivory it needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proven</b> that they are capable of absorbing nutrients derived from prey and that this adaptation gives the plants some competitive advantage.|$|E
5|$|Thongs and Octopus {{are taken}} to the triad boss, who insists the baby is his grandson, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proven</b> wrong by the blood test. Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse so the baby can be with his son, {{prompting}} Thongs and Octopus {{to fight for the}} baby. The two end up trapped in the room with two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. Thongs and Octopus run to the garage with the comatose baby, where Thongs attempts to revive him with a makeshift defibrillator powered by a car battery from a Pagani Zonda. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock capital punishment demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced by the Department of Justice. Thongs, Octopus, and the Landlord then see the baby alive and well with his parents. As a token of appreciation for saving the baby's life, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs by the Lee family as a bodyguard, chauffeur and head of security respectively.|$|E
