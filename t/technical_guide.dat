2500|$|The USDA {{shows that}} grassed {{waterways}} {{of less than}} 5% slopes for a chosen waterway will greatly reduce velocity of draining water within the land. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) offers {{the use of an}} online Soil survey to view the area of land to be planted and examine slope and soil drainage. As viewed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, soil drainage is the number one priority for location of certain grasses. [...] Poorer drainage causes less infiltration of water into the soil as groundwater recharge causing ponding and flooding of surrounding crops. [...] Higher drainage becomes more droughty which hinders the establishment of certain grasses good for waterways. [...] Medium soil drainage becomes the most suitable for planting. [...] Determining exact grasses and seed amounts to plant follows specifications of a local NRCS Field Office <b>Technical</b> <b>Guide</b> and the Contour Buffer practice standard while taking practice on land and regional environmental conditions into consideration.|$|E
