50|$|Skin is opaque to light. In physics light reception, heat {{or other}} type of radiant energy {{on the part of}} {{molecules}} is called absorption. When tissues are illuminated during translumination, some light is absorbed and some reflected. It is known that an object which absorbs all radiation is seen as black; the pigments that give color to the skin and the other tissues, absorb certain wavelengths of white light and transmit radiant energy. This is an aspect of color as captured by our vision. The mechanism by which certain substances absorb more light than others apparently depends on their molecular structure. Light, when reaching more pigmented areas, disperses and reflects more easily; the refraction index is smaller, and it is difficult for white light to penetrate below the skin. Studies of the distribution of elastin and collagen fibers in patients with dermal lesions need to be analyzed for changes. A study of tissue consistency using translumination and dermatoscopy could supply important data complementing the diagnosis of some collagen diseases and study <b>tissue</b> <b>aging.</b> Skin color affects the effectiveness of translumination; individuals with light skin have better venous visualization during the translumination than those with darker skin.|$|E

Human skin is a primary target of oxidative stress from ROS generated from both extrinsic and intrinsic sources, like ultraviolet irradiation (UV) and endogenous oxidative metabolism. Oxidative stress causes the alterations of collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM), the hallmark of skin connective <b>tissue</b> <b>aging.</b> Age-related alteration of dermal collagenous ECM impairs skin structural integrity and creates a tissue microenvironment that promotes age-related skin diseases, such as poor wound healing and skin cancer.

40|$|Human skin is {{a primary}} target of {{oxidative}} stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from both extrinsic and intrinsic sources. Oxidative stress inhibits the production of collagen, the most abundant protein in skin, and thus contributes to connective <b>tissue</b> <b>aging.</b> Here we report that cysteine-rich protein 61 (CCN 1), a negative regulator of collagen production, is markedly induced by ROS and mediates loss of type I collagen in human dermal fibroblasts. Conversely, antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly reduced CCN 1 expression and prevented ROS-induced loss of type I collagen in both human dermal fibroblasts and human skin in vivo. ROS increased c-Jun, a critical member of transcription factor AP- 1 complex, and increased c-Jun binding to the AP- 1 site of the CCN 1 promoter. Functional blocking of c-Jun significantly reduced CCN 1 promoter and gene expression and thus prevented ROS-induced loss of type I collagen.

40|$|Aims Advanced glycation end {{products}} (AGEs) are {{increased in}} patients with diabetes and are associated with diastolic dysfunction through the formation of collagen crosslinks in the heart. The association among AGEs, diastolic function, and aerobic capacity in heart failure (HF) patients with and without diabetes is, however, unknown. We therefore studied the association among <b>tissue</b> <b>AGEs,</b> diastolic function, and aerobic capacity {{in patients with}} HF with or without diabetes. Methods and results In chronic HF patients (with and without left ventricular systolic dysfunction), <b>tissue</b> <b>AGEs</b> [skin autofluorescence (AF) ], diastolic function (echocardiographic mean E' and E/E'), and aerobic capacity [peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing] were obtained. A total of 49 diabetics and 156 non-diabetics were included. Diabetics were older and had more cardiovascular risk factors, but left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) were similar. <b>Tissue</b> <b>AGEs</b> were higher in diabetics compared with non-diabetics (2. 8 +/- 0. 8 vs. 2. 3 +/- 0. 7 a. u.; P < 0. 001). Furthermore, there was a correlation between <b>tissue</b> <b>AGEs</b> and mean E' (r = - 0. 30; P < 0. 001, after adjustment for age, r = - 0. 21; P = 0. 004). Aerobic capacity was significantly lower in diabetic patients with HF (peak VO(2) : 17. 4 +/- 5. 1 vs. 21. 7 +/- 6. 1 mL/min/kg; P = 0. 001), even after adjustment for age and LVEF. Peak VO(2) was related to skin AF (P = 0. 03), independent of age, diabetes, LVEF, and New York Heart Association functional class.

This is due to their capacity for extensive proliferation and differentiation into effector cells. More recently {{it has been shown that}} the proliferative and differentiative ability of stem cells decrease with age, suggesting that this may play a role in <b>tissue</b> <b>aging.</b> Down Syndrome (DS), is associated with many of the signs of premature <b>tissue</b> <b>aging</b> including T-cell deficiency, increased incidence of early Alzheimer-type and Myelodysplastic-type disease and leukemia. Previously we have shown that both hematopoietic (HSC) and neural stem cells (NSC) in patients affected by DS showed signs of accelerated aging. In this study we tested the hypothesis that changes in gene expression in HSC and NSC of patients affected by DS reflects changes occurring in stem cells with age. The profiles of genes expressed in HSC and NSC from DS patients highlights pathways associated with cellular aging including a downregulation of DNA repair genes and increases in proapoptotic genes, s-phase cell cycle genes, inflammation and angiogenesis genes. Interestingly, Notch signaling was identified as a potential hub, which when deregulated may drive stem cell aging.

40|$|Background: Diastolic {{dysfunction}} is {{a frequent}} cause of heart failure. particularly in dialysis patients. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are increased in dialysis patients and are suggested {{to play a role}} in the development of diastolic dysfunction. The aim of our study was to assess whether AGE accumulation in dialysis patients is related to the presence of diastolic dysfunction. Methods and Results: Data were analyzed from 43 dialysis patients, age 58 +/- 15 years. of whom 65 % were male. Diastolic function was assessed using tissue velocity imaging (TVI) oil echocardiography. <b>Tissue</b> <b>AGE</b> accumulation was measured using a validated skin-autofluorescence (skin-AF) reader. Plasma N-epsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and N-epsilon-(carboxyethyl) lysine (CEL) were measured by stable-isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma pentosidine was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Skin-AF correlated with mean E'(r = - 0. 51, P <. 001), E/A ratio(r = - 0. 39, P =. 014). and E/E'(r = 0. 38, P =. 019). Plasnia AGEs were not significantly associated with diastolic function. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that 54 % of the variance of average E' was explained by age (P =. 007) dialysis type (P = 0. 016), and skin-AF (P =. 013). Conclusions: <b>Tissue</b> <b>AGEs</b> measured as skin-AF. but not plasma AGE levels, were related to diastolic function in dialysis patients.

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in T 2 DM, resulting in inflammation, oxidative stress, and protein cross-linking, which are known contributors to neurodegeneration. We aimed to study whether <b>tissue</b> <b>AGE</b> accumulation is associated with T 2 DM-related brain atrophy. We performed brain magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive tests, and noninvasive skin autofluorescence (SAF; a measure of <b>tissue</b> <b>AGE</b> levels) on people aged > 55 years with and without T 2 DM. Multivariable linear regression was used to study the relationships among T 2 DM, SAF, and gray matter volume (GMV). There were 486 people included in the study. T 2 DM was associated with greater SAF. Greater SAF, T 2 DM, and cognitive impairment were each associated with lower GMV independently of age, sex, and total intracranial volume.

40|$|Background: Renal {{dysfunction}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important co-morbidities in terms of pathophysiology, prognosis and treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF). Renal dysfunction in chronic heart failure is both related to a decreased renal blood flow and an increased deposition of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Worsening renal function (WRF) occurs in one third of the CHF patients and is related to an increased mortality and hospital re-admissions. This is the first study to investigate whether a decreased cardiac output, peak VO 2 and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are independent predictors of a decline in renal function in CHF patients. Methods: After dichotomizing the CHF patients from the BENEFICIAL trial (1), baseline characteristics were compared. In uni- and multivariate analyses the relationship was investigated between respectively cardiac output, peak VO 2 and skin <b>tissue</b> <b>AGEs</b> with a change in creatinine concentration. Results: Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that peak VO 2, but not cardiac output, was an independent predictor of change in renal function in CHF patients (r=- 0. 245; P= 0. 015). However, no independent relationship has been determined between the concentration skin <b>tissue</b> <b>AGEs</b> and the change in renal function in this CHF study population. Conclusions: A decline in renal function was associated with a lower peak VO 2 at baseline. We therefore suggest that peak VO 2 is a better predictor of organ perfusion than cardiac output alone. Although it is believed that reduced renal function leads to an increased accumulation of <b>tissue</b> <b>AGEs,</b> skin <b>tissue</b> <b>AGEs</b> are not significantly related to a change in renal function in CHF patients in this study. ...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} is an irreversible proliferation arrest, tumor suppression {{process and}} likely contributor to <b>tissue</b> <b>aging.</b> Senescence is often characterized by domains of facultative heterochromatin, called senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), which repress expression of proliferation-promoting genes. Given its likely contribution to tumor suppression and <b>tissue</b> <b>aging,</b> {{it is essential}} to identify all components of the SAHF assembly pathway. Formation of SAHF in human cells is driven by a complex of histone chaperones, namely, HIRA and ASF 1 a. In yeast, the complex orthologous to HIRA/ASF 1 a contains two additional proteins, Hpc 2 p and Hir 3 p. Using a sophisticated approach to search for remote orthologs conserved in multiple species through evolution, we identified the HIRA-associated proteins, UBN 1 and UBN 2, as candidate human orthologs of Hpc 2 p. We show that the Hpc 2 -related domain of UBN 1, UBN 2, and Hpc 2 p is an evolutionarily conserved HIRA/Hir-binding domain, which directly interacts with the N-terminal WD repeats of HIRA/Hir. UBN 1 binds to proliferation-promoting genes that are repressed by SAHF and associates with histone methyltransferase activity that methylates lysine 9 of histone H 3, a site that is methylated in SAHF. UBN 1 is indispensable for formation of SAHF. We conclude that UBN 1 is an ortholog of yeast Hpc 2 p and a novel regulator of senescence. status: publishe...|$|E

BMP signaling activity from the niche significantly decreases with age, and increasing BMP signaling can prolong GSC life span and promote their proliferation. In addition, the age-dependent E-cadherin decline in the stem cell-niche junction also contributes to stem cell aging.

Aims and Methods: We aimed to assess <b>tissue</b> <b>AGE</b> in two populations with increased oxidative stress: cirrhosis and haemodialysis (HD) and determine whether skin AF is a non-invasive marker of liver disease severity. We studied 56 patients (28 cirrhotics, 28 age and sex matched HD patients) and compared with a normal control database (NC). <b>Tissue</b> <b>AGE</b> was measured using UV autofluorescence (AF) (AGE Reader, DiagnOptics, The Netherlands). Three sequential readings {{were taken from the}} palmar aspect of the forearm, approximately 10 cm below the elbow, avoiding pigmentation or vascular structures. History of diabetes mellitus (DM) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was noted and Child–Pugh (CP) and Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores calculated. Results: Mean age 56 ± 15 years, 64 % male. 71 % alcoholic cirrhosis, median CP score 8, MELD 12. DM and IHD prevalence was similar in both groups; no cirrhotic patient had renal impairment. Compared with NC, mean AF was significantly higher in both HD (3. 264 vs 2. 218, CI 0. 691 to 1. 402, p = < 0. 0001) and cirrhosis (2. 632 vs 2. 218, CI 0. 082 to 0. 746, p = 0. 016). When cirrhotic patients with DM and IHD were excluded, this became insignificant (2. 352 vs 2. 157, CI to 0. 116 to 0. 506, p = 0. 209). Mean AF was significantly higher in HD compared with cirrhosis (3. 264 vs 2. 632, CI 0. 180 to 1. 084, p = 0. 007). Conclusion: Despite high levels of cumulative metabolic stress in both HD and cirrhosis, <b>tissue</b> <b>AGE</b> is only increased in HD. Both conditions are associated with elevated serum AGE levels but the mechanism underlying the differential tissue deposition is unknown. One hypothesis that may explain the reduced cardiovascular risk in cirrhosis is that soluble RAGE acts as a decoy receptor preventing AGE-RAGE interaction and the resulting endothelial dysfunction. Skin AF measurement is unhelpful as a non-invasive tool to detect cirrhosis...|$|R

Mechanistic studies in vitro have {{shed light on}} the role of mTOR-dependent growth signals in promoting senescence and exhaustion of quiescent stem cells, thus linking excess nutrients to <b>tissue</b> <b>ageing.</b> Novel findings add complexity to this theoretical framework, revealing that mTOR cooperates with autophagy to promote the "secretory phenotype" of senescent cells and the release of factors known to contribute to defective renewal and dysfunction of <b>aging</b> <b>tissues.</b> Thus, both cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms link unchecked mTOR activity to cell senescence and by extension to the aging process.

5|$|The {{characteristic}} {{flavor of}} cabbage {{is caused by}} glucosinolates, a class of sulfur-containing glucosides. Although found throughout the plant, these compounds are concentrated in the highest quantities in the seeds; lesser quantities are found in young vegetative tissue, and they decrease as the <b>tissue</b> <b>ages.</b> Cooked cabbage is often criticized for its pungent, unpleasant odor and taste. These develop when cabbage is overcooked and hydrogen sulfide gas is produced.|$|R
