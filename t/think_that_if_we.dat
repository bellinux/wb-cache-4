And that's why I decided to name my tour that way, because I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> all have a little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{qualified}} to swim for Australia, another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western world, led by the United States. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Evans' relay teammate Tonelli believed that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete and publicise their cause among the Australian public. Evans was fully supportive of Tonelli's campaign, reflecting that [...] "We were political tools, and the only ones to suffer would be us." [...] He rhetorically asked: [...] "Do you really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> didn't go someone would come up to us after the Games and pat us on the back for not going?" ...|$|E
500|$|The rebel {{qualities of}} the group were on show in the lead-up to the Olympics. An {{obstacle}} arose with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in a}} boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western world, led by the United States.

2500|$|An {{element of}} British public and {{political}} sentiment favoured a negotiated peace with Germany, among them Halifax as Foreign Secretary. Over {{three days in}} May (26–28 May 1940), there were repeated discussions within the War Cabinet of whether the UK should associate itself with French approaches to Mussolini to use his good offices with Hitler to seek a negotiated peace: they terminated in refusal to do so. Various interpretations are possible of this episode and of Churchill's argument that [...] "it was idle to <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out", but throughout Churchill seems to have opposed any immediate peace negotiations. Although at times personally pessimistic about Britain's chances for victory—Churchill told Hastings Ismay on 12 June 1940 that [...] "ou and I will be dead in three months' time"—his use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British for a long war.|$|E

40|$|Hume's 'Natural History of Religion' {{offers a}} {{naturalized}} {{account of the}} causes of religious thought, an investigation into its 'origins' rather than its 'foundation in reason'. Hume <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> consider only the causes of religious belief, we are provided with a reason to suspend the belief. I seek to explain why this is so, and what role the argument plays in Hume's wider campaign against the rational acceptability of religious belief. In particular, I argue that the work threatens a form of fideism which maintains that it is rationally permissible to maintain religious belief in the absence of evidence or of arguments in its favour. I also discuss the 'argument from common consent', and the relative superiority of Hume's account of the origins of religious belief. © 2007 The Author...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{would suggest}} {{carrying}} this poor fellow to my house, {{but it would}} give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> put something over his face he will be safe until morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Lizz, that's jolly, we're {{bound for}} the same port, and can set sail in company; whether we keep {{together}} or not depends on circumstances, not to mention wind and weather.

6000|$|... "I do {{not mean}} to tell you that. After all, though it be my trade to jest, it is not my way to deal in falsehood.

"I <b>think,</b> sir, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> send forward, at once, a {{regiment}} of French {{soldiers from}} Toledo, accompanied by Colonel Crofton's regiment of dragoons, {{there is no}} likelihood that any resistance will be offered--indeed, I should imagine that the governor will have taken to flight, {{as soon as he}} learns that his plans for the assassination of Major Kennedy have failed." ...|$|R
50|$|We {{can begin}} our {{description}} of Scanlon’s contractualism {{by noting that}} judgements about right and wrong, unlike empirical judgements, are not theoretical claims {{about the nature of}} the spatiotemporal world but rather practical claims about what we have reason to do. Further, they are a particularly important class of practical claims in that the judgement that an action is wrong is taken to provide reasons to not do that action which are most often considered to be decisive against competing reasons. Following this point, Scanlon takes questions about the reason-giving force of moral judgements to be prior to questions about the subject matter of the morality of right and wrong. More explicitly, he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> provide an account of the extraordinary reason-giving force of moral judgements then this account could largely form the basis for a characterisation of the subject matter of what we owe to each other.|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{get past}} Cawnpore in safety {{there is not}} much to fear. There is no other large place on the river, and the lower we get down the less likely the natives are to disturb us, knowing, as they are almost sure to do, that a force is {{gathering}} at Allahabad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} talking together, master; and we <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to call out that they might take the bodies away, without any {{interference}} by us, they would do so.

6000|$|... "We {{had that}} {{question}} the other night, didn't we? Our legal friend here {{seemed to feel}} that we might rub along indefinitely as we are doing, or work out an Altruria of our own; or {{go back to the}} patriarchal stage and own our working-men. He seemed not to have so much faith in the logic of events as I have. I doubt if it is altogether a woman's logic. Parole femmine, fatti maschi, and the logic of events isn't altogether words; it's full of hard knocks, too. But I'm no prophet. I can't forecast the future; I prefer to take it as it comes. There's a little tract of William Morris's, though--I forget just what he calls it--that is full of curious and interesting speculation on this point. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> keep the road we are now going, the last state of labor will be like its first, and it will be owned." ...|$|R

They move slowly in England--I was born there--and I'm not sure they're very much quicker in Ottawa. In fact, they rather like an {{energetic}} protest, and you very seldom get anything without it. Once we show we're in earnest they'll send over a special commissioner with instructions to make any concessions he thinks will please us." ...|$|R

"'I should <b>think,</b> Mr. Earnshaw, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were {{to bring}} the pinnace with that four pounder gun in the bow and up end it, and with a small charge fire a ball with a rope {{fastened}} to it up into that clump of trees we saw just about {{the middle of the}} island, it might get caught.' ...|$|R

"I {{beg your}} pardon, Major, but don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to wind some thin rope very tightly round them {{three or four}} inches thick, they might stand a charge or two of grape to give them at close quarters; we needn't put in a very heavy charge of powder.

6000|$|... "A safe conclusion," [...] {{said the}} captain, laughing; [...] "but {{that is just}} the point. Gold has turned up in all {{directions}} near the valley, and why should we not find it there? Besides, there is a pretty fair bit of land under cultivation, and vegetables fetch fabulous prices at the diggin's; in addition to which there are a good many cattle on the ground, and provisions of all kinds are as good as gold just now--so, you see, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> don't find more of the dust on it, there is some chance that you may raise the wind by the property if you act wisely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there are}} any parties watching," [...] he said to Mike, [...] "they will expect that my messenger, or I myself, will travel by the main road to Almarez, for {{not only is it}} better, but it is shorter. But again, they might <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> I {{suspected}} <b>we</b> might be attacked, I should take the road through Deleytoza, and would, at any rate, make matters safe by watching both roads. It is a difficult question which to choose." ...|$|R

[...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were in her place we could just manage to lay our course along the coast, but with those square yards of hers, she cannot go as close to the wind as we can. As it is, we can lay our course to cut her off." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{will take}} the story simply as it stands we shall see easily enough. For it is all simple and natural enough. Jacob and Esau, we shall see, were men of like passions with ourselves; men as we are, mixed up of good and evil, {{sometimes}} right and sometimes wrong: and God rewarded them when they did right, and punished them when they did wrong, just as he does with us now.|$|E
40|$|It was in {{the year}} 2000. And that same day, we saw {{that they had a}} book with them with the {{addresses}} of the next families {{that they were going to}} evict.
