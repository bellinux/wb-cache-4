Such a general theory would arise out of the ecological and biological sciences and attempt to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break <b>things</b> <b>down</b> into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.|$|E

25|$|Fuchs {{lost control}} of the team in August 1935, and the new owners tried to change the team's image by {{renaming}} it the Boston Bees. This did little to change the team's fortunes. After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate Lou Perini, changed the nickname back to the Braves. He immediately set about rebuilding the team. World War II slowed <b>things</b> <b>down</b> a little, but the team rode the pitching of Warren Spahn to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{returned}} to the WWF ring {{in the fall of}} 1993, at a time when Bret's feud with Lawler was temporarily sidetracked. Bret, along with Owen and their brothers Bruce and Keith, were scheduled to face Lawler and his team at Survivor Series. However, Lawler was unable {{to make it to the}} show, and as a result could not appear on WWF television. Lawler was replaced with Shawn Michaels. During the match Owen and Bret inadvertently crashed into each other, causing Owen to be eliminated from the team. Owen showed up after the match and had a heated confrontation with Bret, while Keith, Bruce and Stu tried to calm <b>things</b> <b>down.</b> This confrontation resulted in Owen leaving the ring to boos while his brothers and father watched in dismay and mother Helen cried at ringside. The following night Owen adopted the pink and black tights, sunglasses and Sharpshooter finisher to send a message to his brother. Owen, angry with being in Bret's shadow, challenged his brother which Bret declined. Instead the brothers seemed to reunite by the holidays.|$|E

My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion.

25|$|After he {{graduated}} from Occidental, Jeffers went to the University of Southern California (USC) to study at first literature, and then medicine. He met Una Call Kuster in 1906; she was three years older than he was, a graduate student, and {{the wife of a}} Los Angeles attorney. Jeffers and Mrs. Kuster became lovers. Mr. Kuster discovered their affair in 1910. Jeffers dropped out of USC medical school and enrolled as a forestry student at the University of Washington in Seattle, a course of study that he abandoned after a semester, at which time he returned to Los Angeles. By 1912 the affair became a scandal, reaching {{the front page of the}} Los Angeles Times. Una spent some time in Europe to quiet <b>things</b> <b>down,</b> then the lovers lived together by Lake Washington to await the completion of Una's divorce. The two were married in 1913, then moved to La Jolla, California, and finally Carmel, California, where Jeffers constructed Tor House and Hawk Tower. The couple had a daughter who died a day after birth in 1913, and then twin sons (Donnan and Garth) in 1916. Una died of cancer in 1950. Jeffers died in 1962; an obituary can be found in the New York Times, January 22, 1962.|$|E
25|$|On 17 August a young Jewish boy {{was stabbed}} to death by Arabs while {{retrieving}} a football, while an Arab was badly wounded in a brawl with Palestinian Jews. Strongly tied to the anti-Hashemite party, and attacked by supporters of Abdullah in Transjordan for misusing funds marked out for campaigning against France, al-Husseini asked for a visa for himself and Awni Abd al-Hadi to travel to Syria, where {{the leadership of the}} Syrian anti-French cause was being contested. Averse to his presence in Syria, the French asked him to put off the journey. Meanwhile, despite Harry Luke's lecturing journalists to avoid reporting such material, rumors circulated in both communities, of an imminent massacre of Jews by Muslims, and of an assault on the Haram ash-Sharif by Jews. On 21 August a funeral cortège, taking the form of a public demonstration for the dead Jewish boy, wound its way through the old city, with the police blocking attempts to break into the Arab quarters. On the 22nd, Luke convoked representatives of both parties to calm <b>things</b> <b>down,</b> and undersign a joint declaration. Awni Abd al-Hadi and Jamal al-Husayni were ready to recognize Jewish visiting rights at the Wall in exchange for Jewish recognition of Islamic prerogatives at the Buraq. The Jewish representative, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, considered this beyond his brief—which was limited to an appeal for calm—and the Arabs in turn refused. They agreed to pursue their dialogue the following week.|$|E

He is primarily a defensive midfielder, reportedly priding himself on [...] "ball-winning ground-covering defensive midfield work"; his major contribution to his team comes from [...] "flying around midfield winning the ball and disrupting the opposition".

[...] "These were not people who wrote <b>things</b> <b>down</b> in the computer or in notebooks. It was all in their heads," [...] he said, adding that much of the knowledge would not be recoverable. Several current and former intelligence officials, however, said that the CIA had numerous operatives with experience in Afghanistan, as the country was considered strategic during the Cold War, and because the U.S. has been involved in active warfare there for the last eight years.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{performance}} at the SAP Center at San Jose, Jim Harrington of the East Bay Times stated that Lovato [...] "outshined" [...] Jonas and that she did [...] "some of her best work of the night on the slower material, touching hearts with the Unbroken cut 'Fix a Heart' and the Demi track 'Nightingale'". Kelli Skye Fadroski of Daily Breeze gave a positive review of the concert held at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California, saying, [...] "Slowing things a bit , she pulled a bar stool onto the catwalk and absolutely killed during 'Fix a Heart'". An editor of The Columbus Dispatch praised Lovato's vocals on the show offered in Columbus, Ohio, writing, [...] "Even when she slowed <b>things</b> <b>down</b> with older tracks 'Fix A Heart' and 'Nightingale', her powerhouse vocals reverberated throughout the arena".|$|E
500|$|Considered by {{many critics}} {{as one of}} Dylan's masterpieces, [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] proved {{difficult}} to capture on tape. Heylin places the writing {{in the fall of}} 1965, when Dylan was living in the Chelsea Hotel with his wife Sara. In the New York recording studio, on November 30, Dylan announced his epic composition: [...] "This is called 'Freeze Out'." [...] Gill notes that this working title captures the [...] "air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched... full of whispering and muttering." [...] Wilentz relates how Dylan guided his backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to sketch out how he wanted it played, saying at one point, [...] "it's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's hard is Robbie." [...] Wilentz notes that, as Dylan quiets <b>things</b> <b>down,</b> he inches closer to what will appear on the album.|$|E

500|$|David Sims, also {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, {{called it a}} fitting end to the season, [...] "leaving {{absolutely}} everyone salivating for season two." [...] Writing for the Star-Ledger, Jenifer Braun praised the episode for its set dressing ("I have to say, it’s a pleasure {{just to look at}} all the shiny stuff the HBO set dressers came up with for Tywin Lannister's tent") and the authenticity of the baby dragons ("And wow, HBO, seamless special effects here. Baby Dragon looks every bit as real as the series’ dogs"). HitFix said it [...] "Wrapped up its terrific first season...it was damned entertaining along the way--with the finale as possibly the most entertaining so far--and we know that at least one more season is coming. And if the creative team can keep up this level of quality, it's hard to imagine HBO shutting <b>things</b> <b>down</b> anytime soon, even with a budget that only figures to get higher.

500|$|Though {{previous}} Halo novels {{had been}} written by professional writers like Eric Nylund and William C. Dietz, publisher Tor Books chose Staten to write the fifth Halo novelization, entitled [...] Editor Eric Raab noted in the book's press release that [...] "who better to tell the tale" [...] of humanity's encounter with the antagonistic alien Covenant than Staten, who had [...] "intimate knowledge" [...] of the series' story. The novel is an ensemble piece, with the action being narrated from both human and alien viewpoints; the work of Staten's favorite science-fiction authors helped teach him the importance of honing a [...] "strong, consistent voice". Staten found that writing compelling action involved slowing <b>things</b> <b>down,</b> paradoxically {{the opposite of the}} fast-paced gameplay of a Halo title. He considered the book the perfect way to elaborate on the Halo story without stripping it down for a video game, and flesh out the character of Avery Johnson more than the games had allowed.|$|E
500|$|Some of the New York {{recordings}} were uptempo {{and contain}} {{in the fifth}} verse the additional line [...] "He examines the nightingale's code".

At one point, Dylan says: [...] "It's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's hard is Robbie." [...] Analyzing {{the evolution of the}} song in the New York recording session, Wilentz writes that Dylan [...] "quiets <b>things</b> <b>down,</b> inching closer to what will eventually appear on Blonde on Blonde—and it is still not right." [...] Several complete takes of the song were recorded on November 30, including one with an uptempo rock beat, containing harpsichord accompaniment, and another with a march-like tempo, which was released on [...] in 2005.|$|E

500|$|In the UK it {{was agreed}} that Madeleine's home force, Leicestershire police—led by Chief Constable Matt Baggott—would {{coordinate}} the British response, although it remained a Portuguese inquiry. A strategic coordinating group, or [...] "gold" [...] group, was put together, representing Leicestershire police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), and the National Police Improvement Agency. The Polícia Judiciária gave a team from the UK a room in which to work, but apparently resented their presence. The British police were used to feeding their data into HOLMES 2 (the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System). In Portugal, information was collected in boxes. In addition the Polícia Judiciária had less autonomy than police in the UK, often having to wait for magistrates' decisions, which slowed <b>things</b> <b>down.</b> In an interview for Anthony Summers' and Robbyn Swan's book Looking for Madeleine (2014), Jim Gamble, head of CEOP at the time, said the Portuguese police felt they were being condescended to, and that the British were acting as a [...] "colonial power".|$|E

Donna and Ringo later begin a relationship, but when Donna wants to take things further, Ringo tells her {{that he wants to}} slow <b>things</b> <b>down.</b> Donna believes that she is being rejected and when she hears about Ringo's relationship with Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair) and then sees them together, she confronts Ringo. Ringo then tries to convince Donna that his heart belongs to her. The couple's relationship goes through various problems. During a moment of time together at home, Donna leaves Ringo to retrieve the cat and the house is set alight. Donna is forced to rescue Ringo and drag him outside. After Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) returns to Ramsay Street, Ringo believes that Donna had cheated on him with his friend and breaks up with her. Donna then goes to Zeke to seek solace and it leads to a love triangle between the three of them.|$|E

The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who were divided regarding its humour, but ultimately praised the cast. Wanderlust underperformed at the box office, earning just over $20 million worldwide during its theatrical run. Åkerman appeared in the comedy film The Giant Mechanical Man, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 23, 2012, to average reviews. She had {{a supporting}} role in the 2012 rock musical film Rock of Ages, based on the stage production of the same name. She played Constance Sack, a journalist who interviews Tom Cruise's character Stacee Jaxx. She hired a vocal coach as her role required her to sing; she and Cruise recorded a duet of Foreigner's [...] "I Want to Know What Love Is" [...] (1984). Although the film grossed lower than expected, its opening weekend gross in the United States became the third-highest ever for an adaption of a stage production.|$|E
