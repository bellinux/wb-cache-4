25|$|Employees {{were given}} 14 minutes between each shift to punch the <b>time</b> <b>clock,</b> walk to their {{respective}} workbench and prepare for work. It took a minimum of eight minutes for all the employees to get by the <b>time</b> <b>clock.</b> The estimated walking time for employees ranged from 30 seconds to three minutes, but some workers needed {{as many as eight}} minutes to reach their workbenches. Upon arriving at their workbench, employees were required to put on aprons or overalls, removed shirts, tape or grease arms, put on finger cots, prepare equipment, turn on switches, open windows, and/or assemble or sharpen tools. Such preparatory activities consumed three to four minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Murphy {{subsequently}} {{turned to}} {{the facts of the}} case. On the basis of the factual record, which proved decisive in the case, the court found that work had, in fact, begun and ended at the scheduled hours and that the employees had no basis for a claim in this regard. The court did not find that the <b>time</b> <b>clock</b> evidence was reliable. [...] " [...] clocks do not necessarily record the actual time worked by employees," [...] Murphy wrote. Since it took eight minutes for an entire shift to punch in, it would be unfair to credit the first worker in line for eight minutes of work, and the time clocks did not show the time at which employees were compelled to be on the premises or at their workbenches.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1880s, {{technologies}} {{emerged that}} would ultimately form {{the core of}} International Business Machines (IBM). Julius E. Pitrat patented the computing scale in 1885; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888); Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine; and Willard Bundy invented a <b>time</b> <b>clock</b> to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889. On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York. The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto. They manufactured machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards. Thomas J. Watson, Sr., fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson, called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered CTR. [...] Watson joined CTR as General Manager then, 11 months later, was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved. [...] Having learned Patterson's pioneering business practices, Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR's companies. He implemented sales conventions, [...] "generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker". His favorite slogan, [...] "THINK", became a mantra for each company's employees. [...] During Watson's first four years, revenues reached $9 million and the company's operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. [...] "Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR" [...] and in 1924 chose {{to replace it with}} the more expansive title [...] "International Business Machines". [...] By 1933 most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.|$|E

40|$|Temporal trajectories can {{represent}} the complex mappings between story <b>time</b> and <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> {{that are to}} be found in shared interactive narratives such as computer games and interactive performances. There are three kinds. Canonical trajectories express an author’s intended mapping of story <b>time</b> onto <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> as part of the plot and schedule of an experience. Participant trajectories reflect a participant’s actual journey through story <b>time</b> and <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> as they interact with the experience. Historic trajectories represent the subsequent selection and reuse of segments of recorded participant trajectories to create histories of past events. We show how temporal trajectories help us analyse the nature of time in existing experiences and can also generate new approaches to dealing with temporal issues such as: disengagement and reengagement, adapting to different paces of interaction, synchronising different participants, and enabling encounters and travel across time...|$|R
