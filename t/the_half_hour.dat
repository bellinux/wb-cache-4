5|$|One 30-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Thursday before the two races. Bird, who called the Circuit de Monaco his favourite track in the GP2 Series, was the fastest driver {{with a time of}} one minute and 21.512 seconds on super-soft tyres, 0.057 seconds faster than teammate Tom Dillmann in second. Evans was third-fastest, ahead of Jolyon Palmer. Marcus Ericsson and Johnny Cecotto Jr. were fifth and sixth. Leimer was seventh-fastest, Nasr eighth, Rio Haryanto ninth and Calado completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Only minor off-track excursions were reported with Stéphane Richelmi spinning at La Rascasse corner and stalled in his attempt to continue driving. Nasr narrowly avoided impacting the barriers at the Swimming Pool complex and Coletti, Leimer, Calado and Kevin Giovesi all ran deep into the track's run-off areas at various points in <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> session.|$|E
5|$|This left Australia {{a target}} of 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have been}} the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. Only 44 runs came in the first hour. Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes and they began to attack; Morris hit three consecutive fours off Len Hutton's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121/1. In <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both had given chances, but England fumbled them.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the night}} to the morning of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides {{arranged}} the speech. The RNC worked to raise the $75,000 needed to buy <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I Love Lucy show, but when the candidate indicated {{he could not be}} ready that soon, settled for 6:30pm Tuesday night, 9:30pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what he might say.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton bowled a googly to deceive Bradman, who {{expected}} {{the ball to}} turn in. However, it went the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg glanced the next ball for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball of the over. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed {{to hold on to}} the catch. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. Compton had control of Bradman for the over, but went unrewarded. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 121/1, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both Morris and Bradman had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
5|$|This left Australia {{a target}} of 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have been}} the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. When Laker was introduced to exploit the spin, 13 runs were taken from his first over, but only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. Bradman signalled his intentions on his first ball by driving Laker against the spin for a boundary. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours off Len Hutton's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121/1. In <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Australia had given chances, but England failed to seize them. Evans failed to stump Morris when he was on 32, and Crapp dropped Bradman from Compton.|$|E

25|$|Friday evening's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. The drivers' fastest lap times {{determined the}} starting {{order for the}} first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. In contrast to previous years, qualifying was held in night time conditions, the first such occurrence in the GP2 Series. The track was less dusty {{than it had been}} in practice, and multiple drivers stood in pole position throughout the duration of <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> session. Palmer clinched his first pole position of the season and the second of his GP2 Series career with a time of one minute and 38.865 seconds. He flat spotted his first set of tyres and was aware with the second set equipped he would challenge for the pole position. Palmer was joined on the grid's front row by Vandoorne who recorded a lap three-hundredths of second slower than his rival. Vandoorne was temporarily investigated by the stewards for exceeding track limits at turn thirteen, but no action was prompted. Abt took third having been unable to improve on his lap time. Richelmi improved towards the end of the session and secured fourth. Haryanto took fifth ahead of sixth-placed Stefano Coletti. Early pace setter Evans fell once the field bettered their times and managed seventh.|$|E

25|$|The {{first leg}} of United's quarter-final against Roma was played at the Stadio Olimpico on 1 April 2008. Ryan Giggs started the match on the bench, which meant that Rio Ferdinand was handed the {{captaincy}} and Park Ji-sung was given his first Champions League appearance of the season, while Michael Carrick {{was able to take}} his position in the midfield three despite having missed the team's training session the day before. The match started fairly evenly, but it was Roma who had the first meaningful attempt on goal, with Christian Panucci heading just over from a corner. On <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> United's defence suffered a major setback as Nemanja Vidić fell awkwardly after jumping for a header. His place in central defence was taken by John O'Shea. Nevertheless, with just five minutes of the half remaining, the ball broke to Paul Scholes on the right hand side of the Roma penalty area. With his options limited, he played a ball at head-height into the centre of the penalty area, where Cristiano Ronaldo, who had just run full speed from near the centre circle, was ready to power a header past Roma keeper Doni. Buoyed by the cushion of the away goal, United started the second half confidently, prising a desperate Roma side apart with crisp passing along the floor. On the hour mark, in response to a header on goal by Mirko Vučinić that brought about a world class save from Edwin van der Sar, Alex Ferguson called for his team to adopt a more conservative formation, bringing on Owen Hargreaves to replace Anderson. United seemed more comfortable playing in a 4–4–2 formation, and the change paid immediate dividends, as Rooney pounced on Doni's mishandling of Park's header to poke the ball home for 2–0. The Reds continued to threaten, but were forced to defend well to prevent Roma from taking any goals with them to Old Trafford. The match finished 2–0, putting United in a comfortable position going into the second leg on 9 April.|$|E
25|$|A week later, Stevenage {{travelled}} to Essex to play Grays Athletic. The game ended 21 to Stevenage, {{despite the}} home side leading at the interval through a Jamie Guy strike. Stevenage {{turned it around}} in the second half, with goals from Michael Bostwick and Charlie Griffin. Stevenage followed this up with another away win four days later at Crawley Town; winning the match 30. Stevenage started brightly and scored within the first five minutes; Yemi Odubade latching onto David Bridges through ball to slot home. The visitors doubled their lead on <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> mark, this time Tim Sills was the provider, as Odubade scored his second. Joel Byrom scored Stevenage's third in the second half, picking up the ball a yard inside the Crawley half and chipped Simon Rayner in goal. Stevenage then followed this up with an eighth consecutive victory, beating Oxford United 10 at Broadhall Way. The only goal of the game came seven minutes into the second half, David Bridges was fouled in the area by Chris Hargreaves; Scott Laird stepped up and subsequently scored to ensure the home side earned three points. Four days later, Stevenage lost 10 to Luton Town thanks to a Matthew Barnes-Homer goal in the second half. Stevenage bounced back just two days later on Easter Monday, with a 30 victory over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow. The away side {{took the lead in}} the ninth minute; Mark Roberts bundling home a Joel Byrom corner after Tim Sills had knocked the ball down. Just two minutes later, Stevenage doubled their lead, again Byrom was the provider, and his lofted ball was met on the half-volley by Lawrie Wilson, who lashed the ball home - making his first start since breaking his leg in August. Stevenage rounded off the victory in injury-time, substitute Eddie Odhiambo slotting the ball home from Charlie Griffin's cross. Stevenage then faced Forest Green Rovers at Broadhall Way five days later; the game ended 20 to Stevenage. The home side took the lead in the tenth minute; Tim Sills broke the offside trap and set up Joel Byrom to lash the ball home. Stevenage doubled their lead in the second half when substitute David Bridges was brought down in the area. Scott Laird calmly stepped up and stroked the ball into the net. A third win followed four days later, when Stevenage beat Altrincham 10 in a tight encounter at Moss Lane. Substitute Charlie Griffin scored the only goal of the game in the 83rd minute; Altrincham goalkeeper Russell Saunders fumbled the ball into the path of Griffin who placed his shot in-between the goalkeeper and the post to ensure a valuable three points to the visitors.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> series premiere debuted on December 17, 1989 with [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" [...] a Christmas special.

Matt Groening developed the lengthy sequence in order {{to cut down on the}} animation necessary for each episode, but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. As the finished episodes became longer, the production team were reluctant to cut the stories in order to allow for the long title sequence, so shorter versions of it were developed.|$|E
