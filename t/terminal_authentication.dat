40|$|This {{dissertation}} work focusses {{on using}} {{information about the}} location of the user during the authentication process on computer networks. With the growth of mobile computer devices {{over the last two decades}} the physical location of users is becoming one of the main issues for access management. This work researches existing solutions which are divided in to two groups related to the source of location information (SATNAV systems for example GPS and based on communication with active infrastructure such as GSM, Wi-Fi). This work shows the methodology for evaluating authentication data which use the principle of fuzzy logic. In comparison with binary logic it is possible to evaluate authentication data accurately. As a result of the authentication process the information is of a higher value, which can be taken into account when setting the levels of user privileges. An important aspect of working with location information is that the user is located in the same place and from where they are asking for access to the system. Solving this question could be linking user biometrics for example finger prints. This principle is used in two types of microelectronic <b>authentication</b> <b>terminals</b> which were developed in conjunction with this work. The first type of terminal uses a SATNAV receiver and an ISM wireless communication module as a source of location information. On the first type of <b>authentication</b> <b>terminal</b> newly developed <b>authentication</b> techniques were tested. The users biometrics are checked by finger print sensor with embedded processing. In the second type <b>authentication</b> <b>terminal</b> a Wi-Fi and GSM module were added for location purposes. In the conclusion of this dissertation the testing methodology of the data authorization and evaluation process of the second type of microelectronic <b>authentication</b> <b>terminal</b> is shown. This confirms the practicality of the suggested methodology and the time-space information in the authentication process...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY We {{propose a}} new construct, the Text-Graphics Character (TGC) CAPTCHA, for {{preventing}} dictionary attacks against password authentication systems allowing remote access via dumb <b>terminals.</b> Password <b>authentication</b> {{is commonly used}} for computer access control. But password authentication systems are prone to dictionary attacks, in which attackers repeatedly attempt to gain access using the entries in a list of frequentlyused passwords. CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are currently being used to prevent automated “bots ” from registering for email accounts. They have also been suggested {{as a means for}} preventing dictionary attacks. However, current CAPTCHAs are unsuitable for text-based remote access. TGC CAPTCHAs fill this gap. In this paper, we define two TGC CAPTCHAs and incorporate one of them in a prototype based on the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol suite. We also prove that, if a TGC CAPTCHA is easy for humans and hard for machines, then the resulting CAPTCHA is secure. We provide empirical evidence that our TGC CAPTCHAs are indeed easy for humans and hard for machines through a series of experiments. We believe that a system exploiting a TGC CAPTCHA will not only help improve the security of servers allowing remote terminal access, but also encourage a healthy spirit of competition in the fields of pattern recognition, computer graphics, and psychology. ...|$|R
50|$|A12 Authentication (Access Authentication for 1xEV-DO) is a CHAP-based {{mechanism}} {{used by a}} CDMA2000 Access Network (AN) {{to authenticate}} a 1xEV-DO Access <b>Terminal</b> (AT). A12 <b>authentication</b> occurs when an AT first attempts to access the AN and is repeated after some authentication timeout period. The element in the AN that performs this authentication is the Radio Network Controller (RNC) using its Access Network AAA (AN-AAA). In order to support A12 authentication, matching A12 credentials (i.e., an A12 Network Address Identifier (NAI) and A12 CHAP key) must be provisioned into the AT and the user’s home AAA server. Since these credentials are only shared between the AT and its home AAA, the AN-AAA forwards A12 challenge responses received from an AT to its home AAA {{to determine whether they}} are correct. A12 authentication is separate from packet data authentication that may occur later when a data session is being established.|$|R

Our solution relies on augmenting <b>terminal</b> <b>authentication</b> with a t-out-of-ℓ threshold signature provided by neighboring terminals. These terminals will be in charge of checking the revocation status of the requested terminal. As Terminals have a real clock embedded and more computational power than Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs), they are better suited for checking revocation status. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Vulnerability {{evaluation}} of various biometric systems {{should be conducted}} and its results {{should be available to}} potential users. Summary Biometrics is utilized in individual authentication techniques which identify individuals by checking physiological or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, faces, voice, iris patterns, signatures, etc. Biometric systems are said to be convenient because they need neither something to memorize such as passwords nor something to carry about such as ID tokens [1]. In spite of that, a user of biometric systems would get into a dangerous situation when her/his biometric data are abused. For example, you cannot change your fingerprints while you can change your passwords or ID tokens when they are compromised. Therefore, biometric systems must protect the information for biometrics against abuse, and they must also prevent fake biometrics. We focus on fingerprint systems since they have become widespread as <b>authentication</b> <b>terminals</b> for PCs or mobile terminals. A fingerprint system ha...|$|R
40|$|Secure {{payment is}} the basis of {{electronic}} commerce (e-commerce). A large amount of electronic payments are made via POS (point of sale) terminals using smart cards and legitimate users are usually authenticated by PIN. The security design of POS <b>terminals</b> and <b>authentication</b> methods are increasingly becoming concerns of e- business. The major aims and objectives of this industrially oriented research are to investigate a new solution at system level to improve the security of current POS payment systems. The contributions of this thesis include several aspects: 1) An in- depth literature survey has been undertaken. The security threats of current POS terminals and available countermeasures have been systematically investigated. The main existing problems have been identified. 2) An innovative scheme, the so-called Supercard, which integrates PIN pad, biometrics and the smartcard, has been proposed. Approaches based on this scheme can meet security challenges posed by attacks such as visual and channel PIN attacks, display attacks, and fake-machine attacks. The scheme also has advantages to prevent the cryptographic key being disclosed by channel or side channel attacks. 3) The Supercard scheme has been examined specifically to improve fingerprint biometrics security. The Capture & Match on Card scheme and corresponding authentication protocol has been designed with the advantage of preventing biometric channel attacks. Biohash is adopted to protect the biometric template. 4) Keystroke dynamics, as a behaviour biometric to strengthen PIN authentication, has been investigated under the specific conditions of a highly limited number of keystrokes. 5) The multimodal signals of PIN, fingerprint and keystroke dynamics have been studied through fuzzy-logic-based information fusion.

40|$|The {{electronic}} passport (ePassport) {{is composed of}} a classical passport booklet and a passive contactless smartcard, where the chip and antenna are integrated in a page or cover. The technical specifications of ePassports are standardized by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation - {{a part of the}} UN) in the Standard number 9303 (currently in its 6 th edition). This document refers to many ISO standards. The communication with the ePassport is based on ISO 14443 (on the low communication level) and 7816 (on the higher communication level). The data stored in the ePassport are organised in 16 data groups (DG 1 -DG 16) and 2 - 3 metafiles (EF. COM, EF. SOD, EF. CVCA).

40|$|Long Term Evolution (LTE) {{is a major}} {{technology}} {{to be used in}} the 4 th generation (4 G) mobile network and the core network is evolving towards a converged packet based framework for all services. As a part of the evolved core network, Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) provides multimedia services (data, voice, video and variations) over packet switched networks. LTE and IMS are both defined by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) group, and the specification identifies that a LTE user device has to carry out two authentication steps to access IP multimedia services. The first authentication step is used to gain LTE network admission and the second authentication step is the IMS authentication used to gain access to the multimedia services. It is observed that the 4 G standardized authentication protocols include double execution of the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) which increases the system’s complexity, results in significant authentication delay and high terminal energy consumption. Authentication is very important for a terminal to gain access to a network and therefore considerable previous research into this topic has occurred. However a common limitation of previously proposed authentication systems is either a lack of security or significant system modification. This research proposes the Improved AKA (IAKA) authentication protocol which binds the two layer’s authentication procedures by using the unified IP Multimedia Private-user Identity (IMPI). The proposed IAKA only executes the AKA protocol once in the network layer and generates authentication credentials which would be used in the second IMS service layer authentication. This research work included providing IAKA authentication protocol, developing a LTE IMS integrated network by using OPNET Modeller, simulation of the IAKA and the legacy 3 GPP defined 4 G LTE AKA authentication protocol under different environments, and in-depth analysis of the system performance, security and terminal’s energy consumption. It is shown that the proposed IAKA carries out <b>terminal</b> <b>authentication</b> correctly, improves security, reduces IMS layer authentication delay by up to 38 %, and provides an 81. 82 % terminal energy consumption saving...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{upgrading}} passports to an electronic version {{is making it}} hard for criminals or anybody to counterfeit or illegally duplicate them. A practical way of doing so is {{through the use of}} digital signatures because it is computationally hard to counterfeit them. So all the contents of e-passports are now digitally signed by the Document Signer of the issuing country. The e-passport has thus achieved its central objective however it suffers from several security and privacy issues. Many of these issues are due to the technology being used in it. For example, use of RFID provides platform for skimming, tracking and hotlisting etc. Similarly, possibility of eavesdropping in the communication is always there. The current protocols used by the e-passports have also not been designed with adequate security. The standard put forward by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the body responsible for standardizing protocols related to e-passports, suffers from several security issues. Many of these issues threaten the privacy of the e-passport owner. An improved version of it, as proposed by European Union (EU) is known as Enhanced Access Control (EAC). But it also suffers from some inaccuracies. So it very important to analyze these issues and put forward a better solution. This thesis analyzes the security and privacy issues in these protocols. It highlights several weaknesses in the ICAO s protocol and EAC. It then proposes a more secure and better protocol, named Secure Electronic Passport Access Protocol (SEPAP). SEPAP makes the <b>terminal</b> <b>authentication</b> more accurate and the design of the protocol itself mandates terminal to be authenticated before the e-passport chip. So, it is more dependable then EAC or other e-passport protocols. In addition to informal analyses, the thesis also performs formal verification of this proposed protocol. Formal verification has been done with ProVerif and Scyther. It is equally important to see if the primitives necessary for the protocol can be practically implemented. So the thesis also provides a sample implementation of the protocol. Finally, the thesis attempts to see if e-passports can be used in other areas as well, besides border control. As a case study, the thesis performs this analysis on electronic voting and puts forward some recommendations on how e-passports, following different e-passport protocols, may be used with different e-voting schemes. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{introduction}} towards the architectural design of a bi-fold authenticated agent-monitored transaction model. The focus is primarily on implementation in ATM systems which provide the following facilities of withdrawing currency at any remote terminal, verification of the end users identity using Personal Identification Number and an authentic One-Time-Session-Dependent Key generation and validation through the mobile. This system requires building up of an third party agent which would establish a secure session to the bank application with the terminal only after a series of authentication mechanism without compromising the privacy of any individual. The customers, without any insider privileges, can withdraw currency without being detected by any mechanisms of theft of card and eaves dropping of the Password from the card holders within the terminal software are also a major threat yet to be addressed. A basic solution is the <b>terminals</b> having bi-fold <b>authentication</b> mechanisms where mobile dependent one time session dependent key is being generated with authenticity being ensured and the confidentiality being maintained. In such a system, the correctness burden on the terminal’s code is significantly less as the customers have been given the chance to authorize themselves from their hand-held devices and are allowed to withdraw currency in terminal only after their identity is proved by a series of authentication procedures.

One critical component present at virtually all login terminals used {{today is the}} traditional text password or numerical PIN. Compromising this authentication component is a critical, yet increasingly feasible, step for criminals looking {{to gain access to}} sensitive information. To increase usability and security, graphical password schemes have been proposed that rely on users' innate ability to recognize pictures for authentication. Sparked by the general ubiquity of cell phones with video recording technology, our research aims to identify the susceptibility of the Passfaces graphical password system to camera based shoulder surfing attacks while introducing a novel defense to combat recording devices. First, we survey several graphical password schemes {{in the context of the}} shoulder surfing attack vector. We then propose a method of subverting video recording capabilities by using high frequency contrast inversion. By preventing cameras from successfully correcting elementary settings in response to contrast inversion, little useful information is extracted from the system. We mate the contrast inversion defense to an already proven user input method, a 'cognitive trapdoor game', and place these mechanisms within a graphical password system. A technological study evaluates the effectiveness of these mechanisms against a variety of recording devices, while a user study evaluates how these mechanisms impact the usability benefits of a graphical password system. We believe our system increases the resource investment for a camera based shoulder surfing attack, yet can be used in most <b>authentication</b> <b>terminals</b> without extensive modification...|$|R
