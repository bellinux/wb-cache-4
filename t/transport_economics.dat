25|$|In a study {{published}} in June 2016, conducted by the Norwegian Institute of <b>Transport</b> <b>Economics,</b> the researchers found that plug-in hybrid owners in Norway drive on average 55% of their annual distance in charge-depleting or all-electric mode (EV mode), and the share goes up to about 63% for work trips. The share of electric travel is higher for trips to work and in the summer, and lower in the winter. The average plug-in hybrid user in the survey drives 60% of the total distance in EV mode in the summer and 53% in winter. The estimate for work trips is higher at 70% in the summer and 59% in winter.|$|E

The latter would involve a shuttle bus from a quay at Hurum and could only serve a limited number of destinations. A more serious contender was basing all public transport on coaches. A 1986 report from the Institute of <b>Transport</b> <b>Economics</b> proposed coach services {{on both sides of the}} Oslofjord, and estimated that travel time by coach from downtown Oslo would take 69 minutes, compared to 68 minutes to Gardermoen. In average trains would transport people 30 minutes faster to Hurum than buses would.|$|E
25|$|A {{new report}} was issued in 2006 and in May 2007 Akershus County Council {{voted in favor}} of {{building}} a tramway. A contributing factor was that a large array of expert bodies, including Oslo Sporveier, the Public Roads Administration, the Institute of <b>Transport</b> <b>Economics</b> and a series of consulting companies all recommended that a people mover was not suitable. The main downsides of a people mover gradually became evident for the county politicians. These included the inability to provide a direct service to Oslo and the system costs of have a fourth rail system, in addition to a metro, tramway and mainline railway. A particular concern was that very few people chose to use public transport if there are two or more transfers, which would be reality for many with a people mover.|$|E

The report concluded that the latter could allow for three daily direct flights to Oslo, and estimated the 2013 traffic, if airport had been built, at 190,000, of which 99,000 would have been generated by the petroleum industry. A major uncertainty in the model is the unknown activity of the petroleum industry in the future.|$|E
500|$|The <b>transport</b> <b>economics</b> {{rationale}} for implementing congestion pricing on roads, described as [...] "one policy {{response to the}} problem of congestion", was summarized in testimony to the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee in 2003: [...] "congestion is considered to arise from the mispricing of a good; namely, highway capacity at a specific place and time. The quantity supplied (measured in lane-miles) is less than the quantity demanded at what is essentially a price of zero. If a good or service is provided free of charge, people tend to demand more of it—and use it more wastefully—than they would if they had to pay a price that reflected its cost. Hence, congestion pricing is premised on a basic economic concept: charge a price in order to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evidenced by users' willingness to pay for the resource".|$|E
500|$|Following the right-winged Second cabinet Bondevik {{victory in}} the 2001 {{parliamentary}} election, Minister of Transport, Torild Skogsholm from the Liberal Party announced {{that the government would}} make all subsidized passenger trains services in the country subject to public service obligation (PSO). This had previously been done in several other European countries, such as Sweden and Germany. The initial plans launched in 2002 called for three routes to be subject to PSO: the Gjøvik Line, the Bratsberg Line and the Bergen Commuter Rail. These are the commuter train services least passengers, and the purpose was to use the initial tenders as a [...] "learning exercise" [...] and to create a more efficient system to implement in future tenders. The plans also called for transferring the responsibility for managing and financing the PSO contracts on commuter rail services to the counties, but this was not followed, in part because of a report from the Institute of <b>Transport</b> <b>Economics,</b> which concluded that this would provide a worse service.|$|E

500|$|The {{real-world}} demand {{functions for}} urban road travel {{are more complex}} than the theoretical functions used in <b>transport</b> <b>economics</b> analysis. Congestion pricing was developed as a first-best solution, {{based on the assumption that}} the optimal price of road space equals the marginal cost price if all other goods in the economy are also marginal cost priced. In the real world this is not true, thus, actual implementation of congestion pricing is just a proxy or second-best solution. Based on the economic principles behind congestion pricing, the optimal congestion charge should make up for the difference between the average cost paid by the driver and the marginal cost imposed on other drivers (such as extra delay) and on society as a whole (such as air pollution). [...] The practical challenge of setting optimal link-based tolls is daunting given that neither the demand functions nor the link-specific speed-flow curves can be known precisely. Therefore, transport economists recognize that in practice setting the right price for the congestion charge becomes a trial and error experience.|$|E
2500|$|The 1981 {{proposal}} by the Institute of <b>Transport</b> <b>Economics</b> {{called for a}} mainline railway service to Fornebu as a single-track branch from the Drammen Line to the airport terminal. The intersection was proposed located [...] east of Lysaker Station, hinder trains from stopping at Lysaker. This was caused both by the geological conditions and road plans. The line would branch off and run under the Drammen Line and E18 in a tunnel. It would ascend between Snarøyveien and the fjord and continue to a station situated at the water aerodrome. The station would feature two tracks and would include an elevated walkway over to the terminal. Depending on the options for expanding Fornebu, the then main terminal was proposed rebuilt to an international terminal and a new domestic terminal was proposed built. This would have required the railway line to be extended and a second station be built. The line was estimated to cost 100 million kroner.|$|E
2500|$|The proposal's {{reception}} {{in the federal}} transport portfolio was in marked contrast. A meeting with the department secretary and senior officers of his department and the Bureau of <b>Transport</b> <b>Economics</b> was to foreshadow an uneasy relationship that was to continue despite the ostensibly cooperative attitude {{of federal and state}} governments. [...] The proposal had been sent to the federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris, with comments reflecting his officials' opinion: it was not worth considering. Although Sydney–Melbourne was later identified as the fourth-busiest air route in the world (busier than any in North America, or any in Europe apart from Madrid to Barcelona) and the bureau had no firm data on transport markets in south-eastern Australia, its officials judged passenger fares would need to be set at a rate that would not be commercially viable. The bureau would not accept the French experience that the laws of physics (in which momentum is proportional to the square of the velocity) allowed much steeper gradients (hence much fewer cut-and-fill earthworks) than on low-speed railways. The difference in the estimation of earthworks was $2 billion – a significant proportion of the total cost of the project.|$|E

2500|$|According to an {{economic}} analysis {{conducted at the}} Center for <b>Transport</b> <b>Economics</b> (CTEK), the tunnel will produce a result ranging from slightly negative to slightly positive; most likely, it will bear its own costs. According to the Swedish Transport Administration's own forecasts, the project will not be profitable. It {{should be noted that}} these calculations were carried out in 2001, and since the early 2000s there has been a sharp increase in local and regional train journeys, making calculations from 2001 highly unreliable. In April 2008 the Swedish Transport Administration revised its forecasts, stating that [...] "...the economic viability of many railway projects in the real world will exceed the previously estimated [...]" [...] The report was commissioned as part of the basis for infrastructure investment in the transport sector from 2010 to 2021. According to a political principle established in Sweden during recent years, construction projects in areas where construction is overly expensive {{does not need to be}} fully economically viable. In such cases, a lower cost estimate can be used in the calculation, since it is not politically desirable for certain metropolitan areas to be neglected merely because of the high cost associated with construction in these areas. Without such a principle, it would not have been possible to build the City Tunnel, Södra länken, Götatunneln and other upcoming city projects.|$|E
