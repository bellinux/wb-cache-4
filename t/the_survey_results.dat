2500|$|The {{high levels}} of binge {{drinking}} among young people and the adverse consequences that include increased risk of alcoholism as an adult and liver disease make binge drinking a major public health issue. Recent {{research has found that}} young college binge drinkers who drink 4/5+ drinks on more than 3 occasions in the past 2 weeks are statistically 19 times more likely to develop alcoholism than non-binge drinkers, though the direction of causality remains unclear. This is particularly interesting as drinking {{for the sole purpose of}} getting drunk, remains a major health and social problem on college campuses across the United States. Heavy and regular binge drinking during adolescence is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism. Approximately 40 percent of alcoholics report heavy drinking during adolescence. Repeated episodes of excessive drinking, especially at an early age, are thought to cause a profound increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-related disorder (ICD-10, harmful use/dependence syndrome). [...] In a study conducted by Harvard University it was found that about 32% of students surveyed were diagnosable for alcohol abuse and about 6% were diagnosed as alcohol dependent. Binge drinking is also becoming an increasing problem in Australian adolescence, the Australian School Students Alcohol and Drug survey conducted by the Nation Cancer Council discovered that around 33 percent of students between Years 7 and 11 consumed alcohol in the week leading up to the survey, they also found that 10 percent of the students participated in binge drinking at a consumption level which is considered dangerous to adults. When <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>results</b> were separated into age groups the findings were that 13 percent of 15-year-old's and 22 percent of 17-year-old's had alcohol consumption levels above the daily maximum suggested to adults and that 20 percent of 17-year-old's had a consumption level of alcohol considered risky to adults.|$|E
2500|$|In their {{aptly named}} book, What We Knew: Terror, Mass Murder, and Everyday Life in Nazi Germany, historians Eric Johnson and Karl-Heinz Reuband {{conducted}} an extensive set of interviews (over 3,000 Germans and 500 German Jews) for an unprecedented firsthand look at {{daily life in}} the Third Reich and analyzed it accordingly. They carefully selected interviews out of the samples, which they believed best represented their overall findings. From the Jewish questionnaires, the authors found that German society {{was not nearly as}} rife with anti-Semitism as one might otherwise have believed, but this changed dramatically with Hitler's ascension to power. German Jews claimed that they knew of the Holocaust {{from a wide range of}} sources, which included radio broadcasts from Italy and what they heard from friends or acquaintances, but they did not know these details until 1943. Responses from non-Jewish Germans indicate that [...] "the majority of Germans identified with the Nazi regime." [...] Contrary to many other accounts and/or historical interpretations, which portray rule under the Nazis as terrifying for German citizens, most of the German respondents who participated in the interviews stated that they never really feared arrest from the Gestapo. Concerning the mass murder of the Jews, <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>results</b> were contingent to some degree on geography, but roughly 27–29% of Germans had information about the Holocaust at some point before the war's end, and another 10–13% suspected something terrible was happening all along. Based on this information, Johnson and Reuband surmise that one-in-three Germans either heard or knew that the Holocaust was taking place before the end of the war from sources which included family members, friends, neighbors or professional colleagues. Johnson suggests (in disagreement with his co-author) that it is more likely that about 50% of the German population were aware of the atrocities being committed against the Jewish people and other enemies identified by the Nazi regime.|$|E
