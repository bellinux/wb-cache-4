Of major interest are the linear triatomic molecules OCS and NzO, which together cover a sizeable portion of the 0 to 3000 cm-l region. Some heterodyne frequency measurements can be made by locking a tunable diode laser (TDL) to an absorption feature of OCS, foy example, and comparing the TDL frequency directly against a C 02 laser frequency standard.

Software defined radio (SDR) techniques replace many of these analog components with digital signal processing (DSP) on rapidly sampled signals. We demonstrate that, generically, commercially available multi-channel SDRs are capable of time and frequency metrology, outperforming purpose-built devices {{by as much as}} an order-of-magnitude. For example, for signals at 10 MHz and 6 GHz, we observe SDR time deviation noise floors of about 20 fs and 1 fs, respectively, in under 10 ms of averaging. Examining the other complex signal component, we find a relative amplitude measurement instability of 3 e- 7 at 5 MHz. We discuss the scalability of a SDR-based system for simultaneous measurement of many clocks. SDR's frequency agility allows for comparison of oscillators at widely different frequencies. We demonstrate a novel and extreme example with optical clock frequencies differing by many terahertz: using a femtosecond-laser frequency comb and SDR, we show femtosecond-level time comparisons of ultra-stable lasers with zero measurement dead-time.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{detailed}} theoretical analysis is presented of the temperature dependent radiative decay in aggregates of pseudoisocyanine (PIC). Our approach extends the original linear exciton-phonon coupling model including static disorder and second order exciton-phonon interactions. It is shown {{that for a}} one-dimensional exciton model neither of these additional effects alone or in combination with linear electron–phonon coupling can explain the steep rise in radiative lifetime at 40 K observed in the J-aggregate of PIC. However, when the aggregate assembles into a two-dimensional bricklike structure its radiative dynamics can be simulated, with linear exciton-optical phonon coupling as the only source for exciton scattering. Exciton-phonon scattering <b>transfers</b> <b>oscillator</b> strength from the k= 0 state to other band states and also generates a nonequilibrium population among the exciton states, which persists during the superradiant decay. These effects together explain the marked temperature dependence of the radiative lifetime of the PIC J aggregate. When disorder limits the coherence length at low temperatures to a few molecules, as seems the case in several light harvesting complexes, the exciton population can equilibrate on the time scale of the superradiance. This situation pertains to the strong collision limit of the master equation, where the radiative decay is insensitive to details of the electron–phonon coupling, but only senses change in the thermal population among the exciton states. ...|$|R

In particular, the steady-state precession can occur at zero applied magnetic field when the ratio between the field-like torque and the spin transfer torque takes up a negative value. In addition, the dependence of the oscillation properties on the junction sizes has also been analyzed.

We establish that the vortex dipole is set in steady state rotational motion due to {{the interaction between the}} vortices, while an external in-plane magnetic field can tune the frequency of rotation. The rotational motion is linked to the nonzero skyrmion number of the dipole. The spin-torque acts to stabilize the vortex dipole at a definite vortex-antivortex separation distance. In contrast to a free vortex dipole, the rotating pair under spin-polarized current is an attractor of the motion, therefore a stable state. Three types of vortex-antivortex pairs are obtained as we vary the external field and spin-torque strength. We give a guide for the frequency of rotation based on analytical relations.

This thesis presents the characterisation of a variety of magnetic thin film structures performed with a range of phase sensitive techniques. It is possible to obtain new insight by utilising the chemical and site specificity of X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) to isolate the precession in different chemical species or at distinct sites in the crystal structure of a chosen material. X-ray Ferromagnetic Resonance (XFMR) combines XMCD and Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) phenomena in a technique capable of measuring the FMR response of an alloy or multilayer with both chemical and site specificity. To complement the XFMR technique a low temperature Time-Resolved Magneto Optical Kerr Effect (TR-MOKE) setup has been developed. This allowed for the characterisation of samples at temperatures in the range 4 K to room temperature. A frequency swept Vector Network Analyser FMR (VNA-FMR) setup was developed to allow for a fast method for determining the resonance condition and damping of a range of ferromagnetic thin film samples. In addition a TR-X-ray Photoemission Electron Microscopy (TR-XPEEM) setup has been established which allows images to be obtained with magnetic contrast.

Specifically, we determine the v+ = (0, 1, 0) /v+ = (0, 0, 0) intensity ratio by detecting dispersed fluorescence from the electronically excited photoions. The results exhibit large deviations over a very wide energy range, 18 <hnuexc< 190 eV. Production of the v+ = (0, 1, 0) level of the ion from the v 0 = (0, 0, 0) ground state is forbidden by symmetry, and while observations of such features are well established in photoelectron spectroscopy, their appearance is normally ascribed to vibronic coupling in the ionic hole state. In this case, we find that such explanations fail {{to account for the}} energy dependence of the branching ratio. These deviations indicate that the continuum photoelectron participates in <b>transferring</b> <b>oscillator</b> strength to the nominally forbidden vibrational transition. A theoretical framework is developed for interpreting the experimental data, and Schwinger variational calculations are performed. These calculations demonstrate that the continuum electron is responsible for the observation of the excited bending mode as well as its energy dependence. This is an intrachannel effect that is best described as photoelectron-induced vibronic symmetry breaking. This appears to be a general phenomenon, and it may be useful in illuminating connections between bond angle and photoionization spectroscopies.
