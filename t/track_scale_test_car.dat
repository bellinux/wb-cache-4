50|$|A <b>scale</b> <b>test</b> <b>car</b> {{is a type}} of {{railroad}} car in maintenance of way service. Its purpose is to calibrate the weighing scales used to weigh loaded railroad <b>cars.</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>test</b> <b>cars</b> are of a precisely known weight so that the <b>track</b> <b>scale</b> can be calibrated against them.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>scale</b> <b>test</b> <b>cars</b> were small, old {{railroad}} cars carrying {{heavy metal}} weights as their superstructure. <b>Scale</b> <b>test</b> <b>cars</b> needed special handling {{so they would}} not suffer damage, which might alter their weight. They were reweighed periodically on accurate scales at the railroad's shops.|$|R

40|$|Vibration-induced {{noise in}} the car of train is of great {{interest}} since low weight is important, but makes the structure more resonant. One excitation source is the sleeper frequency which {{gives rise to a}} periodic excitation. This paper describes an approach to isolate the vibrations caused by the sleepers {{in such a way that}} the noise inside the cabin is reduced. An LMS algorithm with four inertial mass actuators fitted to the bogie with control microphones placed in the cabin. The tests were performed on an experimental light weight bogie fitted to a <b>test</b> <b>car,</b> in both lab environment and in full <b>scale</b> <b>tests</b> on <b>track</b> at full speed (200 km/h) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{preliminary}} {{version of}} the 1798 cc engine was first seen in the Concept-cX <b>test</b> <b>car</b> introduced in 2007. The larger 2268 cc was first exhibited in the Concept-ZT <b>test</b> <b>car</b> introduced {{in the same year}} and later used in the Concept-RA <b>test</b> <b>car</b> introduced in 2008.|$|R
30|$|The {{rear wheels}} of the <b>test</b> <b>car</b> were fixed and {{electronic}} stability control (ESC) was turned off. Hence, the <b>test</b> <b>car</b> could be driven in a front-wheel drive mode. An experienced driver and a front passenger, whose weights were approximately 100  kg, were asked to ride the <b>test</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
