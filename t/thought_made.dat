5|$|In late November 2011, {{the site}} of a former BJ's Wholesale Club in Norcross, Georgia was {{converted}} in appearance to a Costco for shooting. On January 23, 2012, Hill announced that filming had concluded. Multiple scene takes were made, allowing the cast to follow the script as written and inject their own improvisations. Special effects company Legacy Effects provided creature designs and effects for the aliens. The alien costume featured an animatronic head, remotely controlled by three people. The suit was hot even in cold areas, and had to be unzipped to let Doug Jones cool off between takes. The costume was enhanced with CGI in a number of ways, including replacing arms and dilating pupils (which Schaffer <b>thought</b> <b>made</b> the creature seem more alive).|$|E
5|$|The Viz Media {{releases}} {{preserve the}} Japanese reading order and overlay the visual sound effects with equivalent English text. The English lettering {{was criticized for}} being overly large, which Anime News Network <b>thought</b> <b>made</b> the characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments. There are several additional differences between the Japanese and English volume releases of Zombiepowder.. The cover of the second manga volume, which featured an illustration of C.T. Smith holding {{a gun to his}} own head, was replaced in the English edition with new art of Gamma in sunglasses. The English editions of volumes 2-4 also each contain a one-shot story from early in Kubo's career, which were not present in the Japanese collections: Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine, Rune Master Urara, and Bad Shield United, respectively. These extra stories were included for two apparent reasons: to further appeal to Zombiepowder.s primary English-speaking audience of Bleach fans interested in the development of Tite Kubo's style, and to expand the length of the later volumes, which would otherwise have been shorter than Viz's normal releases, to standard pagecounts.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{viewpoint}} is {{that the}} Chancellor morphs into a tiger (Thái sư hóa hổ) story in Ngô Sĩ Liên's work might be derived from the book Việt điện u linh (Compilation of the potent spirits in the Realm of Việt) of Lý Tế Xuyên; this hypothesis can explain {{the existence of such}} mythic elements in an official historical record for a dynasty like Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư. Moreover, the story in Việt điện u linh was gathered from the folk story with the main purpose of praising Mục Thận, who was the tutelary deity of Trích Sài village; therefore its accuracy needs to be placed in doubt. During the dynastic time in Vietnam, normally anyone who was tried for treason was killed or forced to commit suicide; therefore the light verdict of Lý Nhân Tông in the case of Lê Văn Thịnh rose a current of beliefs that the chancellor was unjustly judged or wrongly blamed with the crime of treason. The historian Phan Huy Lê, a renowned researcher of History of Vietnam also expressed his doubt about the real motive of the Lê Văn Thịnh's trial, reckoning that the traditional idea of accusing Lê Văn Thịnh was not really appropriate since the story that Lê Văn Thịnh changed into a tiger to kill the emperor could not happen. A more striking hypothesis proposed that the case of Lê Văn Thịnh {{was the result of the}} struggle between supporters of Buddhism led by the Imperial Consort Ỷ Lan and supporters of Confucianism represented by Lê Văn Thịnh. To repress the influence of Confucianism in the royal court, Ỷ Lan made a plot of slandering the chancellor with the crime of treason. This hypothesis was based on the fact that the Imperial Consort Ỷ Lan was a devotee of Buddhism and had used ruthless methods to eliminate her rival in the royal family, the Empress Consort Thượng Dương. On the other hand, Lê Văn Thịnh was proved to be a loyal official with many achievements and did not have any sign of forming party or hatred towards the emperor before the 1096 event. Also asserting that Lê Văn Thịnh was the victim of a struggle in the royal court, another hypothesis speculated that he was harmed because of his ideas about reforming the royal court and the country. According to this hypothesis, Lê Văn Thịnh's innovative <b>thought</b> <b>made</b> him an obstacle for the conservative side in the royal court and thus he was unjustly treated like the chancellor Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty who lived at the same time as Lê Văn Thịnh and also wanted to reform his country.|$|E

He noted that several segments forced players to use the Mark and Execute feature, frustrating players who favored stealth over action. Ben Reeves of Game Informer praised the return and refinement of Mark and Execute, which he found satisfying, and praised the game's intense, varied mission design.

500|$|... "Postgame Mortem" [...] {{was written}} by Joe Voci and {{directed}} by John T. Kretchmer, marking Voci's first writing credit and Kretchmer's thirteenth directing credit. The episode was one of series creator Rob Thomas's favorite episodes of season three, along with [...] "Of Vice and Men", [...] "Show Me the Monkey", [...] "Poughkeepsie, Tramps and Thieves", and [...] "Mars, Bars". The DVD for the season contains one deleted scene of the episode. It depicts Veronica going into the police station and asking Sheriff Lamb about Josh's recent arrest. Thomas explained {{in his introduction to}} the scene that while it was initially written for its comedic value, it became [...] "an example of staging killing the comedy". He explained that Lamb had to frequently turn all the way around to speak to Veronica and Deputy Sacks (Brandon Hillock), a fact which he <b>thought</b> <b>made</b> the scene awkward.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, Steiger {{appeared}} on Broadway in Moby Dick—Rehearsed, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, {{as well as}} playing a detective searching for a scientist's (Alan Ladd's) mugger in Philip Leacock's 13 West Street for Columbia Pictures. Steiger {{played the role of}} a destroyer commander in the large ensemble cast of The Longest Day, which included John Wayne, Richard Todd, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Sean Connery and Henry Fonda. According to co-star Richard Burton, Steiger had admitted to him that he was in financial trouble at the time and had had a face lift, which Burton <b>thought</b> <b>made</b> him look like [...] "one half of a naked ass-hole". The following year, Steiger played ruthless Neapolitan land developer and city councilman Edoardo Nottola, who uses his political power to make personal profit in a large scale suburban real estate deal, in Francesco Rosi's Italian production, Hands over the City (1963). According to biographer Francesco Bolzoni, Rosi had cast Steiger in the Italian language film because he had wanted [...] "a rich interpreter of great capacity" [...] in the part of the land developer.|$|E

500|$|Allgame called F-Zero X as [...] "certainly {{not up to}} Nintendo's usual standards" [...] {{in terms}} of detail and texture quality. GameSpot also criticized the game's {{graphical}} detail, calling the low polygon count on the vehicles [...] "particularly uninspiring" [...] and saying that the [...] "track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it". Although the optimizations are strict, critics exalted the game for managing a steady rate of 60 frames per second, which some <b>thought</b> <b>made</b> up {{for the lack of}} graphical detail with little room for improvement. The Electric Playground found the framerate to give [...] "the game a major boost in the feel department" [...] making it [...] "seem like your vehicle is bursting through the sound barrier". According to GameSpot, F-Zero X became the first racing game to run at 60 frames per second with up to 30 vehicles on screen at the same time, but {{in order to keep the}} frame rate, polygon counts on the vehicles, textures and track detail are sacrificed.|$|E
500|$|Lisa Mahapatra from The New Indian Express was {{impressed}} with the story and Tripathi's writing and praised [...] "the interactions between Shiva and Sati, [...] intriguing. Age-old thoughts and philosophies were delivered in a very modern context, which I <b>thought</b> <b>made</b> for an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Mahapatra added that [...] "the only downside throughout the novel, I was unable to really get into the main characters—they remained mostly on a two-dimensional level." [...] It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times, where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi's usage of common, everyday language. [...] "There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written. I wrote to Amish to express one small observation, the script writing is not that sharp. You have words like 'Goddamnit', 'bloody hell', 'In the name of God what is this nonsense?' etc, which I guess would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel you find it falling a little flat," [...] the reviewer concluded.|$|E
500|$|The clearer {{sound effects}} of the Dreamcast port were {{received}} well by Game Revolution's Shawn Sparks, who also remarked that the character models look slightly sharper. However, Steve Key of Computer And Video Games disliked the Dreamcast release's low-resolution backgrounds, which he <b>thought</b> <b>made</b> the characters stand out too much from the environments, and thus lessened the game's atmosphere. GameSpot staff writer James Mielke {{did not believe that}} the Dreamcast port was [...] "an essential purchase", but still called it a [...] "great game" [...] and, thanks to its low retail price, an attractive offer. The GameCube release was heavily criticized for its high price and dated graphics. However, [...] "Four-Eyed Dragon" [...] of GamePro noted that it offered the best in-game visuals of any version of the game. Davis and 1UP.com's Mark MacDonald were disappointed by the port's lack of features that were included in the Nintendo 64 release. Peer Schneider of IGN found the 2.5D version for the Game.com to be frustrating and only [...] "partially faithful" [...] to the original release of Resident Evil 2.

500|$|The oeuvre {{comprises}} instrumental, vocal, orchestral and choral music. Early in her compositional career Imogen {{was primarily}} influenced, as Gustav Holst's daughter, {{by what the}} analyst Christopher Tinker terms [...] "her natural and inescapable relationship with the English musical establishment", and by her close personal relationship with her father. Some of her first compositions reflect the pastoralism of Ralph Vaughan Williams, who taught her at the RCM. In her teaching and EFDSS years during the 1930s she became known for her folksong arrangements but composed little music herself. The personal style {{that emerged in the}} 1940s incorporated her affinity with folksong and dance, her intense interest in English music of the 16th and 17th centuries, and her taste for innovation. In her 1930 suite for solo viola, she had begun experimenting with scale patterns; by the 1940s she was incorporating her own six- and eight-note scales into her chamber music and occasionally into choral works such as the Five Songs (1944). This experimentation reappears in later works; in Hallo My Fancy (1972) a new scale is introduced for each verse, while the choir provides free harmonisation to a solo voice. In Homage to William Morris (1984), among her final works, Tinker notes her use of dissonance [...] "to add strength to the musical articulation of the text". By contrast, the String Quintet of 1982, the work which Imogen herself <b>thought</b> <b>made</b> her [...] "a real composer", is characterised by the warmth of its harmonies.|$|E
500|$|The {{asymmetrical}} {{structure of}} the game mostly received praise from critics. Vince Ingenito, from IGN, thought that the system was smart and has successfully delivered a unique multiplayer experience for players. He added {{that the system is}} tactically deep, and that the [...] "evolution" [...] mechanic saved it from being gimmicky. This was contradicted by Steven Strom of Ars Technica, who stated that the game overall was just a [...] "great gimmick and little else: something we'll play for a month or two, and not much longer"., [...] Evan Lahti, from PC Gamer, also commended the structure, and considered it the most compressed multiplayer experience since 2014's Titanfall. He added that such structure is something that the genre needs. Anthony LaBella, from Game Revolution, praised the asymmetrical idea. He added that the distant gameplay elements between Monsters and Hunters had successfully introduced Evolve to a broad audience. However, he noted that such a structure may become repetitive and boring for players after months of playthrough. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd also appreciated the structure, which he <b>thought</b> <b>made</b> every battle feel [...] "vicious and intense". However, Jeff Marchiafava, from Game Informer, thought that the structure felt limited, and that Evolve, even with all the modes, had failed to offer enough variety and challenges to players. Nic Rowan, from Destructoid, thought that Evolve had presented some of the best moments he had had in a multiplayer game, but he felt that these moments are too far between.|$|E
