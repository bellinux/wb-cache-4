5|$|The {{story begins}} when Specter, a white-haired monkey who is {{well-known}} {{at his home}} in a monkey-themed amusement park, puts on an experimental Peak Point Helmet created by a Professor, which increases his intelligence beyond that of a regular monkey, but also twists his mind, turning him evil. Imbued with this new power, Specter gives Pipo Helmets to all the monkeys in the park and sets <b>them</b> <b>loose,</b> having them take over the local laboratory where the Professor and his assistant Natalie (Katie/Natsumi) are currently building a time machine. As Spike (Kakeru) and his best friend Jake (Buzz/Hiroki) arrive at the laboratory, they find themselves transported by Specter, along with all the other monkeys, to the various reaches of time. Realizing that leaving the monkeys to their own devices could rewrite history in disastrous ways, the Professor tasks Spike with finding all of the monkeys scattered across time and sending them back to the present.|$|E

500|$|The {{story is}} {{credited}} to David Dalessandro, a University of Pittsburgh administrator and first-time Hollywood writer. He developed the concept in 1992 after reading a nature magazine article about Indonesian brown tree snakes climbing onto planes in cargo during World War II.

He soon revised it, expanding upon the premise {{to include a}} plague of assorted venomous snakes, thencrediting the film Aliensrevised it once again to include [...] "lots of <b>them</b> <b>loose</b> in the fuselage of a plane."

500|$|Desiring a {{realistic}} depiction of vulpine behavior and habits, Mannix {{spent more than}} a year studying the behaviors of a mated pair of foxes that he kept at his home. He stated that they were [...] "so tame [...] could turn <b>them</b> <b>loose</b> and watch them hunt, fight, make love, and live an almost normal life." [...] Additionally, he studied wild foxes and interviewed trappers, hunters, game wardens, and [...] "Masters of Hounds" [...] to learn what they felt foxes would and would not do. In the novel's postscript, Mannix discusses this research. [...] To defend his novel against charges of improbability, he recounts his observations of wild foxes and discusses other people's stories about fox behavior. Regarding the actions Tod takes in eluding the hunters, he details both witnessing wild foxes performing such acts and stories others shared with him that he used as a basis for some of the story's events. For example, he notes that while people have told him that foxes do not really run among sheep or cattle herds to escape hounds, he himself used to watch them do just that from his bedroom window. In the case of a fox running along train tracks as a train is approaching, Mannix drew on a story told to him by a master of hunting in the area of Whitford Sales—near Thorndale, Pennsylvania—who had to stop hunting in the area because of a fox who consistently killed pursuing hounds on the Trenton Cutoff using this method.|$|E

2500|$|Just as {{the breed}} was {{stabilizing}} in its native land, World War II pushed the Akita {{to the brink}} of extinction. Early in the war the dogs suffered from lack of nutritious food. Then many were killed to be eaten by the starving populace, and their pelts were used as clothing. Finally, the government ordered all remaining dogs to be killed on sight {{to prevent the spread of}} disease. The only way concerned owners could save their beloved Akitas was to turn <b>them</b> <b>loose</b> in remote mountain areas, where they bred back with their ancestor dogs, the Matagi, or conceal them from authorities by means of crossing with German Shepherd dogs, and naming them in the style of German Shepherd dogs of the time.

At emancipation some slaveowners reacted by evicting all former slaves from their properties, others negotiated work contracts or sharecropping arrangements.

2500|$|In the 1841 case of Fouldes v Willoughby , a ferryman was {{sued for}} {{conversion}} {{by the owner}} of two horses which he had put on board to be carried across a river.

The owner remained aboard the ferry. He {{made no attempt to}} retrieve his horses, which were subsequently lost to him. It was argued that this was an interference with the possession of the horses, and would be a trespass. [...] It was a mere asportation without any conversion or interference with rights of ownership, since the action in putting the horses ashore had recognized the right owner. [...] Consequently, the court held that trover was not an appropriate remedy. This was a signal case which brought into sharp distinction the alternate theories of trespass and trover. Trespass was the appropriate action, {{but it was not a}} conversion. This case was decided two years before the case of Johnson v Weedman (see infra) in which Abraham Lincoln successfully argued that a bailee who rode a horse for 15 miles had not incurred enough damage to invoke an action in trover.
