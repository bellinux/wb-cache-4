2500|$|As {{he worked}} on the mural, Picasso said: [...] "The Spanish {{struggle}} is the fight of reaction against the people, against freedom. My whole life as an artist has been nothing more than a continuous struggle against reaction and the death of art. How could anybody <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ... In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call Guernica, and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hall of African Mammals {{was first}} {{proposed}} {{to the museum}} by Carl Akeley around 1909. His original concept contained forty dioramas which would present the rapidly vanishing landscapes and animals of Africa. The intent was that a visitor of the hall, “may have the illusion, at worst, of passing a series of pictures of primeval Africa, and at best, may <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that he has stepped [...] across the sea into Africa itself.” Akeley’s proposal was a hit with both {{the board of trustees}} and then museum president, Henry Fairfield Osborne. To fund its creation, Daniel Pomeroy, a trustee of the museum and partner at J.P. Morgan, offered interested investors the opportunity to accompany the museum’s expeditions in Africa in exchange for funding.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France. [...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not want you to <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I am taking this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do {{the best you can}} and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But somehow I feel safe." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Pig <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and says: [...] "No thanks. I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's to be pitied," [...] said Mr. Jobling, sternly. [...] "I {{know how}} she feels. She can't help herself, but she'll get over it in time. I don't suppose she <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> we have noticed her--her--her liking for me, and I'm {{not going to have}} her {{feelings}} hurt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ole and Sven {{are at a}} funeral. Suddenly {{it occurs}} to Ole that he doesn't {{remember}} the name of the dearly departed. Ole turns to Sven and asks: [...] "Sven, could you remind me again who died?" [...] Sven <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and says, [...] "I'm not sure," [...] Sven points at the casket, [...] "...but I think it was de guy in de box." ...|$|R
2500|$|Clarkson is unsympathetic to {{the green}} {{movement}} and has little respect for groups such as Greenpeace—he believes that the [...] "eco-mentalists" [...] are a by-product of the [...] "old trade unionists and CND lesbians" [...] who had found a more relevant cause—but [...] "loves the destination" [...] of environmentalism and believes that people should quietly strive to be more eco-friendly. Regarding windfarms, he {{says that in the}} future, they will be described as [...] "a reminder of the time when mankind temporarily took leave of its senses and decided wind, waves and lashings of tofu could somehow generate enough electricity for the whole planet". Clarkson has voiced some views regarding global warming: he believes that higher temperatures are not necessarily negative and that anthropogenic carbon dioxide production has a negligible effect on the global climate, but is aware of the negative potential consequences of global warming, saying [...] "let's just stop and <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> what the consequences might be. Switzerland loses its skiing resorts? The beach in Miami is washed away? North Carolina gets knocked over by a hurricane? Anything bothering you yet?" ...|$|E

5000|$|From the {{demanding}} study of raga music, Manose has acquired technical mastery and an astonishing ability to improvise. At the same time, we find him wonderfully free to {{draw inspiration from}} wherever he finds it, be it the swaying sweetness of a samba, or the lightning fast lines of Celtic masters. When asked what or who has had the greatest musical influence on his playing, he <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and says [...] "the sound of the flute." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thou wilt {{say it is}} an idle {{invention}} of my brain--but <b>think</b> it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> the speech of a true diviner, and what wouldst thou say of it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In Gregory Maguire's novel [...] "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" [...] The Scarecrow is a {{companion}} of Dorothy. When the quartet of Dorothy, The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Lion approach Elphaba's home in Fiyero's castle, she <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that maybe Fiyero is the Scarecrow, having not died {{earlier in the}} novel. She sends minions after him to tear him apart to see if Fiyero is inside, but he is not. In the novel he is NOT Fiyero, but this is probably where they {{got the idea for}} the stage version.|$|R
60|$|SHE. And do you <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> he'd stand it, {{like that}} half-baked clergyman in the play? He'd just kill you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm quite reassured. You don't <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{that father}} would {{deliberately}} steal somebody else's money. And it's {{nothing short of}} theft.' ...|$|E
6000|$|BIGELOW--[Severely.] Shut up! You're not yourself. Come, <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> What would Martha feel if {{she heard}} you {{going on this}} way? Why--it would kill her! ...|$|E
60|$|But the {{peculiarity}} of David's psalms, after all, is {{from his}} intense faith in God. God {{is in all}} his thoughts. God is near him, guiding him, trying him, educating him, punishing him, sometimes he <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> deserting him. But even then his mind is still full of God. It is God he wants, and the light of God's countenance, without which he cannot live, and leaving him in misery, and shame, and darkness, {{and out of the}} darkness he cries--My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And, therefore, everything which happens to him shapes itself not into mere poetry, but into a prayer, or a hymn.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had nothing}} {{whatever}} {{to do with}} the horses or the trip, except to help rub them down when we stopped, and to drive home," [...] replied Ralph, almost indignant that George should <b>think</b> even <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that he would have countenanced such a thing.|$|R
60|$|II. I pass now to {{our second}} order of war, the commonest among men, that {{undertaken}} in desire of dominion. And {{let me ask you}} to <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> what the real meaning of this desire of dominion is--first in the minds of kings--then in that of nations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> sir, that I am complaining," [...] said Phineas. [...] "I {{know it is}} {{much more}} than I have a right to expect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Don’t <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I {{have been}} scared off,” she said. “It is they who were frightened. I suppose you {{heard a lot}} of Headquarters gossip?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] he said courteously to Amuba. [...] "I did not <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{that one}} who had but newly arrived among us {{understood}} our language." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{think that}} she cares about you. I don't <b>think</b> it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> You say you haven't spoken to her, and I am sure she's not a girl to throw herself at a man's head. I don't approve it, and I think it had better fall to the ground. It must fall to the ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I had; I confess I once {{or twice}} fancied that I caught glimpses of bliss round the corner, as it were; but, before I could decide, the glimpses vanished, and I was very sure I was a {{conceited}} coxcomb to <b>think</b> it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> It was very hard, and yet I was glad." ...|$|R
50|$|The news of Palmer's {{assassination}} spreads {{quickly through}} the Counter Terrorist Unit and news media, as President Logan, Mike Novick, Chloe O'Brian and Jack Bauer learn the news. Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida watch the news from home. They now run their own security company. Despite a meeting the two have scheduled that day with a man named Rick Rosen, Michelle leaves for CTU, citing that the agency will need her. Tony calls Rick and explains that Michelle won't be attending their meeting. Tony <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and seemingly changes his mind, saying that he will also be going to CTU. As Tony says this, an explosion rips through his front window. Tony {{runs out of the}} house, screaming Michelle's name, as he sees a car bomb has destroyed her car. Tony finds Michelle's body on the ground just as a second explosion knocks him unconscious.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{is a most}} {{remarkable}} woman. Don't <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I don't appreciate her. You don't want to quarrel with her, and I daresay you are right.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well, father. But just <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Place {{yourself}} in Luke's position. The very {{idea that you}} might be suspected must in itself be terrible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But do you <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I {{would permit}} you, or anyone else, {{to pull the}} left wing from a yellow butterfly?" [...] demanded the Tin Woodman sternly.|$|E
6000|$|There was no {{resisting}} such {{a strong}} hint as this: however, I pretended to <b>think</b> about it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then said [...] "Well, I like 'Ting, ting, ting,' best of all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 29. Before {{proceeding}} {{to the principal}} subject of this evening, I wish to anticipate one or two objections which may arise in your minds to what I must lay before you. It may perhaps have been felt by you last evening, that some things I proposed to you were either romantic or Utopian. Let us <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> what romance and Utopianism mean.|$|R
60|$|Geoffrey gasped. Beatrice with {{scarcely}} enough {{means to}} clothe herself--Beatrice shivering and becoming ill from the {{want of a}} cloak while he lived in luxury! It made him sick to <b>think</b> of it. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> he could say nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I am criticising {{the amount}} of the legacy. I am very glad of it, as, without it, there was {{literally}} no provision,--no provision at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh?" [...] {{he said to}} Kurt, {{stopping}} in mid-sentence, and followed the gesture of Kurt's hand. He glared at the crumpled object in the recess and seemed to <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Tony {{laughed a}} clear, ringing laugh. “Did you <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I would? Now, you will gain nothing by insisting, and you don’t command. If I can’t get your {{permission}} I’ll get Maccario’s.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my dear; not so. You {{must not}} <b>think</b> that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> The {{proposition}} has not originated {{with me at}} all. I am endeavouring to do my duty by explaining to you the advantages which you would enjoy by going to your Aunt Emmeline, and which you certainly cannot have if you remain here. And I must tell you, that, if you return to Sir Thomas, he will probably provide for you. You know what I mean by providing for you?" ...|$|R
500|$|Even so, {{the narrator}} pulls his chair {{directly}} in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. He <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. [...] The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. [...] The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a [...] "thing of evil" [...] and a [...] "prophet". Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical [...] "Nevermore", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the [...] "Plutonian shore"—but it does not move. Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven [...] "still is sitting" [...] on the bust of Pallas. The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted [...] "Nevermore".|$|R
50|$|Depressed, Charlie Brown returns home, {{along with}} Linus and Snoopy, {{but unlike the}} crowd of people that saw them off, no one is there to greet them when their bus pulls in. They trudge home, and the next day, Linus visits Charlie Brown. Sally tells him her brother has been in his room all day with the shades down and refuses to see or talk to anybody. Linus tells Charlie Brown that the other kids missed him at school and that his {{baseball}} team finally got their first win of the season, but Charlie Brown says he will never return to school again. As Linus leaves, {{he points out that}} the world did not end despite Charlie Brown's failure. Charlie Brown <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> gets dressed, and goes outside. He sees the other children playing, and when he spots Lucy as she plays with a football which is the same one he failed to kick earlier, he sneaks up behind her to kick it. She pulls it away before he can, and welcomes him home and the two look at the audience before the screen fades out.|$|R
