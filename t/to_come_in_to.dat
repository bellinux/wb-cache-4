Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E

She remarked of her experience of joining the team on Voyager, [...] "It was a little awkward since the cast had been together for three years already. And one of the original characters was being written out pretty much at the same time I was being added. But the cast was terrific, and very welcoming." [...] Although she wore extensive make-up for her first appearances, including an eye-piece that fell off when she smiled, her typical make-up regime took around 45 minutes, with the attachment of the Borg appliance above her eye taking an additional 15 minutes. Her hairstyling usually took as long as that combined.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1838, Morazán's liberal {{forces were}} back in Guatemala after a peasant revolt ousted Guatemalan {{governor}} Mariano Galvez. Morazán and his Guatemalan ally José Francisco Barrundia invaded Guatemalan soil and when they arrived in San Sur, they summarily executed Chúa Álvarez, general Rafael Carrera's father-in-law, for Carrera {{was the leader of}} the revolt. Morazán's soldiers placed Álvarez' head on top of a spike as a warning to Carrera's followers. Upon learning the news, both Carrera and his wife, Petrona Álvarez -who had left Guatemala City to face Morazán and were in Mataquescuintla- promised to avenge Chúa even after Morazán's death. [...] The liberals sent several envoys to try to meet with Carrera, but {{he did not want to}} talk to them -especially Barrundia, who was told that he should not try <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> talk to Carrera if he wanted to remain alive. [...] After this, Morazán began a strong offensive, destroying every single town in his path, stealing their few belongings and forcing Carrera militants to hide in the mountains.|$|E

In 1974, the Chicano conceptual and performance art group Asco {{took advantage of the}} opportunity to confront a by-then entrenched social and political culture with an irreverent [...] "invasion". In the midst of ceremonies attended by Los Angeles's political elite, Harry Gamboa, Jr., Patssi Valdez, Gronk, and Willie Herrón were [...] "delivered" [...] in a giant envelope marked postage due.

2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, {{and we are going}} to keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{attended}} the 1884 GOP National Convention in Chicago {{and gave a}} speech convincing delegates to nominate African American John R. Lynch, an Edmunds supporter, to be temporary chair. Roosevelt fought alongside the Mugwump reformers; however, Blaine, having gained support from Arthur's and Edmunds' delegates, won the nomination by 541 votes on the fourth ballot. In a crucial moment of his budding political career, Roosevelt resisted the demand of the Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine. He bragged about his one small success: [...] "We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the Blaine nominee for temporary chairman... To do this needed a mixture of skill, boldness and energy... to get the different factions <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in...</b> <b>to</b> defeat the common foe." [...] He was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand, the largest crowd he had addressed up to that date. Having gotten a taste of national politics, Roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level; he then retired to his new [...] "Chimney Butte Ranch" [...] on the Little Missouri River. Roosevelt refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Grover Cleveland, the governor of New York and the Democratic nominee in the general election. He debated {{the pros and cons}} of staying loyal with his political friend, Henry Cabot Lodge. After Blaine won the nomination, Roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give [...] "hearty support to any decent Democrat". He distanced himself from the promise, saying that it had not been meant [...] "for publication". When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine, Roosevelt replied, [...] "That question I decline to answer. It is a subject I do not care to talk about." [...] In the end, he realized that he had to support Blaine to maintain his role in the GOP, and he did so in a press release on July 19. Having lost the support of many reformers, Roosevelt decided to retire from politics and move to North Dakota.|$|E

Theater needs <b>to</b> carry <b>in</b> itself its counterpart, its paradox : [...] "to be or not to be", to be one thing {{and at the same time}} something else.
