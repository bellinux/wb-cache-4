On leaving, Joshua Topolsky, former Editor-in-chief, is quoted having said, “We have been working on blogging technology that was developed in 2003, we haven’t made a hire since I started running the site, and I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be more successful elsewhere”.|$|E

It was worse than other defeats because we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> win ... Oxford just rowed through us; with every stroke they took they destroyed our belief in ourselves." [...] His crew mate, Nick Clarry, focused on the approach to this year's race: [...] "This year it's heads down {{and get on with}} the job. [...] We know that if we don't cross the line first on the day, nobody could care less who we are." ...|$|E
500|$|Hugh Syme {{provided}} the artwork for Octavarium. The idea of depicting a giant Newton's cradle was {{born out of}} discussions between Syme and Portnoy. The two talked about how [...] "for everything you do in music you create either a cluster or triad", according to Syme. [...] "And then it became evident that for every action there is an opposite reaction. So I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do something based on the Newton's cradle." [...] There are numerous references to the numbers five and eight throughout the artwork, alluding to the album's concept. For example, the Newton's cradle has eight suspended balls, and there are five birds on the cover. The album booklet features an octagonal maze, spider and octopus, among other references. The landscape on the cover is made up of a sky and grass from Indiana, and a background from the Lake District.|$|E

500|$|Matheos {{originally}} intended the first OSI album as a [...] "project" [...] which would never produce a second album. For Free, Matheos and Moore {{wanted to use}} a different musician lineup to focus OSI on primarily being Matheos and Moore. They {{did not want to}} give the impression that the guests on the first album were part of the band. Matheos stated that the music on Free was [...] "focused less on the progressive elements or the metal elements that were on the first record. We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do something just a little more groove oriented." [...] Matheos and Moore had both worked with bassist Joey Vera in the past and considered him [...] "perfect" [...] for the album. Moore was pleased with Vera's bass parts: Vera sent them to Moore in a state such that they required very little editing or enhancement for the final mix of the album.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles asked {{producer}} Martin {{to come to}} the rescue, so {{he borrowed}} two four-track recorders from EMI, and long-time Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick was given the task of building and setting up a studio with portable equipment. After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least £300,000 (£4.5 million in 2015 pounds). Starr once approved of one of Mardas’ ideas: [...] "He [...] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio – you’d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren’t interested at all".|$|E
500|$|Gunn {{appointed}} a backroom staff of former Norwich colleagues, making Ian Crook first-team coach and John Deehan chief scout. However, the initial turnaround in form {{could not be}} maintained; having lost their last three games of the season, Norwich were relegated from the Championship. Gunn labelled his players as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] after the 4–2 defeat to Charlton Athletic that sealed relegation to League One. Despite relegation to the third tier of English football {{for the first time}} in nearly 50 years, Writing in Tales from the City, Gunn said of the match [...] "Even going to Charlton on the last day, I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> survive… We lost 4-2 and were relegated to the third tier. I was shell-shocked; the emptiest I have ever felt in a sporting or professional context. The directors went on the field to face the fans and to thank them for their support and I had tears in my eyes when I saw Delia and Michael doing that. I told them how sorry I was." ...|$|E

500|$|The group {{concluded}} the North American [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] {{leg of the}} tour on 25 November 1992, leaving them with a six-month break before the tour resumed in Europe in May 1993 with the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg. Rather than use the time to rest, lead vocalist Bono and guitarist The Edge were keen to record new material. Following a hectic year of touring, the two {{did not want to}} settle back into domestic life. Bono said, [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> live a normal life and then go back on the road [...] But it turns out that your whole way of thinking, your whole body has been geared toward the madness of Zoo TV... So we decided to put the madness on a record. Everybody's head was spinning, so we thought, why not keep that momentum going...?" [...] The Edge also wished to distract himself from the emotions he was feeling after separating from his wife during the Achtung Baby sessions in 1991. The other members, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., ultimately agreed to join them for recording.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words I will ever write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is a good movie {{but it is not}} the movie I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make. [...] I do like Great Moments but there is another film in there somewhere that has got lost." ...|$|E

500|$|Elliot Barker, {{the head}} of Oak Ridge's {{therapeutic}} division, had already interviewed Lamb in 1966 and spoken on his behalf at his trial. The doctor had arrived at Penetanguishene in 1959, and in 1965 stepped up his efforts to reform the unit's programmes, which on his arrival were still based around the traditional methods of neuroleptic tranquillisation and electroconvulsive therapy, supplemented by long periods of isolation for each inmate. Barker innovated a programme whereby the patients could spend more {{of their time in}} each other's company, in a more natural environment; he believed that the key to overcoming these illnesses was communication. [...] "My original vision," [...] he writes, [...] "was that I wasn't really dealing with patients. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> evolve a social structure where people could resolve the internal conflicts in community." [...] Barker's [...] "Social Therapy Unit" [...] (STU), initially made up exclusively of young male psychopaths and schizophrenics of normal intelligence, began in September 1965, with a programme of 80 hours of treatment a week, focussing on cures brought about by mutual cooperation and interaction. Joan Hollobon, the medical editor of the Toronto Globe and Mail, volunteered in 1967 to spend two days at Oak Ridge {{as if she were a}} patient, and afterwards heaped praise on the inmates, saying that they were [...] "pioneering a brave and exciting experiment in self-government and self-therapy ... individual responsibility, co-operation with colleagues and authority, and acceptance of rules reached by consensus." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I were to get back together after 20 years and dust off the tape machines and put them in my garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you take {{all of the things that}} people consider your band's signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that. And that's sorta what I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making sense of it all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but had been part of the touring band since 2006.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] finished 32nd in {{ratings for the}} week of September 27– October 4, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 11.8, equivalent to approximately 11.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the seventh best in the show's history. Entertainment Weeklys Dalton Ross lauded it as [...] "the show's best ever musical episode", while Dave Kehr of The New York Times called it a [...] "brilliant ... parody of Broadway musicals that should be required viewing for every Tony viewer." [...] In a list of his favorite episodes, Kevin Williamson of Canadian Online Explorer added, [...] "As pitch-perfect eviscerations of community theatre go, this tops Waiting for Guffman." [...] Series creator Matt Groening has listed {{it as one of}} his own favorites, calling the subplot [...] "Maggie's finest moment", and future Simpsons guest star Trey Anastasio said the episode [...] "may have been the best TV show ever". Executive producer James L. Brooks also listed it as one of his favorites, saying it [...] "showed we could go into areas no one <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> go into". Following the episode, the Ayn Rand Society called Groening to say they were amazed at the references to Rand. They also asked him if the show was making fun of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we'll {{have to go}} back, that is {{all there}} is to it," [...] remarked the doctor's son after a pause, during which they looked across the rocks in perplexity. [...] "I <b>thought</b> sure <b>we</b> <b>could</b> go this way, but it seems as if we can't." ...|$|R

I've had guys come up to me on the street and say, 'I didn't have a dad, you raised me.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked to}} look back on the album, the band {{themselves}} have described Gold Against the Soul as their least favourite album and the period surrounding the album as being the most unfocused of their career. The band's vocalist and guitarist James Dean Bradfield has said [...] "All we wanted to do was go under the corporate wing. We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> ignore it but you do get affected." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{several years}} in Laredo, Tatangelo became active in local politics. He {{considered}} himself a Democrat, but, as an independent businessman, he was more pragmatic than partisan. [...] "I had a summer house in Zapata (also Zapata County) and learned {{that they had a}} fire station manned by volunteers. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have that in Laredo," [...] he told The Laredo Morning Times. He recruited thirty-nine volunteers, and in 1973, a fire station was built on Del Mar Boulevard across from St. Patrick's Catholic Church.|$|E

2500|$|Though In/Casino/Out was {{recorded}} live, [...] "Relationship of Command {{may very well}} be the first record to harness the chaotic balance of adrenaline and intellect of ATDI's live performance." [...] "Ross was instrumental in bringing out a lot of feeling from us," [...] Bixler recalls. [...] "We channeled a lot of emotion into this record. He pushed us farther than we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> go. I learned to cut loose the way we do live and not to be afraid to break something or whatever." [...] While capturing the essence of At the Drive-In's live shows in a way never before seen, the record also featured some of the band's most experimental songs, including [...] "Rolodex Propaganda", [...] "Non-Zero Possibility", and [...] "Invalid Litter Dept." [...]|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, those {{voting on}} the bill were later {{surprised}} by the reaction it gained. [...] State Representative Michele Reagan reflected three months later: [...] "The majority of us who voted yes on that bill, myself included, did not expect or encourage an outcry from the public. The majority of us just voted for it because we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> try to fix the problem. Nobody envisioned boycotts. Nobody anticipated the emotion, the prayer vigils. The attitude was: These are the laws, let's start following them." [...] State Representative Kyrsten Sinema, the assistant House minority leader who {{tried to stop the}} bill and voted against it, similarly reflected: [...] "I knew it would be bad, but no one thought it would be this big. No one." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{an unusual}} game at Grace Road, which was all done by 3.30pm. The ball swung greatly, and there was seam movement, and Charl Willoughby of Leicestershire {{made the most of}} them first, taking 6 for 16 as Somerset were {{dismissed}} for 94 - though it could have been much worse, as they were 58 for 9 before Ian Blackwell and Simon Francis attacked and added 36 for the last wicket. Marcus Trescothick, the Somerset captain, who only made 11 said, [...] "Conditions were not conducive to one-day cricket, that's for sure. Unfortunately, we lost the toss and had the worst of it, but we still <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> win because we have more consistent length bowlers. Even 130 or so could have been a great score." ...|$|E
