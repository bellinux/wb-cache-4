He writes that he listened to The John and Ken Show on KFI, and that their discussion of Scientology allowed him to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> critically during his time at the compound. He says that viewing Conan O'Brien make fun of Scientology celebrities changed his views on individuals that the organization had only spoken of internally with reverence.|$|E

25|$|In {{recent times}} {{occupational}} therapy practitioners have challenged themselves to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> broadly {{about the potential}} scope of the profession, and expanded it to include working with groups experiencing occupational injustice stemming from sources other than disability. Examples of new and emerging practice areas would include therapists working with refugees, children experiencing obesity, and people experiencing homelessness.|$|E
25|$|There {{is not so}} much {{a protest}} song trend in France, but rather of a {{permanent}} background of criticism and contestation, and individuals who personify it. World War II and its horrors forced French singers to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> critically about war in general, forcing them to question their governments and the powers who ruled their society.|$|E

25|$|Still more pacifists {{would argue}} that a nonviolent {{reaction}} may not save lives immediately but would in the long run. The acceptance of violence for any reason {{makes it easier to}} use in other situations. Learning and committing to pacifism helps to send a message that violence is, in fact, not the most effective way. It can also help people to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, then 37-year-old Belaney met 19-year-old Gertrude Bernard (aka Anahareo, or Pony), a Mohawk Iroquois {{woman who}} was to be very {{influential}} in his life. She encouraged him to stop trapping and to publish his writing about the wilderness. They had a passionate eight-year affair, beginning with their Anishinaabe wedding ceremony. Through her influence, he began to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> deeply about conservation. Anahareo encouraged his writing and influenced him by saving and raising a pair of beaver kits.|$|E

25|$|According to Mary Guy, Public {{administration}} does not only {{focus on the}} business side of administration but also on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> practically and with more reason.|$|E
25|$|Heffer worked {{together}} with Benn {{to try to}} establish the National Enterprise Board, which would provide industry with investment funding and {{have the ability to}} take failing firms into public ownership. On 15 August 1974 the plans were unveiled in a White paper and preparations began for the Industry Bill which would enact it. While this policy had been agreed by Wilson in opposition and then appeared in the Labour manifesto, in government he began to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> critically. Drafting of the Bill was delayed over the winter and it was not introduced until January 1975.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have found}} that females tend to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> about their body shape and endorse thinner figures than men even into old age. When female {{undergraduates}} were exposed to depictions of thin women their body satisfaction decreased, but rose when exposed to larger models. In addition, many women engage in fat talk (speaking negatively about the weight-related size/shape of one's body), a behavior that {{has been associated with}} weight dissatisfaction, body surveillance, and body shame. In addition, women who overhear others using fat talk may also experience an increase in body dissatisfaction and guilt. As a result, women may experience concerns related to body image {{in a number of different}} ways and from a variety of sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} by some suffragists {{to speak out}} against the war split the women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom. Most British women were in favour of a quick solution to the conflict and were inclined to work toward that end in any way such as by helping fill positions abandoned by men off at war. Others were nationalistic and sought to make certain that British women were seen as patriotic, as doing their part, so that the men in power would <b>think</b> <b>more</b> highly of them and subsequently pass woman suffrage legislation. A minority of women advocated peace vociferously and worked with international peace organisations or with refugee aid societies. All suffragists from the most strikingly militant to the most actively pacifist agreed not to disrupt the nation at war in their promotion of women's suffrage. Toward the end of the war, British politicians rewarded them with a partial victory: suffrage for property-holding women aged 30 and older.|$|E
25|$|In 1894–95 Gilman {{served as}} editor of the {{magazine}} The Impress, a literary weekly that was published by the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association (formerly the Bulletin). For the twenty weeks the magazine was printed, she was consumed in the satisfying accomplishment of contributing its poems, editorials, and other articles. The short-lived paper's printing came to an end {{as a result of a}} social bias against her lifestyle which included being an unconventional mother and a woman who had divorced a man. After a four-month-long lecture tour that ended in April 1897, Gilman began to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> deeply about sexual relationships and economics in American life, eventually completing the first draft of Women and Economics (1898). This book discussed the role of women in the home, arguing for changes in the practices of child-raising and housekeeping to alleviate pressures from women and potentially allow them to expand their work to the public sphere. The book was published in the following year, and propelled Gilman into the international spotlight. In 1903, she addressed the International Congress of Women in Berlin, and, the next year, toured in England, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.|$|E

25|$|Many artists {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s {{opposed the war}} and used their {{creativity}} and careers to visibly oppose the war. Writers and poets opposed to involvement in the war included Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Robert Duncan, and Robert Bly. Their pieces often incorporated imagery based on the tragic events of the war {{as well as the}} disparity between life in Vietnam and life in the United States. Visual artists Ronald Haeberle, Peter Saul, and Nancy Spero, among others, used war equipment, like guns and helicopters, in their works while incorporating important political and war figures, portraying to the nation exactly who was responsible for the violence. Filmmakers such as Lenny Lipton, Jerry Abrams, Peter Gessner, and David Ringo created documentary-style movies featuring actual footage from the antiwar marches to raise awareness about the war and the diverse opposition movement. Playwrights like Frank O'Hara, Sam Shepard, Robert Lowell, Megan Terry, Grant Duay, and Kenneth Bernard used theater as a vehicle for portraying their thoughts about the Vietnam War, often satirizing the role of America in the world and juxtaposing the horrific effects of war with normal scenes of life. Regardless of medium, antiwar artists ranged from pacifists to violent radicals and caused Americans to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> critically about the war. Art as war opposition was quite popular {{in the early years of}} the war, but soon faded as political activism became the more common and most visible way of opposing the war.|$|E

500|$|Side two {{contains}} a 16-minute medley of eight short songs, recorded over July and August and blended into a suite by McCartney and Martin. Some songs were written (and originally recorded in demo form) during sessions for the White Album and Get Back/ Let It Be, which later appeared on Anthology 3. While {{the idea for}} the medley was McCartney's, Martin claims credit for some structure, adding he [...] "wanted to get John and Paul to <b>think</b> <b>more</b> seriously about their music".|$|E
