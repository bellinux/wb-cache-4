5|$|The Republicans gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the {{campaign}}, as Cleveland's {{campaign was}} poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matt Quay and John Wanamaker.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{played a}} total of eight games in four stages {{to advance to the}} final. Chelsea had <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> all but one of their encounters, {{defeating}} Tromsø with an accumulative score of 9–4 in a two-legged match and edging Vicenza by one goal. Stuttgart also enjoyed an advantage in all but two of their meetings, beating ÍBV 5–2 on aggregate and winning over Slavia Prague and Lokomotiv Moscow by two goals.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1992, Armenian forces {{captured}} the mountain stronghold of Shusha but {{remained on the}} defensive until the next year. Fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued {{in other parts of}} the enclave, including Lachin, Khojavend, and Aghdara. However, nearly all offensives launched by Azerbaijan failed or could not hold on to captured territory. By the spring of 1993 the Azerbaijani military, which had <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the initial stages of the war, had been largely reduced to unorganized and incoherent fighting groups. By March 1993 the fighting had shifted to west and south of Karabakh.|$|E
50|$|In 11th-century Europe, {{instead of}} the state having <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> as <b>in</b> China, or the Brahmins having <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> as <b>in</b> India, there was a power {{conflict}} between state and church, the Investiture Controversy between Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor.|$|R
5000|$|Kansas State had two 100-yard {{receivers}} and James Johnson {{rushed for}} over 100 yards but Nebraska held <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> Saturday <b>in</b> a 73-31 win in Lincoln.|$|R
60|$|After {{that first}} onrush, Lambert, with {{marvelous}} agility and quick {{knowledge of a}} hand-to-hand fight, had shaken himself free of his opponent's trembling grasp.

5|$|The {{match that}} {{followed}} was Melina versus Mickie James for the WWE Women's Championship. The match was short lived, as Melina performed an Inverted DDT upon Mickie James and pinned her {{to retain the}} WWE Women's Championship. The third match was between Chris Benoit and Montel Vontavious Porter for the WWE United States Championship. Benoit and MVP struggled throughout the match, attempting to gain <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Benoit pinned MVP {{after a series of}} counters from both superstars, culminating in a small package to win the match and retain the WWE United States Championship.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{complicated}} battle tactics {{for both}} sides, but the Russians and the Austrians, having {{arrived in the}} area first, were able to overcome many of its difficulties by strengthening a causeway between two small ponds. They had also devised a solution to Frederick's deadly modus operandi, the oblique order. Although Frederick's troops initially gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the battle, {{the sheer number of}} Allied troops gave the Russians and Austrians an advantage. By afternoon, when the combatants were exhausted, fresh Austrian troops thrown into the fray secured the Allied victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory of}} Solachon allowed the Byzantines to regain <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> {{the region of}} the Tur Abdin and, in its aftermath, they began to re-establish their control over the region around Dara. The war {{continued}} for a few years without a decision until the revolt of Bahram Chobin caused the rightful Persian shah, KhosrauII (r. 590–628), to find refuge in Byzantine territory. A joint expedition restored him to his throne and a peace treaty was concluded in 591 that left most of Armenia in Byzantine hands.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 1990, <b>The</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>Hand</b> aired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom on ITV {{while the}} {{original}} version was screened on the individual ITV regional stations. The show starred Joe McGann, Diana Weston, and Honor Blackman in the roles originally played by Tony Danza, Judith Light and Katherine Helmond respectively. In 1993, Helmond herself appeared in an episode of this version as Madame Alexandra.|$|R
50|$|After winning two {{championships in}} 1989 and 1990 in the UAAP, La Salle {{temporarily}} gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand,</b> further dominating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1990s through {{the turn of}} the millennium as 4-peat champion from 1998 to 2001.|$|R
50|$|This {{led to the}} 500-day Cisplatine War. Despite the Argentine {{victory in}} the battle of Ituzaingó, neither side gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand,</b> and <b>in</b> 1828 <b>the</b> Treaty of Montevideo, fostered by the United Kingdom, gave birth to Uruguay as an {{independent}} state, and - more importantly to planned British goals - established the international status of the Rio de la Plata, so that international commerce was easier to accomplish.|$|R
5|$|Castro {{was known}} for his busy working hours, often only going to bed at 3 or 4 a.m. He {{preferred}} to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> negotiations. He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer, and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music. A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise. He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs. Castro had a lifelong love of guns, and a preference for life in the countryside over the city.|$|E
5|$|On August 5, 4th Infantry Division, North Korean People's Army (NKPA), {{crossed the}} Naktong River in the {{vicinity}} of Yongsan, attempting to cut US supply lines to the north as well as gaining a bridgehead into the Pusan Perimeter. Opposing it was the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army. Over the next two weeks, American and North Korean forces fought a bloody series of engagements inflicting heavy casualties on one another in a confusing series of attacks and counterattacks, but neither side was able to gain <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> the end, the US forces, aided by reinforcements, air support and heavy weapons, destroyed the invading North Korean force which was hampered by lack of supply and high desertion rates.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642 between the Royalist {{supporters}} of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. The fortifications in North Wales were held by supporters of the king {{and in some cases}} became strategically important as part of the communications route between royal forces operating in England and supplies and reinforcements in Ireland. The castles and towns' defences were repaired at considerable expense and brought back into service, garrisoned by local Royalists. Parliament gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> England, however, and by 1646 its armies were able to intervene in North Wales. Caernarfon, Beaumaris and Conwy were taken that year. Harlech – the last fortress to hold out for the king – surrendered in March 1647, marking {{the end of the first}} phase of the civil war.|$|E
50|$|Despite this Byzantine success, the Saracen raids {{continued}} unabated, {{and reached}} their climax {{in the early}} 10th century with the activities of Leo of Tripoli and Damian of Tarsus, culminating in the Sack of Thessalonica, the Byzantine Empire's second city, in 904. It was only after the 920s that the Byzantines began taking <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand,</b> ending <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recovery of Crete, Cyprus, and finally Tarsos and Cilicia, in the 960s under Nikephoros Phokas.|$|R
50|$|Although the Spanish were {{in control}} of Aruba for many years, the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Netherlands soon gave <b>the</b> Dutch <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand.</b> Finally <b>in</b> 1636 <b>the</b> Spanish handed over the island to the Dutch. Years later, the English took over Aruba for a brief period, but it quickly {{returned}} to Dutch rule in 1816 and remained that way until 1985, when Aruba became a separate entity within {{the kingdom of the}} Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|In 1821, the Banda Oriental, was annexed by Brazil {{under the}} name of Província Cisplatina. In response, the Thirty-Three Orientals, led by Juan Antonio Lavalleja, {{declared}} independence from Brazil on August 25, 1825, supported by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (present-day Argentina). This led to the 500-day Cisplatine War. Neither side gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand,</b> and <b>in</b> 1828 <b>the</b> Treaty of Montevideo, fostered by the British Empire, gave birth to Uruguay as an independent state.|$|R
5|$|The {{seventh and}} final match was between Randy Orton and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Both Orton and Triple H {{managed to get}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the match. During the match, Ric Flair and Batista {{interfered}} on behalf of Triple H, as they attacked Orton while the referee was knocked out. Jonathan Coachman also {{took part in the}} match as he ran down with a referee shirt and tried to act as a guest referee. Orton managed to get the upper hand over Flair, Batista and Coachman as he delivered an RKO on all of them. Triple H, however, managed to hit Orton with a steel chair, which proceeded with a Pedigree onto the same chair. Batista then rolled the referee into the ring, as Triple H covered Orton for the win via pinfall.|$|E
5|$|When Andrew III died in 1301, {{the entire}} kingdom {{was in the}} hands of a dozen {{powerful}} noblemen. Among them, Roland Borsa ruled Crişana, Theodore of Vejteh gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the Banat, and Ladislaus Kán governed Transylvania. The latter's authority was also recognized by the Saxons and the Székelys. He even assumed royal prerogatives, such as taking over lands lacking rightful owners. After 1310, he acknowledged Charles I of Hungary (13011342) as his sovereign, but in fact continued to rule independently. The king who transferred his residence to Timişoara in 1315 could only strengthen his authority after a long series of confrontations. For instance, Ciceu, the last stronghold of Ladislaus Kán's sons surrendered in 1321.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{reinforcements}} poured in. The {{rest of the}} 27th Infantry moved in, as well as {{a battalion}} from the 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division. These were able to push North Korean infiltrators out of Yongsan and back to their firmly held positions at Cloverleaf Hill. On August 14, following an artillery barrage, Task Force Hill launched a direct assault on these positions. Fighting continued the entire day in a fierce series of attacks and counterattacks in which both sides, already at far reduced strength, inflicted large numbers of casualties. However, Task Force Hill's second attack was just as unsuccessful as its first. Casualties among officers was high in the fight, and the disorganization that followed meant most of the units in the fight could not communicate to coordinate any large actions. It became a battle of attrition by August 15 as neither 4th North Korean Division nor Task Force Hill were able to get <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the fight, which in several cases erupted in desperate hand-to-hand combat. Casualties mounted and a frustrated Walker ordered the 5,000-man 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the area to turn the tide. The brigade moved from the Masan region {{in the middle of a}} counteroffensive being conducted by the 25th US Infantry.|$|E
25|$|On 28 May 2001, rebels stormed {{strategic}} {{buildings in}} Bangui in an unsuccessful coup attempt.

5|$|The third {{match of}} the night saw Kane face Edge, during which both men took <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand.</b> Snitsky {{interfered}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match, delivering a big boot to Kane.

40|$|Zhan and Friedman (2007) study double auctions where {{buyers and}} sellers are {{constrained}} to using simple markdown and markup rules. In spite of the alleged symmetry in roles and assumptions, buyers are shown to have <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> call market and in the continuous double auction. We replicate the study and show that their formulation of the sellers’ markup strategies, while seemingly natural, exhibits a hidden asymmetry. We introduce a symmetric set of markup strategies for the sellers and show how it explains away the paradox of buyers’ advantage in three different double-sided market protocols...|$|R
5|$|Appearing in {{the final}} for the fourteenth time, Liverpool had won the FA Cup seven times {{previously}} (in 1965, 1974, 1986, 1989, 1992, 2001 and 2006), and had been beaten {{in the final}} six times (in 1914, 1950, 1971, 1977, 1988 and 1996). Chelsea were appearing in the final for the eleventh time. They had won the FA Cup six times previously (in 1970, 1997, 2000, 2007, 2009 and 2010), and had been beaten {{in the final four}} times (in 1915, 1967, 1994 and 2002). Liverpool and Chelsea had previously met nine times in the FA Cup, including two semi-finals (most recently in 2006), although they had never met in the final before. Chelsea had <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> those nine meetings, winning five times to Liverpool's four; however, Liverpool won both semi-finals between the two clubs, both on neutral grounds. The only domestic cup final to feature both teams was the 2005 League Cup final, which Chelsea won 3–2 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} before the battle, Philippicus, newly {{assigned}} to the Persian front, moved to intercept an anticipated Persian invasion. He chose to deploy his army at Solachon, controlling the various routes of the Mesopotamian plain, and especially access to the main local watering source, the Arzamon river. Kardarigan, confident of victory, advanced against the Byzantines, but they had been warned and were deployed in battle order when Kardarigan reached Solachon. The Persians deployed as well and attacked, gaining <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the centre, but the Byzantine right wing broke through the Persian left flank. The successful Byzantine wing was thrown into disarray as its men headed off to loot the Persian camp, but Philippicus was able to restore order. Then, while the Byzantine centre was forced to form a shield wall to withstand the Persian pressure, the Byzantine left flank also managed to turn the Persians' right. Under threat of a double envelopment, the Persian army collapsed and fled, with many dying in the desert of thirst or from water poisoning. Kardarigan himself survived and, with a part of his army, held out against Byzantine attacks on a hillock for several days before the Byzantines withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Porto {{won three}} {{consecutive}} Primeira Liga titles with Ferreira, ensuring {{their presence in}} the three subsequent Champions League seasons. In 2007–08, Porto fell again in the round of 16, losing to Schalke 04 in a penalty shootout. In the following season's round of 16, they eliminated Atlético Madrid on away goals and progressed to a quarter-final tie with Manchester United. A two-all draw in Manchester gave Porto <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the round, but a Cristiano Ronaldo goal in the opening minutes of the return leg ended their European run. The 2009–10 UEFA Champions League season was Ferreira's last in charge of Porto, and like in previous years, he successfully guided the team past the group stage. In the round of 16, a 2–1 home win over Arsenal was obliterated by a 5–0 defeat in London, which included a hat-trick from Nicklas Bendtner. Domestically, Porto failed to win a fifth consecutive league title and their third-place finish excluded them from competing in the 2010–11 Champions League. However, victory in the Portuguese Cup final confirmed the club's entry in the play-off round of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 Ducati again had <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season, with Kiyonari {{closest to}} their riders, Lavilla and Leon Haslam. A double victory at Silverstone in the {{penultimate}} round {{kept him in}} close contention for the title. However, in the double point final round at Brands Hatch, after a win in race one (he was leading when Shane Byrne's heavy crash caused a stoppage - much to Haslam's visible frustration), Kiyonari only needed to finish third in the final race. Kiyonari finished 2nd in the shortened race behind Haslam, thus winning the championship by 8 points.|$|R

5|$|The {{period of}} Alboin's reign as king in Pannonia {{following}} the death of his father, Audoin, was one of confrontation and conflict between the Lombards and their main neighbors, the Gepids. The Gepids initially gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand,</b> but <b>in</b> 567, thanks to his alliance with the Avars, Alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies, whose lands the Avars subsequently occupied. The increasing power of his new neighbours caused Alboin some unease however, and he therefore decided to leave Pannonia for Italy, hoping {{to take advantage of the}} Byzantine Empire's reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the Gothic War.|$|R
5|$|The first main {{match was}} for the WWE Championship, in which {{champion}} Rob Van Dam defended the title against Edge accompanied with Lita. In {{the beginning of the}} match, Edge performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Van Dam outside the ring. Van Dam, however, managed to execute a crossbody on Edge inside the ring, resulting in the two landing {{on the outside of the}} ring floor. Both men took <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the match, until Van Dam was scripted to knock the referee unconscious. Edge took advantage, as Lita gave him the title. Edge tried to hit Van Dam with the title, but Van Dam dodged the hit as he performed a spinning kick on the title, resulting in hitting Edge's face. Edge, however, got the advantage as he attempted to perform a shoulder block takedown on Van Dam, while Lita propped a chair on a ring corner. Edge went for the shoulder block takedown, but Van Dam moved out of the way, resulting in Edge to crash head-first onto the chair. Capitalizing on the situation, Van Dam then performed a body splash from the top turnbuckle on Edge, which he followed with a cover and a pinfall, thus retaining the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{numbers of}} Catholic {{refugees}} {{came from the}} two northern dioceses with {{the highest percentage of}} Catholics in Vietnam. These were Phát Diêm and Bùi Chu, mainly located in modern-day Ninh Bình and Nam Định Provinces respectively. The bishops of the dioceses, had been strident opponents of the communists, and both had organised Catholic paramilitary groups that fought against the Viet Minh, which had long identified Catholics with colonial collaborationism. When the communists had gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the north, many Catholics had already begun making preparations to move to the south, where the communists were less influential, and large movements began immediately when news of the partition came through. After the defeat of French Union forces at Dien Bien Phu, French officers had evacuated their troops from Bui Chu and Phat Diem to reinforce the area between Hanoi and Haiphong which they still controlled, making it very easy for the communists to progress through the Catholic strongholds.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} the Charity Shield match, United beat ŁKS Łódź 2–0 and {{qualified}} for the Champions League group stage following a goalless match a fortnight later. Arsenal had <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> their two league meetings with United during the season, winning 3–0 at Highbury in September 1998, before a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford in February 1999. The two teams went into {{the final day of}} the 1998–99 FA Premier League vying for the title, but United's 2–1 win against Tottenham meant they finished one point above Arsenal. The two sides met twice more that season in the FA Cup semi-final, which was settled in a replay after the original match finished goalless. Manchester United won in extra time – the winning goal scored by Giggs. United then went on to defeat Newcastle United 2–0 in the 1999 FA Cup Final. Whereas Arsenal failed to progress past the group stage of the Champions League, Manchester United went on to reach the final, where they beat Bayern Munich to win the competition for the second time. Ferguson's team therefore completed a treble of trophies in one season.|$|E
