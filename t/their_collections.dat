5|$|Richard L. Rice married Helen Hart in 1932 and {{the couple}} began rock {{collecting}} in 1938 after finding agates along the Oregon Coast. In 1952 the Rices built a new home north of Hillsboro on 30 acres (12.1 ha) that would later house the museum. The Rices founded a museum in 1953 to display <b>their</b> <b>collections.</b> <b>Their</b> <b>collections</b> won them the Woodruff Trophy twice (1958 and 1961) and this award was permanently awarded to Richard and Helen in 1961. Helen {{served as president of}} the American Federation of Mineralogical Societies from 1959 to 1960.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{literature}} faced {{a similar}} fate in territories annexed by Germany, where the sale of Polish books was forbidden. The public destruction of Polish books {{was not limited to}} those seized from libraries, but also included those books that were confiscated from private homes. The last Polish book titles not already proscribed were withdrawn in 1943; even Polish prayer books were confiscated. Soon after the occupation began, most libraries were closed; in Kraków, about 80% of the libraries were closed immediately, while the remainder saw <b>their</b> <b>collections</b> decimated by censors. The occupying powers destroyed Polish book collections, including the Sejm and Senate Library, the Przedziecki Estate Library, the Zamoyski Estate Library, the Central Military Library, and the Rapperswil Collection. In 1941, the last remaining Polish public library in the German-occupied territories was closed in Warsaw. During the war, Warsaw libraries lost about a million volumes, or 30% of <b>their</b> <b>collections.</b> More than 80% of these losses were the direct result of purges rather than wartime conflict. Overall, it is estimated that about 10million volumes from state-owned libraries and institutions perished during the war.|$|E
5|$|Since January 1943 an {{agreement}} {{existed between the}} Whitney Museum of American Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art on a coalition which would culminate in the combining of <b>their</b> <b>collections</b> of American art in a new building, paid for from the endowment of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. By this unwritten agreement, the Whitney acquired American art while the Metropolitan concentrated their acquisitions on what they termed classic art.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in September 1945, Lieutenant-Colonel G. Archey of the British Military Administration {{took over}} Directorship of the Library and museum on 6 September.

Compared to other libraries in Malaya which lost nearly half of <b>their</b> <b>collections,</b> only some 500 reference books were looted according to a stocktake done after the war.|$|E

As such, the Clarks began looking at sites in rural New York and Massachusetts with the intention of founding a museum for their art.|$|R

5|$|Botany {{originated}} in prehistory as herbalism with {{the efforts of}} early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, {{making it one of}} the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe <b>their</b> <b>collections</b> were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.|$|E
5|$|The Institution grew slowly until 1964 when Sidney Dillon Ripley became secretary. Ripley {{managed to}} expand the {{institution}} by eight museums and increased admission from 10.8 million to 30 million people a year. This period included the greatest and most rapid growth for the Smithsonian, and it continued until Ripley's resignation in 1984. Since {{the completion of the}} Arts and Industries Building, the Smithsonian has expanded to twenty separate museums with roughly 137 million objects in <b>their</b> <b>collections,</b> including works of art, natural specimens, and cultural artifacts. The Smithsonian museums are visited by over 25 million people every year.|$|E
5|$|Delahaye {{was one of}} many gardener-botanists {{employed}} on European colonial voyages {{of scientific}} exploration in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Their duty was to assist with the collection, transport, cultivation and distribution of economic plants. They worked with the naturalists on these expeditions, but gave particular assistance to the botanists by collecting live plants and seed, as well as plant specimens for herbarium collections. They often maintained journals and records of <b>their</b> <b>collections</b> and made observations on the vegetation encountered during the voyage. On this particular expedition, Delahaye assisted the naturalist and botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardière—who accumulated one of the largest herbarium collections of that era and published what was, in effect, the first Flora of Australia based on the collections he made on the New Holland (Australian) leg of the expedition. Delahaye also made numerous botanical collections of his own.|$|E

Bellamy {{incorporated}} them into a cottage he was building at Plymstock. Captain Maitland bought part of her figurehead {{and some of her}} stern ornaments, later depositing them in the collections of what eventually became the Royal Naval Museum. The National Maritime Museum holds several relics relating to Bellerophon and the people connected with her, including Captain John Cooke's dirk, sword and pistol, and a trophy presented to Admiral Pasley by Lloyd's of London. <b>Their</b> <b>collections</b> also contain artefacts relating to her connection with Napoleon, including the couch from Maitland's cabin, and the skull of a goat which supplied milk for Napoleon and his suite.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, Ashmole {{received}} a Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Oxford. He maintained his {{links with the}} University and, in 1677, Ashmole made a gift of the Tradescant Collection, together with material he had collected independently, to the University {{on the condition that}} a suitable home be built to house the materials and make them available to the public. Ashmole had already moved into the house adjacent to the Tradescants' property in 1674 and had already removed some items from their house into his. In 1678, in the midst of further legal wrangling over the Tradescant Collection, Hester was found drowned in a garden pond. By early 1679, Ashmole had taken over the lease of the Tradescant property and began merging his and <b>their</b> <b>collections</b> into one. The Ashmolean Museum was completed in 1683, and is considered by some to be the first truly public museum in Europe. According to Anthony Wood, the collection filled twelve wagons when it was transferred to Oxford. It would have been more, but a large part of Ashmole's own collection, destined for the museum, including antiquities, books, manuscripts, prints, and 9,000 coins and medals, was destroyed in a disastrous fire in the Middle Temple on 26 January 1679. As a result of the fire, the proportion of the collection derived from the Tradescants was larger than originally anticipated and in the opinion of Professor Michael Hunter this misfortune has contributed to criticisms that Ashmole took an unfair share of the credit in assembling the collection {{at the expense of the}} Tradescants.|$|E
5|$|Meridian {{is served}} by the Meridian-Lauderdale County Public Library, located {{at the corner of}} 7th Street and 26th Avenue. The city {{originally}} had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined <b>their</b> <b>collections,</b> and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African-American library was demolished on May 28, 2008.|$|E
