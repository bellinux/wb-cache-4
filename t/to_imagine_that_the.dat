2500|$|Alter {{noted that}} the idea in [...] “that I am the Lord your God Who takes you {{out from under the}} burdens of Egypt,” is {{emphasized}} repeatedly in the Torah and later books of the Bible. Alter called “the cornerstone of Israelite faith” that God had proven God's divinity and attachment to Israel by liberating the Israelites from Egyptian slavery. Alter reported that some modern scholars, arguing from the absence of Egyptian evidence on any Hebrew slave population or any mention of an exodus, have raised doubts about whether the Hebrews were ever in Egypt. Alter concluded that the story is surely a schematization and simplification of complex historical processes. Alter viewed it quite likely that a sizeable segment of the Hebrew people remained in the high country of eastern Canaan and never went down to Egypt. Yet Alter also found it hard <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Israelites would have invented a story of national origins involving the humiliation of slavery without some kernel of historical memory.|$|E
2500|$|Building on {{the work}} of Heisenberg and others Paul Dirac's theory of {{emission}} and absorption (1927) was the first application of the quantum theory of radiation. Dirac's work was seen as crucially important to the emerging field of quantum mechanics; it dealt directly with the process in which [...] "particles" [...] are actually created: spontaneous emission. Dirac described the quantization of the electromagnetic field as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators with the introduction of the concept of creation and annihilation operators of particles. The theory showed that spontaneous emission depends upon the zero-point energy fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in order to get started. In a process in which a photon is annihilated (absorbed), the photon {{can be thought of as}} making a transition into the vacuum state. Similarly, when a photon is created (emitted), it is occasionally useful <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> photon has made a transition out of the vacuum state.

2500|$|The Flemish {{cartographer}} and geographer Abraham Ortelius {{is believed}} to have been the first person <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> continents were joined together before drifting to their present positions. In the 1596 edition of his Thesaurus Geographicus he wrote: [...] "Unless it be a fable, the island of Gadir or Gades [...] will be the remaining part of the island of Atlantis or America, which was not sunk (as Plato reports in the Timaeus) so much as torn away from Europe and Africa by earthquakes and flood... The traces of the ruptures are shown by the projections of Europe and Africa and the indentations of America in the parts of the coasts of these three said lands that face each other to anyone who, using a map of the world, carefully considered them. So that anyone may say with Strabo in Book 2, that what Plato says of the island of Atlantis on the authority of Solon is not a figment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} partial authenticity rely on the language used in the Testimonium, e.g. that the passage calls Jesus [...] "a wise man" [...] which is not laudatory enough for an interpolator, neither is the reference to [...] "amazing deeds". According to Van Voorst, the statement [...] "those that loved him at the first did not forsake him" [...] has the characteristics of Josephus' writing and points to the continuation of Christianity. Van Voorst states that this sentence argues for the continuation of Christianity based on the love for its leader, not the reported appearances after his death. Van Voorst states that it is hard <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> phrase [...] "receive the truth with pleasure" [...] used in the Testimonium is the work of a Christian interpolator, for Christian writers generally avoid {{the use of the word}} [...] "pleasure" [...] (ἡδονή in Greek) in a positive sense due to its association with hedonism.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 August 2008, George Friedman, US {{military}} analyst, and a CEO of a US-based think-tank Stratfor, {{wrote in}} the institution's report: [...] "There had {{been a great deal}} of shelling by the South Ossetians of Georgian villages for the previous three nights, but while possibly more intense than usual, artillery exchanges were routine. [...] It is very difficult <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Georgians launched their attack against U.S. wishes. The Georgians rely on the United States, and they were in no position to defy it. [...] the United States either was unaware of the existence of Russian forces, or knew of the Russian forces but -- along with the Georgians -- miscalculated Russia's intentions. [...] Putin did not want to re-establish the Soviet Union, but he did want to re-establish the Russian sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union region. [...] He did not want to confront NATO directly, but he did want to confront and defeat a power that was closely aligned with the United States, had U.S. support, aid and advisers and was widely seen as being under American protection. Georgia was the perfect choice. [...] The war in Georgia, therefore, is Russia's public return to great power status. This is not something that just happened — it has been unfolding ever since Putin took power, and with growing intensity in the past five years." ...|$|E
2500|$|The wings {{themselves}} are sometimes {{said to be}} highly modified (tracheal) gills. And {{there is no doubt}} that the tracheal gills of the mayfly nymph in many species look like wings. By comparing a well-developed pair of gill blades in the naiads and a reduced pair of hind wings on the adults, it is not hard <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mayfly gills (tergaliae) and insect wings have a common origin, and newer research also supports this. [...] The tergaliae are not found in any other order of insects, and they have evolved in different directions with time. In some nymphs/naiads the most anterior pair has become sclerotized and works as a gill cover for the rest of the gills. Others can form a large sucker, be used for swimming or modified into other shapes. But it doesn't have to mean that these structures were originally gills. It could also mean that the tergaliae evolved from the same structures which gave rise to the wings, and that flying insects evolved from a wingless terrestrial species with pairs of plates on its body segments: three on the thorax and nine on the abdomen (mayfly nymphs with nine pairs of tergaliae on the abdomen exist, but so far no living or extinct insects with plates on the last two segments have been found). If these were primary gills, it would be a mystery why they should have waited so long to be modified when we see the different modifications in modern mayfly nymphs.|$|E
