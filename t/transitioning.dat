50|$|These {{considerations}} generate {{different sets}} of <b>transitions</b> rules depending on the multipole order and type. The expression forbidden <b>transitions</b> is often used; {{this does not mean}} that these <b>transitions</b> cannot occur, only that they are electric-dipole-forbidden. These <b>transitions</b> are perfectly possible; they merely occur at a lower rate. If the rate for an E1 <b>transition</b> is non-zero, the <b>transition</b> is said to be permitted; if it is zero, then M1, E2, etc. <b>transitions</b> can still produce radiation, albeit with much lower <b>transitions</b> rates. These are the so-called forbidden <b>transitions.</b> The <b>transition</b> rate decreases by a factor of about 1000 from one multipole to the next one, so the lowest multipole <b>transitions</b> are most likely to occur.|$|R

5|$|Operationally, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center speculated whether Bertha was <b>transitioning</b> into a {{subtropical}} cyclone, due to {{its deep}} convection being located, at times, over 200miles (321.8km) from the center. However, the convection progressively returned to the center and by late on July30, Bertha re-intensified into a hurricane as the convection covered the center, about 415miles (667.8km) east of where it first formed. Early on July31, the hurricane briefly attained peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) before weakening and accelerated northeastward as the ridge of high pressure was slowly eroded. Bertha maintained hurricane status as it approached Atlantic Canada, and briefly reached winds of 80mph (129km/h) before weakening and making landfall near Sydney, Nova Scotia on August1 as a 70mph (113km/h) tropical storm. The storm was <b>transitioning</b> into an extratropical cyclone while approaching Atlantic Canada, and lost all tropical characteristics shortly after moving ashore. The weakening extratropical remnants of Bertha turned northward into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and lost its identity shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that neither <b>transition</b> meetings nor other parent outreach methods used by schools are preparing parents {{of students with}} special needs for the roles they face during <b>transition</b> years and after graduation. Although the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act emphasizes the importance of parental participation in the <b>transition</b> process, parents report that they are not knowledgeable about the <b>transition</b> process or options for post school services. Due to the complex needs of individuals with disabilities and intricate post-school agency systems, parental understanding about the <b>transition</b> process and agency systems is particularly important for parents of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Unfortunately, parental knowledge of the <b>transition</b> process and its effect on agency usage and <b>transition</b> outcomes is not well documented. Therefore, the goal {{of this study was to}} understand how parental knowledge of the <b>transition</b> process and human service agencies is related to agency usage and <b>transition</b> outcomes. This study used the Taxonomy for <b>Transition</b> Programming as a guide to develop a questionnaire for parents of children with an intellectual disability who had graduated from a Texas high school. The survey examined parent?s views about <b>transition</b> experiences, agency experiences, <b>transition</b> outcomes, and opinions about the <b>transition</b> process. It was hypothesized that family knowledge about <b>transition</b> and human service agencies that was developed within the <b>transition</b> process would be positively related to agency usage, <b>transition</b> outcomes, and parental opinions about the <b>transition</b> process. In addition, it was hypothesized that agency usage would be positively related to <b>transition</b> outcomes. The results of regression analyses failed to find either statistically significant relationships or noteworthy effect sizes for any component of the <b>transition</b> process with agency usage or <b>transition</b> outcomes. In addition, agency usage did not predict <b>transition</b> outcomes. On the other hand, statistically significant results and noteworthy effect sizes were found for the relationship between the family knowledge of the <b>transition</b> process and parental opinions about the <b>transition</b> process.

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} further {{development}} of smooth <b>transition</b> regression models and their applications in finance. Smooth <b>transition</b> regression models are used to model nonlinearity of regime-switching type in empirical applications. Usually, smooth <b>transition</b> regression models are used with univariate <b>transition</b> functions, that is, a single <b>transition</b> variable is supposed to govern the <b>transition</b> between regimes. With multivariate <b>transition</b> functions, the <b>transition</b> between regimes can be driven {{by more than one}} variable, each weighted by its estimated impact on the <b>transition</b> process. The first paper of the thesis transfers the use of multivariate <b>transition</b> functions to the panel smooth <b>transition</b> regression model and uses oil price forecast as an empirical application. Another commonly found restriction is that smooth <b>transition</b> regression models are applied with a single homogeneous <b>transition</b> function. If a model with more than one regime-switching variable is used, the <b>transition</b> between regimes can be either estimated with a single <b>transition</b> function for all regime-switching variables (homogeneous model) or with different <b>transition</b> functions (heterogeneous model) for each regime-switching variable. The second paper of the thesis proposes the use of panel smooth <b>transition</b> regression models with heterogeneous and multivariate <b>transition</b> functions. Credit default swap pricing is used as an empirical application. The previously introduced generalization of the smooth <b>transition</b> regression framework with heterogeneous <b>transition</b> functions increases the flexibility of the model. Using the heterogeneous model instead of the homogeneous one is the cautionary choice, because estimating the homogeneous model when a heterogeneous specification is appropriate generally leads to biased parameters. Therefore, the third paper of the thesis proposes a test for the decision between homogeneous and heterogeneous <b>transition</b> functions. Empirical size and power of the test are examined by a Monte-Carlo simulation...|$|R
