40|$|This {{paper is}} based on an {{investigation}} into the performance of cold-formed C-channels stiffened with cover plates and subjected to pure bending and primarily shear condition tests. Cover plates with three different thicknesses (1. 6, 2 and 2. 4 mm) were installed at <b>top</b> <b>flanges</b> only as it would be the predicted location for local and distortional buckling. The local and distortional buckling capacities were evaluated via Direct Strength Method, DSM, in accordance with AISI 2007. The accuracy of the interaction equation between the required flexural strength, M, and the required shear strength, V, prescribed by AISI 2007 was also investigated in this paper. A nonlinear finite element model was developed and verified against the test results in terms of maximum strength and buckling failure modes. The results explicitly showed that by attaching the cover plate on <b>top</b> <b>flanges,</b> the non-dimensional slenderness decreased resulted in improved buckling capacities, where the nominal flexural moment of sections, Mn, were close to the plastic moment, MP. Besides, it was concluded that the interaction equation between M and V predicted by AISI was conservative for sections with small non-dimensional slenderness values...|$|R
50|$|The next {{development}} {{retained the}} semicircular <b>top</b> <b>flange,</b> but the side gussets were now abandoned altogether {{as it was}} considered that {{the depth of the}} flange, even if not supported by another plate, would be stiff enough. This also allowed better access to the inside, for painting. Intermittent cross diaphrams were placed across the flange, to maintain its position relative to the main web and avoid distortion by rocking sideways.|$|E
50|$|The {{stiffening}} elements can serve several functions simultaneously. They enhance the bending {{resistance of the}} plate {{to allow it to}} carry local wheel loads and distribute those loads to main girders. They also increase the total cross-sectional area of steel in the plate, which can increase its contribution to the overall bending capacity of the deck (i.e. the deck plate acts as a <b>top</b> <b>flange</b> in a box or I beam girder). Finally, the stiffeners increase the resistance of the plate to buckling.|$|E
50|$|The towpath {{is mounted}} above the water, with the inner edge carried on {{cast-iron}} pillars in the trough. This arrangement allows the water {{displaced by the}} passage of a narrow boat to flow easily under the towpath and around the boat, enabling relatively free passage. Pedestrians, and the horses once used for towing, are protected from falling from the aqueduct by railings on the outside edge of the towpath, but the holes in the <b>top</b> <b>flange</b> of {{the other side of the}} trough, capable of mounting railings, were never used. The trough sides rise only about 6 in above the water level, less than the depth of freeboard of an empty narrow boat, so the helmsman of the boat has no visual protection from the impression of being at the edge of an abyss. The trough of the Cosgrove aqueduct has a similar structure, although it rests on trestles rather than iron arches. It is also less impressively high.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation was}} made to study the shear transfer between precast prestressed beams and in-situ concrete in a relatively new method of construction of continuous bridge decks where the ends of precast beams are connected to an integral in-situ crosshead away from the supports. Two series of tests were carried out. In the first series 1 / 3 scale models of the M. o. T, C&CA M- 8 sections were used, and these were modified in the second series to study {{the effect of the}} beam's <b>top</b> <b>flanges</b> within the connection. One of the most important mechanisms of shear transfer proved to be the <b>top</b> <b>flanges</b> of the precast beam. For the precast beams with <b>top</b> <b>flanges</b> (first series), and with a 300 mm beam embedment length, it was discovered that: a) The shear force is transferred from a small length {{at the end of the}} beam. b) The in-situ concrete nibs (concrete surrounding the web) can take this shear force without stirrups. c) There is no need either to project all the bars from the precast into the in-situ concrete or to prestress the connection transversely as a means of improving shear transfer. d) It was possible to transfer the whole shear force at the connection with a reduced embedment length of 100 mm with nib stirrups. For the precast beam without <b>top</b> <b>flanges,</b> the transfer of the shear force at the connection required other improving details. In this respect transverse prestressing and web shear connectors were utilized effectively. The effect of projecting bars was also examined. In the general behaviour of composite continuous beams subjected to shear a detailed comparison was made between different Code predictions for the web cracking shear and web crushing strength. A mathematical model is also proposed to predict the stirrup stress according to shear span, effective depth and stirrup ratio when failure is controlled by web crushing. Stirrup stress measurement in the vicinity of continuous support made it possible to predict the enhanced shear strength and a design method is proposed for the continuous beams. A comparion is also made between different Code predictions in this respect. To obtain more information about the strength of web shear connectors used in the secod series, a separate dowel shear specimen was designed. Different interface conditions including bond, dowel bar size and strength and the effect of shrinkage were examined. A design method is proposed together with a comparison with different Code predictions...|$|R
40|$|Researchers at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada, {{and at the}} Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) have {{successfully}} enhanced the strength of deck slabs by further exploiting their arching action. With the help of tests on both large- and small-scale laboratory models, they have concluded that a deck slab supported by parallel longitudinal beams does not required any reinforcement, provided that the slab is suitably confined in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. In the longitudinal direction, the deck slab is confined by making it composite with the beams, and by edge beams with suitably high flexural rigidity in {{the plane of the}} slab. In the transverse direction, the confinement is provided by ensuring that the supports of the slab, i. e. the <b>top</b> <b>flanges</b> of the girders, are restrained effectively against relative lateral movement; such confinement can be provided, for example, by welding steel straps to the <b>top</b> <b>flanges</b> of the girders. The practice of patenting 'innovative concepts' in the field of structural engineering is not new. In the same tradition, the concepts of cast-in-place and precast steel-free deck slabs are protected through patents.

The bridge is a three-span {{cantilever}} with two anchor arms, two cantilever arms and a suspended section. It includes a combination of concrete and steel box girders. The bridge was designed by Homer M. Hadley, a consulting engineer from Washington State.The anchor arms and cantilever arms are multiple box, two-cell reinforced concrete box girders. The suspended section consists of two spread, welded steel box girders with reinforced concrete deck.

30|$|The use of high {{strength}} concrete (HSC, i.e. concrete compressive strength f_c^' > 55 MPa) has gained wide acceptance in the PC industry. Standardization {{in the design}} and manufacturing of the precast bridges has been optimized. Bridge superstructure elements such as the PC I-beams, double tee and box beams are generally plant-produced precast and PC products inheriting the advantages of durability, economy, low maintenance and assured quality. The most commonly used precast/PC beam for short-to-medium-spans is the I-beam. An I-beam consists of a top and a bottom flanges with a slender web joining the flanges. The bottom flange and some portion of the web-bottom are reinforced with prestressing strands (tendons); thus the bottom and <b>top</b> <b>flanges</b> build up the flexural strength. The web is reinforced with vertical/transverse deformed reinforcing bars (rebars), referred to as stirrups, which contributes towards the shear strength of the beam.|$|R

In order to identify {{the reason for the}} observed cracks, an ongoing investigation under the commision of the bridge owner was started in the spring of 2009. One conclusions so far is that the observed cracks are to 100 % certainty a result of fatigue. FEM-modeling is currently going on {{as a part of a}} master thesis. As the fatigue process is distortional the propagation phase of the observed cracks might slow down or even stop. One task will thus be to determine the stress intensity factor versus crack length relationship in order to model a growing crack.

40|$|Wide flange precast/prestressed {{concrete}} I-girders {{have been}} widely used by several State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) in the last two decades. These girders have many advantages over standard AASHTO I-girders. Their wide and thick bottom flange accommodates a large number of prestressing strands and their wide and thin <b>top</b> <b>flange</b> provides a shorter deck span, reduced girder weight, greater stability in construction, and adequate platform for workers. Despite these advantages, the wide and thin <b>top</b> <b>flange</b> might be disadvantageous when it comes to deck removal, as it is more susceptible to damage. Therefore {{there is a need to}} investigate the impact of deck removal methods on the performance of the supporting wide flange I-girder. In this thesis, two deck removal methods are presented: saw cutting and jack hammering. The two methods were implemented on the Camp Creek Bridge over I- 80 in Lancaster County, NE before demolition due to its functional obsolesces. Different saw cutting and jack hammering techniques were performed for deck removal between girders and on top of girders. Data obtained from using similar techniques on three other projects were collected and analyzed. Two girders from the Camp Creek Bridge were taken to the lab for testing in flexure after applying different levels of deck removals around shear connectors and re-decking. Test results indicated adequate performance of the new composite section even when partial deck removal around shear connectors is applied. Another investigation was conducted to evaluate the effect of <b>top</b> <b>flange</b> width on the performance of bridge I-girders. <b>Top</b> <b>flange</b> was assumed to be longitudinally saw cut and its width is reduced by fifty percent. The effects on geometrical properties, flexural capacity, horizontal shear capacity, and deflection were investigated analytically and experimentally under construction loads and service loads.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the shear strengths of composite plate girders, with centrally placed rectangular web cutouts, is described. A series of tests is conducted on short‐span girders having conventional welded stud shear connectors, connecting the composite concrete slabs to the <b>top</b> <b>flanges</b> of the plate girders. These tests indicated {{that it is the}} tensile or pullout capacity of the connectors that is primarily responsible for sustaining the composite action under predominantly shear loading. Subsequently, a further series of tests is conducted on short‐span girders with bolted tension connectors, designed to offer negligible resistance to horizontal shear forces at the interfaces between the concrete slabs and plate girders, which confirmed the previous conclusion. Both series of tests indicate that if adequate connectors are provided between a plate girder and a composite concrete slab, the shear strength of the composite girder is significantly higher than that of the plate girder alone. A simple analytical model for predicting the shear strengths of composite plate girders is also presented, which shows satisfactory correlation with the test results. <br /...|$|R

Both seismic loads and gravity loads have effect on <b>top</b> beam <b>flange</b> fractures. The objective was to quantify the variation of stress intensity factor to weld root flaw sizes {{on top of the}} beam flange at column face in steel frame connections under gravity loads. Finite-element analyses were used to study fracture toughness in welded beam-column connections. Investigations of fracture behavior mainly focused on the standard pre-Northridge connection geometry. Finite element analysis was performed using the ANSYS computer program. Stress intensity factor was calculated through a J-integral approach. The parametric study was conducted to quantify elastic fracture demands as a function of beam geometries. Results show that the distributions of stress intensity factor tend to be even across the flange width under gravity loads. The thickness of beam web has little effect on stress intensity factors. Stress intensity factor increases nearly linear with the increase of flaw size, and it increases with the increase of depth of beam and width of beam.

40|$|A {{new steel}} girder bridge system was {{developed}} at the University of Nebraska. The innovative girder design is a box girder folded from a single steel plate that has a trapezoid shape with an opening on the bottom. The girder has application in short span bridges and accelerated construction situations. The structural performance of the girder requires investigation in all stages of a bridge’s lifecycle. This thesis contains descriptions and results from the first two tests {{from a series of}} tests developed to evaluate this new girder shape. The objective of these two tests was to investigate the constructability of the girders. During construction a bridge is in its least stable condition and {{it is important that the}} bridge components exhibit both adequate strength and stability during this critical stage. To this end, two girders were tested in flexure over a simple span as a non-composite beam simulating the loading the girders would be subjected to during construction. The results of the two tests indicate that the folded girder as a whole, and its components, provide adequate strength and stability at construction load levels. Failure occurred at loads that were above normal construction load levels and resulted in a ductile failure mode, which is a well documented benefit of steel components. The girders remained stable through all phases of loading including failure. The <b>top</b> <b>flange</b> was the weakest component of the beam during construction due to its role as a compression element that has a slender and un-braced form. The compression in the <b>top</b> <b>flange</b> caused local buckling in the <b>top</b> <b>flange</b> even at elastic load levels. This was the cause for loss of stiffness and failure in both specimens. Incorporation of a ridge at the center of the <b>top</b> <b>flange</b> of specimens, results of which are not reported in this thesis, proved to resolve this very early buckling issue...|$|E

Test of two {{specimens}} (four different joints) {{of steel}} secondary beam embedded in reinforced concrete girder in frame structure and one specimen with steel cantilever beam embedded in reinforced concrete girder under static load were conducted.

Shear failure of the concrete beam and the <b>top</b> <b>flange</b> pullout failure are the most hazardous failure modes. Lacking restraint of concrete and the reinforcement of steel bar in the concrete slab and catenary action of restraint steel beam, the capacity of steel cantilever beam is much smaller than other beams.

In this paper, monotonic and reversed cyclic loading tests were conducted on three full-scale specimens of this innovative joint, to investigate its load-bearing capacity, energy-dissipating capacity and failure modes. The results indicate that the joint has high load-bearing capacity and great ductility. The failure mode is due to the slippage of flange bolts as well as the gap development between the two flange plates. The experimental studies enabled improvement of the design of the connection to be used in moment-resisting steel frame structures.

30|$|Two {{types of}} {{elements}} {{were chosen to}} analyze the PSFC beams. The prestressing loads exerting on the beam were treated as external forces. These loads are the total prestressing forces after losses. The <b>top</b> and bottom <b>flanges</b> of the PSFC beams were represented by NonlinearBeamColumn elements and the web of the beams were modeled as PCPlaneStress quadrilateral elements.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} Warix flange {{which is}} the same as a York flange but the shower output is on the <b>top</b> of the <b>flange</b> and the vent on the side. The York and Warix flange have female {{adapters}} so that they fit onto a male tank, whereas the Surrey flange connects to a female tank.|$|R
