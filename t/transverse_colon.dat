40|$|Background The role of {{laparoscopic surgery}} in man-agement of <b>transverse</b> and {{descending}} <b>colon</b> cancer remains controversial. The {{aim of the}} present study is to investigate the short-term and oncologic long-term out-comes associated with laparoscopic surgery for <b>transverse</b> and descending <b>colon</b> cancer. Methods This cohort study analyzed 245 patients (stage II disease, n = 70; stage III disease, n = 63) who underwent resection of <b>transverse</b> and descending <b>colon</b> cancers, including 200 laparoscopic surgeries (LAC) and 45 con-ventional open surgeries (OC) from December 1996 to December 2010. Short-term and oncologic long-term out-comes were recorded. Results The operative time was longer in the LAC group than in the OC group. However, intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower and postoperative recovery time was significantly shorter in the LAC group than in the OC group. The 5 -year overall and disease-free survival rates for patients with stage II were 84. 9 % and 84. 9 % in the OC group and 93. 7 % and 90. 0 % in the LAC group, respec-tively. The 5 -year overall and disease-free survival rates for patients with stage III disease were 63. 4 % and 54. 6 % in the OC group and 66. 7 % and 56. 9 % in the LAC group, respectively.

40|$|The {{role of the}} lumbar {{sympathetic}} nerves and supraspinal mechanism in the defecation reflex was investigated in 30 adult cats and 6 kittens. One or two propulsive contractions, whose mean pressure evoked was more than about 90 cmH 2 O (adult cats) and 50 cmH 2 O (kittens), were induced in the rectum of all animals by rectal distension. These propulsive contractions could be generated at the descending and the <b>transverse</b> <b>colons.</b> The removal of the supraspinal influence by spinal transection at T 13 or removal of pelvic afferents to the supraspinal center by spinal transection at L abolished the propulsive contractions. Successive lumbar sympathectomy restored the contractions. Lumbar sympathectomy and the successive removal of the supraspinal influence {{did not affect the}} propulsive contractions. In both cases, the final exclusion of the sacral segments by pithing of the spinal cord abolished the propulsive contractions. These results suggest that the sacral excitatory reflex mediated via pelvic nerves and the lumbar inhibitory reflex mediated via {{lumbar sympathetic}} nerves can function during rectal distension in spinal cats and that the lumbar inhibitory reflex is suppressed by the supraspinal sympathetic inhibitory reflex activated by pelvic afferents in intact cats, as in guinea pigs, resulting in propulsive contractions. </p...|$|R
25|$|The abdomen may {{be divided}} into four quadrants, more {{commonly}} used in medicine, subdivides the cavity with one horizontal and one vertical line that intersect at the patient’s umbilicus (navel). The right upper quadrant (RUQ) includes the lower right ribs, {{right side of the}} liver, and right side of the <b>transverse</b> <b>colon.</b> The left upper quadrant (LUQ) includes the lower left ribs, stomach, spleen, and upper left area of the <b>transverse</b> <b>colon.</b> The right lower quadrant (RLQ) includes the right half of the small intestines, ascending colon, right pelvic bone and upper right area of the bladder. The left lower quadrant (LLQ) contains the left half of the small intestine and left pelvic bone.|$|E
25|$|The {{ascending}} colon {{is the first}} of four sections of the large intestine. It is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum.

25|$|A human colon is {{considered}} abnormally enlarged {{if it has}} a diameter greater than 12cm in the cecum (it is usually less than 9cm), greater than 6.5cm in the rectosigmoid region and greater than 8cm for the ascending colon.

25|$|Intraperitoneal {{parts of}} the GI tract are covered with serosa.

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material and recycle it. As the waste material exits the small intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum {{and then to the}} ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. The unwanted waste material is moved upwards toward the <b>transverse</b> <b>colon</b> by the action of peristalsis.|$|E
40|$|Oncologic laparoscopic {{colectomy}} {{represents a}} fully validated surgical {{approach to the}} management of colorectal cancer. However, laparoscopic surgery for distal <b>transverse</b> and descending <b>colon</b> lesions remains a challenging procedure. A total laparoscopic approach to the left colectomy is an interesting option for critically ill patients although reports {{in the literature on}} this subject are scarce and its approach still not standardized because of its selective nature for indication. There are several advantages associated with conduction of totally laparoscopic approach to the left colon. Intracorporeal vessel sealing ensures an adequate lymph node dissection. Moreover, it enables the construction of a well-vascularized anastomosis. Ultimately, the occurrence of late wound complications are possibly reduced for the placement of a low abdominal incision exclusively used for specimen extraction. This paper aimed at describing our technique for a totally laparoscopic left colectomy for distal <b>transverse</b> and descending <b>colon</b> lesions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular {{responses}} to cold stimulation are well characterised. It is unclear, however, whether cold pain stimulates responses in colonic tone in the transverse and sigmoid regions. AIMS: To assess {{the effects of}} cold stimulation on tone nd motility in the <b>transverse</b> and sigmoid <b>colon</b> and on cardiovascular autonomic activity. METHODS: Phasic and tonic motility of the <b>transverse</b> and sigmoid <b>colon,</b> pulse rate, and beat to beat pulse variability (which are measures of centrally mediated changes in autonomic function) were measured before, during, and after a standard cold pressor test in 22 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Cold pain induced {{a significant increase in}} colonic tone but not phasic contractility in the transverse and sigmoid regions. Simultaneously, cold pain increased pulse interval variability. CONCLUSION: The findings are consistent with the hypotheses that cold pain produces coactivation of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic limbs of the autonomic nervous system and that cold induced changes in colonic tone are temporally associated with alterations in central autonomic nervous activity...|$|R

25|$|The {{mesentery}} becomes {{attached to}} the colon at the gastrointestinal margin and continues as the several mesenteries of the mesocolon, sometimes collectively called the mesenteric organ. The parts of the mesocolon take their names from {{the part of the}} colon to which they attach. These are the transverse mesocolon attaching to the <b>transverse</b> <b>colon,</b> the sigmoid mesocolon attaching to the sigmoid colon, the mesoappendix attaching to the appendix, and the mesorectum attaching to the upper third of the rectum.|$|E
25|$|The {{parts of}} the colon are either {{intraperitoneal}} or behind it in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs in general {{do not have a}} complete covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. Intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. Of the colon, the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, <b>transverse</b> <b>colon</b> and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{mesentery}} of {{the small}} intestine arises from {{the root of the}} mesentery (or mesenteric root) and is the part connected with the structures in front of the vertebral column. The root is narrow, about 15cm long, 20cm in width, and is directed obliquely from the duodenojejunal flexure at {{the left side of the}} second lumbar vertebra to the right sacroiliac articulation. The root of the mesentery extends from the duodenojejunal flexure to the ileocaecal junction. This section {{of the small}} intestine is located centrally in the abdominal cavity and lies behind the <b>transverse</b> <b>colon</b> and the greater omentum.|$|E
40|$|Colonoscopy {{tends to}} be more {{difficult}} to perform in women. Women also experience more pain during flexible sigmoidoscopy, and the mean insertion distance of the instrument is less than in men. The ‘Bladen system’, first described in 1993, is a non-radiological method of continuously visualising the path of the endoscope using magnetic drive coils under the patient and a chain of sensors up the biopsy channel of the instrument. In 1998, results were published that used a novel computer graphics system (the ‘RMR system’), in which a much more realistic endoscope could be produced using the stored positional data from the Bladen system. The RMR computer graphics system has been further refined to enable measurement of the anatomical lengths of different parts of the large intestine to an accuracy of greater than 5 mm. The system is used to analyse the results obtained in 232 patients undergoing a total colonoscopy. In women, the colonoscope tends to form loops in the sigmoid colon more readily than in men (p< 0. 05). When the first 50 cm of the endoscope are inserted for the first time, the tip passes either up to or beyond the splenic flexure in 40 / 116, or 34. 5 %, of males, compared with 24 / 117, or 20. 5 %, of females (p= 0. 0137). It is demonstrated that women have longer <b>transverse</b> <b>colons</b> than men, and the differences are especially apparent when a stiffening tube is used to splint {{the left side of the}} colon (p< 0. 0001). The possible relevance of these observations to biomedical engineers and those manufacturing and assessing prototype endoscopes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Double primary {{malignancies}} {{associated with}} colon cancer {{in patients with}} situs inversus totalis: two case reports Young Wan Kim, Hoon Ryu, Dae Sung Kim and Ik Yong Kim * Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is not itself a premalignant condition, however, rare synchronous or metachronous multiple primary malignancies have been reported.

30|$|Per polyp detected, {{the readers}} {{annotated}} the segmental location, the size, the attenuation, the slice numbers per acquisition, {{and the distance}} to the anal margin of the polyp in a case record form including an image of the polyp. Colorectal polyps ≥ 6  mm were reported and classified in two size categories (≥ 6  mm and ≥ 10  mm). Tumours were included in the calculations and analysed as polyps but were described separately as well. The C-RADs classification was used [18]. To be included in the study all six segments (caecum, ascending, <b>transverse,</b> descending <b>colon,</b> sigmoid, and rectum) needed to be distended and without obscured fluid and fecal residue in either supine or prone position. Segmental unblinding was not used in the study.|$|R
25|$|Interposed {{between the}} hepatic and splenic flexures, the greater omentum adheres to the <b>{{transverse}}</b> <b>colon</b> along a further band or fold of peritoneum. Dissection through this allows {{access to the}} cephalad (top) surface of the transverse mesocolon. Focal adhesions frequently tether the greater omentum to the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. The left colon {{is associated with a}} similar anatomic configuration of peritoneal folds; the splenic peritoneal fold is contiguous with the left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold at the splenic flexure. Division of the latter similarly allows for the separation of the left colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and frees it from the retroperitoneum. The left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold continues distally at the lateral aspect of the mobile component of the mesosigmoid.|$|E
25|$|The {{rationalization}} of mesenteric and peritoneal fold anatomy {{permits the}} surgeon to differentiate both from intraperitoneal adhesions—also called congenital adhesions. These are highly variable among patients and occur in several locations. Congenital adhesions occur between the lateral {{aspect of the}} peritoneum overlying the mobile component of the mesosigmoid, and the parietal peritoneum in the left iliac fossa. During lateral to medial approach of mobilizing of the mesosigmoid, these must be divided first before the peritoneum proper can be accessed. Similarly, focal adhesions occur between the undersurface of the greater omentum and the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. These can be accessed after dividing the peritoneal fold that links the greater omentum and <b>transverse</b> <b>colon.</b> Adhesions here must be divided to separate the greater omentum off the transverse mesocolon, thus allowing access to the lesser sac proper.|$|E
25|$|The {{primitive}} gut {{is suspended}} from the posterior abdominal wall by the dorsal mesentery. The gastrointestinal tract and associated dorsal mesentery are subdivided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut regions based on the respective blood supply. The foregut is supplied by the celiac trunk, the midgut is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the hindgut is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). This division is established by the fourth week of development. After this, the midgut undergoes a period of rapid elongation, forcing it to herniate through the navel. During herniation, the midgut rotates 90° anti-clockwise around the axis of the SMA and forms the midgut loop. The cranial portion of the loop moves {{to the right and}} the caudal portion of the loop moves toward the left. This rotation occurs at about the eighth week of development. The cranial portion of the loop will develop into the jejunum, while most of the ileum and the caudal part of the loop eventually form the terminal portion of the ileum, the ascending colon and the initial two-thirds of the <b>transverse</b> <b>colon.</b> As the foetus grows larger, the mid-gut loop is drawn back through the umbilicus and undergoes a further 180° rotation, completing a total of 270° rotation. At this point, about 10 weeks, the caecum lies close to the liver. From here it moves in a cranial to caudal direction to eventually lie in the lower right portion of the abdominal cavity. This process brings the ascending colon to lie vertically in the lateral right portion of the abdominal cavity apposed to the posterior abdominal wall. The descending colon occupies a similar position on the left side.|$|E
30|$|The primary area {{of concern}} for an ileocolic {{intussusception}} is the ascending colon found in the right lateral abdomen. This is imaged in transverse and sagittal planes from the hepatic flexure down {{to the area of}} the ileocecal valve in the right lower quadrant. A normal appearing ileocecal valve rules out an ileocecal intussusception. When normal appearing colonic anatomy is not found, a further search along the path of the <b>transverse</b> and descending <b>colon</b> may be undertaken.|$|R
