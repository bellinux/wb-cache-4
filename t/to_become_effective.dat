5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective.</b> In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{modern day}} {{territorial}} government has matured in Yellowknife <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective</b> and responsible. The government in Yellowknife had largely gained back its powers {{on par with}} the pre-1905 government that was dissolved during creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The civil service has been effectively consolidated into the city of Yellowknife; and has gained control over administering its own elections from Elections Canada. Education is now {{under the jurisdiction of}} the territorial government and the territory has most powers afforded to the rest of the provinces. There has even talk by the Federal government of the territories gaining provincial status in the future.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective.</b> The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
5|$|With Goebel dead, {{tensions}} {{began to}} ease. The idea of Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, as governor was more palatable {{to much of}} the opposition than civil war in the state, though many of them may have preferred war to a Goebel governorship. After a lengthy meeting, a bipartisan compromise was drafted which would have ended the matter. The terms called for Republican recognition of Goebel's rightful election (and Beckham's subsequent right to govern). Republicans would also remove the militia from Frankfort. Democrats would, in turn, extend immunity to any Republican official found to have ties to the assassination, stop contesting elections for other state offices, and work to pass a nonpartisan election reform bill. The agreement needed only Taylor's signature <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective.</b> Unwilling to relinquish his office, Taylor balked.|$|E

The Carlingford Line, which opened on 20 April 1896 {{as a private}} railway, then as a public line on 1 August 1901, is a mostly single-track line. There is currently only one service {{in the early morning}} which connects to the city directly, at other times a train-change at Clyde, is necessary to reach other stations, and consequently the service has a low patronage, though it is quite popular during peak hours. As part of the CityRail Clearways Project, a passing loop was promised to the Carlingford Line with two services per hour all day <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective</b> in 2010.

25|$|PD {{damages the}} eyes, lungs, throat and nasal membranes. PD {{immediately}} affects {{the eyes and}} blindness can result, though it requires high doses. It also induces nausea and vomiting, an inhalation of as little as 5-50 milligrams can induce severe vomiting. Long-term exposure to PD can cause systemic damage by replacing calcium with arsenic, extensive bone marrow damage can also result. Due to PD being easily recognized {{in the field and}} a relatively fast rate for decontamination procedures <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective,</b> the chemical is not as useful as other blister agents. The blistering resultant from PD exposure may also be delayed, for as little as 30 minutes, or as long as 32 hours depending upon the concentration of the dose.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, the Clan Line and the Union-Castle Line, the two {{shipping}} lines {{controlled by}} the Cayzers, joined with the King Line and Bullard King & Co to form British & Commonwealth Shipping. During that time, the War Office invited new tenders for trooping flight contracts to Europe and the Far East, {{as a consequence of}} the Government's growing dissatisfaction with the operational performance and high costs of the ageing Hermes fleet that was contracted from Airwork, Britavia and Skyways to operate most of these flights. The War Office specified exclusive use of state-of-the-art Bristol Britannia turboprops on the Far Eastern route as it had calculated that this would save the Government Â£1.75m each year compared with continuing use of the Hermes. The War Office offered the successful bidder the option of purchasing three new Britannias from the Government as part of a five-year contract or the alternative to lease these planes under a three-year contract. The contracts were <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective</b> from 1958. Hunting-Clan, which already had two Britannias on order, won against competition from Air Charter and Airwork.|$|E

25|$|By late-1956, Freeman was {{planning}} to shift Transair's operating base and headquarters from Croydon to Gatwick and to replace some of the ageing Dakotas with three brand-new, state-of-the-art Vickers Viscount 800 series turboprops. He was also planning {{to build a new}} hangar at Gatwick for Â£300,000. Although he had Â£500,000 in retained profits, he needed a further Â£1m for the planned investment. Freeman's search for finance led to an offer from Airwork to buy him out. Airwork also offered to leave him in control of Transair and to give him a seat on the board of Airwork's holding company. Freeman's accepted Airwork's offer and Transair became an Airwork subsidiary the following year. During that time, the War Office invited new tenders for trooping flight contracts to Europe and the Far East, {{as a consequence of the}} Government's growing dissatisfaction with the operational performance and high costs of the ageing Handley Page Hermes fleet that was contracted from Airwork, Britavia and Skyways to operate most of these flights. The War Office awarded Transair the European contract, which was to be operated with the new Viscounts the airline had on order. The contract was <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective</b> from 1958.|$|E
25|$|In Islam, a {{woman may}} only divorce her husband under certain conditions. These are many and include neglect, not being {{supported}} financially, the husband's impotence, apostasy, madness, dangerous illness {{or some other}} defect in the marriage. Divorce by mutual consent has only to be agreed upon by both parties <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective.</b> If a Muslim woman wishes to divorce her husband she has two options under Sharia law: seek a tafriq, or seek a khul. A tafriq is a divorce for certain allowable reasons. This divorce is granted by a qadi, a religious judge, {{in cases where the}} qadi accepts her claims of abuse or abandonment. If a tafriq is denied by the qadi, she cannot divorce. If a tafriq is granted, the marriage is dissolved and the husband is obligated to pay her the deferred mahr in their marriage contract. The second method, by far more common in wife-initiated divorces, khul is a divorce without cause, by mutual consent. This divorce requires a husband's consent and it must be supported by consideration that passes from the wife to the husband. Often, this consideration almost always consists of the wife relinquishing her claim to the deferred mahr. In actual practice and outside of Islamic judicial theory, a woman's right to divorce is often extremely limited compared with that of men in the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 1883, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company {{gained control}} of the Staten Island Railroad and its boats. On the same date, {{at the annual meeting}} of the Staten Island Railroad company, Erasmus Wiman {{gained control of}} the {{railroad}} by being elected to the board of Directors of the Railroad and becoming the railroad's president. At the meeting, Wiman laid out his proposals for rail lines on Staten Island. He proposed extending the old Staten Island Railroad to Hyatt Street in what is today Saint George. From there a line would run through New Brighton, and Snug Harbor along the North Shore of Staten Island. The line would then go toward the interior of the island, going parallel to the Kill Van Kull. Based on the settling of the interior of Staten Island, additional spur lines would have been built. Wiman also proposed a bridge across the Arthur Kill from Tottenville to Perth Amboy, which would have replaced the ferry that operated there. This would have been part of a direct route between New York City and Philadelphia by connections at Perth Amboy and South Amboy, with a new bridge over the Rartian River. In the days before the meeting he had gained 7,450 out of the 11,800 shareholders to elect him, surprising many of the directors of the railroad. By the end of the month, Wiman resigned from the Staten Island Rapid Transit Company in order to avoid any conflict of interest. On June 27, 1883, a meeting of the directors of both companies formally ratified the merger of the two companies under the leadership of Erastus Wiman, who was named president. On June 30, 1883, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company leased the Staten Island Railway for a term of 99 years, <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective</b> when the line opened between Clifton and Tompkinsville.|$|E
