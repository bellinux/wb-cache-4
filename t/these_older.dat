5|$|In a 1983 study, only 5% of {{patients}} who had abruptly stopped taking long-acting benzodiazepines after less than 8 months demonstrated withdrawal symptoms, but 43% {{of those who had}} been taking them for more than 8 months did. With alprazolam– a short-acting benzodiazepine– taken for 8 weeks, 65% {{of patients}} experienced significant rebound anxiety. To some degree, <b>these</b> <b>older</b> benzodiazepines are self-tapering.|$|E

5|$|Nine royal tombs {{were located}} in the {{north-eastern}} quadrant of the Rova grounds. These included the two large tombs of King RadamaI (d.1828) and Queen Rasoherina (d.1868), as well as seven ancient wooden tombs known collectively as the Fitomiandalana. <b>These</b> <b>older</b> tombs, {{the first of which}} was built in 1630 for King Andrianjaka, were a series of seven tomb pits topped with individual wooden trano masina (tomb houses) built close together in a row with their gable peaks aligned, followed by one tomb pit without a tomb house. Tomb houses are particular to highland tombs and are intended to indicate the noble rank of the deceased and house his or her spirit after death.|$|E

40|$|Building {{maintenance}} {{in conservation}} of old buildings {{is one of}} the approaches applied within the built environment of Malaysia. For instance, it is realised that <b>these</b> <b>old</b> buildings contribute an important significance to our nation's priceless heritage and unique historical development. However, most of these buildings' maintenance is influenced by related problems that affect the overall building conservation approach. Therefore, <b>these</b> <b>old</b> buildings face problems which greatly affect their overall condition and performance: building structure; building appearance and aesthetic; building materials and building character. In most critical situations, there is a greater possibility that we could lose the cultural significance and heritage values of <b>these</b> <b>old</b> buildings through ignoring the related problems. This paper tries to identify the related problems, reveal the findings and discuss suitable approaches to conserving <b>these</b> <b>old</b> buildings...|$|R
5|$|Sale's built {{environment}} is varied, {{with a mixture}} of modern and old buildings. Some terraces, semi-detached houses and villas, survive from the Victorian period, although many of the larger houses have been converted into flats. Many semi-detached houses survive from the 1930s, when there was a need for new housing in the town {{as a result of a}} growing population and an increasingly wealthy middle class. Interspersed with <b>these</b> <b>older</b> structures are newer housing developments, such as the estates built in Ashton upon Mersey and the east of Sale during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Book of the Dead {{was part}} of a {{tradition}} of funerary texts which includes the earlier Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, which were painted onto objects, not papyrus. Some of the spells included were drawn from <b>these</b> <b>older</b> works and date to the 3rd millennium BCE. Other spells were composed later in Egyptian history, dating to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 7th centuries BCE). A number of the spells which made up the Book continued to be inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi, as had always been the spells from which they originated. The Book of the Dead was placed in the coffin or burial chamber of the deceased.|$|E

5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that <b>these</b> <b>older</b> trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E
5|$|The Octopus {{system was}} {{launched}} {{after three years}} of trials on 1 September 1997. Three million cards were issued within {{the first three months of}} the system's launch. The quick success of the system was compelled by the fact that MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete, which drove commuters to switch quickly. Another reason was the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997. With the transfer of Hong Kong away from British rule, there was a belief that the older Queen's Head coins in Hong Kong would rise in value, so many people hoarded <b>these</b> <b>older</b> coins and waited for their value to increase.|$|E
5|$|The undulating garland motif {{against a}} black {{background}} {{found in the}} masonry-style mural paintings at Delos were also featured in earlier Greek works of art ranging from vases to 4th-century-BC Macedonian mosaics of Pella, particularly the Stag Hunt Mosaic. However, the painters of Delos arguably invented their own decorative genre {{using a combination of}} <b>these</b> <b>older</b> elements with new naturalistic coloring. Aside from the black background, mosaics like the Stag Hunt Mosaic were also inspired by the illusionist, three-dimensional qualities of Greek paintings. At Delos, paintings and mosaics inherited the same Classical Greek standards of craftsmanship, lighting, shading, and coloring. Sculptors, painters, and mosaic artists may have all been part of the same system of patronage at Delos, which in some instances would have necessitated the importation of foreign artists.|$|E

5|$|The show's {{original}} puzzle {{board had}} three rows of 13 manually operated trilons, {{for a total}} of 39 spaces. On December 21, 1981, a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows (11, 13, 13 and 11 trilons) was adopted. This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed {{at the beginning and end}} of the round. Each trilon had three sides: a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle, a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed, and a side with a letter on it. While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle, with <b>these</b> <b>older</b> boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present, a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was be wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by hand out of sight of the contestants. On February 24, 1997, the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows (12 on the top and bottom rows, 14 in the middle two). To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay, the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it. The computerized board obviated the stop-downs, allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company.|$|E
