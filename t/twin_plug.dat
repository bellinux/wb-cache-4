5000|$|... #Caption: Ford {{flathead}} V-8 with an aftermarket <b>twin</b> <b>plug</b> {{cylinder head}} & Stromberg carburettors ...|$|E
50|$|The car {{never had}} the ‘planned’ V8 fitted and it made do with a dry sump 4-litre version of the well-proven 6-cylinder, with <b>twin</b> <b>plug</b> head. More contentiously, it was also fitted with the weakest link from the older and lower-powered DBR1, its CG537 5-speed transaxle; clearly a big mistake and one {{admitted}} by John Wyer. Visually, and dimensionally, the body {{was the same as}} the DP214's but with bonnet line, only 1.5 inches lower, enabled by the dry sump engine. The car was initially fitted with engine no. 400/215/1.|$|E
5000|$|In 1965 {{the car was}} {{updated with}} new {{fibreglass}} bodywork providing lower drag and reduced weight (620 kg). This new version was also made by Zagato. The new design was called the Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ2. The TZ2 was only built as racing version; it was equipped with an Autodelta-prepared <b>twin</b> <b>plug,</b> dry sump lubrication 1,570 cc straight-4 DOHC engine producing around [...] at 7000 rpm. With this engine the car reached top speed of152 mph. The rear window was also changed, now single unit rather than three part window in TZ. Development of TZ cars was stopped {{in the end of}} 1965, to make room for new GTA racing program. Only 12 TZ2s were built.|$|E
2500|$|... (1917), 275 hp, {{first use}} of <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs,</b> 300 built at Derby.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> {{light the}} lean {{fuel-air}} mixtures {{sent to the}} two-valve combustion chambers.|$|R
50|$|Wankel engines {{have such}} an {{elongated}} combustion chamber that even non-aero wankel engines may adopt dual ignition to promote better combustion, in some cases like the Mazda 787B racing car even triple ignition. The MidWest AE series Wankel aero-engine has <b>twin</b> <b>plugs</b> per chamber, but these are placed side-by-side, not sequentially, so their main purpose is to give redundancy rather than improved combustion.|$|R
5000|$|The T69s {{were used}} {{only on the}} Midland Metro, and were built by the Italian company AnsaldoBreda. Their closest [...] "brothers" [...] were the SL95 running in Oslo, Norway. At 24.36 metres long, the T-69s are the {{shortest}} modern tramcars in Britain. The vehicles are articulated, resting on three bogies, and have low floors over about 60% of the length. The central section of the trams is low floor, with inwards facing seating at the sides, while at each end is a raised seating area, accessible by steps. Each tram has 56 seats, with space for another 100 standing. They are accessible from three 1.25-metre wide entrances on each side, with <b>twin</b> <b>plug</b> doors.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "VT700C" [...] was {{introduced}} in 1984 {{as a direct result}} of increased tariffs placed on Japan's imports. The U.S. raised the import tariffs on engine sizes above [...] So the engine size was reduced from a [...] to [...] to get the bikes into the U.S. Special identifying features of this model are the round head lamp and instrument casings with a chromed front fender. The front wheel bore a dual disc brake system and dual horns mounted on the front. The painted side covers had the [...] "Shadow 700" [...] decal. The engine is a [...] SOHC three-valve Liquid Cooled V-Twin with a six-speed, shaft drive transmission from 1984 to 1987. New hydraulic valve adjusters and <b>twin</b> <b>plug</b> cylinder heads were used. The [...] "VT750C" [...] was available outside of the USA (Canada and Europe) with a larger engine displacement.|$|E
5000|$|The GTA had {{aluminium}} {{outer body}} panels instead of steel, (the inner steel panels were also of thinner gauge, {{the inner and}} outer panels were bonded and pop-riveted together), magnesium alloy wheels, clear plastic side windows, an aluminium rear upper control arm, different door handles and quarter window mechanisms, and lightweight interior trim. The engine had a new double ignition cylinder head (called <b>twin</b> <b>plug,</b> later in the eighties the system was called twin spark) cylinder head with a Marelli distributor from a Ferrari Dino, 45 mm carburetors instead of 40 mm and magnesium camshaft cover, sump, timing cover and bell housing. The transmission gear ratios were closer than standard and the gears were machined for lightness and quicker shifting. Dry weight of the 1600 was approximately 1640 lb. In stradale form this car boasted approximately [...] (up from [...] ). In full race form this engine could produce up to [...] The 1600 GTA did not have a brake booster and had a thicker radiator than the standard vehicle. For homologation 500 cars were made for racing and road use.|$|E
50|$|The '100E' engine used <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> with 2 valves per {{cylinder}} but {{was used}} mainly by a Toyota works team.|$|R
50|$|A dual {{ignition}} system will typically provide that each cylinder has <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs,</b> {{and that the}} engine will {{have at least two}} ignition circuits, such as duplicate magnetos or ignition coils.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Monty in 1969 {{working on}} a Triumph {{cylinder}} head with a <b>twin</b> spark <b>plug</b> conversion using additional, centrally-located, smaller 10 mm plugs, mounted into a bench-vice via a tube screwed {{into one of the}} original 14 mm plug-threads ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{version of}} the <b>twin</b> spark <b>plug</b> method was {{introduced}} on the Nissan Stanza with the CA engine, called NAPS-X, which eventually replaced the NAPS-Z approach. The CA engine implemented a hemispherical cylinder head, an approach used by several auto makers.|$|R
50|$|In late 2002, the {{optional}} ABS system {{was replaced with}} an electrically servo-assisted combined braking system. In addition the engines were equipped with <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> on each cylinder to improve emissions and improve a persistent surging problem that affected many BMW boxer models.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{four-stroke}} air-cooled V-twin {{engine was}} purpose-built to deliver maximum torque at 2,500 rpm in the 55 to 75 mph range used for motorcycle cruising. Set at 48 degrees, the cylinders have a four pushrod valves, <b>twin</b> spark <b>plug</b> cylinder heads, with forged pistons having an Alumite coating to reduce friction and ceramic-composite-coated cylinders.|$|R
2500|$|In 1995, the {{introduction}} of the next generation R-259 or oilhead engine signalled BMW's entry into modern adventure models, with a succession of larger displacement models including the R850GS, R1100GS, R1150GS and the R1200GS. Later models have electronic engine management, ABS braking, <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs,</b> and more power than airhead models, {{due in part to the}} use of four valve heads.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1929, Dr. Ferdinand Porsche joined Steyr from Mercedes. He quickly {{produced}} the 37/100 hp Austria, with a 5.3-liter straight eight, dual magneto ignition, and <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs,</b> four-wheel Lockheed hydraulic brakes, and Steyr's first detachable cylinder head. It also had Steyr's half-elliptic front and swing axle rear suspension. It showed at the Paris Salon and Olympia, the cabriolet offered at ₤1550.|$|R
50|$|Continuous VVT {{was adopted}} {{for the first}} time. Featured on both the intake and exhaust camshafts, each can be varied through a range of 40 degrees. The <b>twin</b> spark <b>plug</b> system was {{replaced}} by a regular single spark plug per cylinder. New electronic coolant flow control has replaced the mechanical thermostat for improved engine warm-up and optimum control of engine temperature. Also tumble flaps are used to improve output at low engine speeds.|$|R
50|$|Each of the engine’s three {{cylinders}} {{has its own}} carburetor, with {{an alternate}} air device to provide carburetor heat. Each cylinder has <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs,</b> the sparks being provided by a dual ignition system using engine-triggered amplifiers and coils, rather than the more common aviation magneto. The ignition circuit redundancy is such that if one circuit should fail, all three cylinders will still run. Even if two circuits fail, the engine will still fire on {{two out of three}} cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|Dual {{ignition}} in aero-engines {{can allow}} the aircraft to continue flying and land safely after an ignition system failure. Operation of aero engines on one magneto (rather than both) typically {{results in an}} rpm drop of around 75 rpm. [...] Its existence on aviation powerplants {{dates back to the}} World War I years, when such engines as the Hispano-Suiza 8 and Mercedes D.III, and even rotary engines as the later Gnome Monosoupape model 9N [...] versions featured <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> per cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The F650GS {{had several}} {{advanced}} technology features for its time, with computer-controlled fuel injection, catalytic converter, a Nikasil-lined cylinder, optional ABS and an airbox designed {{to exploit the}} airflow pattern of the bike when in motion. Combined with the bike's high compression ratio and <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> (from 2004 onwards), excellent fuel economy and low emissions existed alongside high power output. The original F650 single-engine was manufactured for BMW by Austrian company Rotax while the bike was assembled by Aprilia. When the F650GS was launched, the full process was brought back in-house.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, the {{introduction}} of the next generation R-259 or oilhead engine signalled BMW's entry into modern adventure models, with a succession of larger displacement models including the R850GS, R1100GS, R1150GS and the R1200GS. Later models have electronic engine management, ABS braking, <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs,</b> and more power than airhead models, {{due in part to the}} use of four valve heads. The current R1200GS, sometimes referred to as a hexhead because of the revised cylinder head shape, is 30 kg lighter and, with , more powerful than the R1150GS.|$|R
50|$|In {{other ways}} {{the engine was}} {{essentially}} identical to the 601, being a 12-cylinder, inverted-V (with the crankshaft above the cylinders) design. Both used dual Bosch magnetos firing <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> for ignition. Fuel injection was powered by a pump supplying up to 90 bar and the oil system used three pumps with a separate 35-litre oil tank. The supercharger was fairly advanced for the era in that it used a barometrically controlled hydraulic clutch (fluid coupling) which allowed the system to automatically compensate for changes in altitude.|$|R
50|$|Latterly, JAP engines (under Villiers control) {{were used}} in {{motorcycle}} racing, and most commonly speedway or dirt track.Various enthusiasts continued development of the engine into the 70's primarily for grass track, speedway and long track use. Variants included the use of 4 valve heads, <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> and early electronic ignition systems. Some were modified to run as alcohol fuelled engines primarily for speedway use.All the engines were 4 stroke.Use of the engine declined in the 70's as competing engines from Jawa-CZ and GM were developed giving better performance.|$|R
5000|$|Nash's slogan {{from the}} late 1920s and 1930s was [...] "Give the {{customer}} more than he has paid for" [...] and the cars lived up to it. Innovations included a straight-eight engine with overhead valves, <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs,</b> and nine crankshaft bearings in 1930. The 1932 Ambassador Eight had synchromesh transmissions and free wheeling, automatic centralized chassis lubrication, a worm-drive rear end, and its suspension was adjustable inside the car. A long-time proponent of automotive safety, Nash was among the early mid- and low-priced cars to offer four-wheel brakes.|$|R
5000|$|The Ford GAA {{engine is}} an American all-aluminum 32-valve DOHC 60-degree V8 engine {{engineered}} and {{produced by the}} Ford Motor Company just before, and during, World War II. It featured twin Stromberg NA-Y5-G carburetors, dual magnetos and <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> making up a full dual ignition system, and crossflow induction. It displaces 1100 cuin L and puts out well over [...] of torque from idle to 2,200 rpm. The factory-rated output was [...] at 2,600 rpm. In terms of its capacity, the GAA was the largest mass-produced gasoline V8 engine in the world.|$|R
50|$|As in the GTA and GTA 1300 Junior, {{the engine}} {{had a special}} {{cylinder}} head with <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> per cylinder {{in contrast to the}} standard car's single plugs, but this time the head was to a new design having a much smaller included angle between the valves than in previous Alfa engines. The original 1750 engine block was used, and by inserting a monosleeve instead of four individual cylinder liners, the capacity was enlarged from the standard 1779cc to 1985cc and later to 1999cc. The GTAm (1969-1971) could produce up to 240PS (180 kW; 240 hp).|$|R
50|$|All models {{feature the}} four cylinder, all-light-alloy Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine in various cubic {{capacities}} from 1290 cc to 1962 cc, all with two valves per cylinder. All {{versions of this}} engine fitted to the 105 series coupés featured twin carburettors, except for US market 1750 GTV and 2000 GTV cars which were fitted with fuel injection. Competition models featured cylinder heads with <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs.</b> Common to all models was also a 5-speed manual transmission and disc brakes on all four wheels. The rear suspension uses a beam axle with coil springs. Air conditioning and a limited slip rear differential were optional on the later models.|$|R
2500|$|The Junkers L5 was a {{development}} of Junkers' first water-cooled engine, the L2, but at {{four times the}} swept volume was a much more powerful engine. [...] It was a water-cooled upright inline 6-cylinder unit, four-stroke and petrol-fuelled, with a capacity of nearly 23 litres. It adopted some of the L2 features, having twin exhaust and inlet valves in each cylinderdriven by an overhead camshaft, <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> and <b>twin</b> magnetos. [...] The splash component of the L2's lubrication was abandoned in favour of a completely forced recirculating system. [...] The twin carburettors of the L2 were replaced with a single float chamber, dual-venturi model. [...] Like the L2, the L5 was a direct drive engine.|$|R
50|$|This {{direct-drive}} aero-engine {{is unusual}} in two respects: it is very oversquare with a bore:stroke ratio of 1.295:1, {{and it has a}} side-valve valvetrain. The designer determined that since maximum continuous power output (65.3kW) was to be developed at only 2800 rpm, the extra weight and complexity of overhead valves would be superfluous. The resulting engine is compact and lightweight, with a dry weight of 58 kg, and a maximum power-to-weight ratio of 1.09 kW/kg (wet; coolant fluids weigh 5 kg).The engine uses fuel injection, so carburetor heat is unnecessary. Lubrication is by dry sump, with an external oil tank. Dual ignition is used, each cylinder having <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> sited between the valves and the piston crowns.|$|R
5000|$|These {{parts were}} {{assembled}} into two engines under {{the ownership of}} Gordon Chapman and then under Bill Morris, who bought the engine parts and the Kieft chassis after Gordon Chapman's death. One engine was sold by Chapman to the then-owner of Shannon SH1, and this FPE {{is said to be}} in Austria together with Shannon SH1. [...] Another using two of the later type <b>twin</b> spark <b>plug</b> heads in the stock, was run in the original 1954 Kieft-Climax V8 Grand Prix chassis with downdraft Weber 40IDF carburetors when they were finally mated and the construction finished on 21 September 2002 at VSCC Silverstone Meeting, and this car was campaigned in VSCC events for the next 10 years.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{designed}} by chief engineer Hans Mezger {{under the leadership of}} Ferdinand Piëch and Helmuth Bott. The car was built around a very light spaceframe chassis (42 kg) which was permanently pressurised with gas to detect cracks in the welded structure. [...] Power came from a new 4.5-litre air-cooled engine designed by Mezger, which was a combination of 2 of Porsche's 2.25L flat-6 engines used in previous racing cars. The 'Type 912' engine featured a 180° flat-12 cylinder layout, twin overhead camshafts driven from centrally mounted gears and <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> fed from two distributors. The large horizontally mounted cooling fan was also driven from centrally mounted gears. The longitudinally mounted gearbox {{was designed}} to take a set of four or five gears.|$|R
5000|$|The Z-103/4 {{developed}} in the mid/late 1950s (the first prototype was made in 1954) was a much simpler design destined to power {{a new series of}} luxury and sportscars. It had a single central camshaft and 2 valves per cylinder actuated by pushrods. It had hemispherical combustion chambers (like the Z-102 engine) and <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs.</b> It was available with three different cubic capacities as well, 3900 cc (238 CID), 4500 cc (275 CID) and 4700 cc (287 CID). The 3.9 L engine had a twin Weber carburettor and the 4.5 and 4.7 L engines 2 quadruple Weber carbs, which gave the later a power output in excess of [...] The very few engines of this type produced were installed in Z-102 cars.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{engine was}} built in summer 2002 and tested in the autumn. Twin {{butterfly}} valves for each throttle body were used to increase control and allow the ECU to vary the mixture flow and ignition map according to the gear selected and speed. The specification of <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> per cylinder and multi-hole fuel injectors by Mark Jenner (fuelling, ignition and emission design engineer) allowed the Rocket III to meet the Euro IV emissions limits at launch. The torque curve is modified for each gear ratio, enabling over 90% of the engine’s torque output at 2,000 rpm, giving {{the high levels of}} flexibility that the designers needed. The 1,500 W starter motor on the Rocket III puts out as much power as the engine on the very first Triumph motorcycle, Siegfried Bettmann's 1902 [...] single.|$|R
25|$|Supercharging {{was used}} to force the charge into the cylinder, rather than {{crankcase}} compression, as on most two-stroke engines. This allowed {{the use of a}} conventional lubrication system, instead of the total-loss type found in many two-stroke engines. Stratified charge was used: the fuel was injected into a bulb-like extension of the combustion chamber where the <b>twin</b> spark <b>plugs</b> ignited the rich mixture. Operable air-fuel ratios of from 15 to 23:1 were available to govern the power produced between maximum and 60%. The rich mixture maintained near the spark plugs reduced detonation, allowing higher compression ratios or supercharger boost. Supercharger throttling was used as well to achieve idling. The supercharger throttles were novel vortex types, varying the effective angle of attack of the impeller blades from 60 to 30 degrees. This reduced the power required to drive the supercharger when throttled, and hence fuel consumption at cruising power.|$|R
50|$|In September 2007, Bajaj Auto filed a claim accusing {{that the}} {{development}} of TVS Flame was in violation of their patent for DTS-I.TVS Motors decided to sue Bajaj Auto for libel.On February 2008, the Madras High Court in Chennai restrained TVS from launching it with the <b>twin</b> spark <b>plug</b> technology.TVS appealed against this decision, claiming that crucial evidence was not taken into accountand in March 2008, launched the Flame with a modified engine containing one spark plug. The DTSi idea is a simple one to understand - it involved usage of two spark plugs (instead of one) per engine cylinder. On 16 September 2009, the Supreme Court of India permitted TVS Motors to manufacture and sell the 125 cc TVS Flame with Twin Spark Technology till the pendency of the suit before the Madras High Court, but it shall maintain accurate records of its sales all over the country.|$|R
