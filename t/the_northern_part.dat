5|$|A {{county council}} for the East Riding of Yorkshire {{was set up}} in 1889, {{covering}} an administrative county which did not cover the county borough of Hull, but otherwise had the same boundaries as the historic riding. Both the administrative county and the historic Lieutenancy were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974, with most of the riding going to form <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>part</b> of Humberside. The creation of this cross-Humber authority was unpopular and this culminated in the local government review in the 1990s, which saw Humberside abolished and <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>part</b> form two unitary authorities. The East Riding district was formed on 1 April 1996. The ceremonial county, the area in which the Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire represents the Crown, was re-established the same day, covering Hull as well as the district.|$|E
