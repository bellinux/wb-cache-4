5|$|As a consequence, most {{battles in}} the 4th century were, as in {{previous}} centuries, primarily infantry encounters, with cavalry playing a supporting role. The main qualification is that on the Eastern frontier, cavalry played a more prominent role, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> reliance on cavalry as their main arm.

5|$|From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, {{one of the}} Achaemenid capitals, and {{captured}} its treasury.

He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.|$|E

5|$|Since 2000, the ADF's {{expanded}} {{force structure}} and deployment capabilities {{have been put}} to the test on several occasions. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Australia committed a special forces task group and an air-to-air refuelling aircraft to operations in Afghanistan, and naval warships <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf as Operation Slipper. In 2003, approximately 2,000 ADF personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, took part in the invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Thence {{the fleet}} {{continued}} {{on to the}} Hellespont, and when all was ready, shipped the land forces across to Europe. The army then marched through Thrace, re-subjugating it, since these lands had already been added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Empire in 512 BC, during Darius's campaign against the Scythians. Upon reaching Macedon, the Persians forced it to become a fully subordinate part of the Persian Empire; they had been vassals of the Persians since the late 6th century BC, but retained their general autonomy.|$|E
50|$|As the Greek {{forces at}} Plataea under Pausanias {{did not want}} <b>to</b> attack <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> for fear of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> cavalry and <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> did not want <b>to</b> attack <b>the</b> Greeks who held the high-ground, Mardonius sent Masistius <b>to</b> harry <b>the</b> Greek forces. Masistius {{performed}} well, causing considerable casualties on the Greek forces {{through a series of}} hit and run attacks. However, as Masistius led from the front, the Greeks were able to kill him, inflicting a considerable blow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b>|$|R
500|$|Herodotus {{described}} {{the relationship between}} the Qedarites and <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> as follows: [...] "they did not yield the obedience of slaves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> but were united to them by friendship for having given Cambyses passage into Egypt, which <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> could not enter without the consent of the Arabs." ...|$|R
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Thermopylae, Boeotia fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> who then began to advance on Athens. The Peloponnesian Allies prepared <b>to</b> now defend <b>the</b> Isthmus of Corinth, thus abandoning Athens <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> From Artemisium, <b>the</b> Allied fleet sailed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island of Salamis, where the Athenian ships helped with the final evacuation of Athens. The Peloponnesian contingents wanted <b>to</b> sail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast of <b>the</b> Isthmus <b>to</b> concentrate forces with the army. However, Themistocles tried to convince them <b>to</b> remain in <b>the</b> Straits of Salamis, invoking the lessons of Artemisium; [...] "battle in close conditions works to our advantage". After threatening <b>to</b> sail with <b>the</b> whole Athenian people into exile in Sicily, he eventually persuaded the other Allies, whose security after all relied on <b>the</b> Athenian navy, <b>to</b> accept his plan. Therefore, even after Athens had fallen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> navy had arrived {{off the coast of}} Salamis, the Allied navy remained in the Straits. Themistocles appears to have been aiming to fight a battle that would cripple <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> navy, and thus guarantee the security of the Peloponnesus.|$|R
5|$|With Thermopylae now opened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> army, the {{continuation}} of the blockade at Artemisium by the Greek fleet became irrelevant. The simultaneous naval Battle of Artemisium had been a tactical stalemate, and the Greek navy was able to retreat in good order to the Saronic Gulf, where they helped to ferry the remaining Athenian citizens to the island of Salamis.|$|E
5|$|After Thermopylae, all of Boeotia and Attica fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> army, which {{captured}} and burnt Athens. However, a larger Allied army fortified the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, protecting the Peloponnesus from Persian conquest. Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter {{the course of}} the war. The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised, and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied victory at Salamis prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army.|$|E

500|$|Finding <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear us, understand what I say, for by no means will <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly <b>to</b> encourage <b>the</b> Ionians, unbeknownst <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> <b>to</b> fight for <b>the</b> Allies (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> mistrust <b>the</b> Ionians.|$|R
50|$|His revolt, {{although}} {{unsuccessful in}} the end, left a big mark in Egyptian history. Herodotus also {{tells us that}} Inaros did more damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> than any man before him.|$|R
5|$|According <b>to</b> Herodotus, <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> commanders were {{concerned}} {{that they would not}} be able <b>to</b> defeat <b>the</b> Ionian fleet and, therefore, would not be able to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens <b>to</b> desert <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Samians secretly agreeing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> terms offered by <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|R

5|$|Resistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> in Syria was not strong; {{although}} the locals constructed fortifications, they generally tried <b>to</b> negotiate with <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> <b>The</b> cities of Damascus, Apamea, and Emesa fell quickly in 613, giving the Sasanian army {{a chance to}} strike further south into Palaestina Prima.

He managed to win a small victory near Emesa, however, where both sides suffered heavy casualties—the total death count was 20,000.
