5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> and take a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E

Guetta is then shown <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> of an airlock where smoke surrounds him. Different shots of television screens and other spaceship hardware are shown before Guetta puts a CD into a CD player. At this moment, the song's audio begins to play. Various video stills of Rihanna sitting down on a chair and surrounded by extras are intermittently shown one after the other. The majority of the video revolves around Rihanna and the extras dancing in a room, while various special effects are incorporated; Guetta continues to observe the singer's actions from a control room. In the daytime video, Rihanna wears a colorful outfit, and she wears a black outfit in the nighttime video.|$|E

[...] NME writer John Doran wrote, [...] "sure enough here are a wealth of rock gems that shine with a warm-hearted, Neil Young-like intensity. Those wanting clangour and dissonance will be disappointed, but everyone else will be pleasantly surprised." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Grayson Currin deemed it a [...] "motley assortment of Sonic Youth nods, acoustic entreaties, and cloying pop-rockers" [...] but that [...] "Ranaldo's opportunity <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> of the Sonic Youth shadows and into his own proper spotlight is mostly a miss made of mediocrity." [...] Ben Graham from The Quietus summarised the album as: [...] "while it may be traditional in structure, Between the Times and the Tides is innovative and inimitable in actual performance. The playing may draw on jazz, country, rock and Ranaldo's own avant-garde catalogue." [...] In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes found it [...] "great to hear the third voice in Sonic Youth stretching out. But it's also a reminder of their irreplaceable magic." ...|$|E

500|$|Britten Austin tempers his {{praise for}} Bellman's realism with the {{observation}} that the effects are chosen to work in song, rather than to be strictly correct or even possible. Thus in Epistle 72, [...] "Glimmande Nymf", the memorable rainbow with its glowing colours [...] "of purple, gold and green" [...] is seen after nightfall. He comments [...] "Never mind. It is a beautiful scene, even if its chronology calls for much poetic license." [...] Or in Epistle 80, [...] "Liksom en herdinna", the farmer is for some reason going to or coming from market on a Sunday, when the market would be closed; and his cart [...] "heavy on staggering wheel" [...] must have been absurdly full if it contained chickens, lambs, and calves all at once. But {{it had to be}} a Sunday to allow Ulla Winblad <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> of her swaying chaise, on an outing from the city. Britten Austin remarks that [...] "until such solecisms are actually pointed out, one does not even notice them." [...] It is the same with the meals, which would cause [...] "terrible indigestion" [...] if the listener actually had to eat them, but [...] "as a feast for mind, eye and ear they are highly satisfactory", the imagination filled with [...] "all the poetic wealth" [...] that Bellman provides.|$|E
500|$|... "Ride Me to Hell" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Rowe and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick and series creator Devin Clark. Screenwriter and executive producer Daniel Powell said that the episode explores [...] "a little bit more" [...] about Mark's background, particularly that his father left {{him when he was}} younger, and that it [...] "sort of informs why he became a social worker". Unlike the series' first season, which paid homage mainly to horror films, season two referenced a variety of genres. In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex, Clark used [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] as an example that the season [...] "taps into a little bit beyond the horror culture". He referred it to as [...] "one of our big episodes" [...] and stated that it references contemporary shows with [...] "unsatisfied endings", such as Monk and Lost. In the episode, Grimes unleashes memories of being a cop in the 1970s, which Clark saw as an opportunity to make fun of 1970s cop shows, such as CHiPs and Starsky and Hutch. He said, [...] "It's always a fun opportunity to see what other worlds I can pull from, even beyond horror. We had some really fun opportunities this season to pull from old '70s cop shows. ... So, it's fun for me just <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> and try lots of different styles and looks. I'm excited for whatever the writers throw at me, thematically. It's just a new opportunity to try something different." [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] was the fifth episode to be produced for the second season. In addition to the regular cast, the episode features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is quite dark and mysterious, {{as much of it}} is often {{interpreted}} to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album's lyrics, Thayil said that [...] "a lot of Superunknown {{seems to me to be}} about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicing—like the Druids : 'Life is good, but death's gonna be even better!" [...] Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are [...] "a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to 'leave us alone. Cornell stated that [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] is about [...] "crawling back to the womb to die", [...] "Fell on Black Days" [...] is about realizing [...] "you're unhappy in the extreme", [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is about a [...] "surreal dreamscape", [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is a [...] "'shame-on-decadence' song", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] is about [...] "trying <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>out</b> of being patterned and closed off and reclusive", and [...] "4th of July" [...] is about using LSD. Cornell talked about [...] "Mailman" [...] at a concert saying, [...] "This next one is about killing your boss. It's about coming to work early one morning cause you have a special agenda and you're going to shoot him in the fucking head." [...] Conversely, [...] "Like Suicide" [...] was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house.
