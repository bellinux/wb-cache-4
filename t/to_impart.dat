5|$|As combat {{operations}} quickly revealed, {{the two sides}} were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it {{in the months following}} the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time <b>to</b> <b>impart</b> needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E

5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and <b>to</b> <b>impart</b> a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E
5|$|Hill and his {{brothers}} {{had taken over the}} management of their father's school in Birmingham in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to learn, not <b>to</b> <b>impart</b> facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage.|$|E
5|$|In Malagasy culture lemurs, {{and animals}} in general, have souls (ambiroa) which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if {{killed in a}} cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other {{elements}} of daily life, have {{been a source of}} taboos, known locally as fady, which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the ancestor of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought <b>to</b> <b>impart</b> their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies. In general, fady extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} of {{reaching}} peak intensity, Mireille turned more to the northwest along the southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge. The increasing size began <b>to</b> <b>impart</b> wind shear in Typhoon Nat to the west, and the two storms underwent the Fujiwhara effect, in which Nat turned sharply southward while Mireille progressed toward the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. After maintaining peak winds for about 30hours, Mireille began weakening, passing just east of Miyako-jima on September26 with 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph), according to the JMA. That day, the typhoon accelerated to the northeast due to increasing mid-level winds from the southwest, passing west of Okinawa. According to the JMA, Mireille re-intensified slightly on September27 to a secondary peak of 175km/h (110mph), aided by unusually warm water temperatures in the East China Sea. The typhoon made landfall at that strength at 07:00UTC between Saikai and Nagasaki along southwest Kyushu. The pressure at landfall was , {{the lowest in the}} country since Typhoon Trix in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{regarded}} as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style. In hockey, a player {{is not allowed to}} lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him <b>to</b> <b>impart</b> momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade. Booth was particularly known for his late cut and his cover drive, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to Mark Waugh. He was known for his quick footwork against spin bowling and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo. Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181cm, weighed 66kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking. He was known for his efficient outfielding, and {{on the second day of}} the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 196465, he ran out Gary Sobers and Basil Butcher with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time leg spinner before converting to off spin.|$|E
5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third finger, which he used <b>to</b> <b>impart</b> spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger {{would not be able to}} handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E
50|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of physics (dynamics, to be exact), a firearm, as for most weapons, is a system for delivering maximum destructive energy to the target with minimum delivery of energy on the shooter. The momentum delivered to the target however cannot be any more than that (due to recoil) on the shooter. This is because the momentum <b>imparted</b> <b>to</b> the bullet is equal <b>to</b> that <b>imparted</b> <b>to</b> the gun-shooter system.|$|R

5|$|Following his {{swearing}} in as Lord Protector in 1653, Oliver Cromwell {{became a}} proponent of Blondeau's coinage method, which had yet to find favour in the nation's minting establishment. In 1654, Cromwell's government placed Blondeau {{in charge of a}} planned mint in Ireland, where the coinage was heavily debased by fraudulent means. The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £2,000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former Royal Mint superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a perforated steel strip, through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the split collar, because the steel strip could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without a collar, which suggests that he used a machine <b>to</b> <b>impart</b> the edge lettering prior to striking.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted <b>to</b> <b>impart</b> {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to demands for more aircrew to fulfil Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying training underwent {{major changes in}} 1951–52, the syllabus at No.1 FTS being split among three separately located units. No.1 Initial Flying Training School (No.1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, <b>to</b> <b>impart</b> students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.1 IFTS {{went on to the}} newly formed No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, where they underwent a further 90 hours of aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, first on Tiger Moths and then on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.1 FTS, which was renamed No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS) in March 1952. There they undertook 100 flying hours of advanced weapons and combat training on Wirraways, before graduating as sergeant pilots. RAAF College, formed at Point Cook in 1947, was to be the Air Force's primary source of commissioned officers. The Tiger Moths and Wirraways of No.1 BFTS were subsequently replaced by the CAC Winjeel, first delivered in 1955.|$|E
