40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, a {{prevailing}} hypothesis in research related to arterial disease has been that circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) provide protection by their innate ability to replace dysfunctional or damaged endothelium. This paradigm has led to extensive investigation of EPCs {{in the hope of}} finding therapeutic targets to control their homing and differentiation. However, from the very beginning, the nomenclature and the phenotype of EPCs have been subject to controversy and there are currently no specific markers that can unambiguously identify these cells. Moreover, many of the initial observations that EPCs differentiate to endothelial cells in the course of arterial disease have been criticized for methodological problems.

40|$|Objectives: To {{report a}} series of {{patients}} following thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) presenting with rupture, who were effectively treated with TEVAR relining. Methods: Five patients who underwent repeat TEVAR in an urgent fashion were identified. Chart review was performed to identify demographics, device type, aneurysm characteristics, and postoperative course. Results: Mean time <b>to</b> <b>relining</b> procedure was 5. 8 (range 2 - 10) years. All patients had 3 device components originally placed. Mean size of the original aneurysm was 7. 2 cm (range 6. 6 - 8). All patients underwent relining with proximal and distal extension with immediate technical success. At a mean follow-up of 1. 3 years, {{there was no evidence}} of endoleak and no patients required repeat intervention. Conclusions: Complete relining with proximal and distal extension was effective in treating patients presenting with rupture. These findings suggest that proximal and distal landing zones provided, relining should be considered the initial management strategy in patients s/p TEVAR re-presenting with ruptur...|$|R

Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling, and added a tube and liner locking ring. Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling that was secured by a tube and liner locking ring with a liner locking collar at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearance at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band seating slope and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12. Mod 12 used a Mod 10 and lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope with Mod 13 being similar but of a Mod 8, Mod 14 used a Mod 9, Mod 15 used a Mod 7, Mod 16 used a Mod 10, Mod 17 used a Mod 8, and Mod 18 a Mod 9.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} changes in {{distraction}} force following relining of a conventional abdominal aortic stent-graft with a type IIIb endoleak using the Nellix endovascular sealing device compared to a unilateral stent-graft. Methods: Relining {{is often used to}} repair type IIIb endoleaks, but the consequences to graft stability are unknown. A mathematical model was constructed based on pressure and volume flow through the stent-grafts, incorporating recognized distraction force equations. Steady flow was presumed at peak systolic pressures to calculate the maximum distraction force, with gravity ignored. Distraction forces for 28 - to 36 -mm-diameter stent-graft bodies with 16 -mm limbs were calculated and compared <b>to</b> forces following <b>relining</b> with single and double Nellix devices or the Renu unilateral device. Results: Distraction forces for the 28 -, 32 -, and 36 -mm stent-grafts prior <b>to</b> <b>relining</b> were 5. 99, 10. 21, and 14. 99 N, respectively. Similar forces were reported after relining with bilateral Nellix devices (5. 86, 10. 08, and 14. 86 N, respectively). However, use of a unilateral Nellix increased the distraction forces to 9. 92, 14. 14, and 18. 92 N, respectively. These were comparable to the increase observed after relining with a Renu unilateral stent-graft (9. 87, 14. 09, and 18. 86 N, respectively).

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} perforation of a Dacron aortic graft {{due to a}} post-thoracotomy dislocated rib {{fracture in}} a young Marfan patient. Case Report: Six months after a successful open repair of a type II dissecting thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA), a 40 -year-old woman with Marfan syndrome underwent elective repair of a post-thoracotomy dislocated rib fracture. During the procedure, the graft ruptured; 2 TAG stent-grafts were emergently implanted <b>to</b> <b>reline</b> the existing aortic graft. The fractured rib was then resected. The postoperative course was uneventful, without residual leak at computed tomography at 3 days. At 18 months, the patient is well, without need of further operations. Conclusion: Early correction of any dislocated rib fracture close to a thoracic aortic graft should be considered, especially if the graft is not wrapped by the aneurysm sac. In these patients, in-graft endovascular relining associated with repair of the rib fracture may be a feasible and effective alternative to redo thoracotomy and surgical graft repair. Prior to attempting rib resection, appropriate thoracic endografts should be on hand in case an endovascular bailout is needed...|$|E

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of a new guided surgery system. Materials and methods Twenty-six patients were treated in 8 centers with a total 116 implants placed. The surgical guides were bone supported, mucosal or teeth supported. At the end of the surgical phase, a post-op CT scan was taken to evaluate the discrepancies between the virtual and the clinical implant position. Results The mean values regarding the 3 D implant position are in line with the mean values reported in the literature. Bone supported and mucosal supported guides are more precise than dental or dental-mucosal supported guides, however, the differences are not statistically significant. Discrepancies at the implant apex, at platform level and at the angle between virtual and clinical position were evaluated by superimposing a pre-op CT scan to a post-op CT scan. Conclusions The accuracy of the guided surgery system used is in line with the data of the literature. A good diagnostic phase is recommended and it is very important to plan the implant position with a safety distance from the anatomical structures of at least 2 mm. In clinical cases of immediate loading it is recommended <b>to</b> <b>reline</b> a provisional prosthesis to compensate the discrepancies between the virtual and the clinical implant position...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Most {{studies on}} the {{sentinel}} node (SN) procedure in patients with colorectal cancer include immunohistochemical analysis of the SN only. To evaluate the real diagnostic accuracy of the SN procedure with immunohistochemical analysis, the presence of occult tumour cells in all histologically negative lymph nodes was compared {{to the presence of}} these cells in SNs. Also the reproducibility of diagnosing occult tumour cells (OTC) and the sensitivity of three different antibodies was assessed. Methods: Between November 2006 en July 2007, an ex vivo SN procedure was performed in 58 histologically NO patients with colorectal cancer. All lymph nodes (n = 908, mean 15. 7) were step-sectioned and immunohistochemistry was performed using two antibodies against cytokeratins (Cam 5. 2, and CK 20) and one antibody against BerEp- 4. Results: OTC were identified in 19 of 58 patients, with micrometastases (0. 2 - 2 mm) in 7 and isolated tumour cells (ITC) (< 0. 2 mm) in 12 patients. The overall agreement in diagnosing OTC between two independent pathologists was 86 %. An SN was identified in 53 of 58 patients. All micrometastases were found in SNs. In two patients with negative SNs, ITC's were demonstrated in non-SNs (sensitivity 88 %, and overall accuracy 96 %). Conclusion: Additional immunohistochemical analysis of histologically negative lymph nodes demonstrates occult tumour cells in 33 % of the patients resulting in an upstaging rate of 12 %. Occult tumour cells are predominantly found in the SN, therefore SN mapping has the potential <b>to</b> <b>reline</b> the staging system for patients with colorectal cancer.

40|$|Context: Relining {{with heat}} cure denture base resin is {{time-consuming}} {{and the patient}} has to remain without dentures within this period. Recently, some autopolymerizing resins marketed as hard chairside reline systems with low exothermic heat allow the dentists <b>to</b> <b>reline</b> prosthesis directly in the mouth. However, {{the decision to use}} these materials must be based on physical properties such as dimensional accuracy that directly influences the accuracy of fit of the denture base. Aim: The aim was to compare the linear dimensional changes of two hard chairside reline resins with two laboratory heat cure resins at 3 times intervals after processing. Settings and Design: A stainless steel split mold (International Organization for Standardization 1567) was used for sample fabrication. Five measurements of the reference dimensions (AB and CD) were measured directly from the mold and the samples with a profile projector, and mean difference were calculated. Subjects and Methods: Forty samples were fabricated by incorporating the split mold into first pour of denture flasks and packing each of the chairside reline resins ("Kooliner" and "Ufi Gel Hard") and laboratory heat cure resins ("Dental Products of India Heat Cure" and "Trevalon"). The mean difference in dimensional change at 3 times intervals (0 h, 4 days and 2 months) were calculated and subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical Analysis Used: One-way ANOVA, RMANOVA and post hoc Tukey′s tests. Results: All resins showed different levels of significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) after processing (T 0) ranging from − 0. 128 to − 0. 310 mm. After 4 days (T 1), there was significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) ranging from − 0. 168 to − 0. 296 mm. After 2 months (T 2), there was again significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) ranging from − 0. 018 to − 0. 216 mm. Chairside reline resins showed less dimensional shrinkage at each time interval than the laboratory heat cure resins.
