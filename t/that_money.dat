5|$|As a senator, Nixon {{received}} an annual salary of $12,500 (about $150,000 in 2009 dollars). While he {{received an}} expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because California {{was one of the}} most populous states), <b>that</b> <b>money</b> went to pay his staff of 12 and to cover the cost of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses.

5|$|Bormann's {{studies at}} an {{agricultural}} trade high school were interrupted {{when he joined}} the 55th Field Artillery Regiment as a gunner in June 1918, in the last days of World War I. He never saw action, but served garrison duty until February 1919. After working a short time in a cattle feed mill, Bormann became estate manager of a large farm in Mecklenburg. Shortly after starting work at the estate, Bormann joined an antisemitic landowners association. While hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic meant <b>that</b> <b>money</b> was worthless, foodstuffs stored on farms and estates became ever more valuable. Many estates, including Bormann's, had Freikorps units stationed on site to guard the crops from pillaging. Bormann joined the Freikorps organisation headed by Gerhard Roßbach in 1922, acting as section leader and treasurer.|$|E

5|$|Brashear was {{not given}} an {{extension}} during the season, and {{prior to the start}} of the free agency he indicated that he would like to return to Washington, citing the prospect of winning a Stanley Cup. Brashear noted that at his age and place in his career, taking care of his family was his top priority and <b>that</b> <b>money</b> would be the deciding factor in his destination. The Capitals, however, opted not re-sign him. After initial talks with the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)'s Vityaz Chekhov, he eventually agreed to a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the New York Rangers. At an event for season-ticket holders, Brashear was booed due to the altercation with the Rangers in the previous post-season. He set a personal milestone during the 2009–10 season by playing in his 1,000th NHL game on November 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
5|$|Cuts {{in federal}} {{construction}} funds for Metro again delayed construction. Metro announced in December 1982 that {{service on the}} line would not cross the Anacostia River until late 1989 at the earliest. The federal contribution to Metro's construction fund was lowered to $44 million from $95 million for fiscal 1983, and Metro {{said that it would}} divert most of <b>that</b> <b>money</b> to dig tunnels from the Gallery Place Station to the Mount Vernon Square station. In February 1983, the Reagan administration proposed cutting Metro's construction budget by $145 million to $230 million, which Metro said would push the opening of the Green Line to 1991. Metro, {{for the first time in}} its history, formally announced that (absent full construction funding) it could not build the Green Line, the Red Line from Wheaton to Glenmont, or the Yellow Line from Franconia-Springfield to King Street – Old Town.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker's {{successful}} leadership race {{had been}} run by Allister Grosart, an executive for McKim Advertising Ltd. Soon {{after taking the}} leadership, Diefenbaker got Grosart to help out at Tory headquarters, and soon appointed him national director {{of the party and}} national campaign manager. Grosart appointed a national campaign committee, something which had not been done previously by the Tories, but which, according to Grosart, provided the organizational key to success in 1957. The party was ill-financed, having only $1,000,000 to wage the campaign—half what it had in 1953. Grosart divided most of <b>that</b> <b>money</b> equally by constituency, to the disgruntlement of Quebec Tories, who were used to receiving a disproportionate share of the national party's financing.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of World War I, as Romania {{remained}} a neutral country, Caragiale's notes record that his friend Bogdan-Pitești was acting as a political agent of the Central Powers, and <b>that</b> <b>money</b> he made available had been provided by German propaganda funds. Nevertheless, the two figures were especially close to one another during and after 1915, and, in 1916, even visited Berlin together. At the time, Caragiale also visited the Germanophile literary circle set up by Mărgărita Miller Verghy, and borrowed a reported 10,000 lei from Bogdan-Pitești, which he never returned. Caragiale's own Germanophile preferences and traditionalist conservatism had by then extinguished his cultural Francophilia, and rumors spread that he himself was a spy for the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} walkouts, the assembly began passing {{most of the}} agenda and Daniels signed the bills into law. Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school voucher program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition and use <b>that</b> <b>money</b> to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E
5|$|In summer 2000, Guðjohnsen and Jensen {{were sold}} for £4million each. Allardyce focused on {{spending}} money {{to improve the}} club's facilities and backroom staff, believing <b>that</b> <b>money</b> spent in these areas would allow Bolton to compete with clubs who had bigger budgets and paid bigger wages than Bolton could afford. On the playing front he spent £400,000 on striker Michael Ricketts and £1.5million to bring back Frendsen from Blackburn, and also signed utility player Ian Marshall and Bradford City loanee Isaiah Rankin. Teenager Kevin Nolan was also promoted from the youth team, whilst 35-year-old defender Colin Hendry arrived on loan. Bolton reached the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in 2000–01, where they beat Preston North End 3–0 to achieve promotion to the Premier League after a three-year absence.|$|E

5|$|Minister of Local Government and Regional Development, Gunnar Berge, {{stated in}} January 1995 {{that he was}} {{concerned}} that the post-Olympic use funds were being used up too quickly and <b>that</b> <b>money</b> was being used for unsuitable projects. However, he rejected that the state should take control over the venues or the money. After one year, Lillehammer Olympiapark had used NOK32 of 146 million, while the company Olympia Utvikling/Troll Park had used NOK14 of 95 million. For the Lillehammer companies, {{this meant that the}} fund was estimated to run out after ten instead of twenty years. In contrast, Hamar Olympiske Anlegg had only used the fund's yield. LOOC criticized the post-Olympic use companies, stating that they were too bureaucratic, that their combined 100 employees were too many, and that one or two companies would be sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Most {{classical}} theories, including Fisher's, {{held that}} velocity was stable and independent of economic activity. Cambridge economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, began to challenge this assumption. They developed the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which looked at money demand {{and how it}} impacted the economy. The Cambridge theory did not assume <b>that</b> <b>money</b> demand and supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding more cash when the economy sagged. By factoring {{in the value of}} holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant steps toward the concept of liquidity preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate transactions and to maintain liquidity. In later work, Keynes added a third motive, speculation, to his liquidity preference theory and built on it to create his general theory.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1787, the {{convention}} received a tentative draft {{written by a}} Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina's John Rutledge; Randolph had represented Virginia. The draft was acceptable to Mason {{as a basis for}} discussion, containing such points important to him as the requirement <b>that</b> <b>money</b> bills originate in the House and not be amendable in the Senate. Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was too powerful, as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and adjudicate territorial disputes between the states. The draft lacked provision for a council of revision, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.|$|E
