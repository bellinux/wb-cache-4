5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have {{curricula}} identical {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying <b>too</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> clinical rotations with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E
5|$|The Kagawa Prefectural Government Hall on {{the island}} of Shikoku was {{completed}} in 1958. Its expressive construction could be likened to the Daibutsu style seen at the Tōdai-ji in Nara. The columns on the elevation bore only vertical loads so Tange was able to design them to be thin, maximising the surfaces for glazing.

He sees other groupings as being arbitrary, as well as detrimental to the proper understanding of rongorongo. Contrary to other scholars who do not place importance on compound glyphs, Dietrich sees compounding as a major aspect of the system. In fact, Dietrich describes rongorongo as a network in which the characters are interwoven together through various combinations.

5|$|Aged 76, {{he faced}} various ailments, and {{although}} exhibiting continued energy, he felt isolated and lonely. He often entertained celebrities, such as Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, and the Spice Girls, and befriended ultra-rich businessmen, like Harry Oppenheimer of Anglo-American {{as well as}} Queen Elizabeth II on her March 1995 state visit to South Africa, resulting in strong criticism from ANC anti-capitalists. Despite his opulent surroundings, Mandela lived simply, donating {{a third of his}} R 552,000 annual income to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which he had founded in 1995. Although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of freedom of the press, and befriending many journalists, Mandela was critical of much of the country's media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused <b>too</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> scaremongering about crime.|$|E

40|$|In this {{introduction}} to the special issue on The New Politics of Inequality in Europe, we summarize recent literature on income inequality in the advanced democracies and argue that dominant accounts are <b>too</b> <b>heavily</b> focused <b>on</b> the United States, while the experience of western European countries has been neglected. While income inequality has risen nearly everywhere in the rich industrial democracies {{since the end of}} the 1970 s, it has done so from different starting points, at different rates, and for reasons connected to different mechanisms and different parts of the distribution. Extending the analysis to Western Europe enables us to fully understand this variation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to verify whether {{efficient}} portfolios, obtained using traditional tools of asset allocation, provide real diversification of risk, in addition to the division of capital into different asset classes. We will show how portfolios that seem diversified in their capital allocation are <b>too</b> <b>heavily</b> concentrated <b>on</b> in terms of risk allocation. To solve this problem we propose using a risk budgeting approach based on equal marginal contributions to total risk. By using this approach the dispersion of risk is maximized, effectively reducing the intensity and the length of drawdowns and diversifying their source, with equal volatility to a traditional portfolio...|$|R

He cautioned that modern humans rely <b>too</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. Jackson Pollock, for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.|$|E

Only developing countries with an already established industrial base achieved industrialization in other sectors. The sizable change {{in both the}} size and structure of manufactured exports from developing countries has not been associated with corresponding changes in manufacturing value added.

Jaimie Veale, a psychology academic, published an alternative theory in 2010 which proposes that variances in gender identity are driven by personality and social factors which determine whether psychological defense mechanisms are employed to avoid or repress gender nonconformity, resulting in the later expression of this gender nonconformity.|$|E

From 1914 to 1918 he taught at a series of private schools, sometimes the same ones as al-Aqqad. During this period, his two collections of poetry were published, one in 1913, and one in 1917. Though influential for the Egyptian revivalist poetry of the 1910s, his poetry was accused of being <b>too</b> <b>heavily</b> based <b>on</b> both European and classical influences, an accusation he didn't greatly dispute; and after 1917 he published very little additional poetry.|$|R

25|$|The {{relevance}} and acceptability of the lyric {{in the modern}} age was, though, called into question by modernist poets such as Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, H.D., and William Carlos Williams, who rejected the English lyric form of the 19th century, feeling that it relied <b>too</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> melodious language, rather than complexity of thought. After World War II, the American New Criticism returned to the lyric, advocating a poetry that made conventional use of rhyme, meter and stanzas, and was modestly personal in the lyric tradition. Lyric poetry dealing with relationships, sex and domestic life constituted the new mainstream of American poetry in the late 20th century following the confessional poets of the 1950s and ’60s such as Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton.|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} is also {{often seen as}} relying <b>too</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> complex mathematical models, such as those used in general equilibrium theory, without enough regard to whether these actually describe the real economy. Many see an attempt to model a system as complex as a modern economy by a mathematical model as unrealistic and doomed to failure. A famous answer to this criticism is Milton Friedman's claim that theories should be judged by their ability to predict events {{rather than by the}} realism of their assumptions. Mathematical models also include those in game theory, linear programming, and econometrics. Some see mathematical models used in contemporary research in mainstream economics as having transcended neoclassical economics, while others disagree. Critics of neoclassical economics are divided into those who think that highly mathematical method is inherently wrong and those who think that mathematical method is potentially good even if contemporary methods have problems.|$|E

50|$|Through further {{research}} and testing, {{the concept of}} relying solely on wind power for Canada's energy needs proved to be inefficient and impractical.

5000|$|Dundee {{upgraded}} its harbour {{and established}} {{itself as an}} industrial and trading centre. Dundee's industrial heritage was based on [...] "the three Js": jute, jam and journalism. East-central Scotland became <b>too</b> <b>heavily</b> dependent <b>on</b> linens, hemp, and jute. Despite the cyclical nature of the trade which periodically ruined weaker companies, profits held up well in the 19th century. Typical firms were family affairs, even after the introduction of limited liability in the 1890s. The profits helped make the city {{an important source of}} overseas investment, especially in North America. However, the profits were seldom invested locally, apart from the linen trade. The reasons were that low wages limited local consumption, and because there were no important natural resources; thus the Dundee region offered little opportunity for profitable industrial diversification.|$|R
