The laboratory research was primarily focused on the choice of an appropriate binder and dosage for the in situ application.

The results of a series of Unconfined Compression (UC) tests showed that blast furnace cement performs rather well in terms of strength and stiffness. The experimentation in situ consisted of instrumentation of <b>trial</b> <b>embankments</b> built both on improved and nonimproved soil. A careful inspection of the actual columns confirmed the key role of lime on homogeneity of the mixed zones and the good incorporation of cement into soil.

The subsoil of the embankment was instrumented by hydrostatic levelling profiles, pore pressure transducers and depth reference points installed in boreholes. An advanced constitutive model for clays (hypoplastic model for clays with meta-stable structure) was used for numerical modelling of both case histories. Basic hypoplastic model for clays was calibrated using isotropic compression tests and triaxial compression tests on reconstituted clay. Three additional model parameters describing the effects of lumpy structure were calibrated using oedometer tests on specimens prepared from scaled down lumpy material (material with smaller size of clay lumps). The performance of the model was evaluated by comparison {{with the results of}} the centrifuge model of self weight consolidated landfill.

40|$|MODELLING OF LUMPY CLAY FILLS Jan Najser Abstract An {{extensive}} {{open cast mining}} {{of brown}} coal has been taking place in NW Bohemia since 1940 's. During the mining process, overburden clay {{is placed in the}} form of irregularly shaped lumps of typical dimensions up to 500 mm into large spoil heaps. The total thickness of the lumpy clay landfills is usually 20 - 50 m. Their material has a double porosity structure: the porosity of intact clay (intragranular porosity) and the voids between clay lumps (intergranular porosity). The total porosity of the fresh fill can be up to 70 %. This soil presents special challenges for geotechnical design, primarily because of its high and non-uniform settlement. Further, the progressive tranformation from the "granular" to "fine-grained" material makes the lumpy clay difficult to characterise and model. The aim of the presented thesis is to describe the behaviour of the landfill and the change of its structure by means of field measurements, the centrifuge and numerical modelling. During site investigation for a motorway over a 20 - 30 years old landfill, two <b>trial</b> <b>embankments</b> were built and monitored over the period of 3 and 6 years respectively.

40|$|Vertical drains {{increase}} {{the rate of}} soil consolidation by providing a short horizontal drainage path for pore water flow, and are used worldwide in many soft soil improvement projects. This thesis develops three new contributions to the solution of consolidation problems: (i) a more realistic representation of the smear zone where soil properties vary gradually with radial distance from the vertical drain; (ii) a nonlinear radial consolidation model incorporating void ratio dependant soil properties and non-Darcian flow; and (iii) a solution to multi-layered consolidation problems with vertical and horizontal drainage using the spectral method. Each model is verified against existing analytical solutions and laboratory experiments conducted at the University of Wollongong, NSW Australia. The nonlinear radial consolidation model and the spectral method are verified against two <b>trial</b> <b>embankments</b> involving surcharge and vacuum loading at the Second Bangkok International Airport, Thailand. The versatility of the spectral method model is further demonstrated by analysing ground subsidence associated with ground water pumping in the Saga Plain, Japan. New expressions for the smear zone parameter, based on a linear and parabolic variation of soil properties in the radial direction, give a more realistic representation {{of the extent of}} smear and suggest that smear zones may overlap. Overlapping linear smear zones provide some explanation for the phenomena of a minimum drain spacing, below which no increase in the rate of consolidation is achieved. It appears this minimum influence radius is 0. 6 {{times the size of the}} linear smear zone. The new smear zone parameters may be used with consolidation models (ii) and (iii), as mentioned above. The analytical solution to nonlinear radial consolidation is valid for both Darcian and non-Darcian flow and can capture the behaviour of both overconsolidated and normally consolidated soils. For nonlinear material properties, consolidation may be faster or slower when compared to the cases with constant material properties. The difference depends on the compressibility/permeability ratios (Cc/Ck and Cr/Ck), the preconsolidation pressure and the stress increase. If Cc/Ck ≤ss than 1 or Cr/Ck ≤ss than 1 then the coefficient of consolidation increases as excess pore pressures dissipate and consolidation is faster. The multi-layered consolidation model includes both vertical and radial drainage where permeability, compressibility and vertical drain parameters vary linearly with depth. The ability to include surcharge and vacuum loads that vary with depth and time allows for a large variety of consolidation problems to be analysed. The powerful model can also predict consolidation behaviour before and after vertical drains are installed and has potential for nonlinear consolidation analysis...|$|R

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} a {{critical}} investigation into a novel development of the road subgrade incorporating a pre-hydrated geosynthetic clay liner (RGCL) within a proposed new Encapsulated Road Pavement (ERPS) design system for a Malaysian difficult ground condition. It studied the effect of static loading on different reinforced full scale road pavement model for six (6) months duration. Continuous full scale testing was conducted at Research Centre for Soft Soil (RECESS Malaysia) located in the campus site of Kolej Universiti Teknologi Tun Hussein Onn (KUiTTIIO). The test area consists of very soft clay {{to a depth of}} 20 meters (JKR Malaysia, 1987). The new RGCL is expected to act as a barrier that will encapsulate or 'wrap' the imported subgrade layer in order to protect it from the high water table that exists {{in most parts of the}} southern region of Malaysia (the state of Johor). Apart from acting as a barrier to the existing sub-surface / ground water present at the test site, the RGCL will also function as reinforcement in the road pavement system. The design and application of RGCL is expected to reduce settlement and the effect of abrupt structural failure to road pavement constructed on soft soil due to traff"ic loadings. It should enhance the performance and prolongs the design life of the road pavement. Laboratory tests on the soil properties and characteristics obtained from the test site were conducted prior to the full-scale <b>trial</b> road <b>embankment</b> construction. Comparisons of different design standards mainly the British and Malaysian Standards were made to understand the current practiced rural road design concept. Full-scale <b>trial</b> road <b>embankments</b> were instrumented with the state of the art monitoring facilities purchased from Canada through fundamental research grants (Chapter 5 : Field Instrumentation for full scale research). From this project, it may be concluded that rural roads when constructed on soft clay with high water table, need to be reinforced and encapsulated with an impermeable layer so that the subgrade layer may last longer as its intended design life. Water table and rainfall intensity have an influence on road performance constructed on soft soil. It was also found that the ERPS design system performs better or similar to the road when compared to the unreinforced (Control Section) and geotextile-reinforced (Existing Practice) road pavement respectively. However, further research such as long term monitoring of this research project is recommended so that more concrete conclusion on the behaviour and performance of encapsulated road pavement can be derived. This project contributes in producing reliable, quality rural road pavement design and construction on Malaysian soft soil. This will enable its inclusion into current standards and assist in the construction of better and efficient rural road networks whilst gearing the nation towards achieving the Malaysian Vision 2020.

40|$|Measured {{data from}} five {{geotechnical}} structures have been back analysed to determine, in each case, {{the set of}} material parameters that will permit a reasonable match to the observed pre-failure foundation response. Back analyses have been performed using simple constitutive soil models (Tresca, Mohr-Coulomb and modified Cam clay) as implemented in the finite element analysis package CRISP 90. Trial loading data are available from: 1. The rapid loading to failure of a soft clay soft foundation through a rigid reinforced concrete slab. 2. The loading to failure of a soft clay foundation via the rapid construction of a <b>trial</b> <b>embankment.</b> 3. The long-term behaviour of a soft clay foundation loaded via a stable <b>trial</b> <b>embankment.</b> 4. The behaviour of two long span, flexible culverts under (granular) backfill and imposed loads. From comparison of the computed and observed responses conclusions have been drawn which have implications for the general application of finite element analysis to geotechnical problems; parameter selection or numerical analyses; and the essential requirements of the soil model for predicting soil behaviour. In chapters 3, 4 and 5 the main concern of analyses was to reproduce the observed settlements, lateral displacements and excess pore water pressures induced within the soft clay foundations. Analyses primarily concentrated {{on the use of}} the modified Cam clay soil model. Particularly in chapter 3, the ability of modified Cam clay to predict the essential elements of the foundation behaviour was reasonable. However, in chapters 4 and 5 predictions of lateral displacements and excess pore water pressures were poor. More accurate estimates of the observed lateral displacements and excess pore water pressures were obtained using empirical methods (hand calculations). The reason for the different quality of lateral displacement and excess pore water pressure predictions is thought, mainly, to be due to incomplete saturation of the soft clay at the <b>trial</b> <b>embankment</b> test site. The influence of incomplete saturation is thought to initially force a drained foundation response, which in the short term will give rise to smaller lateral displacements and excess pore water pressures than those predicted from fully undrained analyses.

40|$|Within {{the past}} few decades, {{increased}} population and infrastructure development has necessitated the reclamation and development of previously undesirable sites for civil engineering works. In Australia, significant development has taken place along the Eastern coastal belt. This region is lined with saturated clays of significant depths (15 m to 20 m) which are typically characterized by high compressibility, low bearing capacity, and high lateral displacement upon loading. The most common and economically viable technique for soil improvement of these foundations is the use prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) in conjunction with preloading. This method accelerates the consolidation process by shortening the drainage path of the soil in the radial direction, and {{has been used in}} a number of large projects including the Muar Plains <b>Trial</b> <b>Embankments,</b> Changi East Reclamation Project and the 2 nd International Bangkok Airport. Nevertheless, there are very limited case studies of soft clay projects in Australia. General theory of soil behaviour is well established based on the broad classifications of granular and cohesive soils.. However, due to the innumerable environmental and physical processes a soil may be exposed to during its formation, there is natural variance in soil properties. Thus, a holistic approach is advocated for geotechnical calculations at any site. The design methods should be used together with field observations, as well as data obtained from in situ and laboratory testing. When examining the deformation behaviour of clays, engineers are interested not only in the consolidation and compressibility characteristics of a soil, but also the index properties of it. The index properties of a soil describe certain critical stages in soil behaviour, and also the consistency of a soil. Within this dissertation, the index properties of soils from a number of different sites around Queensland have been tested within the laboratory, and analysed statistically. Beta distributions have been Further to this characterization, the inherent variation introduced solely {{as a result of the}} manual nature of testing these properties, has been examined and quantified. Covariance between index properties has been examined, and equations specific to Queensland soils produced to describe it. Laboratory testing and examination of the consolidation and compressibility characteristics specific to Queensland clays have also been undertaken, and are correlated to the measured index properties. Commonly, settlement calculations for a given embankment loading are considered in three stages - immediate settlement, consolidation settlement and secondary compression. Generally, the consolidation phase contributes the most significant portion of settlement in clays. Calculations for this phase undertaken by using the assumptions of average coefficient of volume compressibility, m[v], and also instantaneous loading. However, both assumptions are incorrect, and can lead to gross miscalculation of the settlement magnitude. A new method of analytically determining the settlement of a foundation taking into account the stress dependence of m[v], and also the loading sequence of an embankment has been formulated and is described herein. Furthermore, the dependence of the coefficient of volume compressibility (m[v]) on the overconsolidation ratio, and consistency of a soil has been examined and an empirical correlation developed to describe it. The coefficient of secondary compression (C[α]) was also examined in the same manner. While no definitive trend was established to describe the influence of consistency on this parameter, it was found that smaller C[α] values should be expected for increased overconsolidation ratios. This dissertation also presents the case study of an embankment constructed in South East Queensland. This case study has been numerically modelled using the finite difference package FLAC. This embankment was comprised of three different sections. The first two embankment sections were installed with vertical drains at spacings of 1 m and 2 m respectively and the third, was the control case, and was left free of ground improvement. Lastly, lateral displacements which develop in soft clay foundations during and after the construction are a major source of concern for engineers due to their detrimental effect on the behaviour of adjacent structures and amenities. A method of predicting the short term lateral displacements induced through embankment loading has been developed. The dependence of these displacements on soil properties, embankment geometry and also distance from the embankment toe are also examined...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A set of finite element computer programs has been written for the settlement analysis of structures founded on normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soft clays. The programs take into account nonlinear material stress-strain behaviour and creep. Analyses may assume 'undrained' and 'drained' conditions and fully coupled consolidation analyses are also possible. The 'modified' Cam clay model has been used with some modification to model nonlinear material stress-strain behaviour and a phenomenological creep relationship to model creep behaviour. The author's programs have been-tested against another, fully tested, finite element package and also against closed form solutions where they exist. Sensitivity {{of the results of}} creep analyses in response to possible variations in the determination of the values of the creep parameters has also been studied. Results of a combined creep and consolidation analysis of a flexible strip footing. indicate the relative importance of creep displacements with respect to the consolidation settlements which are difficult to separate in practice. A review is made of the main nonlinear models of soil behaviour available to the practising engineer. The main techniques within the finite element method that are used to implement such nonlinear soil models are also reviewed and the 'initial strain' method chosen for use in the computer programs developed. The author's programs have been used to calculate displacements and excess pore pressures resulting from the construction of a <b>trial</b> <b>embankment</b> built at Cubzac-les-Ponts in France and compared to the measured in-situ values. In the conclusions an appraisal is made of the soil model developed by the author and the nonlinear finite element solution technique used. Also, the results of analyses using the computer programs and the accuracy {{of the results of the}} analyses of the <b>trial</b> <b>embankment</b> are summarised. The author's computer programs are explained and listed in the form of appendices...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{numerous}} {{investigations have}} been conducted to predict the lateral displacements which develop in soft clay foundations {{as a result of}} embankment construction. These studies focus on the prediction of lateral deformation at the toe of the embankment, and were prompted by observations of the damaging effects on adjacent structures by these deformations. The mechanisms of lateral deformations are not yet clearly understood, however, predictions of behaviour seem possible due to the distribution of lateral deformations with depth remaining similar during the settlement process. The finite difference program FLAC was used within this study to model the behaviour of a homogeneous elastic medium subjected to different conditions of embankment loading. An empirical relation has been developed to describe the variation of lateral deformations with depth, at various distances from the embankment toe. This empirical correlation compared well to predictions from a previously validated numerical model of an instrumented <b>trial</b> <b>embankment...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} test of inclined timber pile {{was conducted to}} observe {{the effectiveness of this}} soil reinforcement in reducing the settlement with various types. A series of reinforcement method were applied in the field under a <b>trial</b> <b>embankment</b> with 4, 5 m high. Field instrumentation was set up on the site to observe the movement and settlement behaviour of reinforced soil under embankment load. Pile reinforcement of soft soil made from galam timber with 6 m length and 10 cm in diameter. The settlement monitored by using settlement plate during the construction stage and the lateral displacement measured by using inclinometer. Piezometer was used in order to monitor the change of pore water pressure during the preloading test. It was concluded that construction of embankment using inclined pile as reinforcement on soft soil can reduce the settlement and the lateral movement significantly and can be used as an alternative soil reinforcement material...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of the new airport of Mexico City (NAICM) is challenging, as the subsoil at the site is very weak. The airport, which is under construction at the moment, is located on top of thick layers of Mexico Clay soils. These clayey layers consist of a mixture of both clay particles and pyroclastic volcanic materials. These unique soils are characterised by a high water content and compressibility. Upon loading, the soft soils will settle {{as a result of}} the consolidation process. This consolidation is defined as the dissipation of excess pore water as a result of an increase in stress. The rate of consolidation is governed by the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, which is in general very low in soft soils, and the drainage path. In order to speed up this time consuming process, vertical permeable elements can be installed in the soil. Upon installation of these elements, a reduction in drainage path is realised. This reduction in drainage path allows faster dissipation of excess pore water pressure, hence reducing the consolidation time. Due to the conditions at the site, the design of the runways is challenging. The differential- and residual settlements need to be within strict boundaries in order to keep the runways operational. Prior to the design of the runways, <b>trial</b> <b>embankments</b> have been constructed in order to measure the performance of different soil improvement techniques at this specific site. Based upon this field test results, prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) were selected as the most efficient soil improvement technique. Besides the PVD trial, the sandpile trial also showed promising results. The PVDs and sandpiles both decrease the drainage path length inside the soft soil layers. The main difference is the relative high stiffness of the sandpiles, the stiffness of the PVDs is negligible. By installing stiff elements in the soft soil, the loads applied on the top of the soils are transferred to deeper and stiffer soils. Hence, the total settlements of the top soft soil layers are reduced. The sandpiles could therefore be feasible alternative to PVDs, applied at locations in which the total settlement needs to be limited. The investigation into the behaviour of sandpiles in Mexico Clay soils is performed in multiple stages. First, analytical models are used for gaining knowledge about the expected sandpile behaviour. In the second stage the FEM software Plaxis 2 D is used for the numerical modelling of the sandpiles, using an axisymmetric model setup. The model is constructed in multiple steps, with increasing complexity. The first models simulate the material behaviour with the Mohr-Coulomb model, in the advanced models the Soft Soil Creep and Hardening Soil models are used. The final numerical model is verified by the measurement data obtained from the field trials. After fitting the numerical model to the field data, the verified model is used in the sandpile sensitivity analysis. In this analysis the sensitivity of the material properties and geometry of the sandpile on the performance are researched. The residual settlements or performance, which is defined as the difference in settlement after construction and over a period of 8 years, is affected by the length, radius and centre to centre (ctc) distance of the sandpile. Adjusting the pile stiffness has minimal effect on the performance of the sandpile. An optimum in performance is found by varying both the pile radius and ctc distance. A combination of a small pile diameter with a small ctc distance results in the best performance. When comparing the performance of both sandpile and PVD, the PVD is found to be more effective in terms of performance. The additional stiffness of the sandpile is not reducing the total settlements, on the contrary, the self-weight of the piles increases the total settlements by providing an additional load to the soft soil layers located underneath the pile tip. In conclusion the sandpiles have no additional benefit over the use of PVDs, therefore the application of sandpiles at the NAICM site is not a feasible alternative to the use of PVDs. NAIC...|$|R
40|$|Compaction control {{based on}} performance-based test methods {{has been used}} recently.

The study {{is based on an}} extensive experimental program carried out at the Treporti Test Site, where a cylindrical <b>trial</b> <b>embankment</b> (40 m diameter, 6. 7 m height, applied load 106 kPa) was constructed and monitored from beginning of construction until its complete removal, four years later. OCR of the virgin soil (without embankment) was back-figured from “ 1 -m field oedometer” curves reconstructed from local vertical strains measured by sliding deformeter under the embankment center in 1 m-thick layers. OCR at end of construction (OCR = 1) and after embankment removal (OCR > 1) was imparted by mechanical loading-unloading. A tentative correlation between OCR and the ratio MDMT /qt in sand was constructed using parallel DMT and CPTU results obtained at end of construction and after embankment removal, associated to reliable (imparted) OCR values...|$|E
