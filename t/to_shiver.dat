500|$|According to B. J. Novak, {{the episode}} was [...] "a fun one to film". Although {{the cast and}} crew appear to be cold in the {{finished}} episode, [...] "The Fire" [...] was filmed in 100-degree weather; thus, the actors [...] "couldn't look hot" [...] and had to pretend <b>to</b> <b>shiver.</b> The firemen in the scene were played by actual firemen, and their costumes were designed in order to look like authentic Scranton firefighters.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} old picture of Jim and Dwight, an actual high school {{photograph}} of Krasinski was photoshopped {{along with a}} 1991 image of Wilson while Wilson was on tour with an acting company. While standing in the parking lot, the cast had to pretend <b>to</b> <b>shiver</b> in 85-degree weather. Krasinski actually slapped Wilson at Wilson's request, which Krasinski considered [...] "one of the craziest acting experiences I've ever had." [...] Before deciding on singing to a melody from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Ed Helms and Daniels shot 50 different versions. Another Willy Wonka reference includes Andy's mention of a chocolate factory and not wishing [...] "to fall into any chocolate river".|$|E
2500|$|Brown fat {{or brown}} adipose tissue is a {{specialized}} form of adipose tissue in humans and other mammals. It is located mainly {{around the neck}} and large blood vessels of the thorax. This specialized tissue can generate heat by [...] "uncoupling" [...] the respiratory chain of oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria. The process of uncoupling means that when protons transit down the electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, the energy from this process is released as heat rather than being used to generate ATP. This thermogenic process may be vital in neonates exposed to cold, which then require this thermogenesis to keep warm, as they are unable <b>to</b> <b>shiver,</b> or take other actions to keep themselves warm.|$|E

5000|$|Bloody Disgusting rated it 2.5/5 {{stars and}} {{compared}} it negatively <b>to</b> <b>Shivers,</b> Splinter, Slither, and Night of the Creeps. Paul Pritchard of DVD Verdict called it [...] "a flawed but entertaining low-budget movie" [...] that, while {{better than most}} direct-to-video horror, pales in comparison <b>to</b> <b>Shivers.</b> Annie Riordan of Brutal as Hell called it an incoherent film full of stereotypical and cliched characters. Justin Felix of DVD Talk rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, [...] "Growth has some issues with pacing - and believability, though given the genre that's almost a given - in its script. However, a strong cast (including an especially good performance by Nora Kirkpatrick in a main supporting role) and plentiful CG parasite mayhem make the film worthwhile for the horror crowd." ...|$|R

40|$|In many {{mathematical}} {{models of}} thennoregulation, {{the contribution of}} the various muscles <b>to</b> <b>shivering</b> is usually either based on the mass ratio of the muscles involved (1) or on a weighting that assigns <b>shivering</b> activity principally <b>to</b> the trunk muscles (2) (see Table). The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify experimentally the contri-bution of various muscles <b>to</b> <b>shivering</b> during whole body exposure to cold air. METHOD 1. Experimental. Data were obtained from ten male subjects resting in a supine position wearing shorts only and exposed to lOoC air (42 % relative humidity and < 0. 4 mls air flow) for 2 h. Surface EMG recordings were taken continuously using Medi Trace pediatric surface electrodes placed 3 cm apart, center to Center, on the pectoralis major (PE), rectus abdominus (AB), biceps femoris (BI), brachioradialis (BR), rectus femoris (FE), and gastronemius (GA) muscles. The first two and the latter four sites represent, respectively, the trunk and limb regions of the body. 2. Analysis. All EMG measurements were digitized at 1024 samples/so Back-ground (noise) and maximum voluntary contraction (mvc) signals were recorded for...|$|R

50|$|The first trait distinguishes mesotherms from ectotherms, {{the second}} from endotherms. For instance, endotherms, when cold, will {{generally}} resort <b>to</b> <b>shivering</b> or metabolizing brown fat {{to maintain a}} constant body temperature, leading to higher metabolic rates. A mesotherm, however, will experience lower body temperatures and lower metabolic rates as ambient temperature drop. In addition, mesotherm body temperatures tend to rise as body size increases (a phenomenon known as gigantothermy), unlike endotherms. This reflects the lower surface {{area to volume ratio}} in large animals, which reduces rates of heat loss.|$|R
40|$|Individual {{changes in}} heat {{production}} and body temperature were studied {{in response to}} cold exposure, prior <b>to</b> <b>shivering.</b> The subjects ten women (seven men) were of normal weight, had {{a mean age of}} 23 (SD 3) years and average BMI 22 · 2 (SD 1 · 6) Kg/m 2. They were lying supine under thermoneutral conditions for 30 min and were subsequently exposed to air of 15 °C until shivering occurred. Heat production was measured with a ventilated hood. Body composition was measured with underwater weighing and 2 H dilution. Body temperatures were measured with thermistors. Heat production during cold exposure prior <b>to</b> <b>shivering</b> increased and reached a plateau. Skin temperature decreased and did not reach a plateau during the test period. The non-shivering interval (NSI) ranged from 20 to 148 min, was not related to body composition and was not significantly different between women (81 (sd 15) min) and men (84 (sd 34) min). NSI was negatively related to skin temperature (r 2 0 · 44, P= 0 · 004), and skin temperature was related to heat production (r 2 0 · 39, P= 0 · 007) In conclusion, subjects with a relatively large heat production during cold exposure maintained a relatively high skin temperature but showed a short NSI, independent of differences in body composition...|$|R
