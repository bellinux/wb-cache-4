5|$|In {{the last}} years of his life Constantine made plans for a {{campaign}} against Persia. In a letter written to the king of Persia, Shapur, Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well. The letter is undatable. In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> the shape of a church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the Jordan River before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–337, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away. The campaign was called off, however, when Constantine became sick in the spring of 337.|$|E
5|$|Will, Neil and Jay's girlfriends {{have all}} {{broken up with}} them since {{the events of the}} last film, and Simon is unhappy with his girlfriend Lucy, who has become obsessive and abusive. Simon and Will are {{depressed}} and ostracised at university; Neil is working in a bank; and Jay is taking a gap year in Australia. He emails Neil, claiming that he is now a top DJ at a popular night club, lives in a luxury mansion, and has daily sex with multiple partners. This convinces them to visit him in Australia for their Easter holidays. Once they arrive at the club they find that Jay in fact only works as a toilet attendant and lives in a <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> his Uncle's front garden, while Will meets Katie, an old friend from his private school days, who is backpacking, and she persuades him to join her.|$|E
5|$|Chris pays a visit {{during his}} nightly jog, and Ann leaves with him {{so they can}} clear the air. Over dinner, Chris once again acts so optimistic while {{discussing}} the break-up that Ann thinks their relationship is back on and tries to kiss him, severely embarrassing her. Meanwhile, the camping trip proves unsuccessful and everybody decides to go home that night, but they are left without transportation because Tom and Ben have hooked all of their electronics to the van's battery, draining it. Everybody hikes to a strange bed and breakfast filled with cats and dolls called The Quiet Corn, run by a strict old lady named Elsa Clack (Annie O'Donnell). Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> the yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival. Ron, recognizing how burnt out she is, solves Leslie's problem by locking her in a bedroom and ordering her to get some sleep. With a rare full night's sleep energizing her, Leslie wakes up with numerous big ideas that are well received by Chris.|$|E

25|$|He was {{concerned}} because Mallory and Irvine {{seemed to be}} five hours behind their schedule. After this sighting, Odell continued on to Camp VI where he found the <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> chaotic disorder. At 2p.m. an intense snow squall began. Odell {{went out in the}} squall hoping to signal the two climbers who he believed would by now be descending. He whistled and shouted, hoping to lead them back to the tent, but gave up because of the intense cold. Odell holed up in C-VI until the squall ended at 4pm. He then scanned the mountain for Mallory and Irvine but saw no one.|$|E

25|$|Orr {{shares a}} tent with Yossarian, {{and is very}} {{mechanically}} adept, as he manages to make for them the most luxurious <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> the squadron. When working on small pieces for an oven stove in the tent, Yossarian sees his work as arduous and highly unnecessary as the pieces are too small for anything of real concern, yet at the end while using his stove, he realizes the intricate simplicity of improving the stove's performance. Although this tinkering drives Yossarian mad, any idea of harming Orr is so absurd that Yossarian can't follow through with it.|$|E
25|$|Jasmuheen offered similar defence in {{response}} to the death of Verity Linn, who may have died of self-starvation while practising Inedia in Scotland, her diary mentioning Jasmuheen's teachings.

In 2017 a Dutch woman living in a household of four practitioners of breatharianism inspired by Jasmuheen died under mysterious circumstances. The three remaining members of the household are suspected of withholding the malnourished woman adequate medical care.|$|E
25|$|The add-on side tent {{underwent}} a complete redesign. The new model (referred to in publicity materials as an Add-a-Room tent or a Motent) superficially resembles the late Split-windshield's framed <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> general shape and colors, but is otherwise quite different. For one, the tent's frame is now external, with the canvas supported by elastic loops and plastic hooks, somewhat like a shower curtain. Instead {{of a single}} opening front panel, there is a zippered screen door {{in the middle of}} the front (side away from the bus) with a small awning flap that can be lowered for wind and rain protection. This tent also features a waterproof floor, and the attachment method on the vehicle side results in a securely closable shelter (i.e., no more gap below the bus floor).|$|E
