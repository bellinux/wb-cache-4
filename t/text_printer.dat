40|$|With the {{extensive}} growth of technology, {{it is becoming}} prominent in making learning more interactive and effective. Due {{to the use of}} Internet based resources in the learning process, the visually impaired community faces difficulties. In this research we are focusing on developing an e-Learning solution that can be accessible by both normal and visually impaired users. Accessibility to tactile graphics is an important requirement for visually impaired people. Recurrent expenditure of the printers which support graphic printing such as thermal embossers is beyond the budget for most developing countries which cannot afford such a cost for printing images. Currently most of the books printed using normal <b>text</b> Braille <b>printers</b> ignore images in documents and convert only the textual part. Printing images and equations using normal <b>text</b> Braille <b>printers</b> is a main research area in the project. Mathematical content in a forum and simple images such as maps in a course page need to be made affordable using the normal <b>text</b> Braille <b>printer,</b> as these functionalities are not available in current Braille converters. The authors came up with an effective solution for the above problems and the solution is presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Tactile {{graphics}} {{allow the}} visually impaired to perceive twodimensional imagery, which {{is an essential part}} of experiencing the world and learning several subjects such as science and geography. In the developed world, such graphics are available to blind students from an early age, and students grow up familiar with tactile representations of images. The production of tactile graphics, however, requires extensive manual labor by sighted people, or costly graphical braille printers. Thus, blind students in developing regions often grow up without any exposure to these learning aids and as a consequence are often prevented from studying the sciences. In this work, we explore the potential of enhancing access to tactile graphics in the developing world through a software tool that can convert images to a form that can be printed as tactile images using lower-cost braille <b>text</b> <b>printers.</b> We investigate the effectiveness of this tool in producing different types of tactile graphics, and also explore the impact of these graphics on students and visually impaired teachers at a school for the blind in India. We find that our subjects are highly enthusiastic about tactile graphics, are quickly able to understand them, and learn how to write the alphabet using them...|$|R

50|$|The Devotio Moderna and the {{reformed}} Benedictines relied on reading devotional texts for instruction, and {{the written word}} was raised to {{a high level of}} importance not afforded by earlier religious movements.

Printing had exploded in Germany and the Low Countries, the home of the Devotio Moderna and Reformed Benedictines, as opposed to England and France. They were also the home to the beginnings of Late Manuscript Culture, because of the common desire for uniformity. Trimethius protested the invasion of the library by the printed book because of the missing aspect of devotion that had been present in preaching with ones' hands. With the preaching possible as a scribe, manuscripts had a function that was lacking in a printed book, though both possessed a greater degree of uniformity than earlier manuscripts.|$|R
40|$|Science {{is never}} just an {{intellectual}} affair: {{there are also}} cultural, materiial and commercial dimensions. Knowledge becomes science. only when it is reproduced and cmnmunicated. Knowledge, communication and commerce are narrowly entwined and the interaction between them determines determines what we call science. To understand the development of science {{it is important to}} recognize and research this interaction, In early modern times, book publishers were very significant in making science possible. simply because they shared knowledge. Moreover, they were able to influence science itself by the way they selected and presented the knowledge they published. Their role in the production of a book was far from passive. Early modern publishers were active intermediates and very important in laying out the scientific infrastructure of their time. Very interesting in this respect is the Amstedam publisher Willem Jansz Blaeu (1571 - 1638). Blaeu is most famous as a cartographer, but he was a lot more than this: Blaeu was a mathematician, a typographer, a publisher and a merchant; he presented, communicated and sold knowledge and thereby shaped the science of his day. This thesis examines what part Blaeu played in the scbolarly world. It shows how he made knowledge public and to what extent he was able to put his seal upon this knowledge. It turns out that, in addition to great ideas, scIence demands blood, sweat and tears, as well as material goods such as paper, ink and money. Knowledge is communicated in many ways: through public lectures and private conversations, in letters and other manuscripts, in print and on the internet. The invention of printing was a crucial point in the history of science. From the middle of the fifteenth century, printing made it possible to disseminate scientific texts, illustratiom and tabIes in large quantities. Scholars could gather and compare more knowledge. Wwith the aid of the printing press, it became possible to spread (new) knowledge more quickly, allowing many others to build on it. Thus a printer was literally someone who reproduced knowledge. Around 1600, publishing in printed books was certainly not the only way to communicate knowledge. However, it was the only way to make information accessible for the general (invisible and partly unknown) public and to preserve it for posterity. At first, this was delivered in books and pamphlets, and then later in the seventeenth century, the first scientific journals appeared. The emphasis on printed matter is justified, be it simply because most people encountered new knowledge in ptinted form. The production of books different phases in which different people contributed to the final form and content. In addition to authors and editors of a <b>text,</b> <b>printers,</b> publishers and booksellers were of great importance. They presented the author's ideas, so that they became attractive for others; to read, to work with and (therefore) to purchase. ...|$|R

Aniara was an example of an avant-garde idiom in expressionist dance. She left the Opera in 1967 and subsequently spent much time on research trips. Åkesson wanted to find the real essence of dance and its roots, which brought her to Africa. She said that the dance in Europe had lost contact with their origin, and the best ways to study the origins were in Africa. From there she collected a number of dance masks from different countries. After Åkesson’s death, her collection of dance masks was donated to the Museum of Ethnography, Sweden, whom subsequently had a show of them in 2008.

50|$|The printer was {{essentially}} a re-packaged 9-pin dot matrix printer from C. Itoh Electronics (model C. Itoh 8510, with a modified ROM and pinout), released the same year. It was introduced {{as a replacement for}} the earlier parallel-based Apple Dot Matrix Printer/DMP (also a C. Itoh model) and, while primarily intended for the Apple II, worked across Apple's entire computer product line. The ImageWriter could produce images as well as text, up to a resolution of 144 DPI and a speed of about 120 CPS (characters per second). In <b>text</b> mode, the <b>printer</b> was logic-seeking, meaning it would print with the head moving in both directions while it would print only in one direction for graphics and Near Letter Quality. The ImageWriter was also supported by the original Macintosh computer, the Macintosh 128K. Apple wanted a graphical printer for the Mac, and had introduced the ImageWriter primarily to support the new machine. This permitted it to produce WYSIWYG output from the screen of the computer, which was an important aspect for promoting the concept of the GUI and, later, desktop publishing. The ImageWriter could be supported by Microsoft Windows-based PC's by using the included C. Itoh 8510 compatible driver.|$|R

Why did the English humanist give his <b>text</b> to this <b>printer</b> and not to someone like Johann Froben in Basel or Jodocus Badius Ascensius in Paris? In fact, Thomas More didn’t choose Theodoricus Martinus randomly, but had been guided by his friend Erasmus, who was living in Brabant at that time and was working directly with this printer. The humanist from Rotterdam then instructed his circle to monitor closely the printing of the text, to do the proofreading and to direct the publishing. He involved in this process his friend Petrus Aegidius – clerk of city of Antwerp and close friend of both More and Erasmus – and Gerardus Geldenhower. By studying the correspondence of Erasmus, we will first rebuild the process of printing the first edition of the Utopia. This will also be an opportunity to discover the role and the importance of a network of humanists within the workshop of a printer.

40|$|Microprinting is {{utilized}} in {{many types of}} documents for authentication and anticounterfeiting purposes. Elements of microprinting are usually text and not readable to the human eye {{without the aid of}} magnification. A series of test targets were developed to evaluate the capability of the Kodak NexPress 2100, the HP Indigo 5000 and the Heidelberg Speedmaster 74 printing systems to render micro text. The primary criterion that determines the ability of a printing device to render micro elements are: addressability, spot size, font selection, workflow (e. g. file processing), and resolution. All three devices were capable of reproducing micro text. While the 600 spots per inch device was capable of reproducing acceptable results under specific conditions, the devices with higher addressability performed proportionally better under the same conditions. San-serif fonts found in Adobe Illustrator can be used for microprinting and the programming of custom Postscript fonts is not necessary. Among the four fonts tested in this study, Lucida Console was the best suited for microprinting. Workflow greatly impacted each device’s ability to render the micro text. While it remains true that the photocopying of micro text will render only a continuous line, the ability for digital print devices to render micro text directly suggests {{that there is a need}} for a re-evaluation of current techniques for forensic identification of specific print processes.
