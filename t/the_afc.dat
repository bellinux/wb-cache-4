5|$|In the Wild Card Round, the sixth-seeded Jets beat <b>the</b> <b>AFC</b> South {{champion}} and third-seeded Colts 17–16 on January 8, 2011, at the Colts' home field, Lucas Oil Stadium, {{to qualify for}} the Divisional Playoffs. The following week, on January 16, they defeated <b>the</b> <b>AFC</b> East {{champion and}} first-seeded Patriots 28–21, ending New England's eight-game winning streak.

5|$|Originally, {{the home}} {{teams in the}} playoffs were decided based on a yearly rotation. From 1970 to 1974, the {{division}}al playoff round rotated which of the three division champions would not have home field advantage, with the wild-card teams and the teams they would face in the divisional playoff game would never have home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Starting in 1970, the divisional playoff games consisted of <b>the</b> <b>AFC</b> Central champions and the NFC West champions playing their games on the road. Then in 1971 it rotated to <b>the</b> <b>AFC</b> East champions and the NFC East champions playing their games on the road. In the 1972 divisional playoff games, <b>the</b> <b>AFC</b> West champions and the NFC Central champions were the visiting teams. And 1973 it would start all over with <b>the</b> <b>AFC</b> Central and NFC West again, and so on.|$|E

Through 2008, Pittsburgh is the only team to have won <b>the</b> <b>AFC</b> North four times, since its inception prior to the 2002 NFL season. Entering the 2008 season, the Steelers were chosen to win the division by sportswriter Ron Borges, as well as nine of 13 analysts interviewed by ESPN.com.
