2500|$|To ease {{traffic in}} the city centre and to provide an {{efficient}} <b>traffic</b> <b>distributor</b> around the city, in particular where the Inner Ring Road does not help, the city centre loop was created.

2500|$|The 1948 Transportation Plan for San Francisco, {{prepared}} by De Leuw, Cather and Company, included the Central Freeway. This elevated roadway would {{begin at the}} Bayshore Freeway– the approach to the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge– near Division Street and head west and north around the periphery of downtown San Francisco. This portion would include junctions with the Mission Freeway (south and southwest along Mission Street to Daly City) at the southwest corner and the Panhandle Freeway (west through the Panhandle into Golden Gate Park) along the west side. After swinging northeast and back north to {{the east side of}} Van Ness Avenue (continuing as a double-decked structure between Van [...] Ness Ave. and Polk Street), a pair of ramps would split to the east, taking downtown traffic to and from the one-way pair of Bush and Pine Streets. At Clay Street, the freeway would descend to meet the rising terrain, ending at Broadway just east of Van Ness Avenue as a single level depressed roadway. A short tunnel would curve northwest to a portal in Van Ness Avenue north of Broadway, taking traffic onto Van Ness Avenue towards the Golden Gate Bridge. Along with the Embarcadero and Broadway Tunnel, which were listed for rebuilding as ground-level expressways rather than the freeway (Embarcadero Freeway) that was later partially built and demolished, the Central Freeway would have provided a full <b>traffic</b> <b>distributor</b> loop around downtown.|$|E

50|$|The Plessey 5005 {{was made}} up of routers and {{distributor}}s. A distributor performed subscriber concentration and could serve up to 500 lines. A router made up the core of the exchange for switching <b>traffic</b> between <b>distributors</b> or between a distributor and an external junction/trunk. The exchange at Broughton was initially dimensioned to serve 2,000 lines and therefore had four distributors and one router. A 5005 could serve up to 100,000 lines, but no inland exchanges of this size were used in the UK.|$|R
50|$|An {{intersection}} is {{a highway}} layout that permits traffic from one controlled-access highway to access another {{and vice versa}} whereas an access point is a highway layout where <b>traffic</b> from a <b>distributor</b> or local road can join a controlled-access highway. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, do not distinguish between the two, but other, such as Germany; make a distinction using the word Kreuz (cross) for the former and Ausfahrt (exit) for the other. In all cases one road crosses the other via a bridge.|$|R
50|$|By 2012, cycling in Amsterdam {{had grown}} tremendously in {{popularity}} — up by some 40% {{in the previous}} twenty years. The city had 490,000 fietsers (cyclists) take to the road to cycle 2 million kilometres every day according to statistics of the city council. This has caused some problems as, despite 35,000 kilometers of bicycle paths, the country's 18 million bicycles (1.3 per citizen old enough to ride) were clogging Amsterdam's streets at peak times and parked bicycles were overcrowding train stations and other areas. This is being addressed by building even more bike lanes and bicycle parking stations with much greater capacity to tackle a problem many other cities {{in the world would}} envy, that of bicycle traffic congestion. Safety is also a concern, mainly on infrastructure that does not yet conform to the modern Dutch road safety policies of Sustainable Safety. Advance stop lines or otherwise little protection at <b>traffic</b> lights on <b>distributor</b> roads is a major cause of collisions, including the death of a 7-year-old girl under a garbage truck in 2013 on a road which did not include protected cycle paths.|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{traffic volume}} {{in the urban}} areas is leading {{to a series of}} {{negative}} effects such as congestion or emission of air pollutants. The city of Amsterdam is no exception to this trend and a sustainable solution is sought in the area of Traffic Management and Intelligent Transportation Systems. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop a traffic management strategy that enhances the <b>traffic</b> performance in <b>distributor</b> roads (Plus Network Auto in Amsterdam) during saturated conditions (AM and PM peak). After the analysis of the current state of the traffic management in the municipality of Amsterdam, an opportunity has been detected in which a combination of the different systems in place can be used to improve the traffic performance of the local road network. Travel time and delay measurements retrieved from inductive-loop detectors, automatic number plate recognition cameras and floating car data are used in a top-level urban traffic controller that combines the traffic responsiveness of a vehicle-actuated controller with the effective coordination of a fixed-time controller. The proposed controller can act locally when the delay measurements show congestion at a single intersection or along the whole corridor when the average speed drops below a specified threshold. A microscopic simulation model of the Zuidas district for the year 2030 and the PM peak has been used to evaluate the proposed top-level controller compared to the currently used vehicle-actuated controller and the coordinated fixed-time controller. The results show that the average speed in the main corridor has been increased by 28, 5 % and meets the desired speed set by the municipality for the Plus Network Auto. Overall delays at the intersections are reduced in average by 11, 60 % while the effect on the public transport modes remains similar. However, the coordinated fixed-time controller has shown even a better performance than the proposed top-level controller, for which a series of recommendations have been issued...|$|R
