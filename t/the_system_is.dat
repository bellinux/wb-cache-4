5|$|Bees may be solitary or {{may live}} in {{various types of}} communities. Sociality, of several {{different}} types, appears to have evolved independently many times within the bees. The most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies; these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations. This division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes. In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, {{and if there is}} a division of labour within the group, they are considered semisocial. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the queen) and her daughters (workers). When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> considered primitively eusocial, as in many paper wasps; when the castes are morphologically discrete, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> considered highly eusocial.|$|E

40|$|An {{open-loop}} control strategy for vibration suppression of a flexible manipulator system using genetic algorithms {{is presented in}} this paper. This consists of developing suitable forcing functions so that the dominant vibration modes of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>are</b> not excited and hence <b>the</b> <b>system</b> vibration <b>is</b> reduced. <b>The</b> method requires that the vibration modes of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>be</b> determined very precisely. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used for this purpose. Low-pass and band-stop (elliptic type) filtered bang-bang torque inputs are accordingly developed {{on the basis of}} the identified vibration modes.
