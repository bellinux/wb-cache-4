25|$|In Phase I {{clinical}} trials, curcumin had poor bioavailability, {{was rapidly}} metabolized, retained low levels in plasma and tissues, and was extensively and rapidly excreted, factors that make its in vivo bioactivity unlikely {{and difficult to}} accurately assess. Curcumin appears to reduce circulating C-reactive protein in human subjects, although no dose-response relationship was established. Factors that limit the bioactivity of curcumin or its analogs include chemical instability, water insolubility, absence of potent and selective target activity, low bioavailability, limited <b>tissue</b> <b>distribution,</b> extensive metabolism, and potential for toxicity.|$|E

25|$|The {{effector}} of {{both the}} Gαs and Gαi/o pathways is the cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-generating enzyme adenylate cyclase, or AC. While there are ten different AC gene products in mammals, each with subtle differences in <b>tissue</b> <b>distribution</b> or function, all catalyze the conversion of cytosolic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP, and all are directly stimulated by G-proteins of the Gαs class. In contrast, however, interaction with Gα subunits of the Gαi/o type inhibits AC from generating cAMP. Thus, a GPCR coupled to Gαs counteracts {{the actions of a}} GPCR coupled to Gαi/o, and vice versa. The level of cytosolic cAMP may then determine the activity of various ion channels as well as members of the ser/thr-specific protein kinase A (PKA) family. Thus cAMP is considered a second messenger and PKA a secondary effector.|$|E
25|$|Mice made {{deficient}} in their 12/15-lipoxygenase gene (Alox15) exhibit a prolonged inflammatory response along with various {{other aspects of}} a pathologically enhanced inflammatory response in experimental models of cornea injury, airway inflammation, and peritonitis. These mice also show an accelerated rate of progression of atherosclerosis whereas mice made to overexpress 12/15-lipoxygenase exhibit a delayed rate of atherosclerosis development. Alox15 overexpressing rabbits exhibited reduced tissue destruction and bone loss in a model of periodontitis. Finally, Control mice, but not 12/15-lipoxygense deficient mice responded to eicospentaenoic acid administration by decreasing the number of lesions in a model of endometriosis. These studies indicate that the suppression of inflammation is a major function of 12/15-lipoxygenase and the Specialized proresolving mediators it produces in rodents; although rodent 12/15-lipoxygenase differs from human ALOX15 in {{the profile of the}} PUFA metabolites that it produces as well as various other parameters (e.g. <b>tissue</b> <b>distribution),</b> these genetic studies allow that human ALOX15 and the specialized proresolving mediators it produces may play a similar major anti-inflammatory function in humans.|$|E

2500|$|Molecular Mimicry – An {{exogenous}} antigen may share structural similarities {{with certain}} host antigens; thus, any antibody produced against this antigen (which mimics the self-antigens) can also, in theory, bind {{to the host}} antigens, and amplify the immune response. The idea of molecular mimicry arose {{in the context of}} Rheumatic Fever, which follows infection with Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci. Although rheumatic fever has been attributed to molecular mimicry for half a century no antigen has been formally identified (if anything too many have been proposed). Moreover, the complex <b>tissue</b> <b>distribution</b> of the disease (heart, joint, skin, basal ganglia) argues against [...] a cardiac specific antigen. It remains entirely possible that the disease is due to e.g. an unusual interaction between immune complexes, complement components and endothelium.|$|E
2500|$|Signalling by type I {{and type}} II OSM receptors {{have now been}} shown to be qualitatively distinct. These {{differences}} in signaling character, in addition to the <b>tissue</b> <b>distribution</b> profiles of OSMRb and LIFRb, offer another variable in the distinction between the common and specific cellular effects of OSM with respect to LIF. [...] All IL-6 cytokines whether they homo- or heterodimerise gp130 seem to activate JAK1, JAK2 and to a lesser degree Tyk2. It should be noted however that JAK1, JAK2, and tyk2 are not interchangeable in the gp130 system, this has been demonstrated with the use of JAK1, Jak2 or Tyk2 deficient cell lines obtained from mutant mice. Cells from JAK1 deficient mice show reduced STAT activation and generation of biological responses in response to IL-6 and LIF. In contrast, fibroblasts derived from JAK2 null mice can respond to IL-6, with demonstratable tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130, JAK1 and TYK2. Thus it seems JAK1 is the critical JAK required for gp130 signalling. Activation of the same Jaks by all three receptor combinations (gp130/gp130, gp130/LIFR, gp130/OSMR) raises the question of how IL6, LIF and OSM can activate distinct intracellular signaling pathways. Selection of particular substrates, i.e. STAT isoform, depended not on which Jak is activated, but instead are determined by specific motifs, especially tyrosine-based motifs, within each receptor intracellular domain.|$|E

40|$|Corroboration of mechano-regulation {{algorithms}} is difficult, {{partly because}} repeatable experimental outcomes under a controlled mechanical environment are necessary, but rarely available. In distraction osteogenesis (DO), a controlled displacement {{is used to}} regenerate large volumes of new bone, with predictable and reproducible outcomes, allowing to computationally study the potential mechanisms that stimulate bone formation. We hypothesized that mechano-regulation by octahedral shear strain and fluid velocity can predict the spatial and temporal <b>tissue</b> <b>distributions</b> seen during experimental DO. Variations in predicted <b>tissue</b> <b>distributions</b> due to alterations in distraction rate and frequency could then also be studied. An in vivo ovine tibia experiment evaluating bone-segment transport (distraction, 1 mm/day) over an intramedullary nail was used for comparison. A 2 D axisymmetric finite element model, with a geometry originating from the experimental data, was created and included into a previously developed model of tissue differentiation. Cells migrated and proliferated into the callus, differentiating into fibroblasts, chondrocytes or osteoblasts, dependent on the biophysical stimuli. Matrix production was modelled with an osmotic swelling model to allow tissues to grow at individual rates. The temporal and spatial <b>tissue</b> <b>distributions</b> predicted by the computational model agreed well with those seen experimentally. In addition, {{it was observed that}} decreased distraction rate (0. 5 mm/d vs. 0. 25 mm/d) increased the overall time needed for complete bone regeneration, whereas increased distraction frequency (0. 5 mm/ 12 h vs. 0. 25 mm/ 6 h) stimulated faster bone regeneration, as found in experimental findings by others. Thus, the algorithm regulated by octahedral shear strain and fluid velocity was able to predict the bone regeneration patterns dependent on distraction rate and frequency during DO...|$|R
