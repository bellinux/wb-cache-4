The two image pairs were colocated to the same grid (25 -m resolution), and a supervised ice type classification {{was performed on the}} TM images in order to classify ice free, nilas, gray ice, gray-white ice, <b>thin</b> <b>first-year</b> <b>ice,</b> medium and thick first-year ice, and old ice. Comparison of the collocated SAR pixels showed that ice-free areas can only be classified under calm wind conditions (less than 3 m/s) and for surface winds greater than 10 m/s based on the backscattering coefficient alone. This is true for pack ice regions during the cold months of the year where ice-free areas are spatially limited and where the capillary waves that cause SAR backscatter are dampened by entrained ice crystals. For nilas, two distinct backscatter classes were found at - 17 dB and at - 10 dB. The higher backscattering coefficient is attributed to the presence of frost flowers on light nilas. Gray and gray-white ice have a backscatter signature similar to first-year ice and therefore cannot be distinguished by SAR alone. First-year and old ice can be clearly separated based on their backscattering coefficient. The performance of the Geophysical Processor System ice classifier was tested against the Landsat derived ice products. It was found that smooth first-year ice and rough first-year ice were not significantly different in the backscatter domain. Ice concentration estimates based on ERS 1 C band SAR showed an error range of 5 to 8 % for high ice concentration regions, mainly due to misclassified ice-free and smooth first-year ice areas. This error is expected to increase for areas of lower ice concentration. The combination of C band SAR and TM channels 2, 4, and 6 resulted in ice typing performance with an estimated accuracy of 90 % for all seven ice classes...|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{thinning}} {{of arctic}} sea ice {{over the last}} few decades has resulted in significant declines in the coverage of thick multi-year ice accompanied by a proportional increase in <b>thinner</b> <b>first-year</b> <b>ice.</b> This change is often attributed to changes in the arctic atmosphere, both in composition and large-scale circulation, and greater inflow of warmer Pacific water through the Bering Strait. The Atlantic Water (AW) entering the Arctic through Fram Strait has often been considered less important because of strong stratification in the Arctic Ocean and the deeper location of AW compared to Pacific water. In our combined examination of oceanographic measurements and satellite observations of ice concentration and thickness, we find evidence that AW has a direct impact on the thinning of arctic sea ice downstream of Svalbard Archipelago. The affected area extends as far as Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago. The imprints of AW appear as local minima in sea ice thickness; ice thickness is significantly less than that expected of <b>first-year</b> <b>ice.</b> Our lower-end conservative estimates indicate that the recent AW warming episode could have contributed up to 150 – 200 km 3 of sea ice melt per year, which would constitute about 20 % of the total 900 km 3 yr&minus; 1 negative trend in sea ice volume since 2004...|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{the design}} of ships and {{offshore}} structures intended for operation in ice infested waters has been based upon elastic methods of plasticity. However, through development of knowledge regarding the true behaviour of structural components in the large deflection and post-ultimate resistance range, the achievement of more consistent utilization of strength members has become possible. Overloading {{in the case of}} ice loading is quite typical and hard to overlook. To minimize the consequences of these overload conditions; a better understanding of structure behaviour within the plastic range has become necessary. Notwithstanding the plastic design method can be somewhat more complex than the elastic approach; the method may result in significant reduction in steel weight. In this purpose, the International Association of ship Classification Societies, (IACS), has initiated new unified rules for Polar ships, in collaboration with the Russian Register and partly by experience from DNV and other classification societies. These rules are based on plastic methods to determine the scantlings of plating, stiffeners and girders, such that the structure can resist the maximum pressures and forces as the ship is crushing the iceIn the IACS unified rules, a steel Polar Ship intended for navigation in ice-infested polar waters is assigned a class notation PCi, as described in table 1 in the IACS polar class requirement I 1.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of summer arctic sea ice over the satellite era show that record or near record lows for the ice extent {{occurred in the}} years 2002 – 2004. To determine the physical processes contributing to these changes in the arctic pack ice, we analyzed model results from a regional coupled ice– ocean model. Since 1988 {{the thickness of the}} simulated basin-wide ice thinned by 1. 31 m or 43 %. The thinning is greatest along the coast in the sector from the Chukchi Sea to the Beaufort Sea to Greenland. We hypothesize that the thinning since 1988 is due to preconditioning, a trigger, and positive feedbacks: (1) The fall, winter, and spring air temperatures over the Arctic Ocean have gradually increased over the last 50 years leading to reduced thickness of <b>first-year</b> <b>ice</b> at the start of summer; (2) a temporary shift, starting in 1989, of two principal climate indexes (the Arctic Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) caused a flushing of some of the older, thicker ice out of the basin and an increase in the summer open water extent; (3) the increasing amounts of summer open water allow for increasing absorption of solar radiation, which melts the ice, warms the water, and promotes creation of <b>thinner</b> <b>first-year</b> <b>ice,</b> ice which often entirely melts {{by the end of the}} subsequent summer. Internal thermodynamic changes related to the positive ice-albedo feedback, not external forcing, dominate the thinning processes over the last 16 years. This feedback continues to drive the thinning after the climate indexes return to near normal conditions in the late 1990 s. The late 1980 s and early 1990 s could be considered a tipping point during which the ice-ocean system began to enter a new era of thinning ice and increasing summer open water because of positive feedbacks. It remains to be seen if this era will persist or if a sustained cooling period can reverse the processes. A tipping point for arctic sea ic...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRecent observations {{have shown that}} the sea ice coverage and thickness in the Arctic Ocean is significantly decreasing. Areas of the Arctic that have traditionally been covered year-round with thick multiyear ice are being replaced by <b>thinner</b> <b>first-year</b> <b>ice</b> and open water. This results in increased amounts of solar radiation being absorbed and stored as heat in the upper ocean, where it is available for enhanced basal melting of sea ice. Measurements from Autonomous Ocean Flux Buoys (AOFBs) and Ice-Tethered Profilers (ITPs) were correlated to determine the ocean properties of the ice-ocean boundary layer (IOBL). High-resolution satellite imagery was processed to determine sensor positions within the image. Heat content of the IOBL was calculated by vertically integrating the departure from freezing for the time series along the AOFB drift track. This study represents one of the first attempts to quantify local open water fraction and upper ocean heat content using 1 -meter pixel resolution imagery. Results indicate that the use of high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to accurately quantify local open water fraction.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we define {{the concept of}} {{information}} fusion and show how we used it to estimate summer sea ice concentration in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) from single-channel SAR satellite imagery. We used data about melt stage, wind speed, and surface temperature to generate temporally-accumulated information, and fused this information with the SAR image, resulting in an interpretation of summer MIZ imagery. We also used the results of previous classifications of the same area to guide and correct future interpretations, thus fusing historical information with imagery and nonimagery data. We chose to study the summer MIZ since summer melt conditions cause classification based upon backscatter intensity to fail, as the backscatter of open water, <b>thin</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>first-year</b> <b>ice,</b> and multiyear ice overlap to a large degree.

40|$|The {{large-scale}} Arctic sea-ice retreat induces {{a gradual}} replacement of thick, multi-year sea <b>ice</b> by <b>thinner</b> <b>first-year</b> <b>ice.</b> The latter has distinctive physical properties {{and is in}} particular substantially saltier. It is generally thought that while salt rejection occurs primarily during ice formation in winter, {{most of the remaining}} brine is flushed out of the ice by the percolating surface melt water in summer. Here, it is argued that a substantial part of this residual desalination of <b>first-year</b> sea <b>ice</b> can occur well before summer melt, due to brine convection over the full thickness of the ice, once the ice temperature is higher than a threshold that depends on bulk salinity and thickness. This critical temperature is substantially higher than the permeability threshold. The argument stems from a theoretical analysis of the porous Rayleigh number depicting the propensity for convection in the mushy-layer theory. It is supported by simulations performed with a state-of-the-art 1 -D sea-ice model. The study was initially motivated by observations collected in March 2007 in Storfjorden, Svalbard. Those are indirect, however, and are thus presented here as a possible example. Two sporadic anomalies of seawater salinity were recorded close to the base of 40 cm thick ice in temperature conditions that are incompatible with ice formation. Analyses and simulations forced with observed atmospheric conditions suggest that the second peak is caused by flushing of meltwater, while the first and most intense peak is likely associated with an episode of brine convection over the full depth of the ice, yielding significant desalination.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of Arctic sea ice {{show that the}} decrease in summer ice cover {{over the last few}} decades has occurred in conjunction with a significant loss of multiyear ice. The transition to an Arctic that is popu-lated by <b>thinner,</b> <b>first-year</b> sea <b>ice</b> has important implications for future trends in area and volume. Here, a reducedmodel forArctic sea ice is developed. This model is used to investigate how the survivability of <b>first-year</b> and multiyear <b>ice</b> controls the mean state, variability, and trends in ice area and volume. A hindcast with a global dynamic–thermodynamic sea ice model that traces <b>first-year</b> and multiyear <b>ice</b> is used to estimate the survivability of each ice type. These estimates of survivability, in concert with the reduced model, yield persistence time scales of September area and volume anomalies and the characteristics of the sensitivity of sea ice to climate forcing that compare well with a fully coupled climate model. The September area is found to be nearly in equilibriumwith climate forcing at all times, and therefore the observed decline in summer sea ice cover is a clear indication of a changing climate. Keeping an account of <b>first-year</b> and multiyear <b>ice</b> area within global climatemodels offers a powerful way to evaluate thosemodels with observations, and could help to constrain projections of sea ice decline in a warming climate. 1...|$|R

Then, theoretical results are compared with experimental data for new <b>thin</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>first-year</b> <b>ice,</b> and multi-year ice. Sea ice is modeled as a layer medium containing random scatterers and rough interfaces. For multi-year sea ice with snow cover, the sea ice layer is modeled as an ice background with embedded spheroidal air bubbles {{and the snow}} layer as air with ice grains. The hummocky topography on multi-year ice {{is characterized by a}} Gaussian distribution which has an averaging effect on backscattering coefficients. <b>First-year</b> sea <b>ice</b> is described by an ice medium hosting ellipsoidal brine inclusions. These inclusions are oriented preferentially in the vertical direction due to the columnar structure of <b>first-year</b> sea <b>ice.</b> Azimuthally, the orientation of the brine pockets are random corresponding to the random c-axes in sea ice, unless the axes are oriented by sea currents. For thin ice in newly opened leads, it has been observed that there exists a thin brine layer with very high salinity on the top surface of the new ice. This brine layer is depicted as a medium with high permittivity which can significantly affect electromagnetic scattering signatures from the lower thin ice layer, with a higher fractional volume of brine inclusions due to higher salinity as compared to thick <b>first-year</b> sea <b>ice.</b> The rough medium interfaces are described as Gaussian rough surfaces characterized by root-mean-square heights and surface correlation lengths. The contribution from rough surface, calculated under the Kirchhoff approximation or small perturbation method, is assumed to be independent from volume scattering.

40|$|Abstract To better {{simulate}} the seasonal evolution of sea {{ice in the}} Arctic, with {{particular attention to the}} marginal ice zone, a sea ice model of the distribution of ice thickness, floe size, and enthalpy was implemented into the Pan-arctic Ice–Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS). Theories on floe size distribution (FSD) and ice thickness distribution (ITD) were coupled in order to explicitly simulate multicategory FSD and ITD distributions simultaneously. The expanded PIOMAS was then used to estimate the seasonal evolution of the Arctic FSD in 2014 when FSD observations are available for model calibration and validation. Results indicate that the simulated FSD, commonly described equivalently as cumulative floe number distribution (CFND), generally follows a power law across space and time and agrees with the CFND observations derived from TerraSAR-X satellite images. The simulated power-law exponents also correlate with those derived using MODIS images, with a low mean bias of – 2 %. In the marginal ice zone, the modeled CFND shows a large number of small floes in winter because of stronger winds acting on <b>thin,</b> weak <b>first-year</b> <b>ice</b> in the ice edge region. In mid-spring and summer, the CFND resembles an upper truncated power law, with the largest floes mostly broken into smaller ones; however, the number of small floes is lower than in winter because floes of small sizes or <b>first-year</b> <b>ice</b> are easily melted away. In the ice pack interior there are fewer floes in late fall and winter than in summer because many of the floes are “welded” together into larger floes in freezing conditions, leading to a relatively flat CFND with low power-law exponents. The simulated mean floe size averaged over all ice-covered areas shows a clear annual cycle, large in winter and smaller in summer. However, there is no obvious annual cycle of mean floe size averaged over the marginal ice zone. The incorporation of FSD into PIOMAS results in reduced ice thickness, mainly in the marginal ice zone, which improves the simulation of ice extent and yields an earlier ice retreat...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{the mean}} sea ice {{thickness}} and concentration in the Arctic are well known. However, quantitative information about changes in the ice thickness distribution and {{the composition of the}} pack ice is lacking. In this paper we determine the ice draft distributions, mean and modal thicknesses, and their regional and seasonal variability in the Arctic for the time period 1975 – 2000. We compare characteristics of the Arctic pack ice for the years 1975 – 1987 and 1988 – 2000. These periods represent different large-scale atmospheric circulation modes and sea ice circulation patterns, most evident in clearly weaker Beaufort Gyre and stronger as well as westward shifted Transpolar Drift during the later period. The comparison of these two periods reveals that the peak of sea ice draft distributions has narrowed and shifted toward thinner ice, with reductions in both mean and modal ice draft. These noticeable changes are attributed to the loss of thick, mostly deformed ice. Springtime, loss of ice volume with draft greater than 5 m exceeds 35 % in all regions except the Nansen Basin, with as much as 45 % or more at the North Pole and in the Eastern Arctic. Autumn volume reduction, mostly of deformed ice, exceeds 40 % in the Canada Basin only, but is above 30 % also in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. During the later period, the volume of ice category consisting <b>thin,</b> mostly level <b>first-year</b> <b>ice,</b> is clearly larger than during the former period, especially in the spring. In the Beaufort Sea region, changes in the composition of ice cover have resulted in a shift of modal draft from level multiyear ice draft range to values of level <b>first-year</b> <b>ice.</b> The regional and seasonal variability of sea ice draft has decreased, since the thinning has been most pronounced in regions with the thickest pack ice (the Western Arctic), and during the spring (0. 6 – 0. 8 m per decade) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{contribution}} of the atmospheric circulation to a record minimum extent of open water in the polar Ross Sea (RS) region in the 2003 austral summer is examined. Two major findings are reached in this study. The first is that the origins of this anomaly are more complex than previously thought, with an anomalous atmospheric circu-lation contributing {{at least as much}} to the lack of open water as damming of sea ice by a large iceberg known as C- 19. Only in the western RS, where C- 19 lay, is damming found to restrict open water in the spring of 2002 (October–December), but even here the coldest spring in the last 15 years extended the sea-ice formation season. Elsewhere in the RS the divergent northward ice drift that normally occurs widely reversed to southward in early spring and was then followed by negligible ice motion. The most anomalous springtime ice drift occurred in the cen-tral and eastern RS rather than near C- 19 and was mirrored in the weakest southerly winds on record in central areas. The unusual southward ice drift in early spring 2002 caused widespread convergence and compaction of the normally <b>thin</b> and undeformed <b>first-year</b> <b>ice</b> along and north of the central and eastern Ross Ice Shelf (RIS). Compacted ice with few leads would have been slow to melt in the warmest summer (January–February) months. Direct observations also indicate that sea surface temperatures (SSTs) rapidly fell to freezing in the central and western RS in February 2003 supporting new ice formation. All the available data indicate these were due to the cold spring and the extensive, compact ice cover in the late spring of 2002 and in January 2003 preventing mos...|$|R

Two multi-year floes were sampled in June (each about 5 m thick) and another floe in August (over 6 m thick). In June, ice salinity was less than 2 ‰ {{to a depth of}} 1. 4 m. The strength of the multi-year ice was 56 % and 47 % of its maximum mid-winter strength (30 MPa) in June and August, respectively. The floeberg ice was so-called because it was about 30 m thick, was extremely level and the extracted 1. 2 m core had no measurable salinity. In June, the temperature profile of the floeberg ice showed that ice above a depth of 1. 6 m was warmer than – 2 °C, whereas below that depth the ice was – 6. 8 °C.

40|$|The {{microwave}} backscatter statistics {{of the sea}} ice cover in the winter Beaufort Sea were characterized using C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data collected by ERS- 1. Sea ice backscatter signatures were sampled from SAR image data collected {{during the winter of}} 1991 / 92 and winter of 1992 / 93. The spatial and temporal variabilities of the backscatter signatures of different ice types are discussed. The results show considerable seasonal stability of the backscatter signature of multi-year ice as well as <b>first-year</b> <b>ice.</b> Small amplitude regional variations of the multi-year ice backscatter can be observed. Consistent contrast between multiyear <b>ice</b> and <b>first-year</b> <b>ice</b> is maintained throughout the season...|$|R
40|$|X-band (HH) {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) data of sea ice collected during the Marginal Ice Zone Experiment in March and April of 1987 was statistically analyzed with respect to discriminating open water, <b>first-year</b> <b>ice,</b> multiyear ice, and Odden. Odden are large expanses of nilas ice that rapidly form in the Greenland Sea and transform into pancake ice. A first-order statistical analysis indicated that mean versus variance can segment out open water and <b>first-year</b> <b>ice,</b> and skewness versus modified skewness can segment the Odden and multilayer categories. In additions to first-order statistics, a model has been generated for the distribution function of the SAR ice data. Segmentation of ice types was also attempted using textural measurements. In this case, the general co-occurency matrix was evaluated. The textural method did not generate better results than the first-order statistical approach...|$|R
50|$|Because Antarctic <b>ice</b> {{is mainly}} <b>first-year</b> <b>ice,</b> {{which is not}} as thick as multiyear ice, it is {{generally}} less than a few meters thick. Snowfall and flooding of the ice can thicken it substantially, and the layer structure of Antarctic ice is often quite complex.|$|R
40|$|Analysis of 33. 6 -GHz, high-resolution, passive {{microwave}} images {{suggests that}} new sea ice accumulating in open leads {{is characterized by}} a unique textural signature which can be used to discriminate new ice forming in this environment from adjacent surfaces of similar radiometric temperature. Ten training areas were selected from the data set, three of which consisted entirely of <b>first-year</b> <b>ice,</b> four entirely of multilayer ice, and three of new ice in open leads in the process of freezing. A simple gradient operator was used to characterize the radiometric texture in each training region in terms {{of the degree to which}} radiometric gradients are oriented. New ice in leads has a sufficiently high proportion of well-oriented features to distinguish it uniquely from <b>first-year</b> <b>ice</b> and multiyear ice. The predominance of well-oriented features probably reflects physical processes by which new ice accumulates in open leads. Banded structures, which are evident in aerial photographs of new ice, apparently give rise to the radiometric signature observed, in which the trend of brightness temperature gradients is aligned parallel to lead trends. <b>First-year</b> <b>ice</b> and multiyear ice, which have been subjected to a more random growth and process history, lack this banded structure and therefore are characterized by signatures in which well-aligned elements are less dominant...|$|R

Even during summer, ships approaching McMurdo Sound are often blocked by various concentrations of <b>first-year</b> <b>ice,</b> fast ice (connected to the shoreline), and hard multi-year ice. Subsequently, icebreakers {{are required for}} maritime resupply missions to McMurdo Station. Nonetheless, ocean currents and fierce Antarctic winds can drive pack ice north into the Ross Sea, temporarily producing areas of open water.|$|R
