5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> rear wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, {{the angle of the}} resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|After the war started, the FBB {{provided}} wider security {{protection for}} Hitler when {{in residence at}} the Berghof, as he travelled by vehicle to front-line command posts and at military headquarters. They would be in heavily armed vehicles at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> back of Hitler's convoy. In addition, army motorcycle outriders were positioned at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> rear of the convoy of vehicles. The FBK would ride with Hitler and the RSD men would ride in a separate car during the trips.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5000|$|The main blow {{was to be}} {{delivered}} by a double envelopment orchestrated by <b>the</b> Northwestern <b>Front,</b> <b>the</b> Kalinin <b>Front</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Front.</b> <b>The</b> overall objective according to Zhukov was the [...] "subsequent encirclement and destruction of the enemy's main forces {{in the area of}} Rzhev, Vyazma <b>and</b> Smolensk. <b>The</b> Leningrad <b>Front,</b> <b>the</b> Volkhov <b>Front</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right wing forces of <b>the</b> Northwestern <b>Front</b> were to rout the Army Group North." [...] <b>The</b> Southwestern <b>Front</b> <b>and</b> Southern <b>Front</b> were defeat <b>the</b> Army Group South. <b>The</b> Caucasian <b>Front</b> <b>and</b> Black Sea Fleet were to take back the Crimea.|$|R
25|$|During 1920, Red Army {{personnel}} numbered 402,000 at <b>the</b> Western <b>front</b> <b>and</b> 355,000 for <b>the</b> South-West <b>front</b> in Galicia.

5|$|MacPherson struts {{are used}} in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> suspension, <b>and</b> an unusual three-link De Dion tube/Watt's linkage is used in <b>the</b> rear. <b>Front</b> discs with {{anti-lock}} braking (ABS) and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) are standard across the range. In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen-inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on <b>the</b> <b>fronts</b> <b>and</b> wider 175/55 on the rears, {{in an effort to}} minimise the chances of oversteer caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.|$|R

5|$|On {{the first}} lower molar, the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are {{separated}} by an anteromedian fossette. The second lower molar bears a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps, the protoconid and metaconid, that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines. There is a distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The third lower molar also bears an anterolophid and an anterolabial cingulum. The first lower molar has large roots at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> back of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two large roots, one at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> one at the back.|$|E
5|$|Parrots {{are small}} to large birds with a {{characteristic}} curved beak. Their upper mandibles have slight mobility {{in the joint}} with the skull {{and they have a}} generally erect stance. All parrots are zygodactyl, having the four toes on each foot placed two at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> two to the back.|$|E

5|$|The Nuttalliellidae can be {{distinguished}} from both ixodid and argasid ticks {{by a combination of}} a projecting capitulum at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> a soft, leathery skin. Other distinguish characteristics include the position of the stigmata, the lack of setae, the strongly corrugated integument, and the form of the fenestrated plates.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} no longer used for worship by the Church in Wales and, as of July 2012, it was being offered for sale at £65,000. Some of the {{surrounding}} land {{is included in the}} sale, but the graveyards to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> rear of the church are not.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> {{rear wheels}} are {{different}} sizes. Instead of a spare wheel, a roadside repair kit with a 12 volt electric compressor (plugs into cigarette lighter) {{and a bottle}} of repair fluid is located under the cushion of the rear passenger seat.|$|E
5|$|The maxillary toothrows are {{parallel}} to each other. The molars are bunodont (with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests) and brachyodont (low-crowned) and have the inter-cusp valleys on the labial (outer) sides closed by a cingulum (shelf). The valleys on the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molars meet at the midlines. Each of the upper molars has three roots—unlike {{in most of the}} closest relatives of Pennatomys, there is no additional labial root on M1. The m1 has four roots—two large roots at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> back and two smaller ones in the middle. There are three roots under m2, two at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> one at the back, and two under m3, at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> back. Upper toothrow length ranges from 5.6 to 6.7mm and lower toothrow length is 5.9 to 7.4mm.|$|E
5|$|A second, more {{traditional}} design followed {{for the initial}} batch of five unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6230–6234). Again they were of welded tank construction, but lacked any of the streamlining add-ons. Even without the streamlining Type 'B' tenders were distinguishable from Type 'A' by having a slightly different profile at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> steps and handrails at the rear.|$|E
