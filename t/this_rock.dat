5|$|A rock {{formation}} {{known as}} the Campbell's Ledge Black Shale occurs {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Creek. <b>This</b> <b>rock</b> formation contains shale and coal. The ledge on the northern bank of the creek was in the early 1900s noted to contain a large mass (up to a million tons) of sandy till.|$|E
5|$|Based on outcrop analysis, the {{crystalline}} basement composed of granitic and monzonitic rocks, {{dates to the}} Cretaceous, the oldest dated sample being 91.2 ± 2 million years old. <b>This</b> <b>rock,</b> a granite, {{may be part of}} a plutonic basement. Younger basement rocks comprise Miocene marine sediments and volcanics pertaining to the Comondú Group. Andesite of Sierra Santa Lucía is found west-southwest of the Santa Rosalía Basin. The basaltic La Esperanza formation is also in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, {{working with}} Dr. Theodore Wadsworth, Todd gained {{permission}} {{to start a}} hospital near the present-day Farmington/Plainville border for smallpox inoculation. The facility, commonly called Hospital Rock, is found deep in the second-growth hardwood forest of Rattlesnake Mountain in Connecticut and was used from 1792-1794. Though the building is no longer present, the nearby rock ledge upon which patients would socialize remains. It was <b>this</b> <b>rock</b> that lent the facility its name. At this location, they could also receive mail and various packages.|$|E

5|$|Nankoweap Formation {{is around}} 1050million {{years old and}} {{is not part of}} a group. <b>This</b> <b>rock</b> unit is made of {{coarse-grained}} sandstone, and was deposited in a shallow sea on top of the eroded surface of the Cardenas Basalt. The Nankoweap is only exposed {{in the eastern part of}} the canyon. A gap in the geologic record, an unconformity, follows the Nankoweap.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the rock in the Valley is inconsistent, ranging from finely-grained to coarse stone, the latter with the {{potential}} to be structurally unsound. The occasional layer of shale also caused construction and conservation difficulties, as <b>this</b> <b>rock</b> expands in the presence of water, forcing apart the stone surrounding it. It is thought that some tombs were altered in shape and size depending on the types of rock the builders encountered.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about Silverthrone’s eruptive history. However, as at other calderas, eruptions at Silverthrone are {{explosive}} in nature, involving viscous magma, glowing avalanches of hot volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows. The source magma of <b>this</b> <b>rock</b> is classified as acidic, having high to intermediate levels of silica, as in rhyolite, dacite, and andesite. Andesitic and rhyolitic magma are commonly associated with the two forms of explosive eruptions called Plinian and Peléan eruptions. Silverthrone is considerably younger than its nearest prominent neighbour Franklin Glacier Volcano to the east-southeast.|$|E

5|$|Little Catawissa Creek flows over rock of the Mauch Chunk Formation for {{its entire}} length. Most {{of the rest}} of the {{watershed}} is also on <b>this</b> <b>rock</b> formation. However, other rock formations also occur in the watershed. A substantial area of the Pocono Formation can be found in the northwestern part of the watershed and large areas of rock of the Pottsville Formation occupy portions of the southern and western parts of the watershed. Small areas of the Spechty Kopf Formation and the Buddys Run Member of the Catskill Formation are found in the northwestern part of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Named and {{described}} by Polish paleontologist Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Białynicka in 1977, Opisthocoelicaudia was first {{thought to be}} a new member of the Camarasauridae, but is currently considered a derived member of the Titanosauria. Its exact relationships within Titanosauria are contentious, but it may have been close to the North American Alamosaurus. All Opisthocoelicaudia fossils stem from the Nemegt Formation. Despite being rich in dinosaur fossils, the only other sauropod from <b>this</b> <b>rock</b> unit is Nemegtosaurus, which is known from a single skull. Since the skull of Opisthocoelicaudia remains unknown, several researchers have suggested that Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia may represent the same species. Sauropod footprints from the Nemegt Formation, which include skin impressions, can probably be referred to either Nemegtosaurus or Opisthocoelicaudia as these are the only known sauropods from this formation.|$|E
5|$|Rocks {{and land}} {{at the foot of}} these {{mountains}} is calcarenite, a coral sand, blown inland during the Pleistocene between 130,000 and 20,000 years ago and cemented into stratified layers by water percolation. In <b>this</b> <b>rock</b> are fossils of bird bones and eggs, land and marine snails and the extinct endemic horned turtle (Meiolania platyceps) now thought to be an ancient relictual non-swimming tortoise with relatives in South America. The crescent of the island protects a coral reef and lagoon, the barrier reef, at 31° S, is the most southerly in the world. Beach sands, rather than consisting of quartz grains derived from granite, as on the mainland, are made of fragments of shell, coral and coralline algae, together with basalt grains, and basaltic minerals like black diopside, and green olivine. The lowland consists of alluvial soils.|$|E

5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. <b>This</b> <b>rock</b> formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E

50|$|Several {{hundred million}} years ago, the {{northern}} highlands of Wisconsin were an alpine mountain range. Beneath <b>this</b> range, igneous <b>rock</b> formed which now is called pre-Cambrian bedrock, the top layers of the mountains having been worn down by erosion. In more recent geologic time, glaciers scoured the surface exposing <b>this</b> pre-Cambrian <b>rock</b> in many areas, leaving irregular drainage throughout the north woods with many rapids and falls as features of the streams. Grandfather Falls lies in <b>this</b> pre-Cambrian <b>rock</b> bed, and is thus a remnant of the physical geography of this ancient mountain range.|$|R
