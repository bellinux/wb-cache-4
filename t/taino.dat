5|$|After the <b>Taino</b> victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia to defend {{themselves}} against the attacks. Juan Ponce de León {{and one of his}} top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which included a massacre of the <b>Taino</b> forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E
5|$|When Ponce de León {{arrived in}} Puerto Rico, {{he was well}} {{received}} by the Cacique (Tribal chief) Agüeybaná (The Great Sun), chieftain of the island <b>Taino</b> tribes. Besides the conquistadors, {{some of the first}} colonists were farmers and miners in search of gold. In 1508, Ponce de León became the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, founding the first settlement of Caparra between the modern-day cities of Bayamón and San Juan. After being named Governor, de León and the conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to build fortifications; many Tainos {{died as a result of}} cruel treatment during their labor. In 1510, upon Agüeybaná's death, his brother Güeybaná, better known as Agüeybaná II (The Brave), and a group of Tainos led Diego Salcedo, a Spaniard, to a river and drowned him, proving to his people that the white men were not gods. Upon realizing this, Agüeybaná II led his people in the <b>Taino</b> rebellion of 1511, the first rebellion in the island against the better armed Spanish forces. Guarionex, cacique of Utuado, attacked the village of Sotomayor (present day Aguada) and killed eighty of its inhabitants. Cacique Guarionex died during the attack which was considered a <b>Taino</b> victory.|$|E
5|$|An 80-minute {{documentary}} {{film about the}} EPB, titled MACHETERO, was released in 2008. Starring Not4Prophet (Ricanstruction), as Pedro <b>Taíno,</b> and Isaach De Bankolé (Casino Royale), as French journalist Jean Dumont, the film takes place in both New York City and Puerto Rico. Other actors Kelvin Fernández (first starring role) and Dylcia Pagán. The film was {{the winner of the}} 2008 South Africa International Film Festival, 2009 Swansea Film Festival, 2009 Heart of England Film Festival, 2009 International Film Festival Thailand, and the 2009 International Film Festival Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|Caciques {{played a}} large role {{in the history of the}} island, most notably when the Spanish came to take their territory. Upon Spanish arrival in 1508, there were an {{estimated}} 20,000-50,000 <b>Taínos</b> living on the island. [...] Believing the Spaniards were spiritual entities, the <b>Taínos</b> were very hospitable to the Spanish. Knowing this, the Spanish used the <b>Taínos</b> for labor and finding gold on the island. After much mistreatment, and the implement of the encomienda system over the land, the caciques and <b>Taínos</b> as a group lost their control of the island.|$|R

2500|$|Puerto Rico was {{originally}} called [...] "Boriken" [...] by the <b>Taínos,</b> which means: [...] "La tierra del altivo Señor", or [...] "The Land of the Mighty Lord", The <b>Taínos</b> {{were one of}} the Arawak peoples of South America, who inhabited the island before the arrival of the Spaniards.|$|R
5|$|Human {{activity}} {{is arguably the}} main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the <b>Taíno,</b> hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is {{the main reason for}} the decline of population.|$|E
5|$|With his father, Las Casas {{immigrated to}} the island of Hispaniola in 1502 on the {{expedition}} of Nicolás de Ovando. Las Casas became a hacendado and slave owner, receiving {{a piece of land}} in the province of Cibao. He participated in slave raids and military expeditions against the native <b>Taíno</b> population of Hispaniola. In 1510, he was ordained a priest, the first one to be ordained in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|At first, human {{activity}} had not posed a significant {{threat to the}} Puerto Rican amazon. The <b>Taíno</b> hunted the parrot but without much effect on its population. In the past two hundred years, however, many factors {{have led to a}} drastic decrease in the birds' numbers: agricultural development, the construction of roads, hydroelectric development, and the adoption of young chicks as pets. Especially during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, most of Puerto Rico's virgin forests, a historical habitat of the species, were cleared for agricultural development, primarily for the production of sugar, cotton, corn and rice. The amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its main food source and so became seen as a pest; local farmers repelled or hunted the bird if possible. As agriculture expanded, the amazon's habitat disappeared further and its population declined.|$|E

5000|$|Back on his island, Ponce de León parceled out {{the native}} <b>Taínos</b> amongst himself and other {{settlers}} using {{a system of}} forced labor known as encomienda. [...] The Indians were put to work growing food crops and mining for gold. Many of the Spaniards treated the <b>Taínos</b> very harshly and newly introduced diseases like smallpox and measles took a severe toll on the local population. By June 1511 the <b>Taínos</b> were pushed to a short-lived rebellion, which was forcibly put down by Ponce de León and a small force of troops armed with crossbows and arquebuses.|$|R
25|$|His {{research}} {{into the history of}} Puerto Rico gave people an insight into the island {{from the time of the}} <b>Taínos</b> up until 1927. One of his works, The Indo-Antillean Vocabulary, is valuable in understanding the way of life of the <b>Taínos.</b> His works are required reading in Puerto Rican high schools and universities.|$|R
5|$|Queen conch shells {{were used}} by Native Americans and Caribbean Indians {{in a wide variety}} of ways. South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and <b>Taíno</b> used conch shells to {{fabricate}} tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, cookware and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source.|$|E
5|$|The Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies (Spanish Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias) {{was first}} written as the 68th {{chapter of the}} General History of the Indies, but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, {{recognizing}} that the material was not historical. The material contained in the Apologetic History is primarily ethnographic accounts of the indigenous cultures of the Indies – the <b>Taíno,</b> the Ciboney, and the Guanahatabey, but it also contains descriptions {{of many of the}} other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is apologetic because it is written as a defense of the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the Roman, Greek and Egyptian civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs of European and American cultures and evaluating them according to whether they were good or bad, seen from a Christian viewpoint.|$|E
25|$|Groups, {{such as the}} Jatibonicu <b>Taino</b> Tribal Nation of Boriken Puerto Rico (1970), the <b>Taíno</b> Nation of the Antilles N.Y.C. (1993), United Confederation of <b>Taíno</b> People N.Y.C (1998) and El Pueblo Guatu Ma-Cu A Borikén Puerto Rico (2000), {{have been}} {{established}} to foster <b>Taíno</b> culture.|$|E

He played with the <b>Tainos</b> until 1989, when they {{had moved to the}} Southwestern Puerto Rico city of Cabo Rojo.|$|R
5000|$|The date of December 9, 1492 is {{described}} as the most fateful of days…Then, there were an estimated 8 million native <b>Taínos</b> living {{on the island of}} Hispaniola. [...] "Within 20 years, there were fewer than 28,000." [...] "Thirty years on, by 1542, only 200 <b>Taínos</b> remained." [...] Many chapters are also entitled with a date.|$|R
50|$|However, the Spaniards soon {{started to}} enslave the natives. On February 1511, Agueybana's brother Güeybaná, {{better known as}} Agüeybaná II (The Brave), and Urayoan (The Añasco Cacique), and their men drowned Diego Salcedo. They watched Salcedo's body to see whether he would resuscitate: when he didn't, the <b>Taínos</b> {{realized}} that the Spaniards were not gods and thus, the <b>Taínos</b> became rebellious.|$|R
25|$|Rouse classifies as <b>Taíno</b> all {{inhabitants}} of the Greater Antilles (except the western tip of Cuba), the Bahamian archipelago, and the northern Lesser Antilles. He subdivides the <b>Taíno</b> into three main groups: Classic <b>Taíno,</b> mostly from Haiti, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic; Western <b>Taíno,</b> or sub-Taíno, for population from Jamaica, Cuba (except for the western tip) and the Bahamian archipelago; and Eastern <b>Taíno</b> for those from the Virgin Islands to Montserrat.|$|E

25|$|In Hispaniola, a <b>Taíno</b> {{chieftain}} named Enriquillo mobilized over 3,000 <b>Taíno</b> in {{a successful}} rebellion in the 1520s. These <b>Taíno</b> were accorded land and a charter from the royal administration. Despite the small Spanish {{military presence in}} the region, they often used diplomatic divisions and, with help from powerful native allies, controlled most of the region. In exchange for a seasonal salary, religious and language education, the <b>Taíno</b> were required to work for Spanish and Indian land owners. This system of labor was part of the encomienda.|$|E
50|$|By 1500, the <b>Tainos</b> on {{the island}} {{provided}} Santo Domingo with most of its cassava.|$|R
50|$|A third, {{and most}} {{accepted}} version of Salcedo's death {{says that the}} <b>Tainos,</b> fearing that the Spaniards might be gods, refrained from harming them. After suffering under the Spaniards for so long, the <b>Tainos,</b> by order of Agüeybaná, ambushed Salcedo as he was drinking water {{at the edge of}} a river. Fearing that Salcedo might resurrect after three days - based on their understanding of the Christian teachings wielded by Catholic priests - they sat around for three days waiting for Salcedo to come back from the dead, but all they saw was Salcedo's body rotting due to the heat just as they would. At that moment the <b>Tainos</b> realized that these were no gods.|$|R

25|$|The first {{recorded}} smallpox outbreak in the Americas occurred on Hispaniola in 1507. The last record of pure Taínos {{in the country}} was from 1864. Still, <b>Taíno</b> biological heritage survived to an important extent, due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to <b>Taino</b> women, and some present-day Dominicans have <b>Taíno</b> ancestry. Remnants of the <b>Taino</b> culture include their cave paintings, as well as pottery designs which are still used in the small artisan village of Higüerito, Moca.|$|E

5000|$|According to the Chronicles of the Indias {{which are}} found in Seville, Spain, Hayuya lived and governed the area which is now named after him, in the {{interior}} central part of Puerto Rico. On September 7, 1513 Juan Ponce de León, who was appointed governor by the [...] "Spanish Crown", sent troops headed by Alonso Niño and Alonso de Mendoza to quash the rebellious <b>Taínos.</b> When they arrived at Hayuya's village, they proceeded to raid and murder its inhabitants. They burned the village to the ground. The <b>Taínos</b> that survived were taken as prisoners and some were made to work the mines as slaves. The others were sent to Spain where they were sold as slaves for 145 [...] "pesos". Eventually, the <b>Taínos</b> died from working in the mines or from the smallpox epidemic.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of European encounter, the island of Hispaniola, of which Haiti {{occupies}} the western three-eighths, {{was one of many}} Caribbean islands inhabited by the <b>Taíno</b> Indians, speakers of an Arawakan language called <b>Taino,</b> which has been preserved in the Haitian Creole language. The <b>Taíno</b> name for the entire island was Haiti. The people had migrated over centuries into the Caribbean islands from South America. Genetic studies show they were related to the Yanomami of the Amazon Basin. They also originated in Central and South America. After migrating to Caribbean islands, in the 15th century, the <b>Taíno</b> were pushed into the northeast Caribbean islands by the Caribs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taíno</b> {{culture as}} {{documented}} {{is believed to}} have developed in the Caribbean. The <b>Taíno</b> creation story says that they emerged from caves in a sacred mountain on present-day Hispaniola. In Puerto Rico, 21st century studies have shown a high proportion of people having Amerindian MtDNA. Of the two major haplotypes found, one does not exist in the <b>Taíno</b> ancestral group, so other Native American people are also part of this genetic ancestry.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish and <b>Taíno</b> War of San Juan–Borikén, {{also known}} as the <b>Taíno</b> Rebellion of 1511, was the first major {{conflict}} to take place in the modern-day Puerto Rico after the arrival of the Spaniards on November 19, 1493.|$|E
5000|$|Columbus {{reached the}} island {{on his first}} voyage, on December 5, 1492, naming it La Española. Believing that the Europeans were in some way supernatural, the <b>Taínos</b> welcomed them with all the honors available. This was a totally {{different}} society from the one the Europeans came from. Guacanagarí, the chief who hosted Christopher Columbus and his men, treated them kindly and provided them with everything they desired. Yet the Taínos' allegedly [...] "egalitarian" [...] system clashed with the Europeans' feudalist system, with more rigid class structures. This led the Europeans to believe the <b>Taínos</b> to be either weak or misleading, {{and they began to}} treat the tribes with more violence. Columbus tried to temper this when he and his men departed from Ayiti—as the <b>Taínos</b> called the island—and they left on a good note.|$|R
5000|$|The city of Yauco {{was named}} after the river Yauco which was {{originally}} known as coayuco by the <b>Taínos,</b> meaning [...] "yucca plantation".|$|R
