5|$|Impurities {{are mostly}} arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, silver, and gold. The melt is <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reverberatory furnace with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the {{impurities}} except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float {{to the top}} of the melt and are skimmed off. Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process, in which zinc is added to lead. The zinc dissolves silver and gold, both of which, being immiscible in lead, can be separated and retrieved. De-silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the Betterton–Kroll process, treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium. The resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off.|$|E

5|$|During {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the mound of Cubzac was slashed all around to provide stone for Bordeaux's {{construction}} and the ballast of some river banks, creating deep excavations in the limestone. In 1898, André Cousteau, uncle of the researcher and ecologist Jacques Cousteau, started using the caves to make a sparkling wine based on traditional Champagne-making techniques. The wine, <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> closed tank, bottled, and kept neck down many months at constant temperature, became bubbly and had its impurities accumulate near the cap. Once this deposit was removed, the bottles were resealed by force, and the corks muzzled. In 1920, the Cousteau property was sold to the Société Anonyme Gay-Mousse. In 1966, the caves where entrusted to Monsieur Lateyron who, one year later, created the Café de Paris.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua {{brought from the}} recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and it was the participation of these Mesoamerican allies that was particularly decisive. In at least one case, encomienda rights were granted to one of the Tlaxcalan leaders who came as allies, and land grants and exemption from being given in encomienda were given to the Mexican allies as rewards for their participation in the conquest. In practice, such privileges were easily removed or sidestepped by the Spanish and the indigenous conquistadors were <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar manner to the conquered natives.|$|E
5|$|Smelting, {{which is}} an {{essential}} part of the primary production, is often skipped during secondary production. It is only performed when metallic lead had undergone significant oxidation. The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace, with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields. The Isasmelt process is a more recent method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has sulfur removed by treating it with alkali, and is then <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. Refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver most commonly being accepted as impurities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage among injection drug users (IDUs) <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> injection heroin maintenance program with that among IDUs <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oral methadone program, and to determine predictors of S. aureus carriage. Design: Survey. Setting: Two opiate maintenance programs at a psychiatrie university clinic. Participants: A volunteer sample consisting of 94 (74 %) of 127 IDUs <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> injection opiate maintenance program with at least twice daily injections of heroin, and 70 (56 %) of 125 IDUs <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oral methadone program. Results: Addicts <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> the intravenous heroin substitution program had a significantly lower overall rate of S. aureus carriage (37 of 94 [39. 4 %] vs 42 of 70 [60 %]; P =. 009) and a significantly lower rate of nasal carriage (21 of 94 [22. 3 %] vs 30 of 70 [42. 9 %]; P =. 005) than did addicts <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> the oral methadone program. Being <b>treated</b> <b>in</b> the oral methadone program was the only independent predictor of S. aureus carriage (odds ratio, 2. 27; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 19 - 4. 31; P=. 012). All S. aureus isolates were susceptible to oxacillin. Conclusions: The regular use of needles under aseptic conditions did not increase the rate of S. aureus carriage among IDUs. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether the lower rate of S. aureus carriage among IDUs treated with intravenous heroin leads to a lower incidence of S. aureus infections in these patient...|$|R
