5|$|Jeter {{achieved}} two career hit milestones in {{the second}} half of the 2009 season. On August 16, 2009, against the Seattle Mariners, Jeter doubled down the right-field line for his 2,675th hit as a shortstop, breaking Luis Aparicio's previous major league record. Then, Jeter became the all-time hits leader as a member of the Yankees (2,722), passing Lou Gehrig on September 11, 2009. The hit was a single off Baltimore Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>inning.</b>|$|E

5|$|Culbreth was the first-base umpire for Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Matt Garza's no-hitter {{against the}} Detroit Tigers on July 26, 2010. In <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>inning,</b> Tigers manager Jim Leyland was {{ejected from the}} game by second-base umpire Marty Foster. Garza's no-hitter was the first by a Rays pitcher. Culbreth was at second base on June 1, 2012, when New York Mets pitcher Johan Santana threw a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. This no-hitter {{was the first to}} be thrown by a Mets pitcher. Santana benefited from a close call on the third base line by umpire Adrian Johnson; the Carlos Beltrán line drive {{appeared}} to be fair, but Johnson ruled it foul.|$|E
5|$|Galehouse {{started off}} {{the game by}} quickly getting outs from Dale Mitchell and Allie Clark. American League MVP Lou Boudreau then hit a solo home run off Galehouse to make the score 1–0.

5|$|He {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list after he incurred a strained oblique muscle during <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>inning</b> of his July 24 start. On August 9, he was activated off the disabled list to make a scheduled start. He took a 12-start (five-decision) undefeated streak, dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals, into his first start off the disabled list, but he took the loss in a 5–0 defeat, which was again against the Cardinals. Young ended the 2007 season as the major league leader in opponent batting average and hits per nine innings, but also in stolen bases allowed (with 44). He battled injuries late in the season and surrendered the ERA leadership to Jake Peavy in his August 30 start.|$|E
5|$|Nicol {{arrived in}} Chicago on July 20 and was penciled in {{to start on}} {{consecutive}} days against Charles Radbourn and Cy Young. Though he performed poorly in both games, the Colts still managed to win. He was shelled in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>inning</b> by the Cincinnati Reds and on the next day, he gave up seven runs to the Cleveland Spiders in only two innings. Because of these starts, he did not appear in another game until August 14, when he was used in relief to face the Brooklyn Dodgers. His control issues flared up and he had trouble holding the Dodgers' baserunners. He was released one week later, having walked 10 batters in the 11 innings he pitched for the Colts. He ended the season playing for Marinette of the Wisconsin State League.|$|E
5|$|Roebuck {{recorded}} {{three straight}} outs {{to end the}} inning without further scoring. The Dodgers and the Giants each managed a single in their halves of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>inning.</b> Neither Pierce nor Roebuck allowed a baserunner in {{the fourth or fifth}} innings, though the Giants further added to their lead in the sixth. The Dodgers pinch hit for Roebuck to lead {{off the top of the}} inning with Ken McMullen and although he singled he did not score. Larry Sherry entered to pitch for the Dodgers in the bottom of the inning and after recording the first out he allowed back-to-back home runs to Mays and Orlando Cepeda to give the Giants a 5–0 lead. Davenport then singled and Sherry was relieved by Jack Smith who finished the inning without further damage.|$|E

Martínez was relieved after four innings by Durbin, who allowed a ground rule double to Jeter, who later scored on a Teixeira single. Durbin hit Rodriguez and was relieved by Happ after recording one out. Happ allowed a two-run double to Matsui, his fifth and sixth RBI of the game which tied a World Series record for most RBI in a single game set by Bobby Richardson in the 1960 World Series.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{scoreless}} {{through the first}} two innings. Detroit took a three-run lead in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>inning</b> which started when Curtis Granderson walked, advanced on a ground out, and scored on a single by Magglio Ordóñez to center field. Ordóñez was then brought home via a two-run home run by Tigers' first baseman Miguel Cabrera. The Twins responded {{in the bottom of}} the inning, with Matt Tolbert singling to lead off the inning, advancing to second base on a single by Denard Span, and then moving to third on a flyball out. Tigers' starter Rick Porcello attempted a pickoff throw to first which hit the baserunner Span and went past the first baseman Cabrera. Span was out but Tolbert was able to score on Porcello's throwing error.|$|E
5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, {{each of which}} is a strike and thus strikes out three consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay feats of a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers have accomplished this feat for a total of 89 immaculate innings. The first one was pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>inning</b> against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three of them. A record eight immaculate innings have been thrown in the 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E

In {{the bottom of the}} first, Carl Furillo grounded out, and Pee Wee Reese hit a single. After Duke Snider flied out, Reese was caught stealing second base to end the inning. In the second inning, Branca retired all three hitters; when the Dodgers came up to bat, Jackie Robinson flied out and Roy Campanella grounded out. Andy Pafko scored the game's first run with a home run to left field to make the score 1–0. After the third out, Willie Mays walked to start <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>inning,</b> and after the first out Stanky got the Giants' first hit, a single. After a fly out by Dark, the Giants remained without a run; Hearn retired all three batters {{in the bottom of the}} third to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|Cain {{started on}} Opening Day for the Giants in 2013. He pitched six shutout innings before being removed {{due to a}} high pitch count; however, Kershaw threw a shutout, and the Dodgers beat the Giants 40. On April 7, Cain threw two no-hit innings before giving up nine runs in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>inning</b> and getting removed from the game, {{becoming}} the first Giants to allow nine runs in an inning since Ernie Shore in 1912. The Cardinals beat the Giants 14–3. On August 23 against the Pirates, Cain was hit by Gaby Sánchez's line drive in the pitching arm, and {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career. Cain would finish the season with a record of 8-10 in 30 starts. For the first time since 2006, Cain's ERA sat in the 4's, finishing with an exact 4.00 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Despite his struggles, Affeldt {{was named}} to the Giants' playoff roster. Affeldt made his first playoff {{appearance}} for the Giants in Game 2 of the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia. He struck out one batter and intentionally walked another one, but Santiago Casilla allowed him to score as the Giants lost 61. Affeldt faced (and retired) one batter in Game 5, but the Phillies won that game 42. In Game 6, Affeldt entered the game in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>inning</b> with runners on first and second and nobody out after starting pitcher Jonathan Sánchez was taken out early. He pitched two hitless, scoreless innings, and the Giants won the game 32 to advance to the World Series. Affeldt pitched in two games in the World Series, which the Giants won in five games to give Affeldt his first World Series ring.|$|E
