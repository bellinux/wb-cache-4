5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set <b>to</b> <b>overload,</b> the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E
5|$|Placement of the implant: The implant screw {{is placed}} {{and can be}} self-tapping, {{otherwise}} the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog. It is then screwed into place with a torque controlled wrench at a precise torque so as not <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can die, a condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of the implant to fully integrate or bond with the jawbone).|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} {{also consistent with}} the accidental production of arterial bubbles. One scenario considers a shunt at the heart or lung level that passes bubbles from the venous to the arterial side. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is thought to only open in certain conditions. A PFO conveniently explains neurological accidents after recreational air diving without any procedure violation, but it does not explain vestibular hits in deep diving. Vestibular symptoms can appear very early in the decompression, long before the massive bubble production required <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> the system.|$|E

5|$|After the Boss rescues Kinzie {{from her}} nightmare, she devises {{a plan to}} crash the simulation, which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running, thus {{weakening}} the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter. Working together, the remaining Saints manage <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> the simulation, shutting it down just as the Boss escapes. Assaulting Zinyak's ship, the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers {{they had in the}} simulation, and confronts Zinyak in his throne room. While the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and the Boss battle each other. With help from the Saints, the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious. Impressed, the Zin forces surrender to the Boss, who becomes the new head of the Zin Empire.|$|E
5|$|Walter and Walternate (Noble) {{start the}} Machine {{equipment}} <b>to</b> <b>overload,</b> {{which will take}} several minutes, after which they can pull the power and deactivate the Machine. Lee states to Peter (Joshua Jackson) {{that he will be}} staying in the parallel universe, where he feels at home, reflecting a previous conversation Peter had with Lee about staying with Olivia in the prime universe. Walter and Walternate have a heartfelt discussion over Peter, and Walter expresses concern that if the bridge disappears, so will Peter. The other Fringe members say their goodbyes to their counterparts. Eventually, the Machine is overloaded and deactivated, and the parallel universe aspects of the room disappear; Walter is pleased to see Peter remains.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the Anesidora, Ripley discovers {{a message}} from her mother after her initial report of the events on the Nostromo, thus finally giving her closure. Marlow then appears with Taylor and tells Ripley that he plans <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> the Anesidoras fusion reactor and destroy the station, thus {{ensuring}} that no aliens survive. In the ensuing confrontation, Taylor kills Marlow and is herself killed by an electric discharge while Ripley is forced to escape the Anesidora shortly before it explodes. Ricardo tells Ripley that the Anesidora explosion destroyed Sevastopol's orbital stabilisers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger paralyses Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by several alien creatures and then thrown into the ship due to a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. Still in her EVA suit, Ripley is cornered in the airlock and left with {{no option but to}} open it, which ejects both her and the alien into space. The final shot of the game depicts Ripley adrift and unconscious in her EVA suit, then suddenly awakened by a searchlight that crosses her face.|$|E

5|$|Craig, leaving Alfie with a store clerk, {{follows the}} Doctor into the tunnel, {{and is also}} {{captured}} and placed into a conversion machine. The Doctor reveals his own impending death and urges Craig to fight, but the conversion appears to be complete. Alfie's cries over the closed-circuit television echo in the ship. Craig, encouraged by the Doctor telling him that this is his {{chance to be a}} father, fights and reverses the conversion. The rest of the Cybermen painfully experience the emotions they have repressed from Craig's struggle, and their circuits start <b>to</b> <b>overload.</b> The Doctor and Craig escape via the teleporter as the ship explodes, the blast contained by the cavern. Craig reunites with Alfie, while the Doctor slips away unseen. Craig returns home to find the Doctor already there, having used time travel to clean the house. The Doctor tells Craig that Alfie now has a much higher opinion of his dad. The Doctor leaves just before Sophie returns but Alfie's first word ('Doctor') reveal the events during her absence.|$|E
5|$|The Rookie's {{skill is}} {{put to the}} test, leading chase {{missions}} and surviving an ambush. Eventually, the Human Liberation Front's secret base is discovered in Aeropolis II tower by following the enemy supply line, along with the terrorists' intentions of using a nuclear reactor. Ishikawa informs Aramaki that {{an official of the}} Energy Ministry named Sawamura has been in contact with Zebra and is connected to Megatech Body Corporation. While conducting the raid on the enemy's base, the reactor begins <b>to</b> <b>overload.</b> In order to shut it down, squad leader Motoko Kusanagi attempts to remove the protective barrier from an access point nearby, {{as the rest of the}} team search for the other building's control room. After disarming the reactor, Kusanagi locates the leader on top of the tower. Batou and Togusa encounter obstacles that prevent them from moving to the top, leaving the Rookie as the only available member. Once he reaches the top, he engages the leader in combat and defeats him in a free fall battle off of the tower.|$|E
5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins <b>to</b> <b>overload,</b> but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more than anyone else in the universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers something in her ear, declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E
5000|$|On August 20, 1977, a Monarch Aviation CV-880-22-2 (N8817E) struck {{trees and}} crashed shortly after takeoff from Juan Santamaria International Airport due <b>to</b> <b>overloading,</b> killing the three crew.|$|R
50|$|Sediment {{that has}} piled {{up at the}} top of the {{continental}} slope, particularly at the heads of submarine canyons can create turbidity current due <b>to</b> <b>overloading,</b> thus consequent slumping and sliding.|$|R
50|$|Name masking {{can cause}} {{complications}} in function <b>overloading,</b> due <b>to</b> <b>overloading</b> not happening across scopes in some languages, notably C++, thus requiring all <b>overloaded</b> functions <b>to</b> be redeclared or explicitly imported into a given namespace.|$|R

25|$|Edward {{published}} his first book, One Last Time, in 1998. His related appearance on Larry King Live {{later in the}} year prompted enough phone calls <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> the show's switchboard. The next year, Edward had a show of his own.|$|E
25|$|The {{activation}} pattern {{within the}} motor map determines the movement pattern of all model articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis) for a speech item. In order not <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> the model, no detailed modeling of the neuromuscular system is done. The Maeda articulatory speech synthesizer {{is used in}} order to generate articulator movements, which allows the generation of a time-varying vocal tract form and the generation of the acoustic speech signal for each particular speech item.|$|E
50|$|Another problem {{highlighted}} is {{that high}} schools in Pristina are forced to accept students coming from other municipalities because of specific profiles that are missing in these municipalities - which has led <b>to</b> <b>overloading</b> of classes.|$|R
50|$|Ventricular {{remodeling}} {{may include}} ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular dilation, cardiomegaly, and other changes. It is {{an aspect of}} cardiomyopathy, {{of which there are}} many types. Concentric hypertrophy is due <b>to</b> pressure <b>overload,</b> while eccentric hypertrophy is due <b>to</b> volume <b>overload.</b>|$|R
50|$|Packet loss: In some cases, {{intermediate}} {{devices in}} a network will lose packets. This may be due <b>to</b> errors, <b>to</b> <b>overloading</b> of the intermediate network, or to the intentional discarding of traffic in order to enforce a particular service level.|$|R
25|$|In Chile, 10A Magic {{connectors}} {{are commonly}} used for computer/laboratory power networks, {{as well as for}} communications or data equipment. This allows delicate electronics equipment to be connected to an independent circuit breaker, usually including a surge protector or an uninterruptible power supply backup. The different style of plug makes it more difficult for office workers to connect computer equipment to a standard unprotected power line, or <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> the UPS by connecting other office appliances.|$|E
25|$|Another hazard is the {{resonance}} of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave is run without an object {{to absorb the}} radiation, a standing wave will form. The energy is reflected {{back and forth between}} the tube and the cooking chamber. This may cause the tube <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> and burn out. For the same reason, dehydrated food, or food wrapped in metal which does not arc, is problematic for overload reasons, without necessarily being a fire hazard.|$|E
25|$|His rotator-cuff injury {{diagnosed}} in March 1997 kept {{him away from}} cricket till November 1997. Until that time, {{he was a real}} express bowler. This injury was very serious (caused due <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> of bowling) and Srinath at that time had 92 Test wickets from 27 Tests- only 46 in his first 18 Tests, but 46 in his last 9 games. It was wondered if Srinath would ever be able to bowl again, let alone be ranked among the fastest bowlers in the world. After he announced his retirement in Nov 2003, Srinath revealed that he feared his career was over when he was trying to recover from the rotator-cuff injury. (See para 14 of this article).|$|E

25|$|In 1980, the 2.25-litre petrol {{and diesel}} engines {{received}} five main bearing crankshafts to increase rigidity and the transmission, axles and wheel hubs were strengthened. This {{was the culmination of}} a series of updates to the transmission that had been made since the 1960s to combat the all-too-common problem of the rear axle half-shafts breaking in heavy usage. This problem was partly due to the design of the shafts themselves. Due to the fully floating design of the rear wheel hubs, the half shafts can be removed very quickly without even having to jack the vehicle off the ground. The tendency for commercial operators <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> their vehicles exacerbated this flaw which blighted the Series Land Rovers in many of their export markets and established a reputation that continues in many markets to the present day. This is despite the 1982 re-design (mainly the increase of driving-splines from 10 to 24 to reduce stress) that all but solved the problem.|$|E
25|$|Problems also arose between Diogo and the Portuguese {{settlers}} at Sao Tome {{known as}} Tomistas. According to a treaty between Kongo and Portugal, the former were only to trade within the latter's realm for slaves. That meant the Portuguese were {{restricted to the}} slaves offered by King Diogo or those he authorized to sell slaves. Every year the Tomistas would come with 12 to 15 ships to carry back between 400 and 700 slaves (5,000–10,000 slaves a year). This {{was not enough to}} take advantage of Kongo's ever-growing supply of slaves thanks to wars on its eastern frontier. The captains would try <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> their cargos, resulting in revolts. However, the factor that actually broke the deal was the Tomista habit of sailing upriver to the Malebo Pool to purchase slaves from BaTeke traders who were increasingly taken with European goods over the nzimbu shells the manikongo offered them. Enraged by this breach of contract, King Diogo broke off relations in 1555 and expelled 70 or so Portuguese living in his realm (many of whom had lived {{there for a long time}} with African wives and mixed-race children).|$|E
25|$|In the {{alternative}} timeline of the Flashpoint event, Kal-El's rocket crashed directly into Metropolis, {{resulting in the}} deaths of over thirty-five thousand people, and the infant was subsequently taken into government captivity. Years later, young Kal-El is found to have been placed in a government facility of aliens to control his powers for uses to make supersoldiers. Sam Lane takes a liking to him, as he becomes the son Lane never had. Kal-El later makes friends with Krypto, who was also being held in the facility, but they are separated after Kal fails to appease the government workers. Kal-El is helped by Neil Sinclair to free himself, and attacks Sam. Kal-El makes his way to Lane's office, where he finds Lois Lane, Sam's young daughter. Sinclair attempts to kill Lois, but Kal, seeing her innocence, protects her. Sam uses a Phantom Zone gun to send himself and Sinclair into the Phantom Zone. Afterward, Kal-El is deemed Subject 1 and placed in a government underground bunker life sentence by General Nathaniel Adam. Sometime later, attempting to rally support in his attempt to restore the timeline to normal, the Flash, aided by Batman and Cyborg break into the facility where Kal-El is being kept, only to find a very thin man incapable of speech who seems terrified just at the sight of others. Once they break out into the daylight, Kal-El rises into the air. He uses his heat vision on the attacking guards and flies away. Kal-El arrives in Western Europe and rescues Lois from the Amazons who attempt to kill her. Just as the two reunite, Sinclair attacks them. While Sinclair fights some Amazons, Lois tells Kal-El that he must leave. He refuses and says that he learned from Sam that they must protect people from villains like Sinclair. Kal-El manages <b>to</b> <b>overload</b> Sinclair's body with energy, and punches him through the chest, killing him in a huge explosion; Lois is unfortunately caught in the blast. Kal-El holds the dying Lois in his arms, and Lois tells him to save the people. Kal-El arrives {{at the scene of the}} Atlantean/Amazon war and intends to attack both leaders Aquaman and Wonder Woman at the last battle. It is possible that Superman's thin form was caused by isolation from the sun, the source of his powers.|$|E
