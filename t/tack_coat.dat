40|$|The use of <b>tack</b> <b>coats</b> in the {{construction}} of road structures is a technique that ensures the pavement layer bonding. Unfortunately, existing techniques commonly used in France to study <b>tack</b> <b>coats</b> require coring structures for a punctual characterization in laboratory. This paper presents a innovative non destructive approach to characterize the change of geometric and dielectric properties of the <b>tack</b> <b>coats</b> present inside the hot-mix asphalt (HMA) layers of flexible pavements, {{with the use of a}} step frequency radar with mono-static off-ground ultra wide band Vivaldi antennas. The principle of this method is to consider the flexible pavement as a multilayered medium with changing properties (thicknesses, dielectric susceptibilities and dispersion parameters). Then we use a full waveform inversion that allows the extraction of the dielectric and the geometric parameters of each layer composing the structure. Following numerical validations, we have validated the multilayered forward model (Green's function model integrating 2 p variant of Jonscher's model) experimentally using calibration media (until three layered media). Then, our discussion focuses on the link between the dielectric and the geometric parameters of the <b>tack</b> <b>coats</b> and the emulsion quantity (bonding) used in the laboratory experimental design.

40|$|In the past, {{numerous}} {{studies have been conducted}} on the topics of moisture damage and permeability, but very few studies have correlated permeability with moisture damage in Asphalt Concrete (AC). This study evaluates whether such a relation exists or not. In addition, correlations of permeability with AC mix volumetrics and pores are evaluated. Also, correlation of laboratory permeability with field permeability is examined. In this study, a field survey is conducted to identify a set of eight pavements (bad) that are known to suffer from moisture damage and a set of eight pavements (good) that do not exhibit moisture damage. Field permeability testing is conducted on those 16 pavements. Results show that good performing pavements have very low (field) permeability compared to the bad performing pavements, which was expected. Field coring is conducted and cores are collected from all 16 pavement sections. Next, laboratory permeability testing is conducted on the field cores using a falling head permeameter. Based on laboratory permeability values, the good pavement sections exhibit smaller permeability than the bad performing sections. To this end, moisture damage potential of field cores is determined in the laboratory using Moisture Induced Sensitivity Test (MIST) device and the AASHTO T 283 method. In MIST method, a sample is wet conditioned using repeated increase and decrease of pore pressure inside the saturated pores of AC sample. In the AASHTO T 283 method, a sample is wet conditioned using vacuum saturation and then subjected to one cycle of freeze-thaw. A set of three wet and three dry conditioned samples are tested for indirect tensile strength and Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) of wet to dry sample sets is determined. It is shown that both MIST and the AASHTO T 283 yield TSR values of less than 1. 0, which means moisture damage occurred by both conditioning methods. Based on the AASHTO T 283 data, when moisture damage is correlated with laboratory permeability, the AASHTO T 283 shows a good correlation but MIST shows a poor correlation. Correlations of field permeability with the AASHTO T 283 and MIST are found to be poor. Mix volumetrics (e. g., gradation, porosity, binder content) tests are performed on field cores. Gradation data is plotted on a 0. 45 power curve. Based on the power curve plot, it is shown that a mix gradation that passes near to the maximum density line have low permeabilities and moisture damage potentials. It is known that an AC sample contains 3 types of pore: permeable, dead-end, and isolated pores. In this study, permeable pore is determined using a tracer test method, a concept borrowed from soil permeability testing. Dead-end and isolated pores are also determined using a CoreLok device. It is shown that permeable pores have a better correlation with permeability than the effective pore, which is defined as the sum of permeable and dead-end pores. In this study, an attempt is made to correlate laboratory permeability with field permeability. Laboratory permeability does not have any correlation with the field permeability. This {{may be due to the}} fact that field permeability is affected by several factors such as 3 D flow in the field, Open Graded Friction Coarse (OGFC), <b>tack</b> <b>coats.</b> To this end, an analytical model is developed to predict field permeability from laboratory permeability. Model permeability is found to be higher than the laboratory permeability. Because the model considers lateral and vertical direction flows whereas laboratory permeability test considers only vertical flow. It is shown that the model permeability is less than the field permeability for pavements with OGFC and more than the field permeability for pavements without OGFC. Therefore, a shift factor is developed to match the model permeability with the field permeability. New Mexico Department of TransportationCivil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|The {{interlayer}} bonding {{of modern}} multi-layered pavement system {{plays an important}} role to achieve long term performance of a flexible pavement. It has been observed that poor bonding between bituminous pavement layers contributes to major pavement overlay distresses such as premature fatigue, top down cracking, potholes, and surface layer delamination. One of the most common distresses due to poor bonding between bituminous layers is a slippage failure, which usually occurs where heavy vehicles are often accelerating, decelerating, or turning. To enhance the bonding between layers, a <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> is sprayed in between the bituminous pavement layers. A <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> is an application of a bituminous emulsion or bituminous binder between an existing bituminous / concrete surface and a newly constructed bituminous overlay. Normally, hot bituminous binders, cutback bitumens or bituminous emulsions are used as <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> materials. This study is aimed to evaluate the bond strength at the interface between pavement layers by performing laboratory tests. To carry out this objective, three special attachments are fabricated for use in Marshall Loading Frame for finding the performance of <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> laid at the interface between Bituminous Concrete (BC) and Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) layers in the laboratory. In this study, the results of the specimens prepared with 100 mm and 150 mm diameter specimens using two types of normally used emulsions, namely CMS- 2 and CRS- 1 as <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> at application rates varying at 0. 20 kg/m 2, 0. 25 kg/m 2 and 0. 30 kg/m 2 made at 250 C temperature are presented.

40|$|Interface bonding between hot-mix asphalt (HMA) {{overlays}} and Portland {{cement concrete}} (PCC) pavements {{can be one}} of the most significant factors affecting overlay service life. Various factors may affect the bonding condition at the interface, including HMA material,tack coat material, <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application rate, PCC surface texture, temperature, and moisture conditions. The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of these parameters on the permanent deformation of the HMA overlay. This study includes three major components to achieve the objective: laboratory testing, numerical modeling, and accelerated pavement testing. This report presents and analyzes the laboratory testing results. A direct shear test device was built and utilized to investigate the characteristics of the HMA-PCC interface and to determine the interface shear strength in the lab. Tests were run in monotonic mode at a constant loading rate of 0. 47 in/min (12 mm/min). Test specimens were prepared using field PCC cores, laboratory prepared HMA, and <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> materials provided by the supplier. Parameters affecting the interface performance that were evaluated include HMA material type (SM- 9. 5 surface mix and IM- 19. 5 A binder mix), <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> type (SS- 1 h and SS- 1 hP emulsions, and RC- 70 cutback), <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application rate, PCC surface texture, temperature, and moisture conditions. Test results showed that the asphalt emulsions SS- 1 h and SS- 1 hP produced greater interface bonding strength than the cutback asphalt RC- 70. The SM- 9. 5 surface mix was found to have better interface strength than the IM- 19. 0 A binder mix. The HMA tested produced the same trend of interface shear strength with <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application rate for various <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> types. The optimum residual <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application rate for the SS- 1 hP emulsion using IM- 19. 0 A binder mix was 0. 04 gal/yd 2 (0. 18 L/m 2) in the lab. The direction of tining on the PCC produced no effect on interface shear strength at 20 oC. However, the milled concrete surface provided greater interface shear strength than both tined and smooth PCC surfaces for the same <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application rate. At the optimum <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application rate, the smooth PCC surface produced higher interface shear strength than the tined surface.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 CSS- 1 H is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used slow-setting emulsion grade in Oregon. “New” engineered emulsions were recently developed in Oregon to reduce tracking, the pick-up of tack coats by construction vehicle tires during construction activities, and increase interlayer shear strength (ISS), the amount of adhesive bond present between layers of asphalt pavement. Tracking reduces the amount of <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> in particular areas and creates a non-uniform <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> distribution between two pavement layers. The non-uniform <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> distribution leads to localized distresses and significant reductions in interlayer shear strength, leading to complete failure of the pavement structure. The magnitude of this effect and performance of the <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> is dependent on <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> type, residual application rate, temperature, existing surface condition (cracked, milled, overlay), and curing time. For this reason, reducing tracking and increasing interlayer shear strength between pavement layers becomes vital to the longevity of the pavement structure. The performance (ability to reduce tracking and increase ISS) of these emulsions, most effective application rates, the effects of pavement surface texture and traffic on ISS, and curing times were evaluated in this study. Results show that lower temperatures and increased application rates lead to longer curing times, while higher wind speeds will reduce curing times. The results indicate that tracking will decrease with increased curing time. Results show that a positive correlation between pavement surface texture and interlayer shear strength exists and that milled surfaces provide significantly higher ISS than non-milled overlay surfaces. The results indicated that there are positive correlations between rheological tests and interlayer shear strengths from field cores.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Flexible {{pavements}} {{consist of}} multilayers, which form the pavement structures. Since {{the strength of}} the bond at interface between layers plays a significant role in improving the structural integri-ty and the performance of pavement structures, <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> materials and methods used for their application during construction are important in providing an adequate bond strength between pavement lifts. <b>Tack</b> <b>coat</b> is a bituminous liquid asphalt (a mixture of water, asphalt binder, and an emulsifying agent) and usually applied to provide a bond between pavement lifts. The absence of the <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> adhesion at the interface between layers leads to increased stresses in the pave-ment structure. An inspection procedure to monitor the performance of the interlayer bond dur-ing the pavement use phase and identifying bond failures is critical to improve pavement man-agement systems and develop more effective pavement design strategies. In this study, two dif-ferent devices were developed at Oregon State University to evaluate the <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> performance in the field. First, the wireless Oregon Field <b>Tack</b> <b>Coat</b> Tester (OFTCT) device was developed to predict the long-term performance of the in-situ <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> bond strength and to evaluate the impact of pave-ment surface cleanliness before <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application on bond strength. Correlations between OFTCT field test results and the results of laboratory shear tests conducted with cores taken from the field were investigated to determine the effectiveness of the OFTCT tests. A new heat-ing system (an adjustable heat gun and environmental chamber) was developed to reduce the tack coat’s curing time in the field and control temperature during testing. The results indicated that the OFTCT device can be successfully utilized in the field to differentiate between clean and dusty surfaces before <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application. By using wireless sensors controlled by a laptop, practicality of the device was improved to reduce the testing time. The correlation between OFTCT and laboratory shear test results was determined to be statistically significant (R² = 0. 5189). OFTCT was able to identify the tack coats with high and low interlayer shear strength (ISS). Second, a new low cost field test device, Oregon Field Torque Tester (OFTT), was developed to evaluate the long-term post-construction <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> performance of pavement sections. Correla-tions between OFTT field test results and the results of laboratory shear tests conducted with cores taken from the field were investigated to determine the effectiveness of the OFTT tests. The peak torque values at failure measured by the OFTT were observed to be highly correlated with the measured lab shear strengths. To conclude, both of the developed devices are expected to be adapted as field tests to evaluate the performance of tack coats in the field and to mitigate pavement distresses observed on roadways...|$|E

A 1, 676 m (5, 500 ft) section of county road R 16 in Dallas County was divided into 12 test sections. The various techniques used to enhance bond were power brooming, power brooming with air blast, milling, cement and water grout, and emulsion <b>tack</b> <b>coat.</b> Also, two sections were planed to a uniform cross-section, two pavement thicknesses were placed, and two different concrete mix proportions were used. Bond strength was perceived to be the key to determining an appropriate design procedure for whitetopping. If adequate bond is achieved, a bonded PCC overlay technique can be used for design. Otherwise, an unbonded overlay procedure may be more appropriate. Conclusions are as follows: (1) Bond Strength Differences - Milling increased bond strength versus no milling. <b>Tack</b> <b>coat</b> showed increased bond strength versus no <b>tack</b> <b>coat.</b> Planing, Air Blast and Grouting did not provide noticeable improvements in bond strength; nor did different PCC types or thicknesses affect bond strength significantly.

This study was performed to quantify the effects of HMA type, <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> type, <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application rate, and PCC surface texture on the interface bonding and overlay performance through laboratory testing, accelerated pavement testing (APT), and numerical modeling. This report presents the outcomes of the APT, as well as the numerical modeling of pavement interfaces. The results of the laboratory testing are covered in a companion report. The APT built on and validated previously completed laboratory tests where an HMA overlay was placed on top of an existing PCC pavement having various surface textures including smooth, transverse tined, longitudinal tined, and milled. In addition, zebra sections were included to evaluate the effect of non-uniform <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application. Asphalt emulsion SS- 1 hP and cutback asphalt RC- 70 were applied at three residual application rates, 0. 02, 0. 04, and 0. 09 gal/yd 2 (0. 09, 0. 18, and 0. 41 L/m 2); asphalt binder PG 64 - 22 was applied at 0. 04 gal/yd 2 (0. 41 L/m 2). Two HMA designs, standard binder mix and moisture sensitive binder mix, were used along with the three tack coats. Twenty-five pavement test sections were constructed and loaded with the Accelerated Transportation Loading ASsembly (ATLAS) at the centerline. The tensile strains at the bottom of HMA, to quantify potential interface slippage, were measured for selective sections, and primary HMA rutting was analyzed for all sections. The APT results validated laboratory determined optimum <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> application rate, which provided the lowest interface strain and surface rutting in the field. Both PG 64 - 22 and SS- 1 hP showed better rutting resistance than RC- 70. Milled PCC surface provided lower rutting than transverse-tined and smooth surfaces. The field testing also showed that PCC cleaning methods play an important role in the HMA-PCC bonding.

40|$|A {{bituminous}} pavement is a multi-layered structure generally {{made up of}} surfacing, base and sub base courses on a sub grade. An interface {{is said to be}} a boundary between any two consecutive layers. So an adequate bond between the layers at the interfaces must be ensured so that multiple layers perform as a single composite structure. In case of non-bituminous layers or bituminous-non bituminous layers, adequate bond is established as such due to the mechanical interlocking between the aggregate surfaces. To increase the adhesion or bonding between two bituminous layers, bituminous tack coats are applied prior to overlay. This study is an attempt to evaluate the interface bond strength between two types of bituminous layer combinations in the laboratory. The cylindrical specimens have been tested for bond strength at four normal service temperatures, namely 250, 300, 350 and 400 C by applying different types of <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> at varying application rates. Two types of layer combinations have been tried, namely (i) Bituminous Concrete (BC) layer on Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) samples and (ii) Semi Dense Bituminous Concrete (SDBC) layer on Bituminous Macadam (BM) samples. Similarly, different types of <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> materials namely bitumen, Cationic Rapid Setting with low viscosity (CRS- 1) and Cationic Medium Setting with high viscosity (CMS- 2) emulsions have been used for the interface bond between the said bituminous layers. The samples thus prepared have then been tested on a specially fabricated attachment (named bond strength device) fixed to the loading frame of the Modified Marshall Testing Apparatus. It is observed that the interlayer bond strength depends on the test temperature and this decreases with increase in test temperature. It is also observed that the bond strength depends on the type of <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> used and conditions of the type of combinations. The optimum amount of <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> has been found to vary for <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> type and layer combination type...|$|E

Two, hot-in-place recycling (HIPR) projects in Kansas, on US- 160 and K- 25, were overlaid with a 15 - to 19 -mm thick layer of 4. 75 -mm NMAS Superpave mixture in 2007.

40|$|Abstract- An {{experimental}} {{program was}} designed to {{study the effects of}} coir geotextiles in shear resistance characteristics of asphalt overlays. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the effects of coir geotextiles inclusion as inter layer in improving shear resistance of contact layers. Flexible pavements are complex structures consisting of several layers of asphalt and granular materials. This pavement layers including overlays are subjected to tangential force and there is a chance of slipping of layers and which will induce parabolic crack and heaving. This is predominant especially in the case of braking, overtaking zones, intersections and grade separations. Non-linear mechanical behaviour of the pavement materials combined with the randomness in traffic and environmental conditions complicate the issue. Coir geotextiles introduced at the interface of existing damaged surface and overlay found to improve the adherence between layers. The shear resistance is also sensitive to amount of <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> content. Research also revealed inclusion of coir geotextiles as interlayer in the overlay showed increase in shear resistance and is also dependent on the type of geotextiles and quantity of <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> content.

HossainTack coat is a {{thin layer}} of asphaltic {{material}} used to bind a newly-placed lift of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavement to a previously-placed lift or a new HMA overlay/inlay and existing pavement. The purpose of a <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> is to ensure that a proper bond occurs so that traffic loads are carried by the entire HMA structure. Proper bonding exists when HMA layers act as a monolithic structure, transferring loads from one layer to the next. This depends on appropriate selection of <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> material type and application rate, and is essential to prevent slippage failure and premature cracking in the wearing surface. This study focuses on development of a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of HMA pavement structure in order to assess HMA interface bonding. The FE model was constructed using commercially available ABAQUS software to simulate an Accelerated Pavement Testing (APT) experiment conducted at the Civil Infrastructure Systems Laboratory (CISL) at Kansas State University. Mechanistic responses measured in the CISL experiment, such as localized longitudinal strain at the interface, were used to calibrate the FE model. Once calibrated, the model was used to predict mechanistic responses of the pavement structure by varying the <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> property to reflect material characteristics of each application. The FE models successfully predicted longitudinal strains that corresponded to APT results...|$|E

Asphalt cements were The tests consisted of measuring the load requirements while (1) peeling and (2) shearing a strip of fabric from the test surface to which it was bonded. Bond strength was measured as a function of asphalt cement type, film thickness, temperature, loading rate, and surface texture. As one would expect, bond strength increased with the use of harder asphalts, lower temperatures, and faster loading rates. Maximum bond strength occurred at an optimum asphalt film thickness which was found to be dependent on the texture depth of the surface. <b>Tack</b> <b>Coat</b> Quantity Based on tests performed on actual roadway samples, the optimum <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> quantity lies between 0. 15 and 0. 20 gallon per square yard 2 (0. 679 and 0. 905 l/m).

For {{purposes of this}} experimental campaign, a customised double shear testing device was designed. Two interface conditions have been analysed herein: with and without a <b>tack</b> <b>coat.</b> Moreover, the corresponding fatigue behaviour has been analysed at two temperatures: 10 °C and 20 °C. As expected, {{the absence of a}} <b>tack</b> <b>coat</b> leads to a decrease in bonding fatigue performance. Since fatigue tests are highly time-consuming, a method that allows predicting the conventional interface fatigue law from accelerated shear fatigue tests has been proposed. Other novel findings on interface fatigue behaviourwill also be discussed. In addition to these fatigue results, an interface failure model is proposed to evaluate the interface lifetime. Incorporating interface fatigue performance into pavement analysis proves to be a key parameter in describing in situ pavement conditions and assessing pavement durability...|$|E
