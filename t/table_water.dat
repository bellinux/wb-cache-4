5|$|Walter William Law (November 13, 1837 – January 17, 1924) was a {{businessman}} {{and the founder}} of the 8,000-person village of Briarcliff Manor, New York. He was a vice president of furniture and carpet retailer W. & J. Sloane, and later founded the Briarcliff Lodge, the Briarcliff <b>Table</b> <b>Water</b> Company, Briarcliff Farms, and the Briarcliff Greenhouses. He founded or assisted in establishing several schools, churches, and parks in the village, and rebuilt its train station in 1906. In the early 1900s, Walter Law was the largest individual landholder in Westchester County.|$|E
5|$|Consolidated Edison {{provides}} {{electric power}} {{and natural gas}} to the village, and the Briarcliff Manor Department of Public Works supplies water from the Catskill Aqueduct to the village's water system. The department also maintains the sewer system, village vehicles, roads, and grounds, operates a recycling center, and removes snow. In 2012 the village tied for fourth place (out of 48 Westchester municipalities) {{in the percentage of}} recycled waste (71percent, above the county average of 52percent). The department, primarily rooted in the 1941 sale of Walter Law's Briarcliff <b>Table</b> <b>Water</b> Company, began with a state-mandated street commissioner. The commissioner in 1914 was Arthur Brown; asked by village officials if he needed an automobile, Brown replied that he preferred a horse but would use an automobile if the village purchased it (it did not). The department has about thirty vehicles and employs twenty-nine people.|$|E
5|$|The Briarcliff Lodge was {{a luxury}} {{resort in the}} village of Briarcliff Manor, New York. It was a notable example of Tudor Revival architecture, {{and was one of the}} largest wooden {{structures}} in the United States. It was also the first hotel in Westchester County. Walter William Law had it built on his estate, and the Law family owned it until 1937. When the lodge opened in 1902, it was one of the largest resort hotels in the world. The lodge hosted presidents, royalty, and celebrities, and was the scene of numerous memorable occasions for visitors and local residents who attended weddings, receptions, and dances in the ballroom and dining room. For a long time, the lodge was situated among other businesses of Walter Law, including the Briarcliff Farms and Briarcliff <b>Table</b> <b>Water</b> Company.|$|E

5000|$|Influence of the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> When a {{soil layer}} {{is above the}} <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> it is not {{saturated}} and does {{not contribute to the}} transmissivity. When the soil layer is entirely below the <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> its saturated thickness corresponds to the thickness of the soil layer itself. When the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> is inside a soil layer, the saturated thickness corresponds to the distance of the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> {{to the bottom of the}} layer. As the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> may behave dynamically, this thickness may change from place to place or from time to time, so that the transmissivity may vary accordingly. In a semi-confined aquifer, the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> is found within a soil layer with a negligibly small transmissivity, so that changes of the total transmissivity (...) resulting from changes in the level of the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> are negligibly small. When pumping water from an unconfined aquifer, where the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> is inside a soil layer with a significant transmissivity, the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> may be drawn down whereby the transmissivity reduces and the flow of water to the well diminishes.|$|R

The American Plasmon Syndicate, a producer of the dried milk product plasmon, had its factory in Briarcliff for milk from Briarcliff Farms; the farm built the factory and its power plant.|$|E
40|$|The zone {{below the}} <b>water</b> <b>table</b> is not {{necessarily}} saturated, especially following rapid rises in <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> common in alluvial tropical regions. Degree of saturation in this critical zone determines {{the nature and extent}} of redox- and diffusion-related processes. Incomplete saturation below the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> means that typical two-layer seismic refraction methods, widely used for determining <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depth, are not accurate under conditions of rapidly fluctuating <b>water</b> <b>table.</b> In this work we a) measured the degree of saturation below the <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> and b) modified the seismic refraction method to enable accurate determination of depth to <b>water</b> <b>table</b> under fluctuating conditions. Degree of saturation was determined by measuring volumetric soil water content (by time domain reflectometry) and total porosity (from bulk density) to 2 -m depth in a riparian area during several cycles of flooding and draining. At 0. 1 - 1. 0 m depth, air entrapped below the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> represented a mean of 14 % of bulk soil volume.

500|$|The farm's {{products}} were packaged as milk, cream, butter or kumyss, and sent every {{night on the}} New York and Putnam Railroad to New York City for delivery the next day; they were also sold in the farm's stores or from wagons. Briarcliff Farms had three stores in New York City and stores in Greenwich, Connecticut, Yonkers, Dobbs Ferry and Tarrytown. The farm's first New York City store was in Manhattan's Windsor Arcade, at Fifth Avenue and 46th Street, and it had {{an office in the}} Seymour Building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. The office produced advertisements for the New-York Tribune, The New York Times, New York Evening Post and the Mail and Express (papers which, according to Printers' Ink, advertised to wealthy residents).

It shipped its products in zinc-lined cases on ocean-going steamers and shipped nationwide every day except Sunday (shipping a double order on Saturday). The farm's milk was processed into milk, cheese, butter or buttermilk at its Barn A creamery in Pine Plains, and packaged for its [...] rail shipment to New York City.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{began on}} April 16, 1930 and {{immediately}} faced serious engineering and geotechnical obstacles related to natural ground water and drainage.

40|$|Shortage of {{precipitation}} in Kobo valley limits {{the production of}} vegetables during dry periods and the yield of cereals in the rainy periods. Irrigation from ground water could enable farmers to cultivate {{more than once a}} year. Since pumping has an effect on the ground water resources availability, effective management of water resources using reliable calculation of historical groundwater balances at local and sub-watershed scales is required (Kendy et al 2004). We used CropWat 4 Window to determine PET of the area and the Crop Water Requirement (CWR) of onion, tomato and pepper, which are cultivated using irrigation during dry months; T-M and simple water balance equations were used to quantify annual recharge to the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> and <b>water</b> <b>table</b> status under different irrigation scenarios. Although irrigation from the groundwater could ensure the food security of the area, different water management scenarios showed that the ground <b>water</b> <b>table</b> will be declining as a result.

We studied the effects of periodic <b>water</b> <b>table</b> drawdown in a mesocosm experiment. Mesocosms were collected in Southern Sweden, and subsequently brought to an experimental field in the Netherlands. Two <b>water</b> <b>table</b> treatments were applied: one with constant <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> at 5 cm below the moss surface, and one in which the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> was allowed to drop, resulting in <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> fluctuating between 5 and 21 cm below the moss surface. Sphagnum growth, as well as Sphagnum and vascular plant abundance, were assessed for 2 frac(1, 2) years. Our results show that the abundance of graminoid species increased most in the constant <b>water</b> <b>table</b> treatment. In contrast, ericoid species cover increased when <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> were allowed to fluctuate. Furthermore, Sphagnum cuspidatum production decreased with fluctuating summer <b>water</b> <b>tables,</b> while Sphagnum magellanicum responded oppositely. From these results we conclude that increased occurrence of periods with low <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> may bring about a shift in dominant Sphagnum species as well as a shift from graminoid to ericoid vascular plant cover, resembling the shift from hollow to lawn or hummock vegetation. The difference in response within functional groups (vascular plants, Sphagnum) may add to the resilience of the ecosystem. © 2008 Gesellschaft für Ökologie. </p...|$|R

40|$|Correctly {{forecasting}} {{groundwater level}} fluctuations can assist water resource managers and engineers in efficient allocation {{of the regional}} water needs. Modeling such systems based on satellite remotely sensed data may be a viable option to predict <b>water</b> <b>table</b> fluctuations. Two types of <b>water</b> <b>table</b> prediction models based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technology were developed to simulate the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> fluctuations at two well sites in Maryland. One {{was based on the}} relationship between the variations of brightness temperature and <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depth. The other one was based on the relationship between the changes of soil moisture and <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depth. <b>Water</b> <b>table</b> depths recorded at these two wells, brightness temperature retrieved from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer, and soil moisture data produced by the Land Data Assimilation System were used to train and validate the models. Three models were constructed and they all performed well in predicting <b>water</b> <b>table</b> fluctuations. The root mean square errors of the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depth forecasts for 12 months were between 0. 043 m and 0. 047 m for these three models. The results of sensitivity test showed that the models were more sensitive to the uncertainty in <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depth than to that in brightness temperature or in soil moisture content. This suggests that for situations where high resolution remotely sensed data is not available, an ANN <b>water</b> <b>table</b> prediction model still can be built if the trend of the time series of the data, such as brightness temperature or soil moisture, over the study site correlates well with the trend of the time series of the ground measurement at the study site. An extension of the study to a regional scale was also performed at 12 available well sites in Piedmont Plateau, Maryland. Hydrologic soil types, LDAS soil moistures, and <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depths at these locations were used in the ANN modeling.
