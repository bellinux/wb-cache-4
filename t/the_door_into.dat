5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand either side of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>into</b> the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E

25|$|The third {{match was}} between Crowbar and Terry Funk for the WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started when Funk ambushed Crowbar backstage. They fought inside a truck, and Funk sent Crowbar through {{a table with}} a hip toss. Crowbar {{attacked}} Funk with a car door, and slammed a door into Funk's head. Funk performed a low blow, and slammed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>into</b> Crowbar's head repeatedly. Funk handcuffed Crowbar, and attacked him with the car door and a steel chair. Crowbar fought back with the chair, and performed a slingshot splash to Funk through a table. Funk fought back with chair shots, and pinned Crowbar after a piledriver on the car door to win the match and the title.|$|E

25|$|St Paul's Anglican Cathedral, {{built in}} 1894 {{and the oldest}} church {{building}} in the city still in use, is a modest parish church {{on the periphery of}} the central business district whose parish dates from 1883. It has been the designated cathedral church of the Anglican Diocese of Qu'Appelle, comprising most of Southern Saskatchewan, since 1944 when it supplanted the original pro-cathedral of St Peter's in the eponymous town of Qu'Appelle. It was then assumed that St. Paul's would remain pro-cathedral temporarily and that plans would be fulfilled to build a substantial cathedral at the corner of College Avenue and Broad Street: the site remains obvious, with hedges planted about the planned building, its liturgical west end at the corner of the intersection. However, by 1974 the diocese reached the conclusion that this outcome was improbable, and St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral was designated Cathedral. Indeed, its organ console being on the liturgical and geographical south end of the choir, just inside <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>into</b> the chapel and the pipes on the north side, the choir was moved to the north transept with a new Casavant Frères organ, its two-manual console there and the pipes overhead. (The location of the organ console and the choir have changed a third time, now being in the north transept.) Its future cathedral status, however, is somewhat in doubt as the Anglican Church of Canada considers rationalising its increasingly top-heavy episcopal structure and, with decreasing numbers of active church people it being over equipped with that, with parish churches steadily decreasing in number.|$|E

The firebricks were then replaced with cast iron substitutes that melted in the intense {{heat of the}} firebox, which were in turn replaced by thicker [...] firebricks. Some of the firemen allotted to the Leader complained about cramped conditions in the centre cab of the locomotive, a situation made worse by flames entering the cab from the firebox at high outputs. It was an enclosed space that was constantly hot and the single fireman's entrance door {{on the side of}} the locomotive was left open during travel to promote ventilation. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>into</b> the fireman's cab also attracted criticism, as it would have been blocked in the event of the locomotive overturning on that side, preventing the fireman's escape, so that members of the railway trade union ASLEF threatened to stop their crews from operating the Leader.|$|E

[...] Pols felt that, while not implying that the film has [...] "a lack of compelling emotional material" [...] but that the film's [...] "few weak moments" [...] are the [...] "ones that dovetail with typical inspirational stories." [...] Marshall Fine, of The Huffington Post, praised the film as being [...] "a film that doesn't shy away from the depths to which human beings can sink, but it also shows the strength and resilience of which we are capable, even at our lowest moments." [...] Scott Mendelson, also of The Huffington Post, felt that when you put the [...] "glaring issues aside," [...] the film [...] "still works as a potent character study and a glimpse inside a world we'd rather pretend does not exist in America." [...] But while the film [...] "succeeds as a powerful acting treat and a potent character study, there are some major narrative issues that prevent the film from being an accidental masterpiece." [...] Mendelson described the film as being [...] "an acting powerhouse" [...] based on its many emotional themes.|$|E
500|$|Not all Capitol hauntings {{are related}} to people who worked there. The [...] "Demon Cat" [...] is alleged to prowl the halls of Congress, and make {{appearances}} just before a national tragedy or change in Presidential administration. It was first seen {{in the early part}} of the 19th century, and a night watchman shot at it in 1862. It has also been seen by other night watchmen and members of the Capitol Police. It appeared before the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the October 1929 stock market crash, and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The cat has not only been seen in the halls, but has repeatedly appeared in Washington's Tomb. The Tomb (two levels below the crypt beneath the Capitol Rotunda) was an original feature of the Capitol, planned as a resting place for George Washington and members of his family. The Washington family politely declined the offer. The Tomb stands empty, although from 1865 to 2009 (when it was moved to the United States Capitol Visitor Center) the Lincoln catafalque was stored there. The specters of at least two soldiers are also said to haunt the Capitol. A few eyewitnesses have claimed that whenever an individual lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, a World War I doughboy momentarily appears, salutes, then disappears. A second apparition, which eyewitnesses say is the ghost of an American Revolutionary War soldier, has also appeared at the Washington Tomb. According to several stories, the soldier appears, moves around the Lincoln catafalque, and then passes out <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>into</b> the hallway before disappearing.|$|E
