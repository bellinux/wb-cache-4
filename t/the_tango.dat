40|$|This {{essay will}} attempt to {{disentangle}} the “DNA” of the intricate music of tango in order to reveal the Italian strand of its genetic sequence, following it trans-historically and trans-continentally from its inception in Buenos Aires to its contemporary return to one of its ancestral homes, Italy. Outlining a little-studied version of “Italian sound,” in the following pages I will aim to unearth the Italian roots of tango in Argentina, which require a thorough description because they are often overlooked, by considering some textual examples. I will then follow <b>the</b> <b>tango’s</b> long branching out to Italy, through a brief treatment of the successful arrival of this music on the peninsula and through consideration {{of some of its}} most original all-Italian versions, <b>the</b> <b>tangos</b> by singer and songwriter Paolo Conte. The perspective offered here will be that of an overview covering a century of “Italian tango” and will especially privilege the connection between <b>the</b> <b>tangos</b> of Buenos Aires and those of the Asti-born Italian composer. ...|$|R

25|$|Indigenous Cuban dances {{did not use}} {{the closed}} hold with couples dancing {{independently}} until the danzón later in the century, though the guaracha might be an earlier example. The waltz has another characteristic: it is a 'travelling' dance, with couples moving round the arena. In Latin dances, progressive movement of dancers is unusual, but does occur in the conga, the samba and <b>the</b> <b>tango.</b>|$|E
25|$|Western {{lifestyles and}} Western-style art put {{pressure}} on the traditional Turkish formats and these were swept off to the side.

Kanto's popoularity began to fade, the city's centers of entertainment shifted, and the theaters of Galata and Direklerarası were closed down. Turkish female artists were unreceptive to kanto's inherent ribairy and chose to keep their distance from it.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} scored by Franz Waxman. His theme for Norma Desmond {{was based on}} tango music, {{inspired}} by her having danced <b>the</b> <b>tango</b> with Rudolph Valentino. This style was contrasted with Joe Gillis's bebop theme. Waxman also used distorted arrangements of popular film-music styles from the 1920s and 1930s to suggest Norma Desmond's state of mind. The film's score was recorded for compact disc by the Scottish Symphony Orchestra conducted by Joel McNeely and released in 2002.|$|E

25|$|The {{one-step}} {{and other}} dances {{had been done}} to the tempo of Memphis Blues.... When St Louis Blues was written <b>the</b> <b>tango</b> was in vogue.

The dancers seemed electrified. Something within them came suddenly to life. An instinct that wanted so much to live, to fling its arms to spread joy, took them by the heels.|$|E

50|$|In <b>the</b> ballroom <b>tango,</b> most forward {{steps of}} the man's left foot are {{placed in front of}} the right foot in CBMP, due to <b>the</b> <b>tango's</b> {{characteristic}} compact hold and movement slightly biased towards {{the right side of the}} body.

25|$|The first disc-less {{sound film}} was Tango (1931), {{directed}} by Luis Maglia Barth {{and a key}} film of the period was <b>the</b> <b>tango</b> film Dancing which saw {{the birth of a}} number of Argentine stars such as Amelia Bence and Tito Lusiardo; other popular actors from the era included Aida Alberti, Armando Bo, Floren Delbene and Arturo García Buhr. Two such features which have endured in local culture are Honeysuckle, starring Libertad Lamarque and Casamiento en Buenos Aires, starring Niní Marshall.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tangos</b> group {{comprises}} {{most of the}} flamenco {{forms in}} a 4/4 beat. It comprises tangos, tientos, farruca, garrotín and rumba and tanguillos, plus other rare palos such as marianas. The tientos are a slower, more syncopated form of <b>the</b> <b>tangos</b> which recall <b>the</b> rhythm of the habaneras. Many traditional melodies can be sung both in tango and tiento rhythm and, quite often, singers start with a suite of tientos and complete it {{with one or more}} stanzas in <b>tango</b> rhythm. <b>The</b> farruca and the garrotín were folkloric songs originated probably in Asturias and Catalonia and brought to Andalusia, where they acquired flamenco characteristics.|$|R
