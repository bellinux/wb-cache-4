25|$|On map {{projections}} {{there is}} no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear. The examples below show the named parallels (as red lines) on the commonly used Mercator projection and the <b>Transverse</b> <b>Mercator</b> <b>projection.</b> On the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical, whereas on the latter {{there is no}} exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical: both are complicated curves.|$|E
25|$|The {{conformal}} latitude {{defines a}} transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of arbitrary radius {{such that the}} angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid {{is the same as}} the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of small elements is well preserved). A further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the <b>Transverse</b> <b>Mercator</b> <b>projection</b> on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).|$|E

Within this strip Mercator is very good, highly accurate and shape preserving because it is conformal (angle preserving). These observations prompted {{the development of the}} <b>transverse</b> <b>Mercator</b> <b>projections</b> in which a meridian is treated 'like an equator' of the projection so that we obtain an accurate map within a narrow distance of that meridian. Such maps are good for countries aligned nearly north-south (like Great Britain) and a set of 60 such maps is used for the Universal <b>Transverse</b> <b>Mercator</b> (UTM). Note that in both these projections (which are based on various ellipsoids) the transformation equations for x and y and the expression for the scale factor are complicated functions of both latitude and longitude.|$|R

Control point selection is the most critical aspect of integrating the Thematic Mapper Simulator MSS imagery with the cartographic data. It is noted that control points chosen from the imagery are subject to error from mislocated points, either points that did not correlate well to the reference map or minor pixel offsets because of interactive cursorring errors. Errors are also introduced in map control points when points are improperly located and digitized, leading to inaccurate latitude and longitude coordinates. Nonsystematic aircraft platform variations, such as yawl, pitch, and roll, affect the spatial fidelity of the imagery in comparison with the quadrangles. Features in adjacent flight paths do not always correspond properly owing to the systematic panorama effect and alteration of flightline direction, as well as platform variations...|$|R
