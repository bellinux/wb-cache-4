The MTS assay is often described as a 'one-step' MTT assay, which offers the convenience of adding the reagent straight to the cell culture without the intermittent steps required in the MTT assay. However this convenience makes the MTS assay susceptible to colormetric interference as the intermittent steps in the MTT assay remove traces of coloured compounds, whilst these remain in the microtitre plate in the one-step MTS assay. Precautions are needed to ensure accuracy when using this assay and there are strong arguments for confirming MTS results using qualitative observations under a microscope.

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{tetrazolium}} test is used {{to control}} seed quality of various plant species since it allows a rapid evaluation of viability. Freshly harvested barley seeds show dormancy that can make the germination test ineffective for an immediate evaluation. Therefore, {{the development of more}} efficient methods, such as the tetrazolium test, is necessary. The objective of this research work was to study various procedures for performing the tetrazolium test on barley seeds. Five lots of cv. BRS 195 barley seeds were used and subjected to the following treatments: two different methods of seed preconditioning (direct immersion in H 2 O and between sheets of moistened paper towels); two types of preparation for staining (longitudinal cross-section of the seed through the embryo with immersion of one half in a 2, 3, 5 triphenyl tetrazolium chloride solution or placing both halves on top of filter paper moistened with the <b>tetrazolium</b> <b>salt</b> solution); two methods of staining (on top of filter paper and direct immersion in the <b>tetrazolium</b> <b>salt</b> solution).

AdditionalKeyphrase: enzymatic method “Diaphorase ” is the generic name for a group of enzymes widely used in clinical diagnostic reagents to couple pyridine nucleotide-dependent analyte oxidation to reduction of chromogenic electron acceptors. This allows many different assays to be done with measurements within the visible range of the spectrum, rather than in the ultraviolet. Diaphorase activity is commonly measured spectrophotometrically,with use of various electron acceptors such as 2, 6 -dichlorophe-nolindophenol (DCPIP.) 2 Unfortunately, there are several problems with these techniques, including nonlinearity, high blank rates, and measurement of decreasing ratherthan in-creasing absorbance. <b>Tetrazolium</b> <b>salts</b> have been increasingly applied in recent years, particularly in oxidation-reduction histochemistry (1).

The present study was carried out to clarify the surprising lack of effect of Rottlerin on MCF- 7 cell viability, assessed by the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test.

Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase has been selected as an example of these dehydrogenases. It was found that the use of nitro-BT and tetranitro-BT, unlike neotetrazolium and BPST, in combination with an exogeneous electron carrier and azide, resulted in localization patterns in agreement with the sites of activity as determined by microchemical techniques. In the absence of an intermediate carrier the localization was very similar to that of NADPH cytochrome c (P 450) reductase as demonstrated immunocytochemically. BPST did not properly localize dehydrogenase activity, most probably because of the redistribution of formazan, due to its lack of firm substantivity. Neotetrazolium reduction in nitrogen gave the localization pattern, both in the presence and absence of carrier, of the reductase, suggesting that the transfer of reducing equivalents from the exogenous electron carrier to neotetrazolium proceeds via cellular electron transport systems. The reduction of nitro-BT and tetranitro-BT via intermediate carriers was oxygen sensitive in parenchymal cells, but not in the non-parenchymal liver cells. This oxygen sensitivity could be blocked by azide. With neotetrazolium, oxygen inhibited both carrier-mediated and carrier-independent reactions, effects that were not reversed with azide.
