5|$|By 1938, rumours purported that Stanley Matthews {{wanted to}} leave Stoke to further his career. This led to a meeting at Kings Hall, {{attended}} by three thousand people with a further thousand outside. Matthews opted to stay with Stoke and helped the club to finish in seventh place in the 1938–39 season. The outbreak of the Second World War prevented further progress as the league was suspended for six years. After resumption of the FA Cup, 33 fans died and 520 were injured during a sixth round away game against Bolton Wanderers when <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> barriers gave way on the terraces.|$|E
5|$|Enemy monsters {{inhabit the}} levels, but the player can crush them by {{flattening}} impassable blocks against them. The player may also encounter timers {{in the form}} of alarm clocks that will begin to elapse when crushed {{for the first time and}} can only be stopped when Danny jumps on them. Danny wakes from his mental explorations if he falls off the level or too high of a surface, is touched by a monster, or fails to stop a timer, but <b>the</b> <b>C.R.U.S.H.</b> device reinserts him at the start of the level or the last checkpoint Danny passed.|$|E

5|$|No {{members of}} the general public were {{permitted}} on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> of people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1979, a crowd crush at a Who gig at the Riverfront Coliseum, Cincinnati killed 11 fans. This {{was partly}} due to the festival seating, where the first to enter get the best positions.

During the same visit, The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria, and the sisters asked {{to be allowed to}} stand near the front, but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of <b>the</b> <b>crush.</b> In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane. Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards. Dykins had married again, but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife, and did not attend their father's funeral.|$|E
40|$|Cone crushers {{are widely}} used in the mining and {{aggregates}} industries {{to reduce the size}} of blasted rock. A cone crusher consists of a fixed conic liner called concave and inside it a smaller moving liner called mantle. The mantle is suspended on an eccentrically rotating shaft. As the eccentric is turned, rock particles fed to <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> will be squeezed and <b>crushed</b> between <b>the</b> mantle and concave. <b>The</b> <b>crushing</b> process is governed by the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> liners. Previous research has made it possible to model <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> process for a given set of liners and feed rock material. This model has made it possible to optimise the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> chamber. A problem however is that due to wear <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> geometry and performance will change and possibly suffer. For this reason it is desirable to be able to simulate not only <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> process for a given <b>crusher,</b> but also <b>the</b> wear and change of performance over time. A model for this purpose is presented. <b>The</b> cone <b>crusher</b> model comprises flow, breakage, power draw, hydraulic pressure and wear. The material used in rock crusher wear parts is austenitic manganese steel, a material well known for its work hardening capability. It has been a common conception in the mining and aggregates industry that the work hardening increases as <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> pressure against <b>the</b> liner increases. To verify this, hardness tests were performed on two mantles that were cut and grinded. Liners used to crush two different materials, granite and highly abrasive quartzite, were studied. The tests reveal that there is no variation in obtained hardness depending on crushing pressure or rock material for the studied application. <b>The</b> <b>crusher</b> model has two model parameters which need to be validated. A study was conducted in a quarry where operating conditions were tracked during the lifetime of the liners. Operating parameters are predicted with acceptable accuracy, although <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> was run under inconsistent conditions. An important question is whether model parameters remain valid as liners are worn. The simulation results show that they do. <b>The</b> <b>crusher</b> model is useful to engineers developing new crusher liners, and for selecting an appropriate liner for a certain crushing application...|$|R
40|$|Wear in rock crushers causes great {{costs in}} the mining and {{aggregates}} industry. Change of the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> liners is {{a major reason for}} these costs. Being able to predict the geometry of a worn crusher will help designing <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> liners for improved performance. A model for prediction of sliding wear was suggested by Archard in 1953. Tests have been conducted to determine the wear coefficient in Archard's model. Using a small jaw <b>crusher,</b> <b>the</b> wear of <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> liners has been studied for different settings of <b>the</b> <b>crusher.</b> <b>The</b> experiments have been carried out using quartzite, known for being very abrasive. Crushing forces have been measured, and the motion of <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> has been tracked along with the wear on <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> liners. <b>The</b> test results show that the wear mechanisms are different for the fixed and moving liner. If there were no relative sliding distance between rock and liner, Archard's model would yield no wear. This is not true for rock crushing applications where wear is observed even though there is no macroscopic sliding between the rock material and the liners. For this reason, Archard's model has been modified to account for the wear induced by the local sliding of particles being <b>crushed.</b> <b>The</b> predicted worn geometry is similar to <b>the</b> real <b>crusher.</b> A cone crusher is a machine commonly used in the mining and aggregates industry. In a cone <b>crusher,</b> <b>the</b> geometry of <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> chamber is crucial for performance. The objective of this work, where wear was studied in a jaw crusher, is to implement a model to predict the geometry of a worn cone crusher...|$|R

5|$|Ibrox Park had {{the worst}} fan safety record in Britain before its {{complete}} redesign and renaming in 1997. Two fans died in September 1961 when a barrier collapsed on Stairway 13, resulting in a crush. Stairway 13 was a popular, often overcrowded, and very steep exit from the East Terracing due to its proximity to Copland Road subway station and parking areas for the Rangers supporters' coaches. After this incident, Rangers installed safety measures, but further injuries were sustained in crushes on Stairway 13 in both 1967 and 1969. On 23 October 1968, the main stand at Ibrox was hit by fire. Just seven months later there was another fire, which destroyed more than 200 seats behind the directors box. The worst disaster to yet affect football in Britain happened on Stairway 13 after the Old Firm game on 2 January 1971, when 66 people died of asphyxiation due to another crush on Stairway 13. The game itself ended in a 1–1 draw, with Colin Stein scoring a late equalising goal for Rangers. This led to a widespread belief that <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> had been caused by fans who had left the game early, but had turned back {{when they heard the}} roar that greeted the Rangers goal. A public inquiry discounted this initial story. It established that the crowd had been travelling in the same direction when <b>the</b> <b>crush</b> happened, with it perhaps being precipitated by some bending over to pick up items that had been discarded during the goal celebrations. The downward force of the crowd leaving the stadium meant that when people started to fall there was no means of preventing a crush.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{departure}} from the WWF, Adams, who continued to use <b>the</b> <b>Crush</b> gimmick, returned to PNW. He was portrayed as a dominant wrestler, winning both the Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship and the Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. Adams received {{the first of these}} two championships during this stint in the PNW while teaming with previous rival Steve Doll and defeating The Bruise Brothers for the Tag Team Championship on July 27, 1991 in Portland, Oregon. They remained the champions until September 1, 1991 when they lost the title to The Grappler and Don Harris. A little more than a month later, Adams received his second Pacific Northwest Heavyweight title, on October 12, 1991, in Portland after he defeated Rip Oliver via submission to the Full Nelson hold. Adams was the champion for just over three months, losing the title to Ron Harris at a show in Portland, on January 18, 1992.|$|E

A now disoriented Crusher is able to be pinned (literally, as Bugs put a coat on Crusher, gets him to lie down and pins the coat's shoulders to the mat). When the match ends and Bugs is declared <b>the</b> new champion, <b>Crusher</b> snaps out of it. He offers his hand to shake Bugs', despite the crowd's objections causing <b>the</b> <b>Crusher</b> to merely growl them into silence). Bugs relents and when Crusher tries to bite Bugs' arm he's instead biting through a stick of dynamite, which blows up in his face.|$|R
