5|$|A slow {{weakening}} trend began {{early on}} September 27 {{due to the}} increased shear while remaining on a west-northwest track. At the same time, the center of circulation became exposed at times due to the southwesterly wind shear. As a result, an unusual wind field was observed in that the strongest winds were recorded well {{to the east and}} to the northwest of the center. <b>The</b> <b>weakening</b> trend remained fairly slow that evening as the storm continued to produce persistent deep convection. <b>The</b> <b>weakening</b> trend accelerated on September 28 as the convection weakened and the circulation became more disorganized in the high-shear environment. By that morning, Karen weakened to a minimal tropical storm with 40mph (65km/h) winds. Karen also turned abruptly to the north for a short while, as convection interacted with the low-level center and southerly winds increased in the low-level environment. <b>The</b> <b>weakening</b> trend slowed that afternoon as deep convection returned to the disorganized storm. Early on September 29, the high wind shear continued and Karen weakened to a tropical depression with a very poorly defined center. That afternoon, the circulation dissipated while east of the Lesser Antilles. Remnant squalls continued across the area east of the Lesser Antilles for a few days after dissipation.|$|E

5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for about 24hours, Kyle began weakening on September27 as increased upper-level shear restricted outflow and distorted the convection envelope; drier air {{also contributed to}} <b>the</b> <b>weakening.</b> On September 28, after turning west-northwestward, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, and {{by the next day}} the center had become devoid of deep convection. A trough passing to its north and a developing ridge to its west left the storm nearly stationary for several days. <b>The</b> <b>weakening</b> rate of Kyle was temporarily halted when thunderstorms redeveloped on September29 and again early the next day, though late on September30 the storm weakened to tropical depression status. The circulation had become elongated from northeast to southwest. The northeastern portion became associated with the approaching frontal zone, and was briefly monitored for signs of development. However, the southwestern portion redeveloped convection and became the dominant circulation.|$|E

5|$|June 16, 2001– <b>The</b> <b>weakening</b> Tropical Storm Allison tracks northward {{along the}} U.S. East Coast, passing {{southeast}} of the state. Rainfall from Allison totaled to 7.5inches (190mm) in Denton, closing eleven roads and causing washouts on 41 others.|$|E
5|$|Later on August6, <b>the</b> <b>weakening</b> trend briefly halted as outflow {{significantly}} improved {{due to an}} {{area of low pressure}} north of Meranti. However, wind shear drastically increased, displacing convection to the northwest of the circulation center. By this time, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition. Due to the influence of a major shortwave trough approaching from the west, Meranti took a sharp northward turn. The JTWC issued their final advisory on <b>the</b> <b>weakening</b> cyclone around 0600UTC on August8. The JMA continued to monitor Meranti as a tropical cyclone until August9. Shortly after becoming extratropical, the remnants of the storm executed a slow, counter-clockwise loop until August12. Shortly after crossing the International Date Line on August13, the storm was absorbed by a large non-tropical low over the Bering Sea.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} the southern Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ivan weakened to Category4 status by 0600UTC on September 14. As it gradually {{turned to the}} north, southwesterly flow from a large trough over the central United States increased wind shear over the hurricane. An eyewall replacement cycle, along with dry air and restricted outflow, contributed to <b>the</b> <b>weakening.</b> By late on September 14 <b>the</b> <b>weakening</b> trend ceased as the eyewall became better defined, and Ivan was expected to restrengthen slightly over an area of warmer water temperatures. The eye diameter expanded to 60miles (95km/h), though concurrently westerly wind shear and dry air continued to increase. As Ivan approached the Gulf Coast of the United States, Hurricane Hunters reported erosion of the southern portion of the eyewall, and cooler waters just offshore contributed to further weakening. At around 0650UTC on September 16, Hurricane Ivan made landfall just west of Gulf Shores, Alabama with an intensity of 120mph (195km/h); the strongest winds occurred over a narrow area near the southern Alabama and western Florida border. Its landfall {{was accompanied by a}} 10–15feet (3–4.5m) storm surge from Destin, Florida westward to Mobile Bay.|$|E

5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in {{forward speed}} northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, in which two tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold front that absorbed <b>the</b> <b>weakening</b> low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E
5|$|After making landfall, Nida {{weakened}} {{and then}} turned more northward and slowed down. Re-entering the warmer waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, Nida's winds restrengthened to 150 mph (250km/h). During the night of May 18, the typhoon began to weaken. Infrared satellite imagery showed the eye being obscured by high cirrostratus clouds, indicative of <b>the</b> <b>weakening</b> typhoon. The eyewall became significantly disorganized as Nida continued to recurve to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Because of its rapid movement, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on December 22. As the storm weakened, the watches were discontinued. In {{response to the}} threat of the hurricane, officials posted a small craft advisory along the coastline of northern Puerto Rico. There, <b>the</b> <b>weakening</b> tropical cyclone produced light rainfall, though there was no reported damage. Lili moved through Hispaniola as an area of squally weather, but damage, if any, is unknown.|$|E
