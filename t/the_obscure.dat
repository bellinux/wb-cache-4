5|$|The poem is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; it employs a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of <b>the</b> <b>obscure</b> rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, <b>the</b> <b>obscure</b> and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its approach to life and death.|$|E

40|$|The Renyi-Ulam game {{is played}} between two players, the Seeker and <b>the</b> <b>Obscurer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Obscurer</b> thinks of a number between 1 and $n$. The Seeker wishes to {{identify}} that number. On each turn, the Seeker asks <b>the</b> <b>Obscurer</b> whether her number belongs to a specific subset of the numbers from 1 to $n$. <b>The</b> <b>Obscurer</b> answers either yes or no, and her answer is either true or false. The series of truths and lies given by <b>the</b> <b>Obscurer</b> must conform to a restriction $R$ that the players have agreed on in advance. We give criteria on the restrictions $R$ that allow the Seeker to win. Then we apply our results {{to the study of}} restrictions characterized by forbidden substrings. In particular, we give a complete classification of all such restrictions characterized by two forbidden substrings, elaborating on Czyzowicz, Lakshmanan and Pelc's classification of all such restrictions characterized by one forbidden substring.

5|$|There is a {{difference}} in tone between the {{two versions of the}} elegy; the early one ends with an emphasis on the narrator joining with <b>the</b> <b>obscure</b> common man, while the later version ends with an emphasis on how it is natural for humans to want to be known. The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the earlier version serves as a Christian consolation regarding death.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde {{resigned}} {{as vice president}} and was elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 1991, and re-elected in 1995. He ran for president in 1999, being defeated by Fernando de la Rúa. De la Rúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and Congress appointed the governor of San Luis Province Adolfo Rodríguez Saá as president. When Rodríguez Saá also resigned, Congress appointed Duhalde. During Duhalde's term in office, a huge currency devaluation and an increase of the exchange rate led to a gradual recovery. He successfully supported <b>the</b> <b>obscure</b> candidate Néstor Kirchner against Menem, who sought a new presidential term. Duhalde had political disputes with Kirchner in later years, and is largely retired from politics since his defeat in the 2011 presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia stands in a pose which Etty had sketched many times, that {{of a woman with}} her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose <b>the</b> <b>obscure</b> subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a woman in this pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish {{than the rest of the}} canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later in a studio.|$|E

5|$|There follow {{confusing}} episodes involving Brittany (sometimes called Letia). Padarn finally {{leaves for}} France, where he dies, but his remains are brought back and buried in Vannes. A final chapter tells how Padarn, David and Teilo divide south Wales into three episcopates, with Padarn as bishop of Ceredigion. Then, convinced by a miracle performed by Padarn, a local governor called Eithir is persuaded to give land between the rivers Rheidol and Paith to Padarn. The lands owned by Llanbadarn in {{the twelfth century}} were between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach. The Paith is a minor tributary of the River Ystwyth. <b>The</b> <b>obscure</b> figure of Eithyr is commemorated in the farm name of Llaneithr, which stands a mile east of Devil's Bridge near the river Mynach.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{has drawn}} {{influence}} {{from a number}} of musical genres. As a teenager, he mostly listened to 1960s folk and religious music, including the Christian singer-songwriter Larry Norman. For playing on his junior high baseball team, he was given Leon Russell's 1970 debut album, which he says influenced some of his vocalizing. Later in high school and in college, he discovered punk music (Black Flag), along with bands from other genres, such as the new wave band The Cars and <b>the</b> <b>obscure</b> Angst. While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, he listened to Hüsker Dü's Zen Arcade, The Spotlight Kid by Captain Beefheart, and I'm Sick of You, an Iggy Pop bootleg. Thompson was also greatly influenced by the Beatles self-titled 1968 release (known as White Album) with regards to the experimental nature of his compositions (especially those featured in Doolittle).|$|E
5|$|On March 11, a {{day before}} Austria was annexed into Greater Germany {{following}} the Anschluss, Justas Lukoševičius, a Lithuanian border patrol, shot Stanisław Serafin, a Polish soldier, on the demarcation line {{in the village of}} Trasninkai near Merkinė. The exact circumstances are not clear as <b>the</b> <b>obscure</b> event was variously portrayed as a Lithuanian provocation, a Polish provocation, or as an unfortunate accident. During the 1920s and 1930s, similar incidents had occurred: between 1927 and 1937 seven Lithuanian border guards were killed during the course of 78 events. Usually, such incidents were handled at the local level in an attempt to forestall escalation. On this occasion, however, Polish radio and newspapers picked up the story and fanned anti-Lithuanian sentiment. Protests were held in Warsaw, Vilnius, and four other cities where the crowds shouted for military action against Lithuania. There is evidence that the Camp of National Unity was involved in organizing the protests.|$|E

40|$|Observations {{point toward}} {{some form of}} “co-evolutionary sequence,” from dust-enshrouded starbursts to {{luminous}} unobscured quasars. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is generally invoked to expel <b>the</b> <b>obscuring</b> dusty gas in a blow-out event, eventually revealing the hidden central quasar. However, the physical mechanism driving AGN feedback, either due to winds or radiation, remains uncertain and is still a source of much debate. We consider quasar feedback, based on radiation pressure on dust, which directly acts on <b>the</b> <b>obscuring</b> dusty gas. We show that AGN radiative feedback is capable of efficiently removing <b>the</b> <b>obscuring</b> cocoon, and driving powerful outflows on galactic scales, consistent with recent observations. I will discuss how such quasar feedback may provide a natural physical interpretation of the observed evolutionary path, and the physical implications in the broader context of black hole-host galaxy co-evolution...|$|R
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{execution}} of Joachim III, who had previously saved Theodore Svetoslav from Byzantine captivity, are not entirely clear. Historians Ivan Bozhilov and Vasil Gyuzelev speculate that the Patriarch was among the responsible dignitaries for a Mongol invasion in 1285, after which Theodore Svetoslav had to be sent a hostage in the Golden Horde. John Van Antwerp Fine Jr. suggests that the alleged treachery might be linked to <b>the</b> <b>obscure</b> period when Smilets overthrew George Terter I. Others believe that the verdict {{was a result of}} the desire of the new emperor to seek personal retribution from those who he deemed responsible for the hardships of his youth. However, most agree that the actions of Theodore Svetoslav consolidated the shaken imperial authority and paved the way for his long and successful reign. Bulgaria prospered between 1300 and 1321; the Mongol interference was dealt with and the country even regained Bessarabia from the Golden Horde.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater was {{classified}} in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011. Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling confirmed previous findings that Lichenostomus is not monophyletic. While five species have previously been described as comprising the Caligavis subgroup, studies using the mitochondrial DNA identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most {{closely related to the}} black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and <b>the</b> <b>obscure</b> honeyeater (C. obscurus) of New Guinea; they were therefore grouped into the genus Caligavis. The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus) and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus as Bolemoreus. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around seven million years ago.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} metrics {{for measuring}} clutter effectiveness on model-based automatic target recognition systems with FLIR sensors. The measure for clutter effectiveness proposed {{is the difference}} of two Kullback-Leibler distances between the idealized approximate probabilistic models without clutter and the real model containing clutter. We establish that occluding objects and clutter, when manipulated, do not present a fundamental challenge to model-based ATR system if the model manipulated is an accurate representation of <b>the</b> <b>obscuring</b> clutter. However, if <b>the</b> <b>obscurer</b> is not manipulated, performance degrades in cases where <b>the</b> <b>obscurer</b> is an "effective clutterer. " To quantify the effect of clutter in ATR, estimation and detection problems are considered for rigid ground-based targets. For estimating the orientation of a vehicle, the Hilbert-Schmidt distance is employed. Aaron D. Lanterman, Univ. of Illinois, Coordinated Science Laboratory, 1308 W.
