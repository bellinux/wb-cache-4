The only requirement is that <b>they</b> <b>show</b> an intention to create a trust. The exceptions are where it is a transfer of land, the transfer of existing equitable interests, or where the trust is made in a will.|$|E

Then <b>they</b> <b>showed</b> him the ox's goad wherewith Shamgar slew 600 men. <b>They</b> <b>showed</b> him, also, the jaw-bone with which Samson did such mighty feats. <b>They</b> <b>showed</b> him, moreover, the sling and stone with which David slew Goliath of Gath; and the sword, also, with which their Lord will kill the Man of Sin, in {{the day that he}} shall rise up to the prey. <b>They</b> <b>showed</b> him, besides, many excellent things, with which Christian was much delighted. This done, they went to their rest again.[80] ...|$|R

Falcarinol and falcarindiol (cis-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol) are such compounds. This latter compound shows antifungal activity towards Mycocentrospora acerina and Cladosporium cladosporioides. Falcarindiol is the main compound responsible for bitterness in carrots.|$|E

5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. <b>They</b> <b>show</b> temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Azamat {{abandons}} Borat, {{taking his}} passport, {{all of their}} money, and their bear (whose head is later seen inside Azamat's motel refrigerator). Borat's truck runs out of gas, and he begins to hitchhike to California. He is soon picked up by drunken fraternity brothers from the University of South Carolina. On learning {{the reason for his}} trip, <b>they</b> <b>show</b> him the Pam and Tommy sex tape, revealing that she is not the virgin he thought she was. After leaving the three students, Borat becomes despondent, burning the Baywatch booklet and, by mistake, his return ticket to Kazakhstan. He is also about to slaughter his pet hen, but then changes his mind and lets it go.|$|E

5|$|Besides the nucleolus, {{the nucleus}} {{contains}} {{a number of}} other non-membrane-delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that <b>they</b> <b>show</b> that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.|$|E
5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. They argue that such immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. <b>They</b> <b>show</b> that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 state will be less stable than those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; <b>they</b> <b>show</b> reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E

5|$|Chesney {{was active}} in his diocese; more than 240documents {{relating}} to his episcopal career survive. <b>They</b> <b>show</b> him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney {{bought a house in}} London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an episcopal palace in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city. He died in December 1166, probably on the 27th, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Colors {{accepted}} by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings). Bays with white markings are the most popular. Norman Cobs are known as calm, willing horses with strong personalities. The breed's Thoroughbred ancestry gives them energy and athleticism, and makes them mature faster than other draft breeds. <b>They</b> <b>show</b> great endurance when ridden, and are relatively hardy, accepting outdoor living and changes in climate. Traditionally the Norman Cob had its tail docked, a practice that continued until January 1996, when the practice became illegal in France.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents {{the events of the}} biblical Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. <b>They</b> <b>show</b> an unpopulated earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting sharply with the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with lustful humanity.|$|E

5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become amenable to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, <b>they</b> <b>show</b> considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle {{in response to the}} rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, {{some of the}} elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids, although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals, are occasionally referred to as near-metalloids or noted for their metalloidal character. To {{the left of the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line, such elements include gallium, tin and bismuth. <b>They</b> <b>show</b> unusual packing structures, marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric), and amphoterism. To the right of the dividing line are carbon, phosphorus, selenium and iodine. They exhibit metallic lustre, semiconducting properties and bonding or valence bands with delocalized character. This applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions: carbon as graphite; phosphorus as black phosphorus; and selenium as grey selenium.|$|E
