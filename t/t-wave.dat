40|$|Background/Aim. Some electrocardiographic (ECG) {{patterns}} are characteristic for pulmonary embolism but exact {{meaning of the}} different ECG signs are not well known. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the association between four common ECG signs in pulmonary embolism [complete or incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), S-waves in the aVL lead, S 1 Q 3 T 3 sign and negative <b>T-waves</b> in the precordial leads] with shock index (SI), right ventricle diastolic diameter (RVDD) and peak systolic pressure (RVSP) and embolic burden score (EBS). Methods. The presence of complete or incomplete RBBB, S waves in aVL lead, S 1 Q 3 T 3 sign and negative <b>T-waves</b> in the precordial leads were determined at admission ECG in 130 consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a single tertiary medical center in a 5 -year period. Echocardiography examination with measurement of RVDD and RVSP, multidetector computed tomography pulmonary angiography (MDCT-PA) with the calculation of EBS and SI was determined during the admission process. Multivariable regression models were calculated with ECG parameters as independent variables and the mentioned ultrasound, MDCT-PA parameters and SI as dependent variables. Results. The presence of S-waves in the aVL was the only independent predictor of RVDD (F = 39. 430, p < 0. 001; adjusted R 2 = 0. 231) and systolic peak right ventricle pressure (F = 29. 903, p < 0. 001; adjusted R 2 = 0. 185). Negative <b>T-waves</b> in precordial leads were the only independent predictor for EBS (F = 24. 177, p < 0. 001; R 2 = 0. 160). Complete or incomplete RBBB was the independent predictor of SI (F = 20. 980, p < 0. 001; adjusted R 2 = 0. 134). Conclusion. In patients with pulmonary embolism different ECG patterns at admission correlate with different clinical, ultrasound and MDCT-PA parameters. RBBB is associated with shock, Swave in the aVL is associated with right ventricle pressure and negative <b>T-waves</b> with the thrombus burden in the pulmonary tree...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} ECG {{remains the}} most common noninvasive tool for diagnosing and studying atrial fibrillation (AF). Due to the much higher amplitude of the electrical ventricular activity in the surface ECG, isolation of the atrial activity component {{is crucial to the}} analysis and characterization of AF. An average beat subtraction (ABS) based method is developed to perform this QRST cancellation. In contrast with standard methods, two sets of templates are created instead of one: one set for the QRS complexes and one for the <b>T-waves.</b> The QRS complexes are clustered according to their morphology; the <b>T-waves,</b> using both their preceding RR interval and their morphology. Next, spatial optimization (rotation and scaling) is applied to the QRS templates. ECG signals generated by a biophysical model are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with two other QRST cancellation methods. The proposed method decreases the averaged relative error by���and� � in comparison with the standard ABS and the standard spatiotemporal method, respectively. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Right {{ventricular}} dysfunction (RVD) {{is associated}} with poor prognosis in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (APE). Echocardiography and computed tomography (CT) -angiography {{may be difficult to}} perform in a serial follow up, unlike electrocardiography (ECG). Many ECG findings specific for APE have been reported, and many studies have found that negative <b>T-waves</b> (NTW) in precordial leads are most frequently observed in patients with APE. We analyzed serial changes in precordial NTW to detect RVD and predict the recovery of RVD in patients with APE. Methods: We examined 81 consecutive patients diagnosed with APE using CT-angiography or echocardiography. ECG, transthoracic echocardiography, and laboratory tests were performed within 24 hours of admission, and daily ECG follow-up was performed. Precordial NTWs were defined by the new development of pointed and symmetrical inverted <b>T-waves</b> in at least three leads. Recovery of NTW was defined as flattening or upright inverted <b>T-waves</b> in more than two leads. Results: Of the 81 patients with APE, 52 (64 %) had RVD according to echocardiography. Among the patients with RVD, 33 (63 %) showed precordial NTW. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that NTW was the strongest independent predictor for RVD (odds ratio, 22. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 4 to 221. 4; p = 0. 007). Time to normalization of NTW was associated with improvement of RVD on echocardiography (r = 0. 84, p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Precordial NTW was a reliable finding to identify RVD in patients with APE. Improvements in RVD can be predicted by normalizing precordial NTW...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tako-Tsubo {{cardiomyopathy}} (TTC) presents with chest pain, ST-segment elevation {{followed by}} <b>T-waves</b> inversion and QT interval prolongation (Wellens' ECG pattern) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, which may mimic an acute coronary syndrome. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the pathophysiologic {{basis of the}} Wellens' ECG pattern in TTC by characterization of underlying myocardial changes using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). METHODS: The study population included 20 consecutive patients with TTC (95 % females,mean age 65. 3 ± 10. 4 years) who underwent CMR studies both in the initial phase and after 3 -months of follow-up, using a protocol which included cine images, T 2 -weighted sequences for myocardial edema and post-contrast sequences for late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Quantitative ECG indexes of repolarization, such as maximal amplitude of negative <b>T-waves</b> (NTWm), sum of the amplitudes of negative T waves (NTWs) and maximum QT interval (QTc max), were correlated to CMR findings. RESULTS: At the time of initial CMR study, {{there was a significant}} linear correlation between apico-basal ratio of T 2 signal intensity (SI) for myocardial edema and NTWm (ρ= 0. 498;p= 0. 02), NTWs (ρ= 0. 483;p= 0. 03) and QTc max (ρ= 0. 520;p= 0. 02). Repolarization indexes were unrelated to either LGE or quantitative cine parameters. Wellens' ECG abnormalities and myocardial edema showed a parallel time course of development and resolution on initial and follow-up CMR studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our study results show that the ischemic-like Wellens' ECG pattern in TTC coincides and quantitatively correlates with the apico-basal gradient of myocardial edema as evidenced by CMR. Dynamic negative <b>T-waves</b> and QTc prolongation are likely to reflect the edema-induced transient inhomogeneity and dispersion of repolarization between apical and basal LV regions...|$|R

40|$|Propofol {{infusion}} syndrome (PRIS) is well known, {{often associated}} with, lethal complication of sedation with propofol. PRIS {{seems to be}} associated with young age, traumatic brain injury (TBI), higher cumulative doses of propofol, and the concomitant use of catecholamines. Known manifestations of PRIS are metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiac failure. While fatal PRIS can occur suddenly and rapidly, there is no sensitive test or early warning sign, and the only preventive measure is to limit propofol dosage and its duration. A case report was used for investigation purposes of this study. We report the case study of a young patient with severe TBI, receiving propofol sedation because of high intracranial pressure. Seven days after the trauma, the patient developed metabolic acidosis and refractory circulatory shock, probably caused by PRIS. Reversal of <b>T-waves</b> was seen on the electrocardiogram (ECG) 29 h before circulation failure occurred. In the absence of other signs of cardiac dysfunction or ischemia, these reversed <b>T-waves</b> probably represent an early warning sign of developing PRIS. From the findings of this study, we conclude that meticulous observation and analysis of the ECG during propofol sedation might result in earlier recognition of developing PRIS...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{patients with}} a distinct electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern without ST-segment elevation {{in the presence of}} an acute occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. DESIGN: Single-centre observational study. PATIENTS: Patients with acute anterior wall myocardial infarction who were referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between 1998 and 2008. RESULTS: We identified {{patients with a}} static, distinct ECG pattern without ST-segment elevation and an occlusion of the proximal LAD artery during urgent coronary angiography before PCI. Of 1890 patients who underwent primary PCI of the LAD artery, we could identify 35 patients (2 %) with this distinct ECG pattern. The ECG showed ST-segment depression at the J-point of at least 1 mm in precordial leads with upsloping ST-segments continuing into tall, symmetrical <b>T-waves.</b> Patients with this distinct ECG pattern were younger, more often male and more often had hypercholesterolaemia compared to patients with anterior myocardial infarction and ST-segment elevation. CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting with chest pain, ST-segment depression at the J-point with upsloping ST-segments and tall, symmetrical <b>T-waves</b> in the precordial leads of the 12 -lead ECG signifies proximal LAD artery occlusion.
