The government warned of a military crackdown amid ongoing protests. Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected US calls to repeal the emergency law and also accused the US of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> its will on the Egyptian government. The newly appointed Mubarak's Culture Minister Gaber Asfour resigned after one week in office, citing health problems.|$|E

25|$|Although Christian {{values were}} {{supposed}} to be spread through the population, missionaries and priests soon realized that they'd be better off adapting their doctrine as much as possible to the local customs, rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> it. As it happened all over Asia, women in the Philippines were expected to become caring and nurturing mothers for their own children and take care of most household chores. Also a trait found all over Asia was the preference of most families to have male children instead of females.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} October 2007, another heavy {{fighting}} erupted in the Swat district of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province between the Frontier Police and the large portion of far right-wing TNSM organization, {{under the command of}} Maulana Fazlullah who was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> Sharia law. In a response, the military deployed a combat brigade under a local Brigadier-General to confront them. After week of {{heavy fighting}} with the brigade combat teams, the battle came to a standstill with both sides suffering heavy casualties. On 3 November 2007, around ~220 paramilitary soldiers and policemen surrendered or deserted after a military position on a hill-top and two police stations were overrun. This left the TNSM in control of most of the Swat district.|$|E
25|$|In June 2008, CEO Joachim Hunold {{offended}} Catalan language speakers, when {{he claimed}} {{in an article}} included in Air Berlin's inflight magazine {{that the government of}} the Balearic Islands was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the use of Catalan on Air Berlin flights from and to Majorca. He claimed that Air Berlin was an international airline and was not obliged to use Catalan. Hunold went on to criticise the language policy in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, claiming that at the time many children could not speak any Spanish. The Balearic Islands' President, Francesc Antich, explained that his government had simply sent a letter to encourage airlines operating in the Balearic Islands to include Catalan among the languages used for onboard announcements.|$|E

25|$|On 29 November, {{voting on}} the new {{constitution}} by the Constituent Assembly of Egypt began, and continued through Thursday night. There were protests against Morsi outside the presidential palace and a small protest supporting Morsi in Giza {{on the outskirts of}} Cairo. The new constitution adopted {{the first part of the}} draft that included the Sharia as the main source of legislation and making Islam a state religion. Egyptian State TV reported that Christianity and Judaism would be the main source for legislation for Christians and Jews. The liberals, left-wing, and Christians boycotted the assembly and accused the Islamists of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> their vision; they also accused them of trying to limit freedom of speech as well as not including articles establishing equality between men and women.|$|E
25|$|On April 27, 1996, the {{faction of}} the United Somali Congress/Somali National Army (USC/SNA) which {{supported}} Atto decided on a programme to enforce sharia (Islamic court and laws) in southern Mogadishu, where Atto's forces were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> control. A committee was nominated to prepare the installation of Islamic courts and an appeal was issued to Islamic leaders {{to decide on the}} religious personalities most suited to head these courts. Islamic courts were already in place {{in the northern part of}} Mogadishu controlled by Ali Mahdi Mohammed, Atto's new ally. The U.S. Department of State asserted, in its Country Report for Somalia for the year 2000, that the killing of Yusuf Tallan, a former general under the Barre regime, was connected to Atto. The report did not provide specific corroboration for the assertion. According to the UNHCR, Atto was responsible for an attack on 26 July 2000 in which about fifty militiamen in heavily armed vehicles attacked the Mogadishu compound of the NGO Action Internationale contre la Faim (ACF), in which two international staff members (French administrator Francoise Deutsch, and British logistician Jonathan Ward) were taken hostage. They were released after the International Committee of the Red Cross intervened on their behalf.|$|E
25|$|Satellite radio: In June 2005, the CRTC outraged some Canadian {{cultural}} nationalists (such as the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting) and labour unions by licensing two companies, Canadian Satellite Radio and Sirius Canada {{to offer}} satellite radio services in Canada. The two companies are {{in partnership with}} American firms XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio respectively, and {{in accordance with the}} CRTC decision will only need to offer ten percent Canadian content. The CRTC contends that this low level of Canadian content, particularly when compared to the 35% rule on local radio stations, was necessary because unlicensed U.S. receivers were already flooding into the country, so that enforcing a ban on these receivers would be nearly impossible (see below). This explanation did not satisfy cultural nationalists, who demanded that the federal cabinet overturn the decision and mandate a minimum of 35% Canadian content. Supporters of the decision argue that satellite radio can only be feasibly set up as a continental system, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> 35% Canadian content across North America is quite unrealistic. They also argue that satellite radio will boost Canadian culture by giving vital exposure to independent artists, instead of concentrating just on the country's stars, and point to the CRTC's successful extraction of promises to program 10% Canadian content on satellite services already operational in the United States as important concessions. Despite popular perception that the CRTC banned Sirius Canada from broadcasting Howard Stern's program, this is not the case. Sirius Canada in fact initially chose not to air Stern based on the possibility of a future issue with the CRTC, although the company reversed its decision and began offering Howard Stern in 2006.|$|E

500|$|Massenet was {{a popular}} and {{respected}} teacher at the Conservatoire. His pupils included Bruneau, Charpentier, Chausson, Hahn, Leroux, Pierné, Rabaud and Vidal. He was known for the care he took in drawing out his pupils' ideas, never <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> his own. One of his last students, Charles Koechlin, recalled Massenet as a voluble professor, dispensing [...] "a teaching active, living, vibrant, and moreover comprehensive". According to some writers, Massenet's influence extended beyond his own students. In {{the view of the}} critic Rodney Milnes, [...] "In word-setting alone, all French musicians profited from the freedom he won from earlier restrictions." [...] Romain Rolland and Francis Poulenc have both considered Massenet an influence on Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande; Debussy was a student at the Conservatoire during Massenet's professorship but did not study under him.|$|E

While finding the music [...] "listenable", Landau identified the album's lyrics as [...] "misguided in so underrating his audience's intelligence" [...] and added: [...] "But then, perhaps Lennon's didacticism, preaching and banality {{are part of the}} mind game of the album's title …" [...] More impressed, Melody Makers Ray Coleman found that [...] "The raw nerves of a Lennon battered by America's curious logic and sheer hard-heartedness seem to have spurred him to write incisively …" [...] Coleman concluded of Mind Games: [...] "Musically or melodically this may not be a stand-out album, but if you warm to the rasping voice of Lennon and, like me, regard him as the true fulcrum of much of what came from his old group, then like any new Lennon album, it will be enjoyable and even important." [...] In a mixed review, Robert Christgau described the album as [...] "A step in the right direction, but only a step". He complimented [...] "Mind Games" [...] as well as the songs [...] "One Day (At a Time)" [...] and [...] "You Are Here", but criticised Lennon for [...] "falling back on ideas that have lost their freshness for him".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{violence}} between drug cartels had been occurring {{long before the}} war began, the government held a generally passive stance regarding cartel violence in the 1990s and early 2000s. That changed on December 11, 2006, when newly elected President Felipe Calderón sent 6,500 federal troops {{to the state of}} Michoacán to end drug violence there (Operation Michoacán). This action is regarded as the first major operation against organized crime, and is generally viewed as the starting point of the war {{between the government and the}} drug cartels. As time progressed, Calderón continued to escalate his anti-drug campaign, in which there are now about 45,000 troops involved in addition to state and federal police forces. In 2010 Calderón said that the cartels seek [...] "to replace the government" [...] and [...] "are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> a monopoly by force of arms, and are even <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> their own laws." ...|$|E

2500|$|Margaret Bromley {{moved to}} Loughborough {{to live with}} Bromskill and his family by the later stages of the Civil War: this was remarked by Edmund Calamy in his famous account of the ejected ministers.

Bromskill was sufficiently wealthy to buy the Loughborough manor house from Ferdinando Hastings, 6th Earl of Huntingdon, in 1654. Nicholas Hall, the existing rector, was displaced, although he was to regain his position when Bromskill was removed in the Great Ejection of 1662, and Hall was treated as the existing incumbent when he subscribed to the Act of Uniformity.|$|E
