5|$|In a Victorian village, Victor Van Dort, {{the son of}} nouveau riche fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the {{neglected}} {{daughter of}} snobbish yet impoverished aristocrats, are preparing for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's penniless family. Both have concerns about marrying someone they do not know, but upon meeting for the first time, they fall for each other. After the shy Victor ruins the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows, he flees and practices his wedding vows in the nearby forest, placing the wedding ring on a nearby upturned <b>tree</b> <b>root.</b> The root {{turns out to be}} the finger of a murdered woman in a tattered bridal gown named Emily, who rises from the grave claiming that she is now Victor's wife. After fainting, Victor wakes up and finds himself spirited away to the Land of the Dead. The bewildered Victor learns the story of how Emily was murdered years ago by an unknown perpetrator on the night of her secret elopement.|$|E
5|$|Plante {{was born}} on a farm near Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, in Mauricie, Quebec, the first of 11 {{children}} born to Palma and Xavier Plante. The family moved to Shawinigan Falls, where his father worked {{in one of the}} local factories. In 1932, Plante began to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, using a goaltender's hockey stick his father had carved from a <b>tree</b> <b>root.</b> When he was five years old, Plante fell off a ladder and broke his hand. The fracture failed to heal properly and affected his playing style during his early hockey career; he underwent successful corrective surgery as an adult. Plante suffered from asthma starting in early childhood. This prevented him from skating for extended periods so he gravitated to playing goaltender. As his playing progressed, Jacques received his first regulation goaltender's stick for Christmas of 1936. His father made Plante's first pads by stuffing potato sacks and reinforcing them with wooden panels. As a child, Plante played hockey outdoors in the bitterly cold Quebec winters. His mother taught him how to knit his own tuques to protect him from the cold. Plante continued knitting and embroidering throughout his life and wore his hand-knitted tuques while playing and practicing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} permeability and {{shear strength}} {{characteristics of a}} surface soil containing <b>tree</b> <b>roots.</b> In this study, Tsukushihagi and Twine were used as <b>tree</b> <b>roots</b> and its alternatives, respectively. Tensile strength of <b>tree</b> <b>roots</b> was measured using a newly developed tension test apparatus. Also, falling head permeability and direct box shear tests were performed on specimen prepared with soil samples mixed with the <b>tree</b> <b>roots</b> or the alternatives. Main conclusions are as follows. 1) The tensile strength increased {{with an increase in}} diameter of <b>tree</b> <b>roots.</b> 2) The coefficient of permeability seems to be not changed by mass content of <b>tree</b> <b>roots.</b> 3) Whereas the internal fiction angle of soil containing <b>tree</b> <b>roots</b> is almost constant, the apparent cohesion increased with increasing the mass content of <b>tree</b> <b>roots...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} paints were red ochre, red lead, soot, calcium carbonate, and other earth colours, which were bound with fat and water.

However, the dominating colours were white and red lead. There are even accounts where runes were reddened with blood as in Grettis saga, where the Völva Þuríðr cut runes on a <b>tree</b> <b>root</b> and coloured them with her own blood to kill Grettir, and in Egils saga where Egill Skallagrímsson cut ale runes on a drinking horn and painted them with his own blood to see if the drink was poisoned.|$|E

Woods stated on his website that it was {{unrelated}} to his previous surgery and he would {{take a break from}} golf until his back healed. He returned for the Masters, finishing in a tie for 17th. In the final round, Woods injured his wrist after his club hit a <b>tree</b> <b>root.</b> He later stated that a bone popped out of his wrist, but he adjusted it back into place and finished the round. Woods then missed the cut at the 2015 U.S. Open and Open Championship, the first time ever Woods missed the cut at consecutive majors, finishing {{near the bottom of the}} leaderboard both times. He finished tied for 18th at the Quicken Loans National on August 2. In late August 2015, Woods played quite well at the Wyndham Championship finishing the tournament at 13-under, only four strokes behind the winner, and tied for 10th place.

40|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>roots</b> {{are often}} damaged during {{construction}} projects, particularly during trenching operations for pipeline installation. Although mechanical soil excavation using heavy equipment, {{such as an}} excavator or backhoe is considered the fastest the most economical method, it damages and destroys <b>tree</b> <b>roots</b> {{and can lead to}} unintentional tree loss, poor public relations, fines, and litigation. In sensitive areas around <b>tree</b> <b>roots,</b> soil excavation can be completed by hand although this is very slow and expensive. Alternate soil excavation methodologies are available, including a special technique that uses supersonic air streams to explode soil around non-porous items such as pipes, fiber optic cables, sewer and phone lines, and <b>tree</b> <b>roots.</b> This paper discusses the use of this technique for “high value ” coast live oak trees (Quercus agrifolia) in urbanized areas. A case study is presented that discusses an appropriate application of the pneumatic soil excavation method. The pneumatic method is a valuable technique for root zone soil excavation. It preserves <b>tree</b> <b>roots</b> during construction to allow retention of the structural integrity of the root system and provides an opportunity to accurately understand actual <b>root,</b> soil, and <b>tree</b> conditions. This improves discussions with an affected tree owner, or other interested party, regarding future management options of the tree...|$|R

2500|$|Unaided plant roots may {{be unable}} to take up {{nutrients}} that are chemically or physically immobilised; examples include phosphate ions and micronutrients such as iron. One form of such immobilization occurs in soil with high clay content, or soils with a strongly basic pH. The mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus can, however, access many such nutrient sources, and make them available to the plants they colonize. Thus many plants are able to obtain phosphate, without using soil as a source. Another form of immobilisation is when nutrients are locked up in organic matter that is slow to decay, such as wood, and some mycorrhizal fungi act directly as decay organisms, mobilising the nutrients and passing some onto the host plants; for example, in some dystrophic forests, large amounts of phosphate and other nutrients are taken up by mycorrhizal hyphae acting directly on leaf litter, bypassing the need for soil uptake. [...] Inga alley cropping, proposed as an alternative to slash and burn rainforest destruction, relies upon mycorrhiza within the Inga <b>Tree</b> <b>root</b> system to prevent the rain from washing phosphorus out of the soil.|$|E

50|$|The {{very fine}} study <b>Tree</b> <b>Roots</b> in a Sandy Ground ('Les racines') was renamed Les Racines by the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, {{identifying}} {{it with a}} drawing mentioned {{in a letter to}} Theo of 1 May 1882. In that letter, van Gogh said he wanted to express something of life's struggle, as also in a larger version (now lost) of Sorrow, his iconic nude study of Sien completed at the same time. Sorrow is cited by Jan Hulsker {{as an example of the}} technical proficiency van Gogh had attained in the six months since his first clumsy attempts at figure drawing in Etten the year before, and the same degree of mastery is evident in <b>Tree</b> <b>Roots.</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>roots</b> were also the subject of one of the last paintings (if not actually the last) van Gogh made before his death, presumed a suicide, in 1890. This was <b>Tree</b> <b>Roots,</b> although there is no evidence that he was similarly preoccupied with the theme of life's struggle at the time of its painting. The 1882 drawing <b>Tree</b> <b>Roots</b> was purchased by the Dordrecht art collector J. Hidde Nijland before 1895. Nijland's entire collection of 116 van Gogh drawings that he built up was purchased in 1928 by the Dutch shipping magnate Anton Kröller, husband of Helene Kröller-Müller, for 100,000 guilders, and became the nucleus of the collection at the Kröller-Müller Museum.|$|R
