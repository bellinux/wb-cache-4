The gasoline 2.0 GSI benefited from the CVVT engine previously seen in the Coupe, increasing power from 133 to 139 bhp (99 to 104 kW), while CO2 emissions fell from 223 g/km to 208 g/km. Fuel consumption was also improved — the combined figure (average consumption on town and highway driving) rose from 30.4 mpg to 32.5 mpg, imperial gallons (9.3 to 8.7 L/100 km). All Trajets from this point forward featured a third <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> in the rear, which meant all passengers had the protection of a full seat belt.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the first}} modern <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> (the {{so-called}} CIR-Griswold restraint) used in most consumer vehicles today was patented in 1955 [...] by the Americans Roger W. Griswold and Hugh DeHaven. Fatal car accidents were rapidly increasing in Sweden during the 1950s. When a study at Vattenfall of accidents among employees revealed {{that the majority of}} casualties came from car accidents, two Vattenfall engineers (Bengt Odelgard and Per-Olof Weman) started to develop the safety belt. Their work set the standard for safety belts in Swedish cars and was presented to Swedish manufacturer Volvo in the late 1950s. The 3-point seatbelt was developed to its modern form by Swedish inventor Nils Bohlin for Volvo - who introduced it in 1959 as standard equipment. In addition to designing an effective three-point belt, Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness in a study of 28,000 accidents in Sweden. Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants were fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph. No belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact. Bohlin was granted [...] for the device.|$|E

After studying number of design plans and research papers, we have concluded to design and develop seat belt safety mechanism using spring and rope mechanism. In case of accidents, passenger lives can be saved greatly by use of seat belts and airbags in the automobiles. The safety implications of these systems and the stringent safety regulations in the world have brought a growing market to these products. The purpose of developing the project is to design alternate method of seat belt safety mechanism without changing the available space in the car and also to provide safety to occupants in those cars in which air bags and other safety system could not be implemented due to increase in cost. The actuating system design includes <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt,</b> spring, wire rope,solenoid and locking mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to model {{occupant}} kinematics in an autonomous braking event by using a Finite Element (FE) Human Body Model (HBM) with active muscles, as a step towards HBMs that can be used for injury prediction in integrated pre-crash and crash simulations. Methods: Trunk and neck musculature was added to an existing FE HBM. Active muscle responses were achieved using a simplified implementation of three feedback controllers for: the head angle, the neck angle, and the angle of the lumbar spine. The HBM was compared with volunteer responses in sled tests with 10 ms− 2 deceleration over 0. 2 s and in 1. 4 s autonomous braking interventions with a peak deceleration of 6. 7 ms− 2. Results: The HBM captures the characteristics of the kinematics of volunteers in sled tests. Peak forward displacements have the same timing as for the volunteers, and lumbar muscle activation timing matches data from one of the volunteers. The responses of volunteers in autonomous braking interventions are mainly small head rotations and translational motions. This is captured by the HBM controller objective, which is to maintain the initial angular positions. The HBM response with active muscles is within +/- 1 standard deviation of the average volunteer response with respect to head displacements and angular rotation. Conclusions: With the implementation of feedback control of active musculature in an FE HBM, it is possible to model the occupant response to autonomous braking interventions. The lumbar controller is important for the simulations of lap-belt restrained occupants; it is less important for the kinematics of occupants with a modern <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> Increasing head and neck controller gains gives a better correlation for head rotation, while it reduces the vertical head displacement and introduces oscillations...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{fact that}} the safety of {{transportation}} by motor vehicles has increased in the past decades. The number of fatalities related to car crashes even decreased during a period of time were the average travelled distance has doubled. However, the number of fatalities can still be reduced further. Besides that, it is expected that number of vehicles on the road will rise due to growing economies in the developing countries. Therefore, it is important that more sophisticated car safety systems are developed. The most well-known safety system which is present in all modern cars, is the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> This system ensures that an occupant is restraint in his seat during a collision, which reduces the changes on injury. However, this system can be further improved as stated by E. P. van der Laan in his PhD study. This study resulted in a continuous restraint control (CRC) system consisting of a semi-active hydraulic actuator installed on experimental setup and theoretical control strategy. The aim of this bachelor's thesis is to analyze the behavior of the installed current amplier and improve its tracking performance of the reference signal provided by the control algorithm. Futhermore, the crash sleds motion prediction and the setpoint computation of the torso deceleration have to be developed for the experimental setup. In this report the following subjects are discussed. The rst chapter describes the experimental setup and its components. The analysis of the current tracking behavior and the improvement thereof are discussed in Chapter 3 and 4, respectively. In Chapter 5 the theoretical performance of the actuator is computed, which is used to determine which crash test can be performed. These crash tests are described in Chapter 6. During these experiments problems with the amplier occurred which are discussed in Chapter 7. This is followed by Chapter 8 which covers the application of the prediction algorithm developed by Van der Laan to the experimental setup. Finally, the conclusion and recommendations can be found in Chapter 9 and 10, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Fatalities {{caused by}} car {{accidents}} accounted for 1. 2 million worldwide in 2004. Chest injuries are the second death cause, after head injuries, in vehicle accidents. Devices to predict {{risk of injury}} are fundamental to develop and evaluate restraint systems that can mitigate the injury severity and reduce the fatalities. This can be achieved with mathematical Human Body Models (HBM). An HBM needs to be biofidelic, {{both in terms of}} size and biomechanical response. Herein, the biofidelity of the thorax region in an HBM is evaluated. The evaluation focuses on whole body kinematics and chest response during frontal car accidents. Finite element simulations with an HBM were performed with the code LS-DYNA [1]. A modified version of Total HUman Model for Safety v 3. 0 (THUMS) [2] has been the basis for the work presented here. THUMS was modified to improve its robustness and numerical stability. The meshes of the rib cage, skin around the ribcage, and intercostal muscles were refined. THUMS represents a 50 th percentile male and has approximately 150, 000 elements. It was compared with cadaver pendulum impacts [3], table top tests [4], and sled tests [5]. The pendulum test consist of a cylinder with diameter 125 mm, mass of 23. 4 kg and an initial speed of 4. 3 m/s impacting on the middle of the sternum. The table top tests included four loading conditions of the chest: hub, diagonal belt, double diagonal belt, and distributed load. The sled test was performed at 40 km/h, using a <b>three</b> <b>point</b> standard <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> The model has been compared to cadaver experiments on different load cases, which are representative of modern automotive restraint systems. In general, THUMS showed a good agreement with the experimental corridors for the pendulum and table top tests. The chest response in the sled test differed for the lower chest, possibly due to the absence of biofidelic fracture simulations in the THUMS. After comparing the kinematic and dynamic responses of THUMS with cadaver experiments it was concluded that the model is adequate to simulate the human response under frontal impacts. The next step is to identify parameters that can predict the risk of rib fracture and then become a tool to evaluate new restraint systems...|$|R

50|$|Dating back {{as early}} as 1885, <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> were first {{patented}} by Edward J. Claghorn. In 1955, Ford began offering the lap belt in their automobiles. Saab then began to manufacture their entire range of automobiles with seat belts; most importantly the Saab GT750, launched in 1958. From this model, the practice of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> installation then became a competitive advantage to the industry but still did not seem essential to the consumers. Forward, this popular technique became standard in most U.S. automobiles. By 1965, front lap <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> were produced in several models, by 1968 front shoulder and rear lap belts were introduced, and in 1974 <b>three</b> <b>point</b> front lap belts were adopted in most automobiles. The first United States Federal law pertaining {{to the use of}} <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> became effective January 1, 1968 {{with the help of the}} U.S. Department of Transportation which was created two years prior.

The use and legality of <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> varies from state to state, with the first state to pass the law requiring all passengers to wear a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> being New York on December 1, 1984.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws and public {{education}} campaigns on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use are assessed {{on the basis of}} observational or self-reported data on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. Previous studies focusing on front seat occupants have shown that self-reports indicate a greater <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage than observational findings. Whether this over-reporting in self reports applies to rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage, and to what extent, have yet to be investigated. We aimed to evaluate the over-reporting factor for rear seat passengers and whether this varies by gender and under different compulsory <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use conditions. Methods The study was conducted in the Veneto Region, an area in the North-East of Italy with a population of 4. 7 million. The prevalence of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use among rear seat passengers was determined by means of a cross-sectional self-report survey and an observational study. Both investigations were performed in two time periods: in 2003, when rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use was not enforced by primary legislation, and in 2005, after rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use had become compulsory (June 2003). Overall, 8138 observations and 7902 interviews were recorded. Gender differences in the prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were examined using the chi-square test. The over-reporting factor, defined as the ratio of the self-reported to the observed prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use, was calculated by gender before and after the rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> legislation came into effect. Results Among rear seat passengers, self-reported rates were always higher than the observational findings, with an overall over-reporting factor of 1. 4. We registered no statistically significant changes over time in the over-reporting factor, nor any major differences between genders. Conclusion Self-reported <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage by rear passengers represents an efficient alternative to observational studies for tracking changes in actual behavior, although the reported figures need to be adjusted using an appropriate over-reporting factor in order to gain an idea of genuine <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. </p...|$|R

The predictors of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were male driver, no formal or lower level of education, driving for less than 10 years, and the perception that the other drivers use <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> with the same or higher frequency compared to the respondents. Conclusion Only a small proportion of the drivers in Trinidad and Tobago always use a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> when driving. There is the need to enforce the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> legislation in the country. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} Selective Traffic Enforcement Programs (STEPs) on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use and motor vehicle {{accident}} casualties is evaluated. The following research questions are addressed: (a) Will <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use 2 years after a STEP be above the pre-STEP level? (b) Will repeated STEPs {{be as effective as}} an initial STEP in increasing <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use? (c) Does the increase in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use induced by a STEP result in a reduction of accident casualties? A series of six <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use surveys (N = 32, 660) was conducted at the roadside in the Ottawa area where three STEPs were implemented during a 12 -month period, and in a control community. Archival data were used to examine the impact of the STEPs on accident casualties. It was found that <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use 2 years after an initial STEP was still significantly (p <. 001) above baseline usage, that three subsequent STEPs signif-icantly (p <. 001) increased <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use from 66 % to 84 %, and that driver casualties declined by 14 % subsequent to the STEPs. Periodic STEPs are effective in affecting long-term increases in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use and consequently reducing traffic accident casualties. In Canada, compulsory <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use leg-islation has increased <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> wearing in legislated provinces and hence has resulted in some reduction of occupant casualties (Jonah & Lawson, 1984). However, even in legislated jurisdictions, <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use is only in the 60 % range (Arora, 1984). A number of evaluations of Selective Traffic Enforcement Programs have demonstrated that these pro-grams are effective in achieving high levels of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> wearing in legislated jurisdiction...|$|R
