5|$|This {{classification}} {{was widely}} accepted but {{has also been}} criticized mainly because {{the underlying causes of}} epilepsy (which are a major determinant of clinical course and prognosis) were not covered in detail. In 2010 the ILAE Commission for Classification of the Epilepsies addressed <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>and</b> divided epilepsies into three categories (genetic, structural/metabolic, unknown cause) that were refined in their 2011 recommendation into four categories and a number of subcategories reflecting recent technologic and scientific advances.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the hand-picked candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> <b>and</b> Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant siding with the tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E

5|$|There {{are certain}} distributions, {{especially}} those with three or more parameters, whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space. Using maximum likelihood to estimate these parameters often breaks down, with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite, rendering the other parameters inconsistent. The method of maximum spacings, however, being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual likelihood points, does not have <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> <b>and</b> will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> <b>and</b> in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E
