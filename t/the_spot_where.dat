5|$|A Christmas truce {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} in Frelinghien, France, on 11 November 2008. Also on that day, at <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where,</b> on Christmas Day 1914, their regimental ancestors {{came out from}} their trenches to play football, men from the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welch Fusiliers played a football match with the German Battalion 371. The Germans won 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Another {{monument}} marks <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> {{the fire}} stopped: the Golden Boy of Pye Corner in Smithfield. According to the inscription, it {{was evidence of}} God's wrath on the City of London for the sin of gluttony that the fire started at Pudding Lane and stopped at Pye Corner.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 5,000 {{people came}} to Simpson's funeral service. A {{memorial}} stands close to <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> he died {{and has become a}} pilgrimage for many cyclists.

5|$|In 2004, Johannesburg granted Mandela the Freedom of the City, and in 2008 a Mandela statue was {{unveiled}} at <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Mandela {{was released from}} prison. On the Day of Reconciliation 2013, a bronze statue of Mandela {{was unveiled}} at Pretoria's Union Buildings.|$|E
5|$|In Arlington County, The Pentagon Memorial was {{completed}} and {{opened to the}} public on the seventh anniversary of the attacks in 2008. It consists of a landscaped park with 184 benches facing the Pentagon. When the Pentagon was repaired in 2001–2002, a private chapel and indoor memorial were included, located at <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Flight 77 crashed into the building.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November 2011 Ukrainian {{fisherman}} Sergei Pjankow fished up a one metre long frankish sword {{from the}} waters of the Dnieper not far from <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Sviatoslav {{is believed to have been}} killed in 972. The handle is made out of four different metals including gold and silver, and it is very possible that it belonged to Sviatoslav himself.|$|E

5|$|The site of {{the cabins}} became a tourist {{attraction}} as early as 1854. In the 1880s, Charles McGlashan began promoting {{the idea of a}} monument to mark the {{site of the}} Donner Party episode. He helped to acquire the land for a monument and, in June 1918, the statue of a pioneer family was placed on <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the Breen-Keseberg cabin was thought to have been, dedicated to the Donner Party. It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.|$|E
5|$|There {{continued}} to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures {{are hard to come}} by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery {{at the site of the}} battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Harold died.|$|E
5|$|Wainwright {{charged to}} the attack, but the {{submarine}} submerged almost immediately. Upon reaching <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the submarine had been, the warship located an oil slick and began dropping depth charges which {{failed to achieve}} positive results. Approaching darkness {{and the necessity of}} escorting an Admiralty oiler forced Wainwright to break off her attack. After she shepherded the oiler to safety, she returned to the area of her attack and patrolled throughout the night, but the submarine had apparently retired from the neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|The {{erection}} {{of public}} monuments to Holocaust victims {{has been a}} tangible commemoration of Germany's Vergangenheitsbewältigung. Concentration camps, such as Dachau, Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen and Flossenbürg, are open to visitors as memorials and museums. Most towns have plaques on walls marking <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> particular atrocities took place.|$|R

Aerial photography has displayed cropmarks of the works. It has been noted that corn plants grow differently in <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> earthworks once stood.|$|R
5|$|Warwick {{had been}} such an {{influential}} figure in 15th-century English politics that, on his death, no one matched him in terms of power and popularity. Deprived of Warwick's support, the Lancastrians suffered their final defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May, which marked {{the downfall of the}} House of Lancaster and the ascendancy of the House of York. Three centuries after the Battle of Barnet, a stone obelisk was raised on <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Warwick purportedly died.|$|E
5|$|Calling himself Anders, and feigning {{an injured}} leg, Kator is {{taken in by}} Jessica and Jo. His arrival {{immediately}} causes friction between the two. Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned to <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in a spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo.|$|E
5|$|During the Greater Wrath in the 18th century, Kajaani Castle {{was forced}} to {{surrender}} to Russian forces. The Russians blew the castle up in March 1716, {{and it has been}} in ruins ever since. On 17 October 1808, General Johan August Sandels won a key victory to the south of Kajaani near Iisalmi during the Battle of Koljonvirta of the Finnish War, when his army of just 1,800 defeated over 6,000 Russians. There is a monument {{on the east side of}} the river marking where <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Lieutenant Jakob Henrik Zidén and Major-General Mikhail Petrovich Dolgorukov fell.|$|E
5000|$|The Odd Poplers Alley, in Iași, Romania, {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> Mihai Eminescu sought {{inspiration}} in his works (the poem [...] "Down Where the Lonely Poplars Grow"). In 1973, the 15 white poplars still left (with age ranges between 233 and 371 years) were declared natural monuments.|$|R

5|$|In 1936, Schreck {{developed}} meningitis {{and died}} on 16 May in Munich. He was a well-liked man and Hitler was distraught when Schreck died. His final rank was SS-Oberführer, a rank between colonel and general. Schreck was accorded a Nazi state funeral with Hitler delivering his eulogy. Schreck's funeral {{was attended by}} many senior Nazi officials, including Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, Rudolf Hess, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Konstantin von Neurath, Emil Maurice, Hans Baur, Heinrich Hoffmann and Baldur von Schirach. As with many other buried Nazi Party members, Schreck's grave marker was removed after World War II {{and there is a}} stone without inscription on <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> he was buried.|$|E
5|$|Most {{accounts}} {{say that}} Kanhopatra's body was laid at feet of Vithoba and then buried near {{the southern part}} of the temple, in accordance with her last wishes. In some accounts, the nearby Bhima river (Chandrabhaga) flooded, inundating the temple and killing the army that sought Kanhopatra. The next day, her body was found near a rock. According to all versions of the legend, a tarati tree—which is worshipped by pilgrims in her remembrance—arose on <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Kanhopatra was buried. Kanhopatra is the only person whose samadhi (mausoleum) is in the precincts of the Vithoba temple.|$|E
5|$|The Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, {{which is}} {{situated}} by the Asi River, {{is one of}} the sacred temples of the Hindu god Hanuman. The present temple was built in the early 1900s by the educationist and Indian independence figure, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, the founder of Banaras Hindu University. According to Hindu legend the temple was built on <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the medieval Hindu saint Tulsidas had a vision of Hanuman. During a 7 March 2006 terrorist attack, one of three explosions hit the temple while a wedding was in progress, and resulted in injuries to 30 people apart from 23 deaths. Following the attack, a permanent police post was installed inside the temple.|$|E

5|$|The {{movement}} was discovered at about 00:30 on June 3, and Zur's force lost {{the element of}} surprise. The Egyptian position that engaged the Israelis had two companies, but Harpaz, the 51st's 3rd Company's commander, underestimated the force and reported that it contained only one platoon. Zur decided to regroup in the wadi and ordered Aryeh Kotzer's 1st Company to stay and engage the Egyptians at <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> they were originally discovered and assault the pillbox there, {{while the rest of}} the forces would try a turning movement.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} images of Hindu deities around the sabha-mandapa {{including}} those of the regional deities Vithoba and Khandoba, personifications of Shukla chaturthi and Krishna chaturthi (the 4th lunar day in bright fortnight and dark fortnight of a lunar month, both of which are sacred for Ganesha worship) and the Ganapatya saint Morya Gosavi. On the circumambulation path (Pradakshina path), there is a Tarati tree (a thorny shrub) near the Kalpavrushka Mandir. The tree is believed to be <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Morya Gosavi underwent penance. There are two sacred trees in the courtyard: shami and bilva.|$|E
5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which broached on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E
