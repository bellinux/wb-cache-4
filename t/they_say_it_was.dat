2500|$|The {{papers have}} given the {{impression}} that the Sam Paul Association has been the headquarters for a lot of plotters and lawbreakers. [...] As a matter of fact, {{there are a lot of}} respectable business men, lawyers, doctors, and others in our membership. [...] I myself am a tailor. [...] That man on your right is a government official. [...] Of course, some of the members are in sporting lines, but the proportion is about half and half... For some reason or other, Sam Paul and the Sam Paul association have to take the knocks for everything that goes wrong. [...] Every time a gaming joint is raided, the papers say it is supposed to have been one of Sam Paul's, and lately every time a crime has been committed <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> planned here at the clubrooms, and every man the police arrest is said to be a member of the Sam Paul Association.
