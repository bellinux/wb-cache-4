5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) {{is angry}} that {{the club is}} now {{stronger}} <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> punishes Quinn and Santana. Quinn retaliates by thanking Sue for helping her realize that believing in herself negates the need to bring other people down. Will realizes that his passion is teaching, not performing, and resolves to recommit to the glee club.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a series}} of {{commercial}} failures, Grant was now more popular <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>and</b> in high demand. According to Vermilye, in 1939, Grant played roles that were more dramatic, albeit with comical undertones. He played a British army sergeant opposite Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in the George Stevens-directed adventure film Gunga Din, set at a military station in India. Roles as a pilot opposite Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth in Hawks's Only Angels Have Wings, and a wealthy landowner alongside Carole Lombard in In Name Only followed.|$|E
5|$|Henry now {{appeared}} to his contemporaries {{to be stronger}} <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> he was courted as an ally by many European leaders and asked to arbitrate over international disputes in Spain and Germany. He was nonetheless busy resolving some of the weaknesses that he believed had exacerbated the revolt. Henry set about extending royal justice in England to reassert his authority and spent time in Normandy shoring up support amongst the barons. The King also made use of the growing Becket cult to increase his own prestige, using {{the power of the}} saint to explain his victory in 1174, especially his success in capturing William.|$|E
50|$|The {{leverage}} cycle {{crisis of}} 2007-2009 was particularly significant {{for a number}} of reasons. The first and most obvious being that leverage got higher <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before, <b>and</b> then margins got tighter <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before.|$|R
50|$|After Cyttorak's re-empowering of Cain Marko, his {{strength}} and durability were raised to higher levels <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before, <b>and</b> his vulnerability to mental attacks was negated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Refused him!" [...] Miss Crawley said, more bewildered <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> Briggs <b>and</b> Firkin at {{the door}} opened the eyes of astonishment and the lips of wonder.|$|R
5|$|Hergé's book {{sales were}} higher <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> {{translations}} were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets. He was receiving international press attention, with articles {{on his work}} appearing in France-Observateur, The Listener, and Times Literary Supplement. Paul Vandromme authored an un-critical book on Hergé, Le Monde de Tintin ("The World of Tintin"), published by Gallimard; Hergé vetoed {{the inclusion of a}} proposed preface by Roger Nimier after finding its praise for his own work too embarrassing. Radio adaptations of The Adventures of Tintin were produced, as was an animated cartoon series produced by Belvision, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin. Two live-action films were also produced, Tintin and the Golden Fleece (1961) and Tintin and the Blue Oranges (1964), the former of which Hergé had been closely involved with.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{the royal}} touch {{promoted}} {{the power of the}} monarchy, but the ceremony was seldom performed in the 16th century. During the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598), the worsening conditions helped scrofula spread more <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>and</b> the interest in the disease steadily increased. The Catholic League started a propaganda claiming that Henry III (r. 1574–1589) was unable to heal by touch due to his immorality. After the assassination of Henry III and accession of the Protestant Henry IV (r. 1589–1610), the League warned that God would revoke his gift if the French accepted a Protestant as their sovereign and that the scrofulous would never be cured again.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, McKinley and Hay {{engaged in}} {{negotiations}} with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America. The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, which the two nations signed in 1850, prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there. The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two-ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn. Now, with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia, a canal seemed more essential <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty. Hay and the British ambassador, Julian Pauncefote, agreed that the United States could control a future canal, provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified. McKinley was satisfied with the terms, but the Senate rejected them, demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal. Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation, but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate's demands. He was successful, and a new treaty was drafted and approved, but not before McKinley's assassination in 1901.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How are we ever to get {{him back}} again, Brownie?' Elsie put in. She was paler <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> now, <b>and</b> {{prostrate}} with the after-effects of her unwonted effort.|$|R
50|$|Philanthropists have {{increased}} sizable {{gifts to the}} university in its present period more so <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before, <b>and</b> coaches at Transylvania University have been continually recognized for athletic achievements.|$|R
50|$|K2 is {{the second-highest}} {{mountain}} on Earth, after Mount Everest, with a peak elevation of 8611 m. K2 {{is part of}} the Karakoram range, not far from the Himalayas, and is located on the border between the Pakistani Gilgit-Baltistan region, and China's Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang Autonomous Region. It is regarded by mountaineers as far more challenging <b>than</b> <b>Everest,</b> <b>and</b> is statistically the second most dangerous mountain in {{the world in terms of}} fatality per summit.|$|R
25|$|The UFT {{emerged from}} the crisis more {{powerful}} <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> Feldman's hard work, good political judgment and calm demeanor won her widespread praise within the union.|$|E
25|$|AUPE {{organized}} {{aggressively to}} make up for membership losses in the government, but bargaining became harder <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>and</b> gains were marginal. As cutbacks continued through 1988, membership dipped further and revenues sagged.|$|E
25|$|By March 2007, The New York Times and the Daily News {{reported}} that Giuliani had become estranged from both his son Andrew {{and his daughter}} Caroline. In 2014, he said {{his relationship with his}} children was better <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> was spotted eating and playing golf with Andrew.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{know it is}} not an embellishing dress, and she {{did look}} gaunt and haggard; but still somehow we liked her better <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before; <b>and</b> she is so very good and charitable.' ...|$|R
50|$|Opportunities in life, if not equal, were {{distributed}} much more fairly <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before <b>and</b> the weekly wage-earner, in particular, had gained {{standards of living}} {{that would have been}} almost unbelievable in the thirties.|$|R
60|$|But when Theseus {{heard the}} story, he {{straightened}} himself up, {{so that he}} seemed taller <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before; <b>and</b> as for his face it was indignant, despiteful, bold, tender, and compassionate, all in one look.|$|R
25|$|During World War II, {{movie theaters}} were busier <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>and</b> the Ohio was no exception, adding late night showings for war plant shift workers. War bonds were heavily {{promoted}} {{and sold in}} the theater's lobby. In 1944, when Roger Garrett {{was inducted into the}} army, live organ music was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{he showed}} some decline as a bowler in 1914, Thompson batted better <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was a}} great pity for Northamptonshire that serious {{injuries}} prevented him playing at all until 1921, when he had lost his bowling completely but retained some of his batting skill. After a few games in 1922, Thompson's career ended tamely.|$|E
25|$|One {{practical}} application {{of its work}} is ensuring and advancing the safety of ejection systems for pilots. With {{the increasing number of}} females in the Air Force ranks, anthropometry is of greater import now <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> 711th's WB4 'whole-body scanner' enables swift and accurate acquisition of anthropometric data which may be used to design pilot equipment with a better fit for comfort and safety.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{dismounted}} reluctantly. What {{would he}} say about the riding-habit that she wore? She felt very curious to learn, <b>and</b> shyer <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before, <b>and</b> altogether different. The skirt made her more of a girl, it seemed.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the young}} team losing more home games <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before, <b>and</b> {{reducing}} the Gabba's {{status as a}} fortress that intimidated opposition teams, the Lions still produced average crowds the equal of the NRL Premiership team Brisbane Broncos.|$|R
25|$|While {{the trust}} was to {{discontinue}} making the Stearns bicycle, instead, {{it was said}} that the trust had more agents selling the wheel <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before <b>and</b> at the same time had twice as many working men engaged in the manufacture.|$|R
25|$|The sheriff, by company orders, arrests {{the leading}} {{women of the}} strike. Esperanza is among those taken to jail. When she returns home, Ramon tells her the strike is hopeless, as the company will easily outlast the miners. She insists that the union is {{stronger}} <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>and</b> asks Ramon why he can't accept her as an equal in their marriage. Both angry, they sleep separately that night.|$|E
25|$|Gray {{was little}} {{affected}} by {{the stock market crash}} of 1929. The strip was more popular <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>and</b> brought him a good income, which was only enhanced when the strip became the basis for a radio program in 1930 and two films in 1932 and 1938. Predictably, Gray was reviled by some for preaching in the strip to the poor about hard work, initiative, and motivation while living well on his income.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{with new}} imports, such as Canadian goaltender Dylan Smart, the Knights {{were able to}} enter the 5th AIHL season {{stronger}} <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> nearly made the play-offs. With two new teams joining the league, the Brisbane Blue Tongues and Central Coast Rhinos, the Knights {{were one of the}} stronger and more stable teams of the league, winning 11 of 24 games and finishing in fifth place with 35 points. Coached by former player Laing Harrow, 2005 has been the strongest Canberra Knights AIHL season ever.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Parsons {{sank into}} his chair, {{suddenly}} collapsing. He seemed smaller <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> wizened <b>and</b> frail; the wisp {{of white hair}} that concealed his baldness fell forward grotesquely. His face assumed again that expression, which was almost habitual, of anxious fear.|$|R
60|$|But Sam {{was on his}} mettle and now bounded ahead faster <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> leaving Flapp <b>and</b> Pigley several {{yards in}} the rear.|$|R
50|$|Besides the Tories, the NDP also {{benefited from}} the slip in Liberal support. Under Broadbent, the party had seen greater support in opinion polling <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before, <b>and</b> had {{actually}} replaced the Liberals as the second party {{in much of the}} west.|$|R
25|$|Rachel's beloved mother, Ada Hobson, died in Summer 1993 (veteran actress Constance Ford {{had died}} earlier that year). Rachel needed support more <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> {{she found it}} in the unlikeliest source, Mac's former enemy, {{reformed}} villain Carl Hutchins. The two fell in love and became engaged. Iris did not like this news one bit, and at Rachel and Carl's wedding, she planned to startle Carl by firing blanks at him. Evan (now played by Eric Scott Woods) placed real bullets into Iris's gun, causing Iris to gravely wound Carl. She was convicted of the crime and sent to prison.|$|E
25|$|Between 1978 and 1980, Bolivia was {{constantly}} {{in a state}} of crisis. The fragmentation of political forces made it impossible for any party to dominate. In the three elections held during this period, no party achieved a majority, and alliances of various groups could not break the deadlock. Social unrest increased as peasants began to agitate again on a large scale {{for the first time since}} their rebellion in the late colonial period. The Bolivian workers were more radical <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>and</b> in 1979, during the first congress of the Bolivian Labor Federation (Central Obrera Boliviana, COB) since 1970, they vehemently protested the economic austerity measures dictated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E
25|$|Slade {{returned}} to the UK in August 1976 to face the UK music business much changed from when they had left. Punk rock had now exploded and had become the dominant influence on youth culture and the music press. Despite Slade's {{reputation as one of}} the great high energy bands of their day, in this environment Slade had become irrelevant. Regardless, Slade were determined that they were now a better live act <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>and</b> refused to call it a day. The band began recording their seventh studio album in August. According to the Slade Fan Club, the band hoped to record a total of 16 tracks and pick the best to release on the album.|$|E
50|$|Environmental {{science is}} a global issue, {{receiving}} more attention now <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before <b>and</b> is going to increase in importance in the future. This course gives the opportunity to focus on Climate Change, Waste Management, Landscape Ecology and Environmental Science as well.|$|R
50|$|Outreach teams {{working in}} central London {{provided}} a greater presence <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before <b>and</b> developed {{a process for}} ‘gate-keeping’ access to the rough sleepers units to avoid them being filled by people who had not slept rough who invariably have lower needs.|$|R
50|$|The {{event was}} the second largest ever Jamboree held with 38,074 {{participants}} and IST attending, but with more countries <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before., <b>and</b> more <b>than</b> 42,000 day visitors. The 3rd 'Coming of Age' Jamboree in 1929 was the largest held, with 50,000 participants.|$|R
