2500|$|It {{has been}} theorized that free {{radicals}} {{contribute to the}} onset of type-1 diabetes in infants and young children, and therefore that the risk could be reduced by high intake of antioxidant substances during pregnancy.

2500|$|Similar {{performance}} effects {{resulting from}} chronically restricted {{can also be}} seen in the [...] study by Belenky et al. and in figure 3-3. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>involved</b> 66 subjects who were observed in four conditions (i.e., 3, 5, 7 and 9 hours in bed) for 7 days. PVT testing showed severe impairments in reaction time under the 3-hour condition, with lapses in responses increasing steadily across the 7 days of sleep restriction. Subjects who spent 3 hours in bed reached levels of severe impairment at 5 days, while subjects who spent 5 hours in bed reached levels of impairment at 4 days.|$|E
50|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in Lancet Oncology. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>involved</b> patients with oestrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that very low levels of a xenoestrogen, Bisphenol A, could affect fetal neural signalling more than higher levels, indicating that classical models where dose equals response may not be applicable in susceptible tissue. As <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>involved</b> intra-cerebellar injections, its relevance to environmental exposures is unclear, as is the role of an estrogenic effect compared to some other toxic effect of bisphenol A.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>involved</b> only male subjects, which may be significant as sex steroid hormones may have different effects in response to cortisol administration. Men and women also respond to emotional stimuli differently and this may affect cortisol levels. This was also the first Functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) study done utilising glucocorticoids, therefore more research is necessary to further substantiate these findings.|$|E
50|$|Another study, {{conducted}} by Appels et al, investigated {{the effect of}} type D behavior on sudden cardiac death. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>involved</b> interviewing the next-of-kin of the sudden cardiac death victims {{to determine whether they}} were type D or not. Patients scoring high on negative affectivity and social inhibition (the two dimensions of the type D personality subtype) were found to be seven times more likely to suffer sudden cardiac death.|$|E

50|$|Illusory superiority {{has been}} found in studies {{comparing}} memory self-reports, such as Schmidt, Berg & Deelman's research in older adults. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>involved</b> participants aged between 46 and 89 years of age comparing their own memory to that of peers of the same age group, 25-year-olds and their own memory at age 25.

50|$|In 2012, Yang et al. {{incorporated}} the promising results regarding nanoscale reduced graphene oxide reported by Robinson et al. into another in vivo mice study. The therapeutic treatment used in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>involved</b> {{the use of}} nanoscale reduced graphene oxide sheets, nearly identical to the ones used by Robinson et al. (but without any active targeting sequences attached). Nanoscale reduced graphene oxide sheets were successfully irradiated in order to completely destroy the targeted tumors. Most notably, the required power density of the 808 nm laser was reduced to 0.15 W/cm2, {{an order of magnitude}} lower than previously required power densities. This study demonstrates the higher efficacy of nanoscale reduced graphene oxide sheets as compared to both nanoscale graphene sheets and gold nanorods.|$|E
5000|$|The first formal {{studies using}} memory {{implantation}} {{were published in}} the early 1990s, the most famous being [...] "The Formation of False Memories" [...] (commonly referred to as the [...] "Lost in the Mall" [...] study) by Loftus and Pickrell. The basic technique used in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>involved</b> asking family members of a participant to provide narratives of events that happened when they were young and then add another event that definitely had not happened. The participants saw these four narratives and were told to try to remember as much as possible about each event. Across a number of studies using memory implantation, about 37% of people have come to remember parts of or entire events that never actually happened.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{influence}} of same-sex friendships in the development of one's identity. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>involved</b> the use of 24 same-sex college student friendship triads, consisting of 12 males and 12 females, with a total of 72 participants. Each triad was required to have known each other for a minimum of six months. A qualitative method was chosen, as it is the most appropriate in assessing development of identity. Semi-structured group interviewers took place, where the students were asked to reflect on stories and experiences with relationship problems. The results showed 5 common responses when assessing these relationship problems. The responses involved joking about the relationship problems, providing support, offering advice, relating others' experiences to their own similar experiences, and providing encouragement. The results concluded that adolescents are actively constructing their identities through common themes of conversation between same-sex friendships, in this case, involving relationship issues. The common themes of conversation that close peers seem to engage in, help to further their identity formation in life.|$|E

5000|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} studies involving misattribution, the Canadian cognitive psychologist Bruce Whittlesea presented subjects with a list of common words. Each word was briefly displayed to the subject. The task required the subject to judge whether a target word was semantically related to any word in the list. Unlike Whittlesea's first experiment involving the recognition of target words, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>involved</b> the manipulation of processing fluency through the conceptual context of the target word, rather than the physical context. After the subjects were given a brief moment to study the list of words, the subjects were presented with sentences that would contain a word that was capitalized {{at the end of the}} sentence that would have either been, or not been, from the previously presented list. The word at the end of the sentence was either highly predictable given the context of the sentence, for example: [...] "The stormy seas tossed the BOAT", or the end word was less predictable such as: [...] "She saved her money and bought a LAMP". The subjects were then required to state whether the capitalized end word had appeared, or not, on the previous list of words. If not, they were to respond by saying that the word was [...] "new" [...] versus it being [...] "old".|$|E
