5|$|The ZX81 {{could be}} bought by mail order {{in kit form}} or pre-assembled. In {{what was then a}} major innovation, it was the first cheap mass-market home {{computer}} that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public, rather than the preserve of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists. It inspired the creation of a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>businesses</b> producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on {{to play a major role}} in the British computer industry in later years. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} smaller textile {{concerns}} in the parish. Thomas Howarth owned a cottage in Stand Lane from where he sent yarn to be dyed and sized. He made his own warps which were weaved in the town. He would then travel to Preston and Kendal where drapers would purchase his products. His nephews founded A. & J. Hoyle's Mill in Irwell Street, which employed power weaving to produce their specialities in Ginghams and shirting. The mill closed in 1968. Messrs Stott & Pickstone's Top Shop on Stand Lane was the first company to employ powered looms and spinning around 1844. Many of their employees would eventually leave to start <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>businesses,</b> such as Spider Mill, built by Robert and William Fletcher, and John Pickstone. This mill closed around 1930.|$|E

Thus, the indigenous Phoenicians paid a much lesser annual tribute which was only 350 talent compared to Egypt's tribute of 700 talents. Furthermore, Syrians were allowed to rule their own cities in that they continued to adhere their native religions, establish <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>businesses,</b> and build colonies all over the Mediterranean coast.

Forced to exercise independence {{from an early age}} {{as a result of her}} teenage career in the minstrel circuits, Cox proved herself as an independent and astute businesswoman through her ability to organize and maintain her own troupe, Raisin’ Cain, which lasted for a decade. She broke barriers in this regard, as virtually no black women owned and managed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>businesses</b> in the 1920s and 1930s. She was one of the few female blues singers of the time to write her own songs.|$|E
25|$|Currently, Iran has between 15,000 and 20,000 transsexuals, {{according}} to official statistics, although unofficial estimates put the figure at up to 150,000. Iran carries out more gender change operations than {{any country in the}} world besides Thailand. Sex changes have been legal since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, spiritual leader of the 1979 Islamic revolution, passed a fatwa authorising them nearly 25 years ago. Whereas homosexuality is considered a sin, transsexuality is categorised as an illness subject to cure. While the government seeks to keep its approval quiet, state support has increased since Ahmadinejad took office in 2005. His government has begun providing grants of £2,250 for operations and further funding for hormone therapy. It is also proposing loans of up to £2,750 to allow those undergoing surgery to start <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>businesses.</b>|$|E

25|$|As Philadelphia {{grew more}} industrialized the new {{factories}} refused to hire African Americans, with {{only about one}} percent of Philadelphia's African American population finding employment with the factories. In 1899 W. E. B. Du Bois said that {{ninety percent of the}} African American population in the city was below the poverty line. White-collar office jobs also refused to hire African Americans and many worked as domestic workers. There were African Americans that did manage to own <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>businesses,</b> while other became professionals such as doctors and lawyers. In 1884 Christopher J. Perry founded The Philadelphia Tribune, a newspaper for African Americans. It wasn't until World War II that factories began hiring African Americans. The Philadelphia Police Department first hired African Americans in 1881 and in the 1950s the first African American promoted to Police Captain was James N. Reaves. Reaves went on to integrate patrol car crews. During the 1950s and 60s the factories and {{a large portion of the}} white population left the city. African Americans became the city's largest ethnic group, with most of North Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, Germantown and portions of South Philadelphia becoming black neighborhoods. Old black working-class neighborhoods became ghettos filled with vacant lots and houses due to loss of industrial jobs. Starting in the 1970s African Americans began to gain significant independent political influence in city government, with the city's first African American mayor, Wilson Goode, being elected in 1984. Starting at the end of the 20th century a new wave of immigrants directly from Africa settled in the city. Coming from over thirty different countries there are an estimated 55,000 African immigrants in Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{economic}} {{dominance in}} Vietnam {{dates back to}} 208 B.C., when the renegade Qin Chinese general Zhao Tuo defeated An Dương Vương, the king of Âu Lạc in north Vietnam and conquered the Âu Lạc Kingdom, an ancient Vietnamese state situated in the northern mountains of modern Vietnam populated by the ancient Lạc Việt and Âu Việt. He annexed Âu Lạc into the Qin Empire the following year and declared himself the emperor of Nam Viet. A century later, the powerful Han dynasty annexed Nanyue into the Han Empire and was ruled as a province {{for the next several}} hundred years. Sinification of Nanyue was brought about by a combination of Han imperial military power, regular settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees, officers and garrisons, merchants, scholars, bureaucrats, fugitives, and prisoners of war. By the end of the 17th century, a distinct Chinese community, known as the Hoa, formed within Vietnamese society. Modern Chinese settlement and immigration in Vietnam came about from conducive opportunities for trade and business. Ethnic Chinese businessmen began to visit Hội An from the 16th century onward and initially traded black incense, silk, alum and Chinese medicinal products with the local Vietnamese. Dutch, Portuguese and French merchants who visited Hội An in the 17th century brought high quality brass utensils that attracted the attention of the Chinese. In turn, other goods such as porcelain, silver bars and various metals were traded. Around this time, the local Chinese community began to establish their own trading and social associations, the latter of which is referred to as bang in Vietnamese to protect their own economic interests. The bang also provided various welfare services for new Chinese immigrants, including financial services such as the collection of taxes. As more immigrants poured in the 19th century, the bang served as meeting points for Chinese community leaders to band together to pool seed capital and establish <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>businesses.</b> In 1906, Chinese and French businesspeople together had a total capital output of 222 million francs, compared to 2 million francs for the local Kinh Vietnamese.|$|E

He favored capitalism, entrepreneurship, and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>businesses</b> than from collecting royalties.
