However, the Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested negotiated a peace treaty without any direct involvement by foreign powers. The conflict was resolved with the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660). Sweden returned Bornholm and Trøndelag to Denmark. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present day, and secured the Swedish dominium maris baltici.|$|E
5|$|After Guy and Joanna have sex, Martin arrives to {{tell them}} that Joanna is Guy's mother. She met Guy's father whilst she was an {{exchange}} student in Switzerland. Guy then stabs a syringe full of Botox into Martin's legs as an act of revenge. Martin is taken into an ambulance, and Caroline helps Joanna, but Guy punches Mac in a drunken rage and steals the ambulance. Mac tries to stop him and gets on the ambulance, which drives away. Guy drives the ambulance to Wales, with Mac and the paralysed Martin with him. Whilst Mac tries to phone the police, Guy drives into a field and almost goes over a cliff.

The Miracle, the club's previous moniker, originated that year in Orlando, Florida, as the sister team to the NBA's Orlando Magic.

The stretch run included nine straight wins, matching a franchise record from the 2005–06 season, and capped off a streak of 12 straight home wins, which set a new franchise mark. The team finished sixth in the Eastern Conference with 97 points, the second-most points in franchise history.|$|E

25|$|Vancouver was {{the site}} of major {{celebrations}} in 1936, in part to bolster civic spirit {{in the midst of the}} depression, as well as to celebrate Vancouver’s Jubilee. Mayor McGeer provoked considerable controversy by organizing expensive celebrations at a time when the city was <b>teetering</b> <b>on</b> the brink of bankruptcy and civic employees were working at a significantly reduced pay rate. Nevertheless, he did find a great deal of support from those that agreed a celebration would ultimately be good for the city’s prosperity. While some large expenditures were roundly criticized – for example, the “ugly” fountain erected in Stanley Park’s Lost Lagoon – others drew significant financial and public support, such as the construction of a new (and the current) city hall on Cambie Street. The next major civic celebration was the 1939 Royal visit of the King and Queen as part of their tour of Canada which marked the end of the depression and the likelihood of another world war.|$|E

Avril reached the frontier {{to find his}} force faced by a body of artillery-armed Spanish militia behind the Guadiana River. Hearing that Dupont never got beyond Córdoba and that Badajoz was held large numbers of Spanish troops, the French general backtracked to Estremoz in Alentejo Province. On 12 June, General of Division Louis Henri Loison marched east from Almeida in Beira Province with a brigade. He cleared the Spanish garrison from Fort Concepcion and reached the environs of Ciudad Rodrigo. At this time he received intelligence that the city held a considerable garrison, Spain was in revolt, and Bessières was far away. Returning to Almeida on the 15th, he heard that Porto was <b>teetering</b> <b>on</b> the edge of rebellion. Taking 2,000 men and a few cannons, he set out for Porto but on 21 June stumbled into a hornet's nest of guerillas who sniped at him and rolled boulders down from the heights. Loison decided that his small force was overmatched and withdrew to Almeida.|$|E

With the death of the Swedish king, one of the major obstacles to peace was out of the way; in April the Treaty of Oliva was signed with the Allies (Poland, Austria and Brandenburg). However, the Danes were not keen on peace after their recent success. After further concessions, the Dutch released the blockade on Landskrona, allowing the Swedish fleet out in the Øresund strait and blockade Copenhagen.

500|$|Gygax {{immediately}} discarded {{his movie}} ambitions—his D movie {{would never be}} made—and flew back to Lake Geneva. There, he discovered to his shock that although industry leader TSR was grossing , it was barely breaking even; {{it was in fact}} [...] in debt and <b>teetering</b> <b>on</b> the edge of insolvency. After investigating the reasons why, Gygax brought his findings to the five other company directors. (Since 1982, TSR Inc. had conformed to the recommendations of the American Management Association by adding three [...] "outside" [...] directors to the board, increasing its size to six.) Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th century shipwreck. Gygax demanded that Kevin Blume be removed as company president, and the three outside directors agreed with him. However, the board still believed the financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to stay in control, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and rather than selling the company, he took steps to produce new revenue generating products. To that end, he contacted Dave Arneson with a view to produce some Blackmoor material. He also bet heavily on a new AD book, Unearthed Arcana, a compilation of material culled from Dragon Magazine articles. And he quickly wrote a novel set in his Greyhawk setting, Saga of Old City, featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue. In order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, Lorraine Williams.|$|E

It is a daring experiment, and one whose mood, setting and eccentricities linger in the mind." [...] Helen Dunmore of The Times called the narrative of the novel [...] "strong, satisfying and memorable". The Daily Mail called the novel [...] "an exceptional book even from the prize-winning Dawson; clever, moving, sexy and with a mesmerising feel for that magical, optimistic, but doomed time just before the Great War." [...] Vanessa Curtis of The Scotsman admired the novel for its much more satisfying portrayal of Brooke than his biographies and called it [...] "a seductive book, evocative and well paced, the tale split between Brooke and Nell, the two narrative voices strong, distinctive and consistent." [...] Alice Ryan called the novel [...] "a gripping and beautifully written book which deals not only with the history of Brooke and his alleged love child, but also with the wider history of the Fens, its places, people and traditions". The Oxford Times critic Phillipa Logan too gave praise to the novel, saying that Dawson [...] "exploits [...] ambiguities [...] to the full, creating a compelling, thoroughly plausible narrative that explores Brooke’s time as a student in Cambridge." [...] Simon Akam of The New Statesman liked the novel, noting that [...] "in her novel Dawson has [...] pulled off the risky gamble of reimagining history." [...] The New Zealand Listener said, [...] "The Great Lover is proof that its author is one of the finest practitioners of the literary historical novel and that this is her best novel yet." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1966, bassist Samwell-Smith {{left the}} Yardbirds {{to become a}} record producer. [...] His initial replacement, {{well-known}} studio guitarist Jimmy Page, soon switched to guitar with second guitarist Dreja taking over on bass. With both Beck and Page on board, the Yardbirds {{had one of the}} first dual lead guitar teams in popular rock. [...] Movie director Michelangelo Antonioni saw the group's September 23, 1966, performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London and, being impressed with their version of the song, requested that they perform [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] for his upcoming film, Blowup. [...] Less than two weeks later, the group entered the Sound Techniques studios in London, where they recorded on October 3–5, 1966. [...] Unable to secure the movie performance rights from the song's publisher, singer Keith Relf wrote new lyrics, renamed it [...] "Stroll On", and included credits to the five band members. [...] The Yardbirds also introduced an updated arrangement to go with the new lyrics. [...] Led Zeppelin biographer Keith Shadwick describes the new version as [...] "brutal, menacing, and <b>teetering</b> <b>on</b> all-out violence", which foreshadows heavy-metal. [...] It opens with a new drum part by Jim McCarty and harmonized guitar feedback, before Beck's train whistle simulation. [...] Unlike their earlier song, Relf's vocal is not double tracked nor does he play harmonica and the rhythm remains on the riff throughout the song. [...] The guitar work, with both Beck and Page contributing lead-guitar parts, has been called [...] "revolutionary", from the opening [...] "wall of feedback", the use of [...] "jarringly dissonant chords", and the [...] "twining guitar duet" [...] by Birnbaum. [...] During October 12–14, the Yardbirds were filmed lip syncing the song for Blowup. [...] Their scene was staged on a set at Elstree Studios designed to resemble the Ricky-Tick, a popular London club and, at Antonioni's direction, Beck smashes his guitar, in the manner of the Who's Pete Townshend. [...] The song as performed in the film is edited (doubled) to increase its length for the story line. [...] "Stroll On" [...] was later included on the Blow-Up soundtrack album in 1967 and appears on the Yardbirds compilation albums Train Kept A-Rollin'/The Yardbirds Story and Ultimate!.|$|E
