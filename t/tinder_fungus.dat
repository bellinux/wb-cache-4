50|$|Fomes fomentarius (commonly {{known as}} the <b>tinder</b> <b>fungus,</b> false <b>tinder</b> <b>fungus,</b> hoof fungus, tinder conk, tinder polypore or ice man fungus) is a species of fungal plant {{pathogen}} found in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America. The species produces very large polypore fruit bodies which are shaped like a horse's hoof and vary in colour from a silvery grey to almost black, though they are normally brown. It grows {{on the side of}} various species of tree, which it infects through broken bark, causing rot. The species typically continues to live on trees long after they have died, changing from a parasite to a decomposer.|$|E

50|$|The charcloth was fabric {{made from}} {{vegetable}} fibre (e.g. cotton, linen, or jute) which {{had previously been}} charred via pyrolysis, giving it the low ignition temperature and slow burning characteristics suitable for use as tinder. Rotten wood, known as 'touchwood' was also used, as well as 'amadou', which was a <b>tinder</b> prepared from <b>fungus</b> steeped in potassium nitrate (saltpetre) and dried.|$|R
40|$|During the 1997 – 2006 and 2010 – 2011 winter seasons, in {{the area}} of Morozova Gora (the nature reserve "Galichya Gora"), in Russia, 1200 samples of various substrata were taken, most of which were 4500 cm 3 in volume. In total, 41, 854 {{specimens}} of 690 species belonging to 52 Coleoptera families were registered at overwintering sites. The analysis of the peculiarities of imago Coleoptera groups in the major winter habitats showed that in most of the investigated substrata representatives of the Staphylinidae family prevailed both in terms of species diversity and number. It is only under the bark of trees and in deadwood that Carabidae are the most numerous, whereas Latridiidae are prevalent in <b>tinder</b> <b>fungi.</b> Turf has the maximal species saturation during the winter season (the highest percentage of species referring to 18 families was registered here), as well as plant litter (10 families), with turf being the preference of 8 families richest in species diversity. The imagos of a number of families relatively rich in species – Cantharidae, Malachiidae, Melandryidae, Mordellidae, Oedemeridae, Meloidae, Scraptiidae and Anthribidae – were not found at overwintering sites, which is explained by the preimaginal overwintering of most representatives of the abovementioned families. It was shown that in substrata which are the least suitable for the overwintering of the imago of most Coleoptera species, the highest percentage of the predominant species was registered since more accessible substrata are used as overwintering sites by the same species from different habitats, which decreases the concentration of imago beetles of certain species there. A study of the peculiarities of species distribution (with no less than 30 specimens) among overwintering sites showed that the largest number of stenotopic species was registered in droppings (9 species). Then follow the substrata (in decreasing order) : turf (5), hay (grass sward, haymow, meadow) (4), decomposing hay (3), decomposing wheat (3) and flour (3), plant litter (2), rotten birch stumps (1), decaying plant matter (1). Stenotopic Coleoptera species were not found in the following substrata: sandbar, decayed plant matter, soil mixed with decomposed hay and droppings, clumps of twigs and stems, hay (a field of perennial grasses), subcortical space and deadwood, <b>tinder</b> <b>fungi.</b> Cluster analysis revealed that imago Coleoptera groups overwintering in deadwood-related substrata located above the ground level stand out in their species composition. The imago Coleoptera group overwintering in decomposing wheat and flour is also characterised by a peculiar species composition, cereal pests being one of the factors. The species composition of Coleoptera groups overwintering in turf and plant litter as well as in substrata with decaying plant matter (decomposing hay, droppings, plant remains etc.) displayed the highest levels of similarity. The use of a uniform procedure for collecting material allowed calculating the average number of Coleoptera species overwintering in various substrata. It resulted in working out the major requirements for overwintering sites preferred by most imago beetles: 1) the substratum should be freeze-protected (among others, due to plant remains decomposition); 2) the moderate moisture of the location is important (extreme dryness and excess moisture of the substratum are both unsuitable for the overwintering of imago beetles); 3) the necessary presence of cavities suitable for overwintering (in hay, rotten wood, under the bark etc.); 4) it is desirable that the substrata contain enough food available in late autumn and early spring (smaller invertebrates, fungi etc.) ...|$|R

50|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the fungus appeared in the literature in the 1753 Species Plantarum by Carl Linnaeus; he called it Boletus fomentarius. The specific epithet fomentarius is from the Latin , referring to tinder. The species {{has been described as}} a member of numerous different genera. In 1783, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck named the species Agaricus fomentarius in his Encyclopédie Méthodique: Botanique. In 1818, Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer described Polyporus fomentarius in his Primitiae Florae Essequeboensis, and this name was sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries in the 1821 publication of the first volume of his Systema Mycologicum. Fries later, in his 1849 Summa vegetabilium Scandinaviae, moved the species to the genus Fomes. Subsequent attempts to change the genus of the species have been unsuccessful; the species was named Placodes fomentarius by Lucien Quélet in 1886, Ochroporus fomentarius by Joseph Schröter in 1888 and Scindalma fomentarium by Otto Kuntze in 1898. In the twentieth century, Narcisse Théophile Patouillard named the species Ungulina fomentaria in 1900, and William Murrill twice reallocated the species; in 1903, he named it Elfvingia fomentaria and in 1914, he named it Elfvingiella fomentaria. In 1963, Shu Chün Teng named it Pyropolyporus fomentarius. These names are considered obligate synonyms; that is, different names for the same species based on a single description or specimen. In addition to the obligate synonyms, there are a number of taxonomic synonyms, whereby names have been described as separate species, but have come to be considered synonymous. The species is commonly known as the <b>tinder</b> <b>fungus,</b> hoof fungus, tinder polypore, ice man fungus or false <b>tinder</b> <b>fungus.</b>|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to describe seasonal changes in numbers and settlement of basidiocarps of <b>tinder</b> <b>fungus</b> [Fomes fomentarius (L. ex Fr.) Kick] by the coleopteran Bolitophagus reticulatus L. in relation to the weight and the stage of decomposition of a basidiocarp in different types of forest habitats. Tinder fungi, which contained the coleopterans, were collected from four sample plots located in the Tuchola Forest and the Myœlêcinek area located within the administrative borders of the town of Bydgoszcz. Out of 763 collected <b>tinder</b> <b>fungus</b> basidiocarps, the coleopteran B. reticulatus inhabited 322, from which 2643 imagines and 685 larvae were obtained. In each of the studied habitats noticeable concentrations of coleopterans in dead basidiocarps of <b>tinder</b> <b>fungus</b> were observed. Differences in settlement of living and dead fruiting bodies proved statistically significant. Irrespective of the sample plot where the fungi were collected, the number and settlement of <b>tinder</b> <b>fungus</b> basidiocarps by B. reticulatus changed within a year, reaching highest values in winter.

40|$|The use of tinder (‘esca’ or ‘amadou’) {{prepared}} from basidiocarps of some bracket fungi, e. g. Fomes fomentarius and Phellinus igniarius as an easy-to-burn matter {{goes back}} to the man’s conquest of fire. Archaeological finds, such as fragments of tinder, flint-stones and traces of pyrite carried by the ‘Ice man’ on his way across the Alps more than 5, 000 years ago, bear evidence of the use of tinder in the Neolithic age. In 1926, on the assumption that P. igniarius was one of the pathogens of the so-called ‘apoplexy’ of grapevine, the name ‘esca’ was given to the disease. For long time, esca was thought to affect old vines only. In the last decades, however, various forms of the disease {{have been found to be}} widespread and to cause losses even to young vines. Aetiological studies have shown that esca of grapevine is a complex disease, incited by wilt-inducing ascomycetes (Togninia, Phaeoacremonium, Phaeomoniella) and/or the wood-decaying basidiomycete Fomitiporia mediterranea. Since the latter is not a <b>tinder</b> <b>fungus,</b> the advisability of retaining the name ‘esca’ for the disease is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Ethnographic, botanical, and {{historical}} research have been combined {{to describe the}} continuing dynamic interrelationship between the Caribou-Eater Chipewyan of northern Canada and their botanical environment. Summer and winter fieldwork was conducted in 1980 - 1982 at Fond du Lac, Stony Rapids, Stony Lake, and Black Lake, Saskatchewan, and Gravel Hill Lake, Northwest Territories. Twenty-five Chipewyan {{over the age of}} fifty contributed information on the uses of at least 72 species of plants, including foods (34), medicines (52), and materials in technology (34) and ritual (5). These numbers represent the compilation of small personal repertoires of potentially useful plants, most of which are rarely if ever used now. Consumption of fruit (e. g. Vaccinium spp., Rubus spp.) is still common but plants have had only limited seasonal dietary significance. Some indigenous fruits and vegetables (e. g. Vaccinium, Allium, Epilobium, Typha) have excellent potential for development as crops to provide local nutritional and economic benefits. Only one herbal medicine (Acorus) continues to be used frequently. Snowshoe construction is the only technological art employing plant materials (Betula wood) still frequently practiced. The potential for the economic development of such crafts is poor, but Chipewyan technology provides useful patterns for future exploitation of northern resources (e. g. snowshoes, meat drying racks). Ritual use of plant materials is rare. <b>Tinder</b> <b>fungus</b> divination and scapulimancy are attributed the functions of relieving anxiety and reducing indecision. Chipewyan plant taxonomy is mainly on the genus and species level, where some taxa show a close correspondence to scientific classifications. At least one useful plant (Acorus) appears to have been introduced in the study area. Floristic changes due to environmental degradation at village and trail/road sites indicate the fragile nature of the subarctic botanical environment. As an appendix to this study, ten Chipewyan medicinal plants were subjected to a preliminary, qualitative phytochemical screening for alkaloids, steroid saponins, cardiac glycosides, and anthraquinones. The results provide a starting point for the pharmacognostic evaluation of these plants...|$|E
