This point may present a little difficulty {{to those who are}} not accustomed to see in every discharge an equal exertion of power in opposite directions, a positive brush being considered by such (perhaps in consequence of the common phrase direction of a current) as indicating a breaking forth in different directions of the original force, rather than a tendency to convergence and union in one line of passage. But the ordinary case of the brush may be compared, for its illustration, with that in which, by holding the knuckle opposite to highly excited glass, a discharge occurs, the ramifications of a brush then leading from the glass and converging into a spark on the knuckle. Though a difficult experiment to make, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>discharge</b> between highly excited shell-lac and the excited glass of a machine: when the discharge passes, it is, from the nature of the charged bodies, brush at each end and spark in the middle, beautifully illustrating that tendency of discharge to facilitate like action, which I have described in a former page (1418.).|$|E

40|$|In {{the scope}} of this study, main pipe of the diffuser, risers, ports, {{internal}} and external environments forming the discharge system which is used in application are modelled by Finite Elements Analysis (FEA) program <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>discharge</b> and structural behaviour. The last two spans of the system (20 m) and four ports on these spans are investigated. While the diameter and geometry of the risers and ports remain constant, the diffuser pipe is modelled in three different ways. These are constant sectioned (Model 1), contracting with sharp edge entrance sectioned (Model 2) and gradually contracting sectioned (Model 3) respectively. Among them, only Model 1 is treated as Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) system and it is simulated by FEA to verify FEA solver in the first place. After structural suitability is confirmed, rest of the models are analysed to determine reaction forces and stresses. The discharge is performed as unsteady external flow as well as steady external flow assumption which is widely used in external flow model in the literature. The discharge analyses are performed in two different ways to verify FEA program. Iterative method is accompanying to FEA program. As a result of this study, proper model for structural and discharge behaviour and external flow effects on discharge velocities are obtained...|$|E
40|$|A {{transient}} 2 D axi-symmetric and lumped parameter (LP) {{model with}} constant outflow conditions {{have been developed}} to study the discharge capacity of an activated carbon bed. The predicted discharge times and variations in bed pressure and temperature are in good agreement with experimental results obtained from a 1. 82 l adsorbed natural gas (ANG) storage system. Under ambient air conditions, a maximum temperature drop of 29. 5 K and 45. 5 K are predicted at the bed center for discharge rates of 1. 0 l min(- 1) and 5. 0 l min(- 1) respectively. The corresponding discharge efficiencies are 77 % and 71. 5 % respectively with discharge efficiencies improving with decreasing outflow rates. Increasing the LID ratio from 1. 9 to 7. 8 had only a marginal increase in the discharge efficiency. Forced convection (exhaust gas) heating had a significant effect on the discharge efficiency, leading to efficiencies as high as 92. 8 % at a discharge of 1. 0 l min(- 1) and 88. 7 % at 5 l min(- 1). Our study shows that the LP model can be reliably used <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>discharge</b> times due to the uniform pressure distributions in the bed. Temperature predictions with the LP model were more accurate at ambient conditions and higher discharge rates, due to greater uniformity in bed temperatures. For the low thermal conductivity carbon porous beds, our study shows that exhaust gas heating can be used as an effective and convenient strategy to improve the discharge characteristics and performance of an ANG system.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{whether and how}} personal bankruptcy law affects small firms' access to credit. When a firm is unincorporated, its debts are personal liabilities of the firm's owner, so that lending to the firm is equivalent to lending to its owner. If the firm fails, the owner has an incentive to file for personal bankruptcy in order <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>discharge</b> of the firm's debts. While bankruptcy law is uniform across the country, states are allowed to set their own bankruptcy exemption levels and they vary widely. The higher the exemption level, the more attractive it is for debtors who live in that state to file for bankruptcy, because they can keep more of their assets while obtaining discharge {{of their own and}} the firm's debts. The paper presents a theoretical model of credit markets which shows that supply of credit falls and demand for credit rises when non-corporate firms are located in states with higher bankruptcy exemption levels. We test the model using the NSSBF and find that high homestead and personal property exemptions exemptions are associated with an increased probability of non-corporate firms being denied credit, but do not affect the probability of corporate firms being denied credit. We also find weak evidence that both types of firms receive smaller loans when they are located in states that have high bankruptcy exemptions, but we find no evidence that interest rates are affected by bankruptcy exemptions. We also test for the effect of a prior bankruptcy filing by non-corporate firms or their owners on access to credit and find that a prior ling nearly triples the probability that these firms are denied credit...|$|E
40|$|This is a fascinating, complex {{case of an}} {{adolescent}} male who developed an erotomanic attachment for a male peer along with gender identity confusion. John’s symptoms clearly reached delusional proportions; their tenacity over several years speaks to their entrenched nature. An example is John’s unsubstantiated but firm belief that Fred was not returning his love because Fred’s parents disapproved of the relationship. Labeling this belief as a defense mechanism could fill a case confer-ence by itself, given it has elements of “rationalization” (justification of a belief by inventing a fallacy), “distortion” (grossly reshaping outer reality to suit inner needs), and “psychotic denial ” (in psychotic denial, the denied reality may {{be replaced by a}} delusion) (Kaplan and Saddock, 1988). John’s erotomanic delusion seems to have abated after just a week of psychosocial treatment, surprisingly, without medication. Little has been written about psy-chotherapeutic approaches to delusions. One approach postulates that delusions form at a time of agitation associated with emotional conflict, and therapy focuses on addressing underlying affective contributions (Malancharuvil 2004). Or was John downplaying his symp-toms <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>discharge?</b> This case raises other interesting questions, e. g., Are John’s erotomania and gender identity disturbances etio-logically related, or is it possible that “lightning struck twice, ” and both disorders developed independently? Certainly the stronger argument would be that these two conditions are related, as {{there was no evidence of}} gender identity concerns during John’s preteen years. Gender identity issues commonly surface early in child-hood (Bradley and Zucker, 1997), although there is some evidence for a “late onset ” type, especially for those who are phenotypic males (Okabe et al., 2008) ...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{insolvency}} {{systems have}} been designed with larger enterprises in mind. They assume an extensive insolvency estate of significant worth, {{and the presence of}} creditors and other stakeholders with sufficient value at stake that they participate in and oversee the process. These assumptions undergird mechanisms by which creditors and other stakeholders may ensure that the insolvency process faithfully serves their interests, for an independent professional to run the business undergoing an insolvency process, and for extensive judicial oversight. These assumptions and features are incongruent with the reality of micro, small, and medium enterprises (2 ̆ 7 MSMEs 2 ̆ 7). Mirroring the general population of businesses and reflecting the particular fragility associated with smaller asset bases and relative absence of risk diversification, the vast majority of businesses entering insolvency proceedings are MSMEs. On MSME insolvency, little or no value is available for distribution to anyone other than secured creditors in a significant proportion of insolvency estates, and secured creditors tend to have effective collection methods under non-insolvency law. Correspondingly, most secured and unsecured creditors, as well as other stakeholders, are rationally disinterested in the insolvency process. In many cases, it is not worthwhile for either the estate or most stakeholders to engage lawyers to represent them in court. Estates may possess inadequate value even to pay an independent insolvency professional. Such incongruence between the design of insolvency regimes and the nature of most of the businesses to which they apply leaves the insolvency process unbalanced, inadequately supervised, non-efficacious, and sometimes, simply unfeasible. Policy-makers and legislators have often responded through ad hoc changes to the ‘standard’ regime, such as by shearing some elements of the insolvency process when applied to smaller businesses, by shortening statutory timelines, and by dispensing with the necessary participation of certain stakeholders. The resulting processes have been marked by arbitrary boundaries, rigid preconditions for availability, and limited effectiveness. This paper systematically rethinks the treatment of distressed MSMEs. At its core is a new ‘Modular Approach’ to MSME insolvency. This approach is modular in two ways: (i) it allows national policy makers to choose from a range of available options including in terms of the involvement of appropriate institutions; (ii) subject to national authorities’ design decisions, the Modular Approach provides an essential ‘core’ process in each case, and allows relevant stakeholders to invoke additional tools (‘modules’) if and when the benefits of wielding those tools in the particular case outweigh the costs. The Modular Approach shares with ‘standard’ insolvency regimes the core objectives of preserving and maximizing the value in the insolvency estate, ensuring distribution over an appropriate period of time of the highest feasible proportion of that value to those entitled to it, providing due accountability for any wrongdoing connected with the insolvency, and enabling discharge of over-indebted natural persons. The Modular Approach differs in the way it pursues these objectives. Its basic assumption is that the parties to a particular insolvency case are best placed to select the tools appropriate to that case. The role of the legal regime should be to provide these tools in a maximally flexible way, while creating the correct incentives for their deployment. Traditionally, legal systems provide particular ‘packages’ or combinations of these tools and label them ‘workout’, ‘liquidation’ and ‘restructuring’. The Modular Approach unpacks those combinations. It assumes a core process, geared towards enabling the entrepreneur to propose a restructuring of the business’ liabilities and <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>discharge</b> of any unrepayable obligations. The entrepreneur, who may operate through a legal entity or as a sole trader, may access any of the full range of insolvency law mechanisms to enable attainment of these objectives. At the same time, creditors and other stakeholders have the right to adequate notification of each step in the process, coupled with the power to override the entrepreneur’s choices where a sufficient proportion of them consider it appropriate to do so. Judicial involvement is not required as a matter of course, though, again, it may be requested by the stipulated proportion of creditors. The process may obtain and retain momentum by virtue of the presumptions that stakeholders who have not positively objected to a step in the process have consented to that step, and that the non-exercise of procedural rights within the process precludes the relevant stakeholders from objecting to the part of the process to which the unexercised rights relate. Stakeholders are divided into appropriate classes; they must act by stipulated majority by value; and stipulated majorities by value of a class may bind dissenting minorities. The Modular Approach is designed to provide appropriate incentives for the entrepreneur and other stakeholders alike. Entrepreneurs have positive incentives to commence the insolvency process in a timely manner: {{they do not have to}} declare the business insolvent; they may, in principle, retain its management; and they have the right to propose how the insolvency should proceed. Entrepreneurs also face negative incentives that discourage non-timely commencement of insolvency proceedings, in that the Modular Approach imposes personal liability for any additional loss suffered by the business’ creditors because of blameworthy delay in commencement. The Modular Approach acknowledges that in many MSME insolvencies, unsecured creditors are rationally disinterested, given their limited economic stake and the very limited likelihood of any recovery in the process. They need not actively participate in the process if, upon due notification, they do not consider it worth the time and expense of participating. As noted, their abstention is deemed approval, and the insolvency process may continue apace. Negative incentives for creditors arise because the non-exercise of procedural rights amounts to a waiver of such rights. Positive incentives arise in creditors’ ability, acting with others who together hold a sufficiently large proportion of the claims against the enterprise, to override the entrepreneur’s choice of tools and to select a destiny for the business different to the one favoured by the entrepreneur. The Modular Approach also responds to differences in the economic, social and legal circumstances of different countries. It does so by guiding national policymakers with respect to the factors relevant to determining the proper boundaries between ‘standard’ and MSME insolvency regimes, and by identifying three functions: management, administrative and judicial. The Approach explains the costs and benefits of assigning those functions to different entities...|$|E
