25|$|Spironolactone {{directly}} blocks androgen signaling {{and also}} {{acts as an}} inhibitor of androgen production. Due to the antiandrogenic effects that result from these actions, it is frequently used off-label to treat a variety of dermatological conditions in which androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play a role. Some of these uses include androgenic alopecia in men (either at low doses or as a <b>topical</b> <b>formulation)</b> and women, and hirsutism (excessive hair growth), acne, and seborrhea in women. Spironolactone is {{the most commonly used}} drug in the treatment of hirsutism in the United States. Higher doses of spironolactone are not recommended in males due to the high risk of feminization and other side effects. Similarly, it is also commonly used to treat symptoms of hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transcription}} factor GATA-3 {{is also an}} interesting target, of the DNAzyme <b>topical</b> <b>formulation</b> SB012, for a novel therapeutic strategy in ulcerative colitis (UC). UC is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases defined by chronically relapsing inflammations of the gastrointestinal tract, and characterized by a superficial, continuous mucosal inflammation, which predominantly affects the large intestine. Patients that do not effectively respond to current UC treatment strategies exhibit serious drawbacks one of which may lead to colorectal surgery, and {{can result in a}} severely compromised quality of life. Thus, patients with moderate or severe UC may significantly benefit from these new therapeutic alternatives, of which SB012 is in phase I clinical trials.|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{acceptance of}} <b>topical</b> <b>formulations</b> intended for local and/or regional activity has prompted {{renewed interest in}} developing a model to determine the bioavailability of drugs {{in order to establish}} bioequivalence as a means of evaluating formulation performance of multisource products and also for use during formulation development. Current in vivo techniques such as blister suction and skin biopsy amongst others used to determine the bioavailability and/or bioequivalence of <b>topical</b> <b>formulations</b> are either too invasive to generate appropriate concentration-time profiles or require large numbers of study subjects thereby making the study expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there are currently no sampling techniques that can demonstrate dermal bioavailability and/or bioequivalence of <b>topical</b> <b>formulations</b> intended for local and/or regional activity. Dermal microdialysis is a relatively new application of microdialysis that permits continuous monitoring of endogenous and/or exogenous solutes in the interstitial fluid. The technique is involves the implantation of semi-permeable membranes which are perfused with an isotonic medium at extremely slow flow rates and collection of microlitre sample volumes containing diffused drugs. Tape stripping, a relatively older technique, has been extensively used in comparative bioavailability studies of various <b>topical</b> <b>formulations.</b> However, due to shortcomings arising from reproducibility and inter-subject variation amongst others, the published FDA guidance outlining the initial protocol was subsequently withdrawn. The incorporation of transepidermal water loss with tape stripping has garnered renewed interest and has been used for the determination of drug bioavailability from a number of <b>topical</b> <b>formulations.</b> Hence the primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate microdialysis sampling and tape stripping techniques, including the incorporation of the determination of transepidermal water loss, to assess the dermal bioavailability of ketoprofen from <b>topical</b> gel <b>formulations</b> and to develop models for bioequivalence assessment. A rapid UPLC-MS/MS method with requisite sensitivity for the analysis of samples generated from dermal microdialysis was developed and validated which accommodated the microlitre sample volumes collected. An HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for the analysis of samples generated from the in vitro microdialysis and in vivo tape stripping studies. The work presented herein contributes to a growing body of scientific knowledge seeking to develop a model for the determination of bioequivalence of pharmaceutically equivalent <b>topical</b> <b>formulations</b> intended for local and/or regional activity in human subjects...|$|R

The comparative Normal Stability Testing of the <b>topical</b> <b>formulations</b> containing unmodified and modified papain showed that the modified variety presented with a differentiated profile under the adopted temperature conditions (5. 0 ± 1. 0 °C; 22. 0 ± 2. 0 °C; 40. 0 ± 2. 0 °C). The most suitable condition for non-modified papain were 5. 0 ± 1. 0 °C and, for modified papain, they were 22. 0 ± 2. 0 °C. These results confirmed the higher stability of modified papain compared to free papain, as well as its potential to be applied in <b>topical</b> <b>formulations...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Dapsone {{had been}} {{reported}} {{in a few cases}} to effectively treat acne, but the risk of hemolytic anemia kept it from being widely used for this purpose. For many years scientists attempted to develop a <b>topical</b> <b>formulation</b> of dapsone that would be as effective against acne as oral dapsone, but without the hemolysis side effect. This was difficult to accomplish because dapsone is highly insoluble in aqueous solvents. In the early 2000s QLT USA developed Aczone, a 5% dapsone gel that was shown to be effective against acne without causing clinically significant declines in hemoglobin levels, even in subjects with G6PD deficiency. [...] In February 2016, the FDA approved a 7.5% dapsone gel. This higher strength has the advantage of a once-daily application, versus twice-daily application of the 5% formulation.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{diffusion}} of parabens from <b>topical</b> <b>formulations</b> is presented here. In particular, four different <b>topical</b> <b>formulations,</b> namely, a water-in-oil emulsion, an oil-in-water emulsion, and two hydrophilic gels (Pemulen gel and Carbopol gel) were produced, containing a mixture of three common parabens, namely, methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP), and propylparaben (PP). An analytical method based on liquid extraction, followed by reversed-phase HPLC for the quantitative determination of MP, EP, and PP, was developed. The method allowed good separation of paraben mixtures and high percentages of recovery (> than 97 %). The diffusion kinetics of parabens from the produced formulations was determined by an in vitro system based on a Franz cell assembled with a synthetic membrane, followed by a reversed-phase HPLC analytical method. The comparative study demonstrated that, {{in the case of}} emulsions, diffusion coefficients are a function of the substituent of preservatives: the higher the solubility, the higher the diffusion of parabens. On the contrary, {{in the case of the}} hydrophilic gels, the higher the parabens olubility, the lower the diffusion coefficients. The method described here could represent a means of controlling the extent of diffusion of parabens from <b>topical</b> <b>formulations</b> in order to minimize percutaneous absorption and to control the availability of microbes...|$|R

5000|$|... "T. ni" [...] is a polyphagus insect {{that has}} {{exhibited}} {{resistance to the}} Bt <b>topical</b> <b>formulation</b> Dipel(R) in Canadian greenhouses. Resistance to the Bt endotoxin Cry1Ac of this population {{was determined to be}} autosomal and incompletely recessive. Biochemical analysis of putative toxin receptors indicated an alteration of expression for two APN midgut receptors, with resistant individuals having a downregulation of APN1 and upregulation of APN6 compared to their susceptible counterpart. However, molecular analysis has not linked the APN gene with resistance and instead has identified the gene of ABCC2 with resistance. It is still to be determined what role ABCC2 plays in the mode of action for Bt resistance. The alteration of expression of APNs and the linkage of ABCC2 with Bt resistance could be artifacts of the initially isolated population and may not have any role in the resistant mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Asthma is {{characterized}} by eosinophil-induced inflammation motivated by a type 2 helper T cell (Th2). By targeting the transcription factor, GATA3, of the Th2 pathway, with DNAzyme {{it may be possible}} to negate the inflammation. The safety and efficacy of SB010, a novel 10-23 DNAzyme was evaluated, and found to have the ability to cleave and inactivate GATA3 messenger RNA in phase IIa clinical trials. Treatment with SB010 significantly offset both late and early asthmatic responses after allergen aggravation in male patients with allergic asthma.The transcription factor GATA-3 is also an interesting target, of the DNAzyme <b>topical</b> <b>formulation</b> SB012, for a novel therapeutic strategy in ulcerative colitis (UC). UC is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases defined by chronically relapsing inflammations of the gastrointestinal tract, and characterized by a superficial, continuous mucosal inflammation, which predominantly affects the large intestine. Patients that do not effectively respond to current UC treatment strategies exhibit serious drawbacks one of which may lead to colorectal surgery, and can result in a severely compromised quality of life. Thus, patients with moderate or severe UC may significantly benefit from these new therapeutic alternatives, of which SB012 is in phase I clinical trials. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, in which patients suffer from eczema, often severe pruritus on the affected skin, as well as complications and secondary infections. AD surfaces from an upregulation of Th2-modified immune responses, therefore a novel AD approach using DNAzymes targeting GATA-3 is a plausible treatment option. The topical DNAzyme SB011 is currently in phase II clinical trials.DNAzyme research for the treatment of cancer is also underway. The development of a 10-23 DNAzyme that can block the expression of IGF-I (Insulin-like growth factor I, a contributor to normal cell growth as well as tumorigenesis) by targeting its mRNA could be useful for blocking the secretion of IGF-I from prostate storm primary cells ultimately inhibiting prostate tumor development. Additionally, with this treatment it is expected that hepatic metastasis would also be inhibited, via the inhibition of IGF-I in the liver (the major source of serum IGF-I).|$|E
