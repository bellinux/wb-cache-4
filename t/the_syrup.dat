5|$|Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout. <b>The</b> <b>syrup</b> is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. In most overseas markets, Guinness Flavour Extract (GFE) is blended with locally brewed beer to produce FES.|$|E
5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of <b>the</b> <b>syrup.</b>|$|E
5|$|Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout. <b>The</b> <b>syrup</b> is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. Each year, six million litres of GFE are made using 9,000 tonnes of barley. Guinness Flavour Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s. In 2003, production of GFE was relocated from St James's Gate to the former Cherry's brewery in Mary Street, Waterford, but in 2013 production returned to St James's.|$|E

5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to <b>the</b> <b>syrup.</b> This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
5|$|Applewood Farm {{has served}} as a farm for over a century, with an 1850 census {{reporting}} it produced butter, cheese, rye, Indian corn, oats, wool, Irish potatoes and hay. Three apple orchards planted by Russell Gallup would become an important part of Applewood Farms and owe its name to those orchards. After Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s, the farm produced fresh fruits and vegetables and poultry, eggs and dairy products. In 1994, the Applewood Farm reported having 700 trees tapped for maple syrup production and showed visitors the process of producing <b>the</b> <b>syrup.</b> Applewood Farms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under criteria A for the Gallup family history that {{played an important role in}} the local history and under criteria C as an architecturally important example of a late colonial center chimney house.|$|E
5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E

25|$|Ribbon cane is a {{subtropical}} {{type that}} was once widely grown in the southern United States, {{as far north as}} coastal North Carolina. The juice was extracted with horse or mule-powered crushers; the juice was boiled, like maple syrup, in a flat pan, and then used in <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> form as a food sweetener. It is not currently a commercial crop, but a few growers find ready sales for their product.|$|E
25|$|No longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavour {{dispenser}} {{introduced by}} Coca-Cola and Siemens in 1988. Intended {{for use in}} offices with five to fifty people, its refrigerated compartment held three individual one-litre plastic containers of soda syrup and a CO2 tank. Like a soda fountain, it mixed syrup in a 1:5 ratio with carbonated water. In North America, Coca-Cola discontinued spare BreakMate parts in 2007 and stopped distributing <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{production}} and distribution of Coca-Cola follows a franchising model. The Coca-Cola Company only produces a syrup concentrate, which it sells to bottlers throughout the world, who hold Coca-Cola franchises for one or more geographical areas. The bottlers produce the final drink by mixing <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> with filtered water and sweeteners, and then carbonate it before putting it in cans and bottles, which the bottlers then sell and distribute to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and food service distributors.|$|E

25|$|In 1935, Loft sued Guth for {{breaching}} {{his duty}} {{of loyalty to}} the company by failing to sell <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> formula to Loft, and instead appropriating it for himself. Loft argued that while its president, Guth used Loft's assets, credit, finances, facilities and employees {{to build up the}} other company. Guth argued that the opportunity came to him personally and that it was out of Loft's business sector. Loft sued for the 237,500 shares that Guth owned (91% of Pepsi-Cola's total shares). He remained president of Pepsi during the process. In 1939, the Delaware supreme court rendered the verdict in favor of Loft.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of date-presses (madbassat) are found in houses {{throughout}} the town. They are small rooms with ridged plastered floors sloping to one corner where a jar would have been placed. Dates were packed in sacks and placed {{on the floor with}} weights on top to squeeze out the date juice - a sweet sticky syrup (dibs). The jar would collect and preserve <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> for later consumption or use in cooking. In 2014, a site was excavated which revealed the largest yet-discovered date-pressing site in the country and region. There were 27 date presses found overall, including 11 found in one lone complex.|$|E
25|$|First to {{the scene}} were 116 cadets under the {{direction}} of Lieutenant Commander H. J. Copeland from USS Nantucket, a training ship of the Massachusetts Nautical School (which is now the Massachusetts Maritime Academy), that was docked nearby at the playground pier. They ran several blocks toward the accident. They worked to keep the curious from {{getting in the way of}} the rescuers, while others entered into the knee-deep, sticky mess to pull out the survivors. Soon, the Boston Police, Red Cross, Army, and other Navy personnel arrived. Some nurses from the Red Cross dove into the molasses, while others tended to the injured, keeping them warm and keeping the exhausted workers fed. Many of these people worked through the night. The injured were so numerous that doctors and surgeons set up a makeshift hospital in a nearby building. Rescuers found it difficult to make their way through <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> to help the victims. Four days elapsed before they stopped searching for victims; many of the dead were so glazed over in molasses, they were hard to recognize.|$|E

500|$|Boiling <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> is {{a tightly}} {{controlled}} process, which ensures appropriate sugar content. [...] Syrup boiled too long will eventually crystallize, whereas under-boiled syrup will be watery, and will quickly spoil. [...] The finished syrup has a density of 66° on the Brix scale (a hydrometric scale {{used to measure}} sugar solutions). <b>The</b> <b>syrup</b> is then filtered to remove sugar sand, crystals made up largely of sugar and calcium malate. These crystals are not toxic, but create a [...] "gritty" [...] texture in <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> if not filtered out.|$|E
500|$|Off-flavours can {{sometimes}} develop during {{the production of}} maple syrup, resulting from contaminants in the boiling apparatus (such as disinfectants), microorganisms, fermentation products, metallic can flavours, and [...] "buddy sap", an off-flavour occurring late in <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> season when tree budding has begun.

500|$|Sugar beet {{became a}} major source of sugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became available. It is a {{biennial}} plant, a cultivated variety of Beta vulgaris in the family Amaranthaceae, the tuberous root of which contains a high proportion of sucrose. It is cultivated as a root crop in temperate regions with adequate rainfall and requires a fertile soil. The crop is harvested mechanically in the autumn and the crown of leaves and excess soil removed. The roots do not deteriorate rapidly and may be left in a clamp in the field for some weeks before being transported to the processing plant. Here the crop is washed and sliced and the sugar extracted by diffusion. Milk of lime is added to the raw juice [...] and carbonatated in a number of stages in order to purify it. Water is evaporated by boiling <b>the</b> <b>syrup</b> under a vacuum. <b>The</b> <b>syrup</b> is then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals. The white sugar that crystallizes out can be separated in a centrifuge and dried. It requires no further refining.|$|E
