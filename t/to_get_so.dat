25|$|Republican {{presidential nominee}} John McCain had early hopes {{for winning the}} state. New Hampshire {{strongly}} supported McCain in the 2000 and 2008 Republican primaries, attracted by his status as an independent maverick; New Hampshire voters have historically been friendly to independent-minded Republicans. After he clinched the GOP nomination in March 2008, McCain began to move more {{to the right to}} appease the base of his party, and his selection of the socially conservative Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin to be the vice presidential nominee alienated several independents and libertarian-leaning Republicans in New Hampshire. Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama campaigned extensively throughout the state in 2008 to try and unite the party in the general election after the historic and divisive 2008 Democratic primary. Despite the polls that had Obama leading by double digits, New Hampshire voters gave a surprise comeback win to Hillary Rodham Clinton in the January 2008 New Hampshire Democratic Primary {{thanks in large part to}} an enormous number of women who turned out to support Clinton after her emotional moment at a campaign stop in Portsmouth a few days earlier. Obama acknowledged this phenomenon throughout the campaign when he advised his supporters not <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> cocky and arrogant when they saw the polls that had him leading.|$|E

500|$|The pair {{wrote the}} song, while {{longtime}} producer Scott Hendricks handled the production. It portrays a midtempo, country pop crossover duet. Shelton believed that writing his own music had [...] "been a great channel {{for him to}} vent and celebrate his tumultuous year". Rolling Stone stated that Shelton and Stefani [...] " [...] gush about their relationship in the press too much, as they [...] to keep some semblance of privacy. Instead, they wrote a song about it." [...] Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly claimed that [...] "Go Ahead and Break My Heart" [...] served as the parent album's [...] "gossipy framing" [...] for [...] "offer a simultaneous spit-in-the-face and [...] to their exes". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed, finding Shelton [...] "embracing his {{new lease on life}} with renewed vigor and a new a love", who Erlewine later claimed was Stefani.

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{excellent}} review, {{giving it a}} A-. In her recap, she gave the performances high marks: [...] "Y’know, when I get so frustrated with OUAT, it’s because it sets a high bar up against itself. Like this episode, for example. It takes a classic myth, perfectly twists it into the show’s own purposes, and manages to be jaw-dropping in a single hour. I didn’t realize we were about <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> much out of “Nimue,” but I should have guessed once {{we found out that}} it was penned by Jane Espenson, who writes most of OUAT’s best episodes." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 27 April 2008: Insurgents, {{reportedly}} {{from the}} Haqqani network, used automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades {{to attack a}} military parade that Karzai was attending in Kabul. Karzai was safe, but at least three people were killed, including a parliamentarian, a ten-year-old girl and a minority leader, and ten injured. Others attending the event included government ministers, former warlords, diplomats and the military top brass, {{all of whom had}} gathered to mark the 16th anniversary of the fall of the Afghan communist government to the mujahideen. Responding to the attack during the ceremony, the UN said the attackers [...] "have shown their utter disrespect for the history and people of Afghanistan." [...] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack, stating, [...] "We fired rockets {{at the scene of the}} celebration." [...] He went on to say there were 6 Taliban at the scene and that 3 were killed. [...] "Our aim was not to directly hit someone," [...] Mujahed said when asked if the intention was to kill Karzai. [...] "We just wanted to show to the world that we can attack anywhere we want to". The ability of the attackers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> close to Karzai suggested they had inside help. Defense minister Wardak confirmed that a police captain was connected with the group behind the assassination attempt and that an army officer supplied the weapons and ammunition used in the attack.|$|E

2500|$|When Larry announces his {{leave of}} absence to board the International Space Station (in the episode [...] "Brutus"), Charlie is shocked and upset. He is in denial about Larry's ambitions and he thinks reason of the risks {{involved}} will assert itself firmly in Larry's mind. He reasons that apparently Larry wouldn't do such a thing. Larry remands his few prized possessions to him, and he is grateful for the gesture. When he tells him his concerns, Larry is angered.

[...] Larry understands and decides to ignore Charlie's protestations. Though neither apologize, they are on good terms. Charlie says to Amita that he does not know what he would do without him, as he peruses through Larry's precious items that were bestowed upon him. In [...] "Killer Chat", he says that he was glad that Larry's dream could come true, but feels conflicted about being relieved when he discovers that Larry might have been scrapped from the mission when NASA learned of his eccentric indulgences such as sleeping in the campus steam tunnels. However, Charlie agrees with Megan in wanting to help Larry and personally vouches for him. Eppes' words and affiliation with the NSA gets him back on the mission, thus, repaying a debt as Larry helped launch him into the academic firmament. Earlier, he had given him back his lucky T-shirt.|$|E
