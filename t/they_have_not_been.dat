5|$|Similar {{to single}} interstitials, divacancies {{do not produce}} photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900°C {{creating}} multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E

5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E

5|$|Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, {{gold and}} other {{minerals}} have been found, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> in large enough quantities to exploit. The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts {{a struggle for}} resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934tonnes.|$|E

Follow-up observations in 2018 are planned to secure their orbits and perhaps find new moons.|$|E
5|$|Two {{neptunium}} chlorides, NpCl3 and NpCl4, {{have been}} characterized. Although several attempts to create NpCl5 have been made, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> successful. NpCl3 {{is created by}} reducing neptunium dioxide with hydrogen and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and NpCl4 by reacting a neptunium oxide with CCl4 at around 500°C. Other neptunium chloride compounds have also been reported, including NpOCl2, Cs2NpCl6, Cs3NpO2Cl4, and Cs2NaNpCl6. Neptunium bromides NpBr3 and NpBr4 have also been created; the latter by reacting aluminium bromide with NpO2 at 350°C and the former in an almost identical procedure but with zinc present. The neptunium iodide NpI3 has also been prepared by the same method as NpBr3.|$|E

5|$|Apatosaurus was {{the second}} most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after Camarasaurus. Apatosaurus may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs. Supersaurus has a greater total length and is the largest of all sauropods from the Morrison Formation. Apatosaurus fossils have only been found in the upper levels of the formation. Those of Apatosaurus ajax are known {{exclusively}} from the upper Brushy Basin Member, about 152–151 mya. A.louisae fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late Kimmeridgian stage, about 151mya. Additional Apatosaurus remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> identified as any particular species, and thus may instead belong to Brontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium {{is known}} from {{isolated}} teeth, {{the assignment of}} some of which is controversial. The material from the Los Alamitos Formation, which is mostly in the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia (MACN) in Buenos Aires, with one tooth in the Museo de La Plata (MLP) in La Plata, Argentina, has been thoroughly described; while there are additional Ferugliotherium fossils from the La Colonia Formation, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> described in detail. Although the fragmentary nature of the known fossils of Ferugliotherium {{makes it impossible to}} determine its dental formula with certainty, Gurovich suggested that it had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars {{on each side of the}} lower and upper jaws. However, on the basis of comparisons with Sudamerica, which is known to have had four lower molariforms (molar-like teeth, either premolars or molars) in its lower jaw, Pascual and Ortiz-Jaureguizar suggested in 2007 that Ferugliotherium may also have had four lower molars.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United Football Club is an English {{professional}} football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester.
