40|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>forming</b> is an {{advanced}} version of metal spinning process {{which is used}} to manufacture sheet metal products having symmetrically axial geometry and also to produce long thin-wall tubes with precision dimensions and desired mechanical property. In <b>flow</b> <b>forming</b> of tubes, the workpiece is held onto the mandrel as the forming roller moves along the workpiece axially to reduce the diameter. Author has developed a few concepts of <b>flow</b> <b>forming</b> tool that built to accommodate the lathe tool post. One of the concept consists of two rollers set has been fabricated. This tool is rigid enough <b>to</b> perform <b>flow</b> <b>forming</b> at lathe machine and can flow-form tubes with a diameter up to 100 mm. This tooling assembly is attached at Pinacho SP/ 165 conventional lathe machine <b>to</b> perform <b>flow</b> <b>forming</b> process. The selected work material is aluminium alloy 6061 that widely applied at light-weighted industries. The main objectives of this research is to analyse the influences of major process parameters such as feed rate, spindle speed and depth of cut on wall thickness changes, internal diameter growth and roundness of the finished products. The dimensions of the finish products are measured using Carl Zeiss Coordinate Measuring Machine. It is found that wall thickness changes decreases and external diameter increases as the roller travels along the tube. It is also found that higher feed rate of rollers and lower thickness reductions have advantages for obtaining smaller internal diameter growth. The tube with good roundness also can be obtained by flow-form the tube using lower thickness reductions. Material structure test also has been conducted to confirm the direction of the flow of material during the process...|$|R

50|$|Many {{materials}} can sustain a smouldering reaction, including coal, tobacco, decaying wood and sawdust, biomass fuels {{on the forest}} surface (duff) and subsurface (peat), cotton clothing and string, and polymeric foams (e.g., upholstery and bedding materials). Smouldering fuels are generally porous, permeable <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> and <b>formed</b> by aggregates (particulates, grains, fibres or of cellular structure). These aggregates facilitate the surface reaction with oxygen by allowing gas flow through the fuel and providing a large surface area per unit volume.

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), flow-induced arteriolar constriction {{is due to}} an enhanced generation of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species, causing an impairment of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin mediation of the response. Changes in diameter of isolated, pressurized (at 80 mm Hg) gracilis muscle arterioles (diameter approximately 170 microm) from control and methionine diet-induced HHcy rats were measured by videomicroscopy. Increases in intraluminal <b>flow</b> (from 0 <b>to</b> 25 microL/min) resulted in NO- and prostaglandin-mediated dilations of control arterioles (maximum, control, 30 +/- 4 microm) but elicited significant constrictions of HHcy arterioles (maximum, HHcy, - 32 +/- 3 microm), which were abolished by the thromboxane A(2) receptor blocker SQ 29, 548. Intraluminal administration of superoxide dismutase plus catalase did not affect flow-mediated dilations of control arterioles, but in HHcy arterioles, it reversed the flow-induced constrictions to dilations (maximum 18 +/- 4 microm), which were abolished by an NO synthase inhibitor. Flow-induced constrictions of HHcy arterioles were prevented {{by the presence of}} the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol [but not by the NAD(P) H-oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium] and by urate, a known peroxynitrite scavenger. Also, authentic peroxynitrite elicited arteriolar constrictions (- 31 +/- 8 microm) that were eliminated by urate and SQ 29, 548. Thus, we suggest that in HHcy, xanthine oxidase-derived superoxide scavenges NO released <b>to</b> <b>flow,</b> <b>forming</b> peroxynitrite, which promotes release of thromboxane A(2), resulting in arteriolar constriction...|$|R

5000|$|Powder Coating {{is a type}} of coating that {{is applied}} as a free-flowing, dry powder. The main {{difference}} between a conventional liquid paint and a powder coating is that the powder coating does not require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form.

The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. Powder coating is mainly used for coating of metals, such as household appliances, aluminum extrusions, drum hardware, and automobile and bicycle parts. Newer technologies allow other materials, such as MDF (medium-density fibreboard), to be powder coated using different methods.|$|R
40|$|The {{change in}} shape of atmospherically {{relevant}} organic particles {{is used to}} estimate the viscosity of the particle material {{without the need for}} removal from aerosol suspension. The dynamic shape factors χ of particles produced by α-pinene ozonolysis in a flow tube reactor, under conditions of particle coagulation, were measured while altering the relative humidity (RH) downstream of the flow tube. As relative humidity was increased, the results showed that χ could change from 1. 27 to 1. 02, corresponding to a transition from aspherical to nearly spherical shapes. The shape change could occur at elevated RH because the organic material had decreased viscosity and was therefore able <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> spherical shapes, as favored by the minimization of surface area. Numerical modeling was used to estimate the particle viscosity associated with this flow. Based on particle diameter and RH exposure time, the viscosity dropped from 10 (8. 7 ± 2. 0) to 10 (7. 0 ± 2. 0) Pa s (two sigma) for an increase in RH from < 5 to 58 % at 293 K.

50|$|Over time, {{the layer}} of salt is covered with {{deposited}} sediment, becoming buried under an increasingly large overburden. The overlying sediment will undergo compaction, causing an increase in density and therefore a decrease in buoyancy. Unlike clastics, pressure has a significantly smaller effect on the density of salt due to its crystal structure and this eventually leads to it becoming more buoyant than the sediment above it. The ductility of salt initially allows it to plastically deform and flow laterally, decoupling the overlying sediment from the underlying sediment. Since the salt has a larger buoyancy than the sediment above - and if a significant faulting event affects the lower surface of the salt - the salt can begin <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> vertically, <b>forming</b> a salt pillow. The vertical growth of these salt pillows creates pressure on the upward surface, causing extension and faulting (see salt tectonics).|$|R
