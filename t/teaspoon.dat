(Note that salt {{contains about}} 39.3% sodiumthe rest being chlorine and trace chemicals; thus, 2.3g sodium is about 5.9g, or 2.7 ml of saltabout half a US <b>teaspoon.)</b> The American Heart Association recommends {{no more than}} 1.5g of sodium per day.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{and white}} {{granulated}} sugar are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates, respectively, with less than 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown sugar contains a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams (one <b>teaspoon),</b> would provide 15 calories and a negligible amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown sugar contains 5–10% molasses reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than white sugar.|$|E
5000|$|Frappé is in Greece {{available}} in three degrees of sweetness, {{determined by the}} amount of sugar used. These are: glykós (γλυκός, pronounced , [...] "sweet", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> of coffee and 4 <b>teaspoons</b> of sugar); métrios (μέτριος, [...] "medium", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> of coffee and 2 <b>teaspoons</b> of sugar); and a skétos (σκέτος, [...] "plain", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> of coffee and no sugar). All varieties may be served with evaporated milk (με γάλα [...] ), in which case they may be called in slang φραπόγαλο (frapógalo, , [...] "frappé-milk"), or without. Sometimes, frappé is served without any water (besides the water used in the foam) and milk is used instead. This variation is most commonly found in Cyprus.|$|R

5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million {{of them in a}} <b>teaspoon</b> of seawater—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and {{this is the most important}} mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.|$|E
5|$|A <b>teaspoon</b> of {{seawater}} {{contains about}} 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, and are in fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E
