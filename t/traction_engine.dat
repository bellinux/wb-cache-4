50|$|Aveling & Porter built {{several small}} {{shunting}} / tram locos {{based on their}} <b>traction</b> <b>engines.</b> They were basically <b>traction</b> <b>engines</b> with flanged wheels and no steering. Their advantages were that they were cheap to manufacture (and to design in the first place) {{and they could be}} operated with minimal training by someone who was familiar with <b>traction</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

25|$|Traction engines saw {{commercial}} {{use in a}} variety of roles between the mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries. Each role required a machine with a different set of characteristics, and the <b>traction</b> <b>engine</b> evolved into a number of different types to suit these different roles.|$|E
25|$|Related to {{the steam}} <b>traction</b> <b>engine,</b> the steam roller {{was used for}} road {{building}} and flattening ground. Typically designed with a single heavy roller (in practice, usually a pair of adjacent rollers) replacing the front wheels and axle, and smooth rear wheels without strakes.|$|E
25|$|Fred Dibnah of Bolton, England {{was known}} as a National Institution in Great Britain for the {{conservation}} of old traction engines and other steam engines.

25|$|The overtype had a {{steam engine}} mounted {{on top of}} a fire-tube boiler, in a similar manner to a <b>traction</b> <b>engine.</b> The front of an overtype steam wagon bears a close family {{resemblance}} to traction engines, and manufacturers who made both may well have been able to use some common parts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the age of}} steam, {{the steam}} calliope was {{particularly}} used on riverboats and in circuses. In both cases, a steam supply was already available for other purposes. Riverboats supplied steam from their propulsion boilers. Circus calliopes were sometimes installed in steam-drive carousels, or supplied with steam from a <b>traction</b> <b>engine.</b> The <b>traction</b> <b>engine</b> could also supply electric power for lighting, and tow the calliope in the circus parade, where it traditionally came last. Other circus calliopes were self-contained, mounted on a carved, painted and gilded wagon pulled by horses, but {{the presence of other}} steam boilers in the circus meant that fuel and expertise to run the boiler were readily available. Steam instruments often had keyboards made from brass. This was in part to resist the heat and moisture of the steam, but also for the golden shine of the highly polished keys.|$|E
25|$|The {{engine is}} an 8-{{cylinder}}, 145 litre Mirrlees Blackstone 8MB275T diesel <b>traction</b> <b>engine</b> (275mm cylinder diameter); the Mirrlees engine {{was one of}} the most fuel efficient available at the time (189g of fuel per kWhr), but relatively heavy. The engine was also successfully installed in marine applications such as small ships and passenger ferries. The low cylinder count for the rated power was expected to result in lower maintenance costs.|$|E

25|$|Other {{influences}} {{were existing}} vehicles {{which were the}} first to be referred to as traction engines such as the Boydell engines manufactured by various companies and those developed for road haulage by Bray. The first half of the 1860s was a period of great experimentation {{but by the end of}} the decade the standard form of the <b>traction</b> <b>engine</b> had evolved and would change little over the next sixty years.|$|E
25|$|From the 1950s, the 'preservation movement' {{started to}} build up as enthusiasts {{realised}} that traction engines {{were in danger of}} dying out. Many of the remaining engines were bought by enthusiasts, and restored to working order. <b>Traction</b> <b>engine</b> rallies began, initially as races between engine owners and their charges, later developing into the significant tourist attractions that take place in many locations each year. It has been estimated that over two thousand traction engines have been preserved.|$|E
25|$|Bidborough Mill is a four-storey brick tower mill, partly {{rendered}} with cement. It had a Kentish-style cap, four single patent sails and was winded by a fantail. The millstones {{were driven}} underdrift. A large pulley {{on the outside}} of the mill at first-floor level allowed the mill to be driven by belt from a <b>traction</b> <b>engine</b> or tractor, via a gear bolted to the underside of the Great Spur Wheel. A wheat cleaner and a flour dresser remained in the mill before conversion.|$|E

The average speed of the solution was , with additional steam <b>traction</b> <b>engine</b> assistance required up steep hills, and drag ropes and anchors on declines of over 1:6. The average rate of move was three huts a week, with a record set of one hut moved in a day, albeit having {{been placed on the}} railway trolley the previous night.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, {{before the}} {{establishment}} of a modern automotive industry in Britain, English engineer Bramah Joseph Diplock patented a four-wheel-drive system for a steam-powered <b>traction</b> <b>engine,</b> including four-wheel steering and three differentials, which was subsequently built. The development also incorporated Bramah's Pedrail wheel system in what {{was one of the first}} four-wheel-drive automobiles to display an intentional ability to travel on challenging road surfaces. It stemmed from Bramagh's previous idea of developing an engine that would reduce the amount of damage to public roads.|$|E
25|$|If {{the rail}} {{line has been}} built with {{sufficient}} vertical clearance then Double-stack rail transport can be used. Where lines are electrified with overhead electric wiring double stacking is normally not possible. The mandatory requirement to fit under overhead wire for the <b>traction</b> <b>engine</b> electrical power supply sets the height limit for the railcars to allow for trailer transport. This requires a certain low building height {{which led to a}} minor size of wheels for the railcars. Hence increased degradation of bogeys by wheel wear-out is a cost disadvantage for the system.|$|E
