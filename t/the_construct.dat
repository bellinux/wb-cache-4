5|$|The {{morphology}} of Proto-Central-Semitic shows {{significant changes}} compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and {{is much like}} in Classical Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (nominative), /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (but never in <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: nunation (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, mimation (final /-m/) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun is not in <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word urušalemim (Jerusalem) as given in an Egyptian transcription.|$|E
5|$|Homer is {{relaxing}} on a Saturday when Marge {{tells him}} {{that he should be}} doing work around the house and yard. Homer overcomes his reluctance and takes Bart to Mom & Pop Hardware to get some equipment. But while there, Homer sees a do it yourself barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work. Homer tries to install the pit, but bungles the job when he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement. He frantically tries to assemble the barbecue pit before the cement hardens, but only makes things worse. In the end, Homer is left with a mismatched collection of parts stuck in hardened cement, which angers him. He vents his rage on <b>the</b> <b>construct,</b> mangling it further. Later, Homer takes the results of his work back to the store for a refund, which he does not receive. On the way home, Homer loses control of the wagon containing the jumbled mess of concrete and bricks. It rolls down the highway and crashes into a woman's car, wrecking it. Homer flees the scene of the accident, but the woman tracks him down. It turns out that she is an artist named Astrid Weller (voiced by Isabella Rossellini), and sees Homer's handiwork as being a masterpiece of outsider art. Homer's exhibit goes to the Louvre: American Style museum and when Mr. Burns buys his work, Homer becomes a success.|$|E

40|$|This paper selects {{the road}} {{construction}} project on Putian city {{to analyze the}} wetland ecoenvironmental impact on tidal flat reclamation area by road construction project. Survey shows that: 1) the ecological security of <b>the</b> <b>constructed</b> wetland impacted by planned road is very important as the wetland is closely connected with marine; 2) The bird bio-diversity of <b>the</b> <b>constructed</b> wetland impacted by planned road is abundant; 3) the aquatic bio-diversity, the terrestrial plant bio-diversity and the vegetation bio-diversity of <b>the</b> <b>constructed</b> wetland impacted by planned road are lower. The {{results show that the}} planned road construction project will impact the eco-environment of <b>the</b> <b>constructed</b> wetland, although it crosses constructed wetland with bridges. The effects include: 1) Bird bio-diversity will be reduced by noise and landscape pollution; 2) Road construction and operation will impact the wetland ecological security, pollute marine outside the reclamation area; 3) Road construction and operation may bring exotic plant invasion to <b>the</b> <b>constructed</b> wetland. Studies suggest that the construction unit must take protection and compensation measures for birds and exotic plant invasion,and take risk prevention measures, to guarantee <b>the</b> <b>constructed</b> wetland ecological security.

25|$|David Spiegel {{also argued}} that Rind et al.'s {{suggestion}} of relabeling some forms of sexual encounters between adults and children/adolescents as adult-child (or adult-adolescent) sex is fundamentally flawed, because children cannot give meaningful consent to sexual relations with an adult. Some critics {{also argued that}} using value-neutral terminology would normalize CSA and that redefining terminology {{is not in the}} interest of the general public because it confuses the underlying moral issues. Rind et al. replied that <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> of consent used in their study was misinterpreted by critics; they only asserted that children/adolescents are capable of simple consent (willingness) as opposed to informed consent used in legal contexts, and used this as a variable in their study simply because it was used in the original studies - where it had predictive validity. Thus, they conclude that although <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> of willingness might be morally unacceptable, it is a scientifically valid term. A similar argument was put forward by Oellerich, who stated that considering all adult/non-adult sexual behavior as abusive and lacking consent can lead to bias in scientific research in the area, and that recognizing this distinction does not necessarily lead to considering adult/non-adult sexual interactions as morally permissible.|$|E
