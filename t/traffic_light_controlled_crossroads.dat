The <b>traffic</b> signal <b>lights</b> <b>control</b> system {{automatically}} {{controls the}} statues of the intersection <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> and dispatch the traffic vehicles normally that traffic scheduling {{is an important}} system {{and it is the}} most basic and most important tools in city <b>traffic</b> management. <b>Traffic</b> <b>lights</b> <b>control</b> system made by single chip microcomputer technology has a single working model, low reliability, slow speed, and it can't modify or upgrade online, which is difficult to adapt to changes at different times of the traffic flow.

40|$|Nowadays, <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> {{are using}} a fixed time as on-off light signal controller. However this system has many disadveantages, such as {{vehicles}} have to queue long time in certain road section (lane) at rush hour. As a consequence, it reguires a <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>control</b> system that can prioritize a more dense lane. Adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>control</b> detects the number of queues of vehicles on the lane. Sensors detect the vehicle queue’s length. There are three sensors that will detect queues’s length of vehicles on each lane. When the queue of vehicles reached the first sensor, the green light will be on longer 5 seconds compare to the normal traffic. When the queue of vehicles reaches the second sensor, the green light provide 10 seconds more compare to the normal traffic and if the queue of vehicles reaches the third sensor, the green light will be longer which is about 20 seconds compare. In this adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>control</b> system, there are two jam sensors installed {{in the middle of}} the intersection that will turn on all the red lights when there is an unexpected problems happened. This adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>control</b> system will provide the longest queuing time 92 seconds, when all sensors on all lanes active and the fastest time is 47 seconds which is the time when the normal system...|$|R

Less waiting time will result in less fuel consumption and fewer CO 2 emissions.

As AI and IoT technologies are becoming mature, in this paper, we propose to apply AIoT technologies for <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>control,</b> which is an essential component for intelligent transportation system, to improve the efficiency of smart city's road system. Specifically, various sensors such as surveillance cameras provide real-time information for intelligent <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>control</b> system to observe the states of both motorized traffic and non-motorized traffic. In this paper, we propose an intelligent <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>control</b> solution by using distributed multi-agent Q learning, considering the traffic information at the neighboring intersections as well as local motorized and non-motorized traffic, to improve the overall performance of the entire control system. By using the proposed multi-agent Q learning algorithm, our solution is targeting to optimize both the motorized and non-motorized traffic. In addition, we considered many constraints/rules for <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>control</b> in the real world, and integrate these constraints in the learning algorithm, which can facilitate the proposed solution to be deployed in real operational scenarios. We conducted numerical simulations for a real-world map with real-world traffic data.
