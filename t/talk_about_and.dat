[...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> <b>And</b> read it beside African works." [...] Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E

Beyoncé recorded the song in April 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper.

Stewart commented that the song was [...] "the only public statement that [...] ever made about marriage", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, {{even to the point}} of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that [...] "people are passionate about and want to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>and</b> debate". She stated that although [...] "Single Ladies" [...] is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.|$|E

2500|$|The {{loneliness}} in Orbison's {{songs that}} he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: [...] "I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else... Although if you grow up in West Texas, {{there are a lot}} of ways to be lonely." [...] His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated, [...] "He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>and</b> sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it." [...] Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: [...] "When [...] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry." [...] Peter Lehman, on the other hand, considered Orbison's theme of constant vulnerability an element of sexual masochism.|$|E
2500|$|Hofstadter's {{writing is}} {{characterized}} by an intense interaction between form and content, as exemplified by the 20 dialogues in GEB, many of which simultaneously <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>and</b> imitate strict musical forms used by Bach, such as canons and fugues. Most of Hofstadter's books feature some kind of structural alternation: in GEB between dialogues and chapters, in The Mind's I between selections and reflections, in Metamagical Themas between Chapters and Postscripts, and so forth. Both in his writing and in his teaching, Hofstadter stresses the concrete, constantly using examples and analogies, and avoids the abstract. Typical of the courses he teaches is his seminar [...] "Group Theory and Galois Theory Visualized", in which abstract mathematical ideas are rendered as concretely as possible. He puts great effort into making ideas clear and visual, and asserts that when he teaches, if his students do not understand something, it is never their fault but always his own.|$|E
