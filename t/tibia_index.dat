40|$|In 1996, the European Community {{released}} {{new regulations}} relating to frontal impact vehicle crash. One of the tests, the European offset crash, consists of crashing {{the car on}} a deformable barrier at 56 km/h with 40 % of the car impacting on the barrier. The regulations require the dummy injury parameters such as the HIC, chest deflection, chest acceleration, femur loads and the <b>tibia</b> <b>index</b> be lower than established values. MADYMO occupant simulations have been performed on a DaimlerChrysler vehicle in order to accurately predict the <b>tibia</b> <b>index.</b> Many parameters {{play a role in}} the <b>tibia</b> <b>index</b> evaluation such as the toe pan intrusion, the intrusion mode, the intrusion rate and the motion of the accelerator pedal.

40|$|Prediction of {{occupant}} injury using crash simulations {{can require}} numerical representation of {{materials that are}} not normally included within the structural model. Intuitively, {{it makes sense that}} the carpet would be required to predict the <b>tibia</b> <b>index</b> during frontal crash events; however, there appears to be little published on the topic. The <b>tibia</b> <b>index</b> is an injury criteria that needs to be predicted during IIHS frontal offset occupant simulations, but is also be looked at during unbelted FMVSS 208 simulations. Since carpet behaves quite differently during compressive and tensile loading, a numerical representation that can stably capture both regimes during occupant modelling is needed. This paper outlines a method to model the carpet using a specific meshing method and two material models. Shell elements in combination with the *PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY material model are used to model the tensile load carrying capacity of the carpet, while brick elements with the *MAT_FU_CHANG_FOAM material model are used to represent the compressibility of the carpet. Validation of using this modelling method with test data is presented, as well as the application of the carpet model in larger occupant models. KEYWORDS...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Bone marrow lesions (BMLs), common osteoarthritis-related {{magnetic}} resonance imaging findings, are associated with osteoarthritis progression and pain. However, there are no articles describing the use of 3 -dimensional quantitative assessments to explore the longitudinal relationship between BMLs and hyaline cartilage loss. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal descriptive characteristics of BMLs with a simple measurement of approximate BML volume, and describe the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between BML size and the extent of hyaline cartilage damage. Methods 107 participants with baseline and 24 -month follow-up {{magnetic resonance}} images from a clinical trial were included with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. An 'index' compartment was identified for each knee defined as the tibiofemoral compartment with greater disease severity. Subsequently, each knee was evaluated in four regions: <b>index</b> femur, <b>index</b> <b>tibia,</b> non-index femur, and non-index tibia. Approximate BML volume, the product of three linear measurements, was calculated for each BML within a region. Cartilage parameters in the <b>index</b> <b>tibia</b> and femur were measured based on manual segmentation. Results BML volume changes by region were: index femur (median [95 % confidence interval of the median]) 0. 1 cm 3 (- 0. 5 to 0. 9 cm 3), <b>index</b> <b>tibia</b> 0. 5 cm 3 (- 0. 3 to 1. 7 cm 3), non-index femur 0. 4 cm 3 (- 0. 2 to 1. 6 cm 3), and non-index tibia 0. 2 cm 3 (- 0. 1 to 1. 2 cm 3). Among 44 knees with full thickness cartilage loss, baseline tibia BML volume correlated with baseline tibia full thickness cartilage lesion area (r = 0. 63, p r = 0. 48 p Conclusions Many regions had no or small longitudinal changes in approximate BML volume but some knees experienced large changes. Baseline BML size was associated to longitudinal changes in area of full thickness cartilage loss. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pentapedal {{locomotion}} {{is the use}} of {{the tail}} as a fifth leg during the slow gait of kangaroos. Although previous studies have informally noted that some smaller species of macropodines do not engage in pentapedal locomotion, a systematic comparative analysis of tail use during slow gait across a wide range of species in this group has not been done. Analysis of relative movement of the pelvis, tail, and joint angles of the lower limbs during slow gait, using 2 D landmark techniques on video recordings, was carried out on 16 species of Macropodinae. We also compared the relative lengthening of the <b>tibia</b> using crural <b>index</b> (CI) to test whether hindlimb morphology was associated with pentapedal locomotion. Pentapedal locomotion was characterised by three features: the presence of the tail repositioning phase', the constant height of the pelvis and the stationary placement of the distal tail on the ground during the hindlimb swing phase. The mean CI of pentapedal species was significantly greater than that of non-pentapedal species (1. 71 versus 1. 36; P< 0. 001). This lends support to the hypothesis that the use of pentapedal locomotion is associated with the relative lengthening of the hindlimb, which in turn is associated with body size and habitat preference within the Macropodinae...|$|R
40|$|Injuries to {{the lower}} leg are still a {{frequent}} occurrence in frontal crashes and the most serious injuries {{have been found to}} be associated with the ankle region (pilon, calcaneal and talar neck fractures). These injuries are not only of a high severity, they are also associated with long term impairment, which contributes significantly to the societal cost associated with road traffic accidents. In order to reduce these injuries, the ability to determine the potential injury risk in legislative crash tests as well as the capability to assess the performance of proposed enhanced safety measures in the vehicle footwell region is essential. If this is to be achieved a biofidelic assessment tool with appropriate injury criteria is required. In Europe, the protection afforded against injury in frontal impacts is currently assessed by the Hybrid III dummy in an offset deformable barrier test. For the lower leg the <b>tibia</b> <b>index</b> injury criterion is used, however this relates primarily to the risk of tibia fracture and is not appropriate for the determination of the risk of injury to the ankle. This paper reports an overview of the biofidelity of existing dummy legs and the results of a series of PMHS tests which have recreated in the laboratory the more serious ankle injuries seen in real world crashes. The limitations of this work in terms of its application to an ankle injury criterion using peak tibia force for the Hybrid III are discussed and proposals for future work using a different approach are made in order to obtain these important criteria. The results show the significantly enhanced biofidelity of the THORLx lower leg compared to the Hybrid III leg. The paper concludes that the early introduction of a more biofidelic leg such as the THORLx lower extremity is essential if additional and reliable lower leg criteria are to be usefully implemented...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper {{introduces}} a FE modeling effort of the lower extremity of Thor dummy, Thor-Lx Hybrid III retrofit. The FE model consists of 9, 800 nodes and 8, 300 elements, of which 2, 900 are deformable solid elements. Three kinematic ankle joint elements are respectively used to represent dorsiflexion, inversion/eversion, and internal/external rotation of the foot. In addition to kinematic joint elements which represent the initial linear resistance developed by continuous joint stop, sliding contact interfaces are also defined between neoprene rubber and rotating center blocks for the subsequent non-linear stage. This two-stage joint definition then provides the precise description of ankle joint characteristics both in loading and unloading phases. The simulated outcomes of FE model have been validated for the performance of the ankle under different rotation motions and showed good agreement with both quasi-static and dynamic test results. The second part of the paper deals with a practical application of the FE Thor-Lx model. Numerical simulations of a NCAP frontal 40 % offset crash with a small size sedan are performed. A sub-structuring scheme for isolating the occupant compartment from the full car crash simulation is then adopted in order to facilitate the parametric study in which the various levels of structural deformations are attempted. The FE model of Hybrid III 50 th percentile male upper body including knees and femurs is utilized to mount Thor-Lx and Hybrid III leg for the quantitative and comparative analyses of both legs. The Hybrid III leg mostly produces higher <b>tibia</b> <b>index</b> values than Thor-Lx due to its simple ankle joint structure which might result in steep increase of moments {{at the end of the}} range of motion. The paper concludes with the improved capabilities of Thor-Lx for the injury risk assessment compared with Hybrid III leg...|$|E

"Safety is of {{paramount}} importance to manufacturers of roadway vehicles. Although {{in the past few years}} much progress has been made in the field of passenger safety in cars, there is still a strong need for the design of a more crashworthy vehicle in a frontal collision. Therefore, a vehicle crash test performance and how well the vehicle protects the front seat passengers in a head-on-collision is an essential part of the design of the vehicle. Over the past twelve years, the modeling of components and crash analysis of entire vehicles have become increasingly significant. In this thesis, a Ford Taurus model is analyzed in a frontal full-width and offset impact. This thesis describes the comparison of structural damage on a vehicle colliding with rigid pole as compared to the same vehicle model colliding with a barrier. The reason for selecting a rigid pole was to consider the worst-case scenario. The NHTSA has rules and regulations for barrier crashes; however it does not have any standards for pole crashes. In reality, there are many pole related vehicle crashes every year. Pole crashes involve vehicles colliding with utility and traffic light poles. Our purpose was to study the intrusion and injury values for the pole test and compare it with the barrier testing method of NHTSA. These simulations are carried under the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The simulations are obtained using LS-DYNA 3 D crash code. The rigid barrier, deformable barrier and pole are modeled in MSC/PATRAN. The accelerations at various points are recorded. The occupant compartment intrusions are compared between pole and barrier. Finally the responses of an occupant for the crash tests are studied in Mathematical Dynamical Models (MADYMO) by placing the dummy inside the dyna model. The dummy is placed in the car using extended coupling. A hybrid III 50 th percentile male dummy model is used to study the occupant responses. The finite element shoulder and lap belts are modeled in MADYMO. The head accelerations are plotted and the HIC values are calculated. For the crash test the occupant foot injury during compartment intrusion is evaluated by calculating the <b>tibia</b> <b>index</b> and tibia forces. The barrier and the pole test results are compared and the results showed that the intrusions and injury values are more severe in the case of pole impact and in off-set crash there is a severe leg injury...|$|E
40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the relationship between}} honey yield {{and some of the}} morphological characters, five queen-daughters from each of 30 queen-mothers were studied. The queen-mothers were selected randomly from the apiary of Research Center of Animal Science and Natural Resources in Isfahan Province. Summer honey yield was measured from the difference of honey comb before and after honey extraction while fall honey production was calculated from area of sealed honey combs. Morphological characters were recorded using a stereodissecting microscope fitted with a calibrated micrometer reticule according to Ruttnerâ€™s procedures. The mean of honey yield for a year was estimated to be 10. 05 kg. Phenotypic correlations between yearly honey production and summer and fall honey productions were estimated to be 0. 49 and 0. 88, respectively, while the correlation between summer and fall honey yields was low (0. 019). There were significant correlations between summer honey yield with cubital-b <b>index,</b> <b>tibia</b> length and forewing width (0. 28, 0. 27 and 0. 25, respectively). Also there were significant correlations between metatarus width with total and fall honey yields (0. 22 and 0. 23, respectively). Genetic correlations between metatarus length and cubital index with summer honey yield were negative (- 0. 75 and - 0. 45, respectively). It may be concluded that due to the high correlation between summer honey production and total honey yield, one could improve yearly honey production by selecting on the basis of summer yield of colonies. Among morphological traits, metatarus length, forewing width and cubital index could be used in the breeding plan in order to increase honey yield...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{supported}} indexing {{systems may}} be categorized in several ways. One classification scheme refers {{to them as}} statistical, syntactic, semantic or knowledge-based. While a system may emphasize one of these aspects, most systems actually combine {{two or more of}} these mechanisms to maximize system efficiency. Statistical systems can be based on counts of words or word stems, statistical association, and correlation techniques that assign weights to word locations or provide lexical disambiguation, calculations regarding the likelihood of word co-occurrences, clustering of word stems and transformations, or any other computational method used to identify pertinent terms. If words are counted, the ones of median frequency become candidate index terms. Syntactical systems stress grammar and identify parts of speech. Concepts found in designated grammatical combinations, such as noun phrases, generate the suggested terms. Semantic systems are concerned with the context sensitivity of words in text. The primary goal of this type of indexing is to identify without regard to syntax the subject matter and the context-bearing words in the text being indexed. Knowledge-based systems provide a conceptual network that goes past thesaurus or equivalent relationships to knowing (e. g., in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) system) that because the tibia is part of the leg, a document relating to injuries to the <b>tibia</b> should he <b>indexed</b> to LEG INJURIES, not the broader MeSH term INJURIES, or knowing that the term FEMALE should automatically be added when the term PREGNANCY is assigned, and also that the indexer should be prompted to add either HUMAN or ANIMAL. Another way of categorizing indexing systems is to identify them as producing either assigned- or derived-term indexes...|$|R

INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture are major public health issues for society; the burden for the affected individual is also high. It is unclear whether osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture are socially patterned. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyse social inequalities in osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture among the 3, 225 community-dwelling men and women, aged 59 - 73 years, who participated in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS), UK.

RESULTS: We found little strong or consistent evidence among men, or women, for social inequalities in prevalent or incident fracture, DXA bone mineral density, bone loss rates, or pQCT bone strength, with or without adjustment for age, anthropometry, lifestyle and clinical characteristics.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the effect of letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, on os-teogenesis of medullary bone in prelay pullets. Three hundred fifteen 95 -d-old ISA prelay pullets were used. After 10 d of adaptation in the cages, 15 pullets were selected randomly to collect the serum and bone sam-ples and the rest {{were randomly assigned to}} 2 groups with 3 replicates each. One group was control and the other was letrozole-treated, fed 0. 5 mg of letrozole per prelay pullet per day for 18 d. The serum and bone samples from these birds were collected during the ex-periment. Estradiol and testosterone in serum were as-sayed using commercial RIA kits. The serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), Ca, and inorganic P were measured by an automatic biochemistry analyzer with commercial kits. The periosteum perimeter, endosteum perimeter, corti-cal bone index, cortical width, cortical bone area, and cortical area ratios of tibia were measured by transmit-ted scanner and a computer-assisted image analyzer. Our results showed that relative to the control-fed pul-let, letrozole-fed pullets had reduced serum estrogen (57. 5 %), Ca (33. 2 %), ALP (33. 6 %), and TRAP (24. 2 %) and that values of serum estrogen, Ca, estrogen recep-tor expression, tibia radiographic density, serum ALP, and TRAP were all reduced (P < 0. 05) and the serum P had a degressive trend in letrozole-treated groups. By contrast, the serum androgen and the <b>tibia</b> cortical bone <b>index</b> values were higher in the letrozole-treated group (P < 0. 05). No differences were observed in the periosteum perimeter, endosteum perimeter, cortical width, and cortical area ratios of tibia between the 2 groups. The results showed that letrozole can inhibit the development of bone and medullary osteogenesis by inhibiting the synthesis of estrogen and its receptor in prelay pullets.
