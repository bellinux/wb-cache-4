The four women soon fell out, vying for control over him; Canto CXIII: alluded to it: [...] "Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell." [...] Pound {{was in love with}} Spann, seeing in her his last chance for love and youth. He wrote about her in Canto CXIII: [...] "The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / And to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill." [...] Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to America.|$|E
500|$|The Incredibles as {{a concept}} dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during {{a period in which}} he tried to break into film. Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life. During this time, Bird had inked a {{production}} deal with Warner Bros. Animation and {{was in the process of}} directing his first feature, The Iron Giant. Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life. He stated, [...] "Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie." [...] After the box office failure of The Iron Giant, Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{airing of}} the De Vries {{programme}} on Dutch television, Beth Twitty {{adhered to the}} position that the tapes represented the way events transpired and told the New York Post that she believed her daughter might still be alive if Van der Sloot had called for help. She contended that Van der Sloot had dumped Holloway's body, possibly alive, into the Caribbean. Twitty also alleged that the person Van der Sloot supposedly called that evening was his father, Paulus, who, according to Holloway, [...] "orchestrated what to do next." [...] She and Dave Holloway alleged that Van der Sloot was receiving [...] "special legal favors." [...] After the court decision not to rearrest Van der Sloot was affirmed, Twitty stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> I do take comfort in, his life is a living hell," [...] later adding, [...] "I'd be good with a Midnight Express prison anywhere for Joran." ...|$|E

500|$|Gillian Anderson was {{particularly}} {{pleased with the}} episode showing a different side of Scully and said, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great idea. I personally was going through a dark period at the time, and I wanted to explore Scully's dark side. For some reason, Glen and Jim were on the same wavelength that week. Afterward, a lot of people told me that on that episode I was so 'unlike' Scully or that 'it showed my range'. I told them I thought they were wrong. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> I did here was out of character for Scully. The only thing different is that the audience hadn't seen it before." [...] Initially, Anderson called up Morgan and asked him to write a story wherein Scully [...] "fall hard" [...] for another man, which leads to an [...] "intense kind of romantic or passionate relationship". Morgan obliged and wrote a scene where Scully enjoys a passionate night with Jerse. This was later removed from the script by series creator Chris Carter, the only time in Glen Morgan's tenure on the show where a scene of his was removed by Carter. Morgan later noted [...] "I think Chris thought that I was monkeying around with him, but I really wasn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Twitty also {{alleged that}} the person who van der Sloot {{supposedly}} called that evening was his father Paul, who according to Holloway [...] "orchestrated what to do next".

After the court decision not to rearrest Van der Sloot was affirmed, Twitty stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> I do take comfort in, his life is a living hell", later adding, [...] "I'd be good with a Midnight Express prison anywhere for Joran." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zyscovich {{thinks that}} Plan Z can kickstart a {{cultural}} {{change in the}} city. The project could join two other proposed infrastructure projects, a linear park called the Underline and the Ludlam Trail, a rails-to-trail multi-use path. “I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we are presenting is a concept large enough to contribute to creating a network,” the architect says. “If we can implement Plan Z, the Underline, and the Ludlam Trail, {{we are going to}} have thousands of users that will then become the advocacy group to demand more bicycle infrastructure.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Quoting William Placher, Domestication of Transcendence, Louisville, 1996, (p.66) : [...] "In {{the famous}} extra-Calvinisticum, Calvin insisted, against Luther, that {{something}} of God's infinity remained uncaptureable in God's finite self-revelation in Jesus Christ...this does not imply, I <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> {{we know of}} God is false, but only that, while true {{as far as it}} goes, it is necessarily limited to our finite capacities. Calvin's real concern here seems to have been to preserve the reality of the Incarnation, which appeared to him threatened by a view in which even Christ's humanity took on divine infinity and thereby ceased to be really human."

2500|$|Cosmologist Brian Swimme {{said in a}} 1997 interview: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> E. O. Wilson {{is trying}} to suggest is that to be fully human, a person has to see that life has a heroic dimension... I think for the scientist, and for other people, it's a {{question}} of, [...] "Is the universe valuable? Is it sacred? Is it holy? Or is the human agenda all that matters?" [...] I just don't think we're that stupid to continue {{in a way that}} continues to destroy. I'm hopeful that the Epic of Evolution will be yet another strategy in our culture that will lead our consciousness out of a very tight, human-centered materialism." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I look at myself objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> success I may have achieved through life is largely {{due to the fact that}} I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Garbo was humiliated by the {{negative}} reviews of Two-Faced Woman, {{she did not}} at first intend to retire. But her films depended on the European market and when it fell through with the war, finding a vehicle was problematic for MGM. She signed a one-picture deal in 1942 to make The Girl from Leningrad but the project quickly dissolved. She still thought she would continue when {{the war was over}} though she was ambivalent and indecisive about returning to the screen. Salka Viertel, Garbo's close friend and collaborator, said in 1945 [...] "Greta is impatient to work. But on the other side, she's afraid of it." [...] Garbo also worried about her age. [...] "Time leaves traces on our small faces and bodies. It's not the same anymore, being able to pull it off." [...] George Cukor, director of Two-Faced Woman, and often blamed for its failure, said [...] "People often glibly say that the failure of Two-Faced Woman finished Garbo's career. That's a grotesque oversimplification. It certainly threw her, but I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> really happened was that she just gave up. She didn’t want to go on." ...|$|E
