25|$|The most {{effective}} clutter reduction technique is pulse-Doppler radar. Doppler separates clutter from {{aircraft and spacecraft}} using a frequency spectrum, so individual signals can be separated from multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences. This requires a coherent transmitter. Another technique uses a moving target indicator that subtracts <b>the</b> <b>receive</b> signal from two successive pulses using phase to reduce signals from slow moving objects. This can be adapted for systems that lack a coherent transmitter, such as time-domain pulse-amplitude radar.|$|E
25|$|The {{modulation}} index riding on <b>the</b> <b>receive</b> signal {{is proportional to}} the time delay between the radar and the reflector. The amount of that frequency shift becomes greater with greater time delay. The measure of the amount of frequency shift is directly proportional to the distance travelled. That distance can be displayed on an instrument, and it may also be available via the transponder. This signal processing is similar to that used in speed detecting Doppler radar. Example systems using this approach are AZUSA, MISTRAM, and UDOP.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>receiving</b> antenna is also {{typically}} directional, {{and when}} properly oriented collects {{more power than}} an isotropic antenna would; as a consequence, <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> antenna gain (in decibels from isotropic, dBi) adds to <b>the</b> <b>received</b> power.|$|R
25|$|Precoding is multi-stream beamforming, in {{the narrowest}} definition. In more general terms, it is {{considered}} to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter. In (single-stream) beamforming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input. The benefits of beamforming are to increase the received signal gain – by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively – and to reduce the multipath fading effect. In line-of-sight propagation, beamforming results in a well-defined directional pattern. However, conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks, which are mainly characterized by multipath propagation. When the receiver has multiple antennas, the transmit beamforming cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of <b>the</b> <b>receive</b> antennas, and precoding with multiple streams is often beneficial. Note that precoding requires knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver.|$|E

2500|$|If a {{clock is}} sent in {{parallel}} with data, that clock {{can be used to}} sample the data. [...] Because the clock must be received and amplified before it can drive the flip-flops which sample the data, there will be a finite, and process-, temperature-, and voltage-dependent delay between the detected clock edge and the received data window. [...] This delay limits the frequency at which data can be sent. [...] One way of eliminating this delay is to include a deskew PLL on <b>the</b> <b>receive</b> side, so that the clock at each data flip-flop is phase-matched to the received clock. In that type of application, a special form of a PLL called a delay-locked loop (DLL) is frequently used.|$|E

That impulse introduces FM noise that degrades clutter performance.|$|E
