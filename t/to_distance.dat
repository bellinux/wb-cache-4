5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> themselves from Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but {{made no mention of}} Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E

40|$|Tremendous {{land use}} change has {{occurred}} in Lagos in recent times. Modelling urban systems now extends beyond the use of geographic information systems models. This research therefore presents a loose coupling of geographic information systems and artificial neural network for simulating land use change in Lagos. The experiment is based on three land use epochs of Lagos: 1963 - 1978, 1978 - 1984, and 1984 - 2000. Twelve salient land use explanatory variables (<b>distance</b> <b>to</b> water, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> residential structures, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> industrial and commercial centres, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> major roads, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> railway, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> Lagos Island, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> international airport, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> international seaport, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> University of Lagos, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> Lagos State University, income potential, and population potential) are used for the simulation. Using the Kappa statistic, {{the result of the}} simulation in terms of the order of best-fit of the reference data is: 1978 - 1984, 1984 - 2000, and 1963 - 1978. An evaluation of the simulation using the receiver operating characteristics corroborates the Kappa estimates. A non black-box experiment using a one-neuron neural network to assess the performance of the spatial independent variables used for the simulation indicates that for all three epochs <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> residential structures has the highest impact in the simulation while population potential has the lowest impact. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cultivated land {{transition}} and its driving mechanism are the hotspots among studies on land use change. In this study, we constructed a framework {{to study the}} driving mechanism of cultivated land transition from the quantitative perspective. Based on the vector data of land use in 1990, 2000 and 2009 of Yantai Proper, Shandong Province China, 11 explanatory variables were chosen from two aspects: the elevation, slope, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> major water area and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> minor water area, which presented physical factors; cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> district center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> town center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> city expansion center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> major roads, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> city roads, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> county roads and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> rural roads, which presented the socio-economic factors. Combined with spatial analysis tools and Logistic regression analysis model, we construct Logistic regression analyses with four objectives that were urban construction land, rural residential land, orchard and other lands. The results show that, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> district center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> town center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> city expansion center and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> city roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into urban construction land. The main explained factors on the transition of cultivated land into rural residential land are slope, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> town center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> county roads and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> rural roads. Slope, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> minor water area, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> town center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> county roads and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> rural roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into orchard land.

5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are {{complicated by the fact that}} his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E

5|$|Established {{during the}} revival of the Indies film industry, Union {{released}} its first film, Kedok Ketawa, in July 1940.

This continued after Saeroen left for Star Film in 1941, with Union's final two productions emphasising realism.
