I've shaved a thousand men with that axe and that's <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> drew blood. These officials get me a little nervous." ...|$|E

500|$|Gielgud {{was in the}} Oxford {{company in}} January and February 1924, from October 1924 {{to the end of}} January 1925, and in August 1925. He played a wide range of parts in {{classics}} and modern plays, greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process. The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in The Cherry Orchard, his first experience of Chekhov: [...] "It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> went out on stage feeling that perhaps, after all, I could really be an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Monkhouse as Space Navigator Brad Newman. Monkhouse, {{an actor}} in such films as Carry On Sergeant (1958), would later host the British game show The Golden Shot between 1967 and 1972. He first {{approached}} Gerry Anderson for permission to film a comedy sketch based on Stingray, but ended up agreeing to replace Alfred Marks, who had withdrawn from the film due to a fee dispute, as Newman. Monkhouse recalled the conversation: [...] " [...] said, 'How much would you charge for the job?' I said, 'Gerry, I'd do it for nothing.' And that was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard the phrase, 'The price is right'." [...] He affected an American accent for his parts in the film.|$|E
500|$|After {{his brother}} died in 1929, Pond married Katherine N. de Nancrede, who was 47 years old, at a {{ceremony}} in Ann Arbor. [...] Pond said at the time, [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> did it, and I thought I ought to be pardoned because of my youth." [...] Pond was also an amateur acrobat and remained a physical fitness buff all of his life. [...] At {{the time of his}} wedding in 1929, the Associated Press reported that he is [...] "almost as well known for his present athletic agility as for his architectural accomplishments. A part of his daily routine is to turn handsprings and flipflops and do other strenuous exercises." [...] He drew applause when, on his 80th birthday, he grabbed his bare knees with both hands and performed a backflip. [...] A photograph of Pond's feat was published in Life magazine in June 1937.|$|E

500|$|In September, {{the album}} entered Billboards album charts; the highest {{position}} Freewheelin reached was number 22, but it eventually came to sell one {{million copies in}} the US. Dylan himself came to acknowledge Freewheelin as the album that marked {{the start of his}} success. During his dispute with Albert Grossman, Dylan stated in a deposition: [...] "Although I didn't know it at the time, the second album was destined to become a great success because it was to include 'Blowin' in the Wind'." [...] Besides [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Girl from the North Country", [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" [...] and [...] "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" [...] have all been acclaimed as masterpieces, and they have been mainstays of Dylan's performing repertory to the present day. The album's balance between serious subject matter and levity, earnest finger-pointing songs and surreal jokes captured a wide audience, including The Beatles, who were on the cusp of global success. John Lennon recalled: [...] "In Paris in 1964 was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard Dylan at all. Paul got the record (The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan) from a French DJ. For three weeks in Paris we didn't stop playing it. We all went potty about Dylan." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with Iwata, {{he was surprised}} about the game's reception outside Japan, which retrogamers have named {{it as one of}} their favorite and most memorable 8-bit titles. He said: [...] "It’s kind of funny that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> really had any sense of the game’s success was about 10 years following the original release of Blaster Master, when a young staff member from the U.S. office said something to me like, 'You’d definitely have become a super famous game designer if you were an American.'" [...] Alex Neuse, creator of the Bit.Trip series, reminisced his memories of playing Blaster Master as a child. He acknowledged that the game was a clone of Metroid that featured a tank that could jump and a corny storyline, but he said it was all [...] "presented {{in a way that it}} felt meaningful". He added that the game's music convinced him [...] "that video game music could be high-quality, memorable, and evocative". 1UP.com listed the game as the 11th best NES game of all time in its [...] "Top 25 NES Games" [...] list; the 1UP.com staff said the game was [...] "an action game that worked like a mishmash of every NES game before it", noting the expansive map like in Metroid. Paste magazine ranked Blaster Master as the 2nd greatest NES game of all time, behind The Legend of Zelda; they cited the tank's additional abilities as a main reason behind its ranking.|$|E
2500|$|Fortney {{was raised}} in Ashtabula, Ohio, where he grew-up on rock music. In high school, Fortney was {{interested}} in baseball until the audience reaction he got playing John Mellencamp’s [...] "Small Town" [...] for the school talent show made an impression on him. Although he had played guitar for a while, he didn’t start writing music until he wrote a song for a friend’s funeral. He says of it, “That was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> put words and melody together. I realized {{in the future that}} was what I was going to be.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 2003 book According to the Rolling Stones, Watts said: [...] "'Sympathy' was one {{of those}} sort of songs where we tried everything. [...] <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard the song was when Mick was playing it at the front door of a house I lived at in Sussex... He played it entirely on his own... and it was fantastic. We had a go at loads of {{different}} ways of playing it; in the end I just played a jazz Latin feel in the style of Kenny Clarke would have played on 'A Night in Tunisia' – not the actual rhythm he played, but the same styling." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "This is {{the sixth}} one I have seen here at San Quentin, and I {{have to say}} this was very different. The most notable thing was that Williams had {{supporters}} {{at the back of the}} room… Mrs. Becnel was among them, I understand. We could see them, and throughout the last part of the execution—or preparing him when he was still conscious, they gave what looked like black power salutes several times to him, one man and two women. And most strikingly at the end of the execution, as those three were heading out, they yelled, 'The State of California just killed an innocent man!' [...] which is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard any outburst in the death chamber there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tatum drew {{inspiration}} from the pianists James P. Johnson and Fats Waller, who exemplified the stride piano style, and from the more [...] "modern" [...] Earl Hines, six years Tatum's senior. [...] Tatum identified Waller as his main influence, but according to pianist Teddy Wilson and saxophonist Eddie Barefield, [...] "Art Tatum's favorite jazz piano player was Earl Hines. He used to buy all of Earl's records and would improvise on them. He'd play the record but he'd improvise over what Earl was doing ... 'course, when you heard Art play you didn't hear nothing of anybody but Art. But he got his ideas from Earl's style of playing – but Earl never knew that." [...] A major event in his meteoric rise to success was his appearance at a cutting contest in 1933 at Morgan's bar in New York City that included Waller, Johnson and Willie [...] "The Lion" [...] Smith. [...] Standard contest pieces included Johnson's [...] "Harlem Strut" [...] and [...] "Carolina Shout", and Waller's [...] "Handful of Keys". Tatum performed his arrangements of [...] "Tea for Two" [...] and [...] "Tiger Rag", in a performance that {{was considered to be}} the last word in stride piano. [...] Johnson, reminiscing about Tatum's debut afterward, simply said, [...] "When Tatum played Tea For Two that night I guess that was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard it really played." [...] Tatum's debut was historic because he outplayed the elite competition and heralded the demise of the stride era. [...] He was not challenged further until stride specialist Donald Lambert initiated a half-serious rivalry with him.|$|E
