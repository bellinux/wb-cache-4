A few days later, the Carthage Convention called for establishment of a militia that would force them out if they {{failed to meet the}} May deadline. To <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> this deadline and to get an early start on the trek to the Great Basin, the Latter-day Saints began leaving Nauvoo in February 1846.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} coin {{shortages}} beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> demand. The early 1960s {{was a time}} of increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money if the price of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but government stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E

25|$|Once girls enter school, patriarchal {{norms and}} values work against norms {{and values of}} modern {{education}} which aims to provide equal education for boys and girls. Parents may allow girls to attend school but still expect them to fulfill traditional duties rather than giving then time to do homework or arrive at school before school gates are shut. Girls are expected to participate in class contrary to their training for non-participation. If girls <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> school norms for participation they are subjected to psychological violence reinforcing patriarchal norms. Girls may also be subjected to violence and abuse at home if they act on new school norms contrary to tradition. This clash of norms continues {{on the way to}} and from school with older boys and adult men seeing adolescent girls as unprotected by marriage. Consequently, girls experience physical and sexual violence and are at risk of abduction. Girls' attempts to cope with the educational system may increase their risk of violence and sexual abuse. Girl students were some of the main perpetrators of violence against other girls and they could act as go-betweens for boys in the hope that boys would favor them.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{work began}} on 2May 1936.

To <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the deadline, construction work was carried out both day and night. As the journey would take place entirely underground {{it was decided to}} line the wider, original tunnel with illuminated displays showing scenes from around the world. This led to the line becoming semi-officially known as the [...] "World Scenic Railway".|$|E
500|$|Poor {{families}} {{are much more}} constrained in their economic ability to [...] "buy back" [...] lost time through the market. Instead of buying market substitutes, they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> their needs without spending money by taking care of children instead of hiring help, {{taking care of the}} sick instead of taking them to the hospital, and making food from scratch instead of buying pre-made food. The way that poor families deal with the time debt is for the main caretaker to intensify the time that they spend working, by doing multiple jobs at once instead of doing one job at a time. When people increase the intensity of their work to compensate for their lack of time to finish everything that needs to get done, called work intensity, many health problems occur.|$|E

2500|$|The {{consensus}} view among guidance advisors {{is that it}} is a {{good idea}} to visit colleges, preferably when college is in session and not during a summer break, with a chance to meet an actual student in the form of a tour guide, and taking notes for reference later when applying. Sometimes a college will waive the application fee based on the college visit. A benefit is seeing a school as it really is—not just glossy pictures from a brochure or a promotional video from a website. Another suggested that students should ask themselves, when visiting a particular college: [...] "can I see myself here"? Reporter Jenna Johnson in the Washington Post suggested that students contact a professor in an area of interest at the college before visiting, and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with them briefly or sit in on one of their classes. Reporter Brennan Barnard in the New York Times recommended that student visitors should ask good questions (by avoiding factual questions better answered by the college's website), and ask for complimentary passes for dining or free food. Barnard recommends going beyond the usual tour to ask random strangers about life on campus and reading the student newspaper. He recommends arranging to speak with a professor in the department of interest as well as athletic coaches and music directors, possibly by emailing them in advance of the visit, to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> them even briefly. A follow-up [...] "thank you" [...] note to the host is a good idea (avoid texting abbreviations.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 1838, Morazán's liberal {{forces were}} back in Guatemala after a peasant revolt ousted Guatemalan {{governor}} Mariano Galvez. Morazán and his Guatemalan ally José Francisco Barrundia invaded Guatemalan soil and when they arrived in San Sur, they summarily executed Chúa Álvarez, general Rafael Carrera's father-in-law, for Carrera {{was the leader of}} the revolt. Morazán's soldiers placed Álvarez' head on top of a spike as a warning to Carrera's followers. Upon learning the news, both Carrera and his wife, Petrona Álvarez -who had left Guatemala City to face Morazán and were in Mataquescuintla- promised to avenge Chúa even after Morazán's death. [...] The liberals sent several envoys to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with Carrera, but {{he did not want to}} talk to them -especially Barrundia, who was told that he should not try to come in to talk to Carrera if he wanted to remain alive. [...] After this, Morazán began a strong offensive, destroying every single town in his path, stealing their few belongings and forcing Carrera militants to hide in the mountains.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, {{the site}} of the Le Rosey campus was chosen by the school's founder, Paul-Emile Carnal, [...] "a lover of nature, history and the countryside". The Le Rosey campus at Rolle is {{situated}} adjacent to the famous Lake Geneva. In 1911, the founder passed the ownership of Le Rosey to his son, Henri-Paul Carnal. In 1917, the school began to go to Gstaad in the German-speaking Canton of Berne for the winter months to escape the dense fog that settles in on Lake Geneva. In 1947, the third generation of directors, Louis Johannot and Helen Schaub, assumed ownership of Le Rosey. Under the same ownership, in 1967, Le Rosey admitted girls {{for the first time and}} opened a separate girls' campus. In 1980, the current owners, Philippe and Anne Gudin de la Sablonnière, became the fourth generation of Directors at Le Rosey. Louis Johannot, in an interview with Life Magazine in 1965, made a comment that received considerable attention: [...] "The only reason I always <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> and know the parents better is because it helps me to forgive their children." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{being interviewed}} by Haaretz in May 2011, Ehud Shani said that [...] "during the last visit by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to Israel a month ago, {{we were told}} that the delay may be shorter than they {{originally}} thought. In any case, I am not nervous about it. This [...] may actually serve our interests. I favor an aircraft with as many Israeli-made systems as possible." [...] He also said that [...] "we will see how they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> our requests over this time. In the original timetable, it was argued that there was no time [...] We will hear their conclusions and I expect a dialogue with the Americans over the new timetable and the changes." [...] The idea that the Air Force will, in the meantime, acquire another squadron of F-15s {{in order to meet the}} gap that will be created [...] "is not relevant," [...] he said. The delay may mean that in the future there will be more aircraft coming to Israel in a shorter period of time, and the numbers procured may rise from 20 to 30. Israeli defense officials said that the problems with the F-35 were 'much worse than we had been told' and that a high-level delegation would be sent to the United States to determine the extent of the problems.|$|E
