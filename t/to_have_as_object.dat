40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{movement}} to introduce a classroom liberal education component into technical courses up to Ordinary National Certificate arose from the rethinking {{of the role of}} education under the influence of psychology and mass democracy after the First World War. The application and institutionalisation of the resulting concepts is traced, through the Spens Report, the 1944 Education Act and subsequent pamphlets, the Crowther Report, and Government White Papers and Pamphlets, together with related City and Guilds and individual developments. The present rationale of the subject, and the courses based on it, are shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>objects</b> the enlargement of socio-cultural awareness and the inculcation of desired social attitudes rather that the acquisition of specialist knowledge. In the chosen sample area, North-East England (excluding the North Riding of Yorkshire), the influence of national directives on social studies teaching is shown in some Authorities <b>to</b> <b>have</b> resulted in a coherent liberal education policy, but otherwise <b>to</b> <b>have</b> led only <b>to</b> a series of revisions of technical courses, dependent upon L. E. A. size and wealth, local cultural and educational tradition, and geographical position. Effective teaching at college level is found to depend upon both Individual staff contributions and Local Authority policy, and especially therefore upon appointments and departmental status policy. The effectiveness of this teaching is evaluated by means of tests of cultural span and social attitude, completed by a group of 112 control and 38 % experimental students from five colleges, covering all levels of student and methods of teaching. Results show that social studies teaching is not in itself a significant factor in effective scoring, but enhances other significant factors, by increasing the scores of the better students, in particular, Technicians and O. N. C. students. Social studies teaching itself varies significantly in effectiveness with college, method, and student interest...|$|R

40|$|Taking William Munny and Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven as short-hand for America, {{the present}} article solves what is {{probably}} ‘the’ critical impasse in Unforgiven studies: the degree of complexity of William Munny, and his ascription to the natural or supernatural realm. The article makes the natural interpretation academically binding, and makes a case for complexity in simplicity. To do so, it first makes conscious, and then relocates, critics’ unreflective use of an Aristotelian distinction in their interpretation of English Bob, Little Bill, and William Munny. This relocation allows crucial parallelisms to surface between English Bob and Little Bill, which in turn explain why these characters <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fail <b>as</b> <b>objects</b> of myth. The article then teases out a natural interpretation of William Munny by re-interpreting both Munny’s meeting with Beauchamp and his final dialogue with Little Bill, and explains why this natural allegiance differs from previous natural interpretations of Munny...|$|R
5000|$|Richard Easterlin, an {{economist}} who has researched {{economic growth in}} the United States, explains the growth pattern of American population in the 20th century through fertility rate fluctuations and the decreasing mortality rate. Easterlin <b>has</b> attempted <b>to</b> explain the cause of the Baby Boom and Baby Bust through the [...] "relative income" [...] theory. The [...] "relative income" [...] theory suggests that couples choose <b>to</b> <b>have</b> children based on a couple's ratio of potential earning power and the desire to obtain material objects. This ratio depends on the economic stability of the country in which they live and how people are raised to value material objects. The [...] "relative income" [...] theory explains the Baby Boom by suggesting that the late 1940s and 1950s brought low desires <b>to</b> <b>have</b> material <b>objects,</b> <b>as</b> a result of the Great Depression and WWII, as well as huge job opportunities, because of it being a post war period. These two factors gave rise to a high relative income, which encouraged high fertility. Following this period, the next generation had a greater desire for material objects; however, an economic slowdown in the United States made jobs harder to acquire. This resulted in lower fertility rates, causing the Baby Bust.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} the {{phenomenon}} of capturing environment and experiences into digital collections. Digital collecting {{can be seen as}} a cross-section of today’s situation where physical and digital are intertwined and where the fast life pace makes many people capture the current moments to be remembered later. With digital equipment it’s more possible to collect things in various ways and also to describe unseen things such as memories, smells and feelings. Many things that we used <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> concrete, tangible <b>objects</b> <b>have</b> become digital. For example a butterfly collection can be done without taking the lives of butterflies but instead by capturing virtual butterflies or displaying representations of them online. Collecting is a multidimensional activity and there is a fine line between collecting and hoarding, for instance. Collecting has a long tradition and now it has stepped into an era where it gets new forms by using new media possibilities such as digital devices, applications, platforms and social communities. In this thesis I am exploring the individual level collecting done by today’s capturing possibilities, especially turning the physical environment and experiences into digital forms. I am using my own digital photography collections and other cases as examples along with the related literature and a survey I implemented. After realizing that I had collections in the first place, I wanted to know why I had been creating them and what digital collecting was about. That was the starting point for this thesis topic. My research questions are: What is digital collecting about? Why people digitally collect things? According to my research, digitally collecting one’s environment and experiences relates to wide range of phenomena such as self-expression, comprehension and memory. Digital collections reflect collector’s thinking and identity and the contemporary culture. The results suggest that the motives for digitally collecting derive more from the collector’s inner life than from the actual things collected. The findings help to understand better the contemporary collecting and its links to our modern lives and it also offers viewpoints for further research...|$|R
