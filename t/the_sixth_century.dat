5|$|The {{figure of}} St. Ninian, {{traditionally}} credited with introducing Christianity {{to the region}} of south-west Scotland, is now widely regarded as a later construct {{and may have been}} the result of scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian. The church known as Candida Casa was dedicated to him at Whithorn in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century</b> and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan, which would extend an influence across the Strathclyde region. However, it is clear that Christianity had already gained a foothold across what is now southern Scotland before <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Armenian {{churches were}} {{constructed}} during that period, including the St. James Monastery. The latter was last expanded in the mid-12th century. An Armenian scriptorium was in operation by the mid-fifth century.

5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century,</b> Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E

5|$|In the Book of Nehemiah, the Ashdodites seem to {{represent}} the whole nation of the Philistines in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century</b> BCE, the speech of Ashdod (which half of the children from mixed families are described as adopting) would simply be the general Philistine dialect.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century,</b> Caesarius of Arles {{taught that}} the whole glory of the Jewish Sabbath had been {{transferred}} to Sunday and that Christians must keep Sunday {{in the same way}} as the Jews were commanded to keep the Sabbath. The Council of Orléans in 538 reprobated this tendency, to apply the law of the Jewish Sabbath to the observance of the Christian Sunday, as Jewish and non-Christian.|$|E
5|$|The myth of Eshmun {{was related}} by <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century</b> Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius and ninth century Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius.

She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he emasculated himself with an axe and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of heaven.|$|E

5|$|The {{reputation}} of Seric iron of South India (wootz steel) amongst {{the rest of}} the world grew considerably. Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel.

5|$|The {{roots of}} Shakta Tantrism are unclear, {{probably}} ancient and {{independent of the}} Vedic tradition of Hinduism. The interaction between Vedic and Tantric traditions trace back to at least <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century,</b> and the surge in Tantra tradition developments during the late medieval period, states Geoffrey Samuel, were a means to confront and cope with Islamic invasions and political instability in and after 14th-century CE.|$|E
5|$|Education in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} education within the modern borders of Scotland, between {{the departure of the}} Romans from Britain in the fifth century, until the establishment of the Renaissance late fifteenth century and early sixteenth century. Few sources on Scottish education survived the Medieval era. In the early Middle Ages, Scotland was an oral society, with verbal rather than literary education. Though there are indications of a Gaelic education system similar to that of Ireland, few details are known. The establishment of Christianity from <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century</b> brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools.|$|E

5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers {{were highly}} skilled, {{and before the}} end of <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century</b> they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as {{at the mouth of the}} Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. It may well be that this wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.|$|E
5|$|Settlement of Kent by {{continental}} peoples, primarily Jutes, {{was complete}} {{by the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century.</b> Eadbald's father, Æthelberht, probably came to the throne in about 589 or 590, though the chronology of his reign is very difficult to determine accurately. Æthelberht was recorded by the early chronicler Bede as having overlordship, or imperium, over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. This dominance led to wealth in the form of tribute, and Kent was a powerful kingdom at the time of Æthelberht's death in 616, with trade well-established with the European mainland.|$|E
5|$|The Life is {{difficult}} to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes facts and traditions known to him and transfers them to the saint himself. Thus there was in the twelfth century a holy relic at Llanbadarn {{believed to have been}} Padarn's staff, Cyrwen, which could well be the origin of the place name Llangorwen. The writer obviously knew very little indeed about Padarn, except that he was seen as a contemporary of David and Teilo, who certainly lived during <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of Christianity from <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century</b> brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories {{of knowledge and}} education, often running schools and providing a small, educated and overwhelmingly male, elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society. Literary life revolved around the contemplation of texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks {{were part of the}} mainstream of European Christian culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{occupation}} at Gedi has been extrapolated {{as a result}} of excavations and historical documents pertaining to its material culture, architecture, and the known history of trade linking the Swahili Coast with the regions adjoining the Indian Ocean. The settlement of Gedi occurred long after the emergence of the earliest settlements along the Swahili Coast with the intensification of trade in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century.</b> The earliest evidence for occupation at Gedi is a grave marker that has been radiocarbon dated to between 1041 to 1278, placing the original settlement of the site sometime in the eleventh or early twelfth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Buddhism during <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century</b> was {{a catalyst for}} large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese Tang and Sui Dynasties led to {{the foundation of the}} first permanent capital in Nara. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design. The {{introduction of}} the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland from <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century</b> {{led to the}} construction of basic masonry-built churches, beginning on the west coast and islands. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings. However, from the eighth century, more sophisticated buildings emerged. Early Romanesque ashlar masonry produced block-built stone buildings, like the eleventh century round tower at Brechin Cathedral and the square towers of Dunblane Cathedral and The Church of St Rule.|$|E
5|$|The islands were {{incorporated}} into the Maurya Empire under Emperor Ashoka of Magadha in the third century BCE. The empire's patronage made the islands a centre of Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture. Buddhist monks, scholars, and artists created the artwork, inscriptions, and sculpture of the Kanheri Caves in the mid third century BCE and Mahakali Caves. After {{the decline of the}} Maurya Empire around 185 BCE, these islands fell to the Satavahanas. The port of Sopara (present-day Nala Sopara) was an important trading centre during the first century BCE, with trade contacts with Rome. The islands were known as Heptanesia (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer Ptolemy in 150CE. After the end of the Satvahana rule in 250 CE, the Abhiras of Western Maharashtra and Vakatakas of Vidarbha held dominion over the islands. The Abhiras ruled for 167 years, till around 417 CE. The Kalachuris of Central India ruled the islands during the fifth century, which were then acquired by the Mauryas of Konkan in the sixth and early part of the seventh century. The Mauryas were feudatories of Kalachuris, and the Jogeshwari Caves were constructed during their regime between 520 and 525. The Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes visited Kalyan (near Mumbai) during 530–550. The Elephanta Caves also dates back to <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century.</b> Christianity arrived in the islands during <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century,</b> when the Nestorian Church made its presence in India. The Mauryan presence ended when the Chalukyas of Badami in Karnataka under Pulakeshin II invaded the islands in 610. Dantidurga of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty of Karnataka conquered the islands during 749–750.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>century</b> {{was a period of}} {{political}} disorder in Arabia and communication routes were no longer secure. Religious divisions were an important cause of the crisis. Judaism became the dominant religion in Yemen while Christianity took root in the Persian Gulf area. In line with broader trends of the ancient world, the region witnessed a decline in the practice of polytheistic cults and a growing interest in a more spiritual form of religion. While many were reluctant to convert to a foreign faith, those faiths provided intellectual and spiritual reference points.|$|E
