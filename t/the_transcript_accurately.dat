40|$|As a novel {{class of}} noncoding RNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been {{verified}} {{to be associated}} with various diseases. As large scale transcripts are generated every year, it is significant to accurately and quickly identify lncRNAs from thousands of assembled <b>transcripts.</b> To <b>accurately</b> discover new lncRNAs, we develop a classification tool of random forest (RF) named LncRNApred based on a new hybrid feature. This hybrid feature set includes three new proposed features, which are MaxORF, RMaxORF and SNR. LncRNApred is effective for classifying lncRNAs and protein coding <b>transcripts</b> <b>accurately</b> and quickly. Moreover,our RF model only requests the training using data on human coding and non-coding transcripts. Other species can also be predicted by using LncRNApred. The result shows that our method is more effective compared with the Coding Potential Calculate (CPC). The web server of LncRNApred is available for free at [URL]...|$|R

3000|$|Every {{known or}} {{predicted}} form of transcript {{of a gene}} will be assigned a systematic identifier {{that will be the}} same as the locus identifier except that the letter ‘g’ for gene will be replaced by letter ‘t’ for transcript, to be added as a suffix following the two-digit chromosome identifier. This naming convention will ensure consistency in the gene’s locus ID and its transcript ID. For example, <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> Os 05 t 0000300 is transcribed by the locus Os 05 g 0000300 representing gene 3 on chromosome 5. Sometimes <b>the</b> nascent <b>transcript</b> undergoes alternative splicing.

By default, <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> ID of <b>the</b> very first <b>transcript</b> (or <b>the</b> only <b>transcript</b> identified) will always have number “- 01 ” suffixed to <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> ID. For example, <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> ID of <b>the</b> locus Os 05 g 0000300, for which there are no known splice variants, will be Os 05 t 0000300 - 01. If there is a later report suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> from this locus undergoes alternative splicing, such that three alternative forms are created, if any one of the three forms matches <b>the</b> original <b>transcript,</b> it would retain <b>the</b> original <b>transcript</b> ID and two additional IDs would be generated, Os 05 t 0000300 - 02 and Os 05 t 0000300 - 03. Assigning the number series to the splice variants will depend on the precedence of identification, the submission to GenBank or possibly the size of the cDNA. Any additional alternative forms are numbered sequentially.|$|R

40|$|Transcription of the clpP-clpX operon of Escherichia coli {{leads to}} the {{production}} of two different sizes of transcripts. In log phase, the level of <b>the</b> longer <b>transcript</b> is higher than the level of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript.</b> Soon after <b>the</b> onset of carbon starvation, the level of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> increases significantly, and the level of <b>the</b> longer <b>transcript</b> decreases. <b>The</b> longer <b>transcript</b> consists of <b>the</b> entire clpP-clpX operon, whereas <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> contains <b>the</b> entire clpP gene but none of the clpX coding sequence. The RpoH protein is required for the increase in the level of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> during carbon starvation. Primer extension experiments suggest that there is increased usage of the ς 32 -dependent promoter of the clpP-clpX operon within 15 min after the start of carbon starvation. Expression of the clpP-clpX operon from the promoters upstream of the clpP gene decreases to a very low level by 20 min after the onset of carbon starvation. Various pieces of evidence suggest, though they do not conclusively prove, that production of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> may involve premature termination of <b>the</b> longer <b>transcript.</b> <b>The</b> half-life of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> is much less than that of <b>the</b> longer <b>transcript</b> during carbon starvation.
