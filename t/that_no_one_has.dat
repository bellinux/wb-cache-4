I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying.

5|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, {{journalist}} Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), {{co-owner of}} Millennium magazine, {{has lost a}} libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family's compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing {{a list of names}} and numbers <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> been able to decipher.|$|E

25|$|Atiyah {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures.

In Rosie's room, they confront Terry about being at the lake when Rosie died. As Stan and Mitch enter the room, Terry apologizes, asking them to not be mad at her.|$|E

When the kids arrive at Shannon's party, they see <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> arrived. Shannon laments about how his bullying ways have caused no one he knows to actually like him, and the kids sympathize with the bully. However, Shannon then reveals that there are several kids at the party, who come out from hiding spots and ridicule Brendon, Jason, and Melissa for being swindled. As their retaliation, the children steal Shannon's lawn gnome and depart from the party.|$|E
25|$|On her {{way down}} the yellow brick road, Dorothy attends a banquet held by a Munchkin man named Boq. The next day, Dorothy frees the Scarecrow from the pole on which he is hanging, applies oil from a can to the rusted {{connections}} of the Tin Woodman, and meets the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion wants courage, so Dorothy encourages the three of them to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald City to ask for help from the Wizard. After several adventures, the travelers enter the gates of the Emerald City and meet the Guardian of the Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes from being blinded by the city's brilliance. Each one is called to see the Wizard. The Wizard appears to Dorothy as a giant head on a marble throne, the Scarecrow as a lovely lady in silk gauze, the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and the Cowardly Lion as a ball of fire. The Wizard agrees to help them all if they kill the Wicked Witch of the West, who rules over Oz's Winkie Country. The Guardian warns them <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> ever managed to defeat the witch.|$|E

500|$|After {{speaking}} about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on {{to tell us that}} the word 'molecule' is a modern word. [...] He states, [...] "it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. [...] The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry." [...] We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases.

She relates how she is gazing dreamily at the moon when she is [...] "hopelessly sad" [...] and lonely. Playing the koto (a kind of horizontal harp) on a cool evening makes her even more miserable. This section of the diary also contains a short description of her room containing two bookcases, one with books that her husband had placed there and <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> touched since, the other with [...] "old poems and romances", likely referring to her own works. This scene is set on an unknown date in Kankō 6 (1009).

500|$|Richard Schickel of Time {{magazine}} praised Zorro as {{a summer}} blockbuster which paid tribute to the classical Hollywood swashbuckler films. [...] "The action in this movie, most of which {{takes the form of}} spectacular stunt work performed by real, as opposed to digitized, people," [...] Schickel stated, [...] "is motivated by simple, powerful emotions of an old-fashioned and rather melodramatic nature." [...] Zorro exceeded Roger Ebert's expectations, who was surprised by the screenplay's display of traditional film craftsmanship. [...] "It's a reminder of the time when stunts and special effects were integrated into stories, {{rather than the other way}} around." [...] Ebert later called The Mask of Zorro [...] "probably the best Zorro movie ever made." [...] Despite giving credit to Anthony Hopkins for his masculine portrayal of an older Zorro, Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, found that the actor's [...] "performance presents a slight problem: The film asks us to believe <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> figured out that Zorro and his real-life persona are the same person, even though they are the only guys in Mexico who talk with a British accent." ...|$|E
