30|$|Another {{approach}} (used herein) <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{take advantage}} of the clear disparity in zonal scales, between PSSR and upwelling, to extract the contributions <b>to</b> ‘PSSR.’ <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> if estimates of ‘PSSR’ are the same, when measured by ionosondes spaced in longitude, the estimate of ‘PSSR’ <b>is</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of PSSR-only, and <b>that</b> an upwelling <b>was</b> not present. But, if the estimates are different, the smaller of the two <b>is</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of PSSR and the difference in estimates would likely <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of upwelling growth.|$|R

As Harriet Guest explains, [...] "the theme Barbauld's essays of the 1790s repeatedly return <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{of the constitution}} of the public as a religious, civic, and national body, and she is always concerned to emphasize the continuity between the rights of private individuals and those of the public defined in capaciously inclusive terms." ...|$|E
500|$|Heffron also {{clashed with}} the Federal Government's {{imposition}} of National Emergency Services procedures, most notably over the imposition of brownouts {{for the city of}} Sydney. In the Legislative Assembly in November 1942, Heffron denounced the advisers of the Federal Government who continued to maintain the brown-out as an essential defence measure: [...] "The only conclusion I can come <b>to,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the brown-out was born of a form of panic when Japan entered the war and it has continued because of a few brass hats will not look at the facts and the evidence of the fighting men, but persist in sticking to their first conclusion. The position, therefore, is ludicrous." [...] Heffron later affirmed that the brown-out was completely unnecessary as a black-out, with short notice given, was a more effective and safer defensive measure.|$|E

Notyhawa said that Cosatu had never objected to the trial of Shaik, but {{he went on to}} say that [...] "what we object <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the judge erred in implicating a person who has not been part of the proceedings and has been denied his right to respond in a proper forum".|$|E

2500|$|If M and N are {{compact and}} connected, then any {{submersion}} f:M→N {{gives rise to}} a fiber bundle in the sense that there is a fiber space F diffeomorphic to each of the fibers such that (E,B,π,F)=(M,N,ƒ,F) is a fiber bundle. [...] (Surjectivity of ƒ follows by the assumptions already given in this case.) More generally, the assumption of compactness can be relaxed if the submersion ƒ:M→N is assumed to be a surjective proper map, meaning that ƒ−1(K) is compact for every compact subset K of N.

2500|$|In L'Art Vivant Salmon {{quotes a}} {{statement}} made by Metzinger {{in defense of}} himself and Picasso: 'Before us, no painter had the desire to feel the objects he painted' [...] (Jean Metzinger). What Metzinger probably refers <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> unlike the artists before them, he and Picasso move around their models and subjects, capturing not just one vision but many, capturing the full essence of their subject matter, {{if not all of}} its characteristics and properties. [...] "Palper", or to 'palpate the objects' is more than just 'feel', it is to examine or explore by touch, a method of examination in which the artist feels size or shape or firmness or location of something, it implies volume, it involves a sense, just as taste. This text can also be found in André Salmon on French Modern Art, translated as: [...] "We have never had the curiosity to touch the objects we were painting." [...] This translation of Metzinger's statement is obviously erroneous, and in fact says almost the exactly opposite of what was meant (and indeed what was said) in French.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Ewbank {{was seen}} as a humble coach who had {{a good sense of humor}} and tried to stay out of the spotlight. He could also be harsh with his players, however. Before the 1958 {{championship}} game, he gave a speech telling his stars they needed to improve and had barely made the team. Unitas, he said, was obtained [...] "with a seventy-five-cent phone call" [...] and Ameche wasn't liked or wanted. Ewbank was not universally liked by his players. Second-string running back Jack Call later said the team won [...] "in spite of, not because of" [...] Ewbank. Other players saw him as overly easygoing, saying that while he was able to build teams up, he became too relaxed once he reached the top. [...] Hall of Famer Raymond Berry stated in his book All the Moves I Had [...] "What it amounts <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Ewbank knew exactly what he wanted his team to do and how to get them to do it well..

2500|$|There are {{problems}} on both extremes {{of the gun}} transmission debate. Its proponents emphasize the older history of gunpowder evolution as attested by historical records and archaeological samples in China, its less obviously militarily focused name as [...] "fire medicine," [...] the Mongol role as a catalyst in disseminating gunpowder technology, and criticizes the scant or absent evidence of prior experimentation with gunpowder in Europe for non-military purposes {{before the arrival of}} the gun. However, there are still several blanks in the history of a gun transmission theory and the questions they raise which its proponents have been unable to answer. The rapid spread of guns across Eurasia, only 50 years from China to Europe, with non-existent evidence of its route from one extreme of the continent to the other, remains a mystery. Other Chinese inventions such as the compass, paper, and printing took centuries to reach Europe, with events such as the Battle of Talas as perhaps a possible takeoff point for discussion. No such event exists on record for either gunpowder or the gun. There is simply no clear route of transmission, and while the Mongols are often pointed to as the likeliest vector, Timothy May points out that [...] "there is no concrete evidence that the Mongols used gunpowder weapons on a regular basis outside of China." [...] A conclusion most military historians in the transmission camp have come <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the rapid diffusion of gunpowder and the gun is probably best explained by its clear military applications.|$|E
2500|$|The widest hall vaulted by the Romans {{was that}} of the throne room in the palace of Diocletian on the Palatine Hill, and this had the {{enormous}} span of , its thrust being counteracted by other halls on either side with buttresses outside. In provincial towns and {{in other parts of the}} Roman Empire, where the material pozzolana was not procurable, the Romans had to trust to their mortar as a cementing medium, but this, though excellent of its kind, was not of sufficient cohesive strength to allow of the erection of vaults of more than about [...] span, which were generally built in rubble masonry. There still exist in Asia Minor and Syria some vaulted halls, generally attached to thermae, which are carried on walls of great thickness. There were many varieties of the Roman vault, whether continuous or intersected, such as those employed over the corridors on the Colosseum and the theatre of Marcellus, but in these cases the springing of the vault was above the summit of the arches of the main front, so that there was no intersection; on the other hand, over the corridors were either elliptical or semicircular, or over the staircases rising vaults, all of which were more difficult to construct; there were also numerous solutions of vault over circular halls, of which that of the Pantheon is the most important example, having a diameter of , and over the hemicycles, which were sometimes of great size; that known as Canopus in Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli had a diameter of , and was vaulted over with a series of ribs, between which were alternating rampant flat and semicircular webs and cells; in the same villa and in Rome were octagonal halls with various other combinations of vault. Another type of vault not yet referred <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the Tabularium arcade where the Cloister vault was employed. Fig. 3 compared with fig. 2 will show the difference; in the former the angles of intersection are inset, and in the latter they are groins with projecting angles at the base, which die away at the summit.|$|E
