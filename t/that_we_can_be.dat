He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, {{and that we can}} say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E

500|$|Scott's story {{concept was}} {{partially}} inspired by Chariots of the Gods?, Erich von Däniken's work about {{the theory of}} ancient astronauts which hypothesizes that life on Earth was created by aliens. Scott said, [...] "NASA and the Vatican agree that [...] almost mathematically impossible <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{where we are today}} without there being a little help along the way... That's what we're looking at , at some of Erich von Däniken's ideas of how did we humans come about." [...] Spaihts originated the idea that David, the android, is like humans but {{does not want to be}} anything like them, eschewing a common theme in [...] "robotic storytelling" [...] such as Blade Runner. He also developed the theme that while the human crew is searching for their creators, David is already among its creators. Scott liked these ideas and further explored them in Lindelof's rewrite. For Shaw, Lindelof felt it was important that she was distinct from Aliens Ripley, to avoid inevitable comparisons between the two characters. In Spaihts's draft, Shaw was directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants to seek out potentially dangerous knowledge. As with David, Lindelof expanded this facet of the character during his rewrites. He spent approximately eight months developing the script, finishing in March 2011 as filming began.|$|E
500|$|On 31 August 2012, Jesy Nelson told Jenn Selby of Glamour that Little Mix's third single will be {{completely}} different from their previous two, {{and that it will}} show a different side to the group that has never been seen before. Leigh-Anne Pinnock went on to reveal to Selby that the song will serve as the album's second single, in turn resulting in the group's debut single [...] "Cannonball" [...] not featuring on the album altogether. Pinnock added that the second single was a pending choice between two songs at that time, and that the group were leaning towards the [...] "darker" [...] and [...] "different" [...] track. Speaking to Selby, Pinnock reasoned the group's choice: [...] "It's just a chance for us to show <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> really serious and really show off our vocals well. This one's really about the vocals." [...] On 11 September 2012, details of the song and its title were revealed when music industry insiders were played a preview of [...] "DNA" [...] during the Sony Music Entertainment Conference Day. [...] Following the conference, Chart Show TV described the song as an [...] "electro ballad" [...] on Twitter. Before promptly deleting the tweet, they added that the song is [...] "very cool" [...] and has [...] "big vocals". On 27 September 2012, [...] announced that [...] "DNA" [...] will be sent to radio in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2012.

This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
