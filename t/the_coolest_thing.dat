It {{served as an}} official video for the song, after an unofficial version was released by DreamWorks as a [...] "temporary video" [...] that was played on MTV2. In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained {{the process of making}} the music video, and said, [...] "We shot the video at this really cool place in Crenshaw, in L.A., that was a bowling alley upstairs and a roller rink downstairs. It had this really weird, retro vibe to it. When they were setting up the different sets, we'd have to stop every 10 seconds because a bowling league would walk in.

[...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's <b>the</b> <b>coolest</b> <b>thing</b> about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us."

500|$|The {{song was}} {{nominated}} for Best Metal Performance at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed {{that he did not}} [...] "even care", and noted that Slayer fans [...] "don't give a shit and that's {{the most important thing to}} me".

[...] David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: [...] "A character like Snape, where you're not really sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think <b>the</b> <b>coolest</b> <b>thing</b> you can do with an audience is deny them a little bit of information." [...] Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself.
