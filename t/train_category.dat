40|$|Our aim in {{this article}} is to {{elaborate}} the role of training in representational change theory (RCT), particularly in terms of Ohlsson’s (2011) spread of activation explanation (named redistribution theory), and to develop novel training manipulations that effect the re-encoding mechanism proposed by RCT (Ohlsson, 1992). Two experiments are reported that aim to help solve verbal insight problems and to enable some constraint to be relaxed. In Experiment 1, participants were trained to use heuristics to solve unseen problems from the same category that shared the same representational obstacle, namely, ambiguous word and ambiguous name problems. Concurrent verbal protocols were collected and analyzed in terms of the hypotheses proposed by participants. Training improved solution rate of unseen problems from the <b>trained</b> <b>categories</b> and, as expected, positive transfer was specific to the <b>trained</b> <b>category</b> of problem. Analysis of the incorrect hypotheses proposed during problem solving provided supplementary evidence of the effectiveness of training at inducing representation change. In Experiment 2, a similar approach to training was developed to help solve functional fixedness problems. Solution rate increased with training, although transfer was specific to the <b>trained</b> <b>category</b> of problem. Theoretical and methodological issues are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} {{regions in the}} left and right hemisphere language network that were altered in terms of the underlying neural activation and effective connectivity subsequent to language rehabilitation. Eight persons with chronic post-stroke aphasia and eight normal controls participated in the current study. Patients received a 10 week semantic feature-based rehabilitation program to improve their skills. Therapy was provided on atypical examples of one <b>trained</b> <b>category</b> while two control categories were monitored; the categories were counterbalanced across patients. In each fMRI session, two experimental tasks were conducted: (a) picture naming and (b) semantic feature verification of <b>trained</b> and untrained <b>categories.</b> Analysis of treatment effect sizes revealed that all patients showed greater improvements on the <b>trained</b> <b>category</b> relative to untrained categories. Results from this study show remarkable patterns of consistency despite the inherent variability in lesion size and activation patterns across patients. Across patients, activation that emerged as a function of rehabilitation on the <b>trained</b> <b>category</b> included bilateral IFG, bilateral SFG, LMFG, and LPCG for picture naming; and bilateral IFG, bilateral MFG, left SFG, and bilateral MTG for semantic feature verification. Analysis of effective connectivity using Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) indicated that LIFG was the consistently significantly modulated region after rehabilitation across participants. These results indicate that language networks in patients with aphasia resemble normal language control networks and this similarity is accentuated by rehabilitation...|$|R
50|$|From 1892 a new <b>train</b> <b>category</b> with {{especially}} comfortable express coaches appeared: the Durchgangszug or D-Zug (plural: D-Züge).
