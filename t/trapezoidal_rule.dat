40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} generic scheme to {{construct}} corrected <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>rules</b> with spectral accuracy for integral operators with weakly singular kernels in arbitrary dimensions. We {{assume that the}} kernel factorization of the form, K = αφ+ K ̃ with smooth α and K̃, is available so that the operations on the smooth factors can be performed accurately {{on the basis of}} standard Fourier spectral methods. To achieve high precision results, our approach utilizes the exact evaluation of the Fourier coefficients of the radial singularity φ, which can be obtained in arbitrary dimensions by the singularity isolation/truncation described in this article. We provide a complete set of formulae for singularities of the type: log(r) and r−ν. Convergence analysis shows that the constructed quadrature rules exhibit almost identical rate of convergence to the trape-zoidal rule applied for non-singular integrands. Especially, for smooth data, the corrected <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>rules</b> converge super-algebraically...|$|R

Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature is essentially a change of variables to cast an arbitrary integral in terms of integrals of periodic functions where the Euler–Maclaurin approach is very accurate (in that particular case the Euler–Maclaurin formula {{takes the form of}} a discrete cosine transform).
