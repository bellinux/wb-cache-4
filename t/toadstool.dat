5|$|Super Mario World is a side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). An instalment in the Super Mario series, it was first released in Japan on 21 November 1990, in North America on 13 August 1991 and in Europe on 11 April 1992. The story follows Mario's quest to save Princess <b>Toadstool</b> and Dinosaur Land from series antagonist Bowser and his children, the Koopalings. Gameplay is similar to previous entries in the series, with players controlling Mario or his brother Luigi {{through a series of}} levels to stop Bowser. The game also introduces Yoshi, a dinosaur who can eat enemies with his tongue.|$|E
5|$|The red-and-white spotted <b>toadstool</b> is {{a common}} image in many aspects of popular culture. Garden {{ornaments}} and children's picture books depicting gnomes and fairies, such as the Smurfs, often show fly agarics used as seats, or homes. Fly agarics have been featured in paintings since the Renaissance, albeit in a subtle manner. In the Victorian era they became more visible, becoming the main topic of some fairy paintings. Two {{of the most famous}} uses of the mushroom are in the video game series Super Mario Bros. (specifically two of the power-up items and the platforms in several stages), and the dancing mushroom sequence in the 1940 Disney film Fantasia.|$|E

5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of <b>toadstool,</b> called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she {{caught a whiff of}} her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E
5|$|In May 1991, {{following}} an unsuccessful attempt with Sony {{to develop a}} CD-ROM-based add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo signed a deal with Philips to develop the aforementioned add-on. However, witnessing the poor reception of the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo no longer considered the add-on profitable, and the project was scrapped entirely. As part of dissolving the deal, Nintendo gave Philips the license to use five of their characters, including Mario, Luigi and Princess <b>Toadstool,</b> to be featured in their games for the CD-i. The games were given little time to be developed and little funding, and Nintendo only gave cursory input. Philips used the characters to create games for the CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on {{the look of the}} characters. Apart from Hotel Mario, the Mario characters were intended to be used in Super Mario's Wacky Worlds, but the game was cancelled with only some prototype versions being programmed. While Wacky Worlds was planned as a CD-i adaptation of the side-scrolling platformer Super Mario World, Hotel Mario was made into a puzzle game in which stage areas were restricted to a single screen. Unlike the Legend of Zelda-related games, the game was not developed by a third-party company, but by Philips' development team Fantasy Factory.|$|E
