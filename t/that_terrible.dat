25|$|Since the oil industry's {{earliest}} days, {{discovery and}} production have periodically taken a human toll. For Canada's petroleum industry, the worst incident was the Ocean Ranger disaster of 1982. In <b>that</b> <b>terrible</b> tragedy the Ocean Ranger, a semi-submersible offshore rig drilling the Hibernia J-34 delineation well, {{went down in}} a winter storm. The vessel took 84 hands into the frigid sea; none survived. This memory was fresh in everyone's mind when the field's production system was being negotiated.|$|E

Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I {{came to realize that}} in the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.|$|E

500|$|As most of Balzac's biographers point out, Hańska {{was not in}} {{the room}} when he died. Robb says she [...] "must have retired for a moment", while André Maurois notes that she had been by his side for weeks with no way of knowing how long it would continue, and [...] "there was nothing to be done". Vincent Cronin {{attributes}} her absence to the nature of their relationship: [...] "From the first day by the lakeside at Neuchâtel theirs had been a Romantic love and Eve wanted to guard it to the end against <b>that</b> <b>terrible</b> taint of corruption." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Well of Loneliness, war work {{provides}} a publicly acceptable role for inverted women. The narrative voice asks that their contributions {{not be forgotten}} and predicts {{that they will not}} go back into hiding: [...] "a battalion was formed in those terrible years that would never again be completely disbanded". This military metaphor continues later in the novel when inverts in postwar Paris are repeatedly referred to as a [...] "miserable army". Hall invokes the image of the shell-shocked soldier to depict inverts as psychologically damaged by their outcast status: [...] "for bombs do not trouble the nerves of the invert, but rather <b>that</b> <b>terrible</b> silent bombardment from the batteries of God's good people".|$|E
500|$|The {{baritone}} soloist {{sings the}} first section alone. On a bass in an ostinato rhythm of two quarter notes, a rest and the upbeat to the next two quarters, he sings the text [...] "" [...] (Free me, Lord, from eternal death on <b>that</b> <b>terrible</b> day when the heavens will move and the earth, {{when you come to}} judge the world with fire.), embarking on a melody of wide range, with some sharp leaps. The text is continued by the choir in four parts in homophony: [...] "" [...] (I am trembling). In more motion, [...] "" [...] (day of wrath) is expressed by fortissimo chords, giving way to the prayer for rest in the same motion, but piano, with a crescendo on [...] "", but suddenly softening on a last [...] "". Then the choir repeats the opening statement of the baritone fully in unison. Soloist, then choir, end the movement softly, repeating [...] "".|$|E

500|$|As death succeeded death, Dickinson {{found her}} world upended. In {{the fall of}} 1884, she wrote that [...] "The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come." [...] That summer she had seen [...] "a great {{darkness}} coming" [...] and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious {{late into the night}} and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston. She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: [...] "Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily". On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson {{died at the age of}} 55. Austin wrote in his diary that [...] "the day was awful ... she ceased to breathe <b>that</b> <b>terrible</b> breathing just before the [...] whistle sounded for six." [...] Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as Bright's disease and its duration as two and a half years.|$|E
500|$|By waiting one day, the Coalition {{lost the}} advantage. [...] As the Coalition {{assaulted}} the southern suburbs of the city, Napoleon {{arrived from the}} north and west with the Guard and Marmont's VI Corps, covering [...] in forced marches over three days. The leading elements of Klenau's corps were placed on the army's left flank, separated from the main body by the Weißeritz, flooded after almost a week of rain. Marshal Joachim Murat took [...] advantage of this isolation and inflicted heavy losses on the Austrians. A French participant observed, separating Klenau's corps from the Austrian army, Murat [...] "hurl himself upon it {{at the head of the}} carabineers and cuirassiers. His movement was decisive; Klenau could not resist <b>that</b> <b>terrible</b> charge. Nearly all his battalions were compelled to lay down their arms, and two other divisions of infantry shared their fate." [...] Murat captured intact a division of five infantry regiments (15,000 men) under command of Lieutenant Field Marshal Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Felsö-Kubiny, plus 15 of their regimental and company colors. [...] As the left wing disintegrated, the French swarmed over the flank; the right wing was also driven back, and the entire force had to withdraw.|$|E
500|$|According to Lupton, [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] is Angelou's {{most famous}} poem. Lupton {{has argued that}} [...] "Angelou's {{ultimate}} greatness will be attributed" [...] to the poem, and that Angelou's [...] "theatrical" [...] performance of it, using skills she learned as an actor and speaker, marked {{a return to the}} African-American oral tradition of speakers such as Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. British reporter Kate Kellaway compared Angelou's appearance as she read the poem at Clinton's inauguration with the eight-year-old child in Caged Bird, noting that the coats she wore in both occasions were similar: [...] "She looked magnificent, sternly theatrical with an unsmiling bow mouth. She wore a coat with brass buttons, a strange reminder of the eight-year-old Maya Angelou who stood in a courtroom, terrified {{at the sight of the}} man who had raped her". Gillespie stated regarding Kellaway's observations: [...] "But standing tall on the steps of the Capitol, she was light-years removed from <b>that</b> <b>terrible</b> time, and America was no longer an 'unfriendly place.' Her poem 'On the Pulse of Morning' was a soaring call for peace, justice, and harmony. Capturing the hope embodied in the human spirit, it was a solemn and joyful reminder that all things are possible. She wished us 'Good morning' in her poem, and one felt as if a new day was truly dawning." ...|$|E

500|$|So many Southern Rhodesians were {{withdrawn}} from the trenches for officer training that in mid-1915 Brady appealed through the Salisbury and Bulawayo presses for more volunteers to replace {{those who had been}} commissioned. A platoon of Southern Rhodesians with the 2nd Battalion, KRRC took part in the [...] "big push" [...] of 1 July 1916, {{the first day of the}} Battle of the Somme, charging German positions elsewhere on the line early that morning. There were 90 Rhodesians on the eve of the attack and only 10 alive and unwounded afterwards. On the Somme battlefield itself, Rhodesians were among those at Delville Wood, which began on 14 July. This was the South African 1st Infantry Brigade's first engagement, and some of the colonials blacked up and imitated Zulu battle cries and war dances. Despite suffering casualties of catastrophic proportions—about 80% of the brigade's personnel were killed, wounded or captured—they took the Wood and held it as ordered until they were relieved on 20 July. By the time of its withdrawal, the South African Brigade, originally numbering 3,155 (123 officers and 3,032 other ranks), had been reduced to 19 officers and 600 men. Delville Wood was later described by Sir BH Liddell Hart as [...] "the bloodiest battle hell of 1916". [...] "God knows I never wish to see such horrible sights again," [...] a Southern Rhodesian veteran of the battle wrote home; [...] "at times I wished it would come fast, anything to get out of <b>that</b> <b>terrible</b> death-trap and murderous place." ...|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{had been}} given nutritive enemas; on September 11, he took some broth by mouth. [...] When it seemed to do him good, the {{following}} morning they allowed him toast, coffee, and chicken broth. [...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and most doctors left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing {{on the walls of}} his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, and the First Lady sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put an arm around her. [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime <b>that</b> <b>terrible</b> evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears standing in his eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus."

A French participant observed, [...] "Murat, who commanded {{this part of the}} French line, showed himself more brilliant than ever; for after forcing the defile of Cotta, he turned and cut off from the Austrian army Klenau's corps, hurling himself upon it {{at the head of the}} carabineers and cuirassiers.

2500|$|During {{their long}} arduous return journeys, the Indians had {{received}} mixed treatment {{from the local}} Burmese; some Indians were treated with kindness, {{in keeping with the}} prevailing Buddhist culture of Burma; however, others were subjected to extortion, robbery, and violence. [...] Between 10,000 and 50,000 Indians refugees, according to one estimate, died from various causes before they reached India. [...] By May 1942, some 300,000 refugees had passed through Bengal en route to their homes elsewhere in India. [...] Back home, the refugees told tales of atrocities inflicted by the Burmese and of the viciousness of the Japanese attack. Rumor and panic took hold in many parts of India. In Assam, through which the injured British and Indian soldiers had returned in May, fears arose of a Japanese attack. In the United Provinces, where in Gorakhpur district alone, some 30,000 refugees had returned by the end of 1942, the Governor publicly lamented the low morale. In Bengal, a witness before the Government-appointed Famine Commission, recalled later in 1945, that the refugees were [...] "bringing hair-raising stories of atrocities and sufferings. The natural effect of all that on the people of Bengal was to make them feel that the times were extremely uncertain and <b>that</b> <b>terrible</b> things might happen." [...] The civil administration in Bengal was also affected: the embittered and humiliated colonial administrators from Singapore and Burma who had appeared in Calcutta in early 1942 further unnerved the already demoralized and shorthanded colonial Indian civil service. [...] In many parts of India, the Japanese victory had created the public perception that the British Raj was vulnerable, its end near, perceptions that were to later draw increased participation in the Quit India movement of August 1942.|$|E
