5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{function}} {{and the appearance}} in life of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral spines remain elusive. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> represented defense weapons against predators, arguing that they tapered towards their tips. In a subsequent skeletal reconstruction drawing, Salgado (1999) depicted the neural spines supporting a keratinous sheath, which could have added significantly to the total length of <b>the</b> <b>spines.</b> The presence of a covering, either of keratin or skin, is shown by a striation pattern {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> similar to the bony horn cores of today's bovids. American science writer Gregory Paul (2000) argued that <b>the</b> <b>spines,</b> if elongated by a keratinous sheath, could have been used as a weapon both against predators and members of the same species, as the animal {{might have been able to}} point its most anterior spines forward by bending its neck. He also hypothesized that <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> could have been clattered together to generate sound. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel suggested that the backwards-directed spines might have been able to skewer predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's giant sable antelope and Arabian oryx, which can use their long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking lions. Apart from the possible function in defense, <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their spines for neck wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between <b>the</b> <b>spines.</b> In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one-third of <b>the</b> <b>spines.</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} biomechanics of <b>the</b> human <b>spine.</b> <b>The</b> vertebrae of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> are described, including basic {{differentiation between}} vertebrae depending on theirs placement in <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b> <b>The</b> intervertebral discs are depicted. Curvatures of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> are presented, {{followed by the}} basic biomechanics, including a movability of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> and an influence of body posture on <b>the</b> <b>spine...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Benefits of {{the large}} surface area of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> {{apparatus}} include increased electronic properties of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> and contribution to longitudinal resistance of <b>the</b> cytoplasm. <b>The</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus occupies {{a large portion of}} the volume of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> stalk, which allows it to contribute significantly to the longitudinal resistance of the cytoplasm. [...] Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus can have a direct effect on the membrane potential of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> plasma membrane by variation in position and volume.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{structures}} of <b>spine</b> apparatuses differ {{depending on their}} elaboration and position in <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b> Spines can be classified into four different categories: thin, stubby, mushroom, and branched. The shape of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus differs depending upon which spine type it is associated with. For example, when <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus is associated with thin <b>spines,</b> <b>the</b> morphology is simple and consists of a very basic tubular form; however, when <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus is associated with mushroom shaped dendritic <b>spines,</b> <b>the</b> morphology is a complex laminar arrangement of saccules in <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> head and stalk.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spines</b> on {{the claws}} of H.americanus are red or red-tipped, while those of H.gammarus are white or white-tipped.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spines</b> of cacti {{are often}} useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, {{as well as}} in whether all <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> {{produced}} by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most spines are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened spines (e.g. Schlerocactus papyracanthus). Other cacti have hooked spines. Sometimes, one or more central spines are hooked, while outer spines are straight (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).|$|E

30|$|After {{confirming}} the timer’s state, <b>the</b> <b>Spine</b> Switch Controller checks the time duration, {{as shown in}} Algorithm 5. Each Leaf switch has a timer for activating a Spine switch. If {{any one of those}} timers is on and Tda is exceeded, <b>the</b> <b>Spine</b> Switch Controller makes the decision of adding a new one. <b>The</b> <b>Spine</b> Switch Controller sends <b>the</b> <b>Spine</b> switch’s ID to the Power Control to inform it that <b>the</b> <b>Spine</b> switch should be activated, and sends <b>the</b> <b>Spine</b> switch’s ID to the Routing Module to tell it that traffic can be distributed on <b>the</b> new active <b>Spine</b> switch.|$|R
50|$|Synaptopodin, {{a protein}} that binds actin and α-actinin-2, is closely {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus. Although SP-deficient mature mice both lack <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus and display impaired LTP, the relationship between SP, <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus, and plasticity {{is complicated by the}} following three findings: (1) In addition to being associated with <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus, SP is also located in the cisternal organelle, which is structurally similar to <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus. (2) <b>The</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus is generally found in mushroom spines of mature neurons, but ample levels of SP and expression of LTP have been detected in juvenile rats just 15 days old. (3) Unlike SP, <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus has not been found in cultured neurons. These findings have led some to the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> apparatus is implicated in plasticity only because this organelle is associated with SP.|$|R
5|$|In many plants, {{defensive}} or {{storage structures}} {{are made by}} modifications {{of the development of}} primary leaves, stems, and roots. Leaves are variously modified from photosynthetic structures to form the insect-trapping pitchers of pitcher plants, the insect-trapping jaws of Venus flytrap, and <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> of cactuses, all homologous.|$|E
5|$|Most lionesses {{will have}} {{reproduced}} {{by the time}} they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.|$|E
5|$|The broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical spores are 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. Their surfaces {{are covered with}} small rounded bumps. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–30 by 6–7.5μm. The hyphae of the flesh are brownish with thin walls, and measure 4–6μm; hyphae in <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> are thin-walled, septate, and sometimes branched, measuring 3.5–4.5μm. The hyphae do not have clamp connections.|$|E
50|$|Deltoid {{tubercle}} of {{spine of}} scapula is prominence of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> of scapula. <b>The</b> <b>spine,</b> at lateral {{to the root of}} <b>the</b> <b>spine,</b> curves down and laterally to form lip. This lip is called the deltoid tubercle.|$|R
50|$|Foredge {{shelving}} may damage <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> {{and joints}} of a book. A possible reason {{for doing it}} was that leaving <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> facing up {{makes it easier to}} see the call number, which is usually located on <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b>|$|R
30|$|If {{the timer}} for deactivating Spine {{switches}} is on and Tdd is exceeded, <b>the</b> <b>Spine</b> Switch Controller calculates the number (min_num) of Spine switches {{that should be}} deactivated (as shown in lines 5 – 7 in Algorithm 5) and determines which Spine switches should be deactivated. <b>The</b> <b>Spine</b> Switch Controller sends <b>the</b> <b>Spine</b> switches’ ID to the Power Control Module to inform that <b>the</b> <b>Spine</b> switches should be deactivated, and sends <b>the</b> <b>Spine</b> switch’s ID to the Routing Module to inform that traffic {{is not to be}} distributed on those Spine switches.|$|R
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown–roughly the same color as <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. <b>The</b> <b>spines</b> on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have {{caps and}} stipes, often with indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. The flesh has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones {{in the flesh}} reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high nighttime humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth. <b>The</b> <b>spines</b> are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent (extending {{down the length of}} the stipe). Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, light brown, or dark brown in age.|$|E
5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> {{on its head}} and back when confronted by a predator, and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E
60|$|Thus the leg {{is not so}} {{different}} as it looks at first sight, in its proportion to <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> in <b>the</b> Gorilla and in the Man--being very slightly shorter than <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> in <b>the</b> former, and between 1/10 and 1/5 longer than <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> in <b>the</b> latter. The foot is longer and the hand much longer in the Gorilla; but the great difference {{is caused by the}} arms, which are very much longer than <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> in <b>the</b> Gorilla, very much shorter than <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> in <b>the</b> Man.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>spine</b> is an {{important}} and complex skeletal structure in the human body. It is a vulnerable part of our skeleton that is open to many medical problems. Hence {{it is necessary to}} establish a virtual spine model to assist surgeons to understand biomechanics of <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b> In this study, we aim to propose a virtual <b>spine</b> multi-body model. <b>The</b> computational biomechanical modeling of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> is based on the theory of multi-body dynamics and implemented with SimBody open-source SDK. Simbody was then used to solve the kinetic equations and simulate <b>the</b> movement of <b>spine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>spine</b> model was validated by comparing its simulation results with experimental results from literature. <b>The</b> <b>spine</b> model will be helpful to understand biomechanics of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> under loading...|$|R
50|$|The root of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> of <b>the</b> scapula is {{the most}} medial part of <b>the</b> {{scapular}} <b>spine.</b> <b>The</b> root of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> is on a level {{with the tip of}} the spinous process of the third thoracic vertebra.|$|R
5|$|Over the centuries, {{numerous}} durian cultivars, propagated by vegetative clones, {{have arisen}} in southeast Asia. They {{used to be}} grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected rootstocks. Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of <b>the</b> <b>spines.</b> Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.|$|E
5|$|The {{allometric}} exponent for sail {{height is}} similar in magnitude to the scaling of interspecific antler length to shoulder height in cervids. Furthermore, as Bakker (1970) observed {{in the context of}} Dimetrodon, many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays, and positively allometric, sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards (Echelle et al. 1978; Christian et al. 1995). There is also evidence of sexual dimorphism both in the robustness of the skeleton and in the relative height of <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> of D. limbatus (Romer and Price 1940).|$|E
5|$|The {{three pairs}} of legs are sturdy, with large coxae and five claws each. They are {{attached}} {{to each of the}} three thoracic segments. The front legs are the shortest and the hind legs the longest, providing the main propulsive power when the insect runs. <b>The</b> <b>spines</b> on the legs were earlier considered to be sensory, but observations of the insect's gait on sand and wire meshes have demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain. The structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legs.|$|E
25|$|The skin {{is mounted}} with <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> running through <b>the</b> {{centre of the}} drum head, with the line of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> {{pointing}} at <b>the</b> player, so the hands strike either side of <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b> Animal skins are thicker at <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> than <b>the</b> sides; mounting the skin with <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> centered ensures that {{the left and right}} hand play symmetric areas of equal size and thickness. In turn, this helps to minimize differences in pitch of the notes played by the left and right hand. Normally, the head end of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> points at <b>the</b> player, so the hands strike the area of the skin that used to be the shoulders of the goat. With thicker skins, such as from a cow or horse, the skin round is usually taken {{from the side of the}} hide so it does not include <b>the</b> <b>spine,</b> which is too thick for use on a djembe.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} dynamic {{effects of the}} Nuss procedure on <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> in <b>the</b> treatment of patients with pectus excavatum with asymmetric thoraces. MethodsTwenty-five patients with pectus excavatum who underwent the Nuss procedure were categorized into 4 groups by preoperative morphology of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> and thoracic asymmetry. In group 1 (n =  8), {{the right side of}} the thorax was concave and <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> bowed to <b>the</b> right. In group 2 (n =  4), {{the right side of the}} thorax was concave and <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> bowed to <b>the</b> left. In group 3 (n =  5), the left side of the thorax was concave and <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> bowed to <b>the</b> right. In group 4 (n =  8), the left side of the thorax was concave and <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> bowed to <b>the</b> left. With computed tomographic data, finite-element models were produced to simulate each patient's thorax. Thereafter, dynamic response patterns of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> to <b>the</b> Nuss procedure were examined. Validity of these biomechanical findings was verified by referring to clinical outcomes. ResultsIn group 1 and group 4 models, deformed spines were straightened; in group 2 and group 3 models, spinal bowing increased. These biomechanical findings were compatible with clinical evaluations. ConclusionsPerformance of the Nuss procedure for asymmetric pectus excavatum exerts dynamic influence on <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b> Response patterns of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> are predictable from morphologic relationships between the asymmetric patterns of the anterior thoracic wall and <b>the</b> <b>spine...</b>|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The work {{reported}} here presents a parametric solid model of <b>the</b> <b>spine,</b> loading systems of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> and a extracted arch spine {{model in which}} the body weight and external loads are treated as forces applied at appropriate points on <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> and muscle and ligament forces are treated as reaction forces applied to both ends of <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b> <b>The</b> model extends <b>the</b> arch <b>spine</b> approach by using optimisation techniques {{to find a better}} fitting thrust line compared with the previous arch model in the literature, and calculates the internal forces between the vertebrae in <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b> Case studies show the reasonable values of the internal forces (1. 1 - 1. 5 kN) in <b>the</b> arch <b>spine.</b> <b>The</b> values are much less than that of lever models (up to 6. 6 kN) ...|$|R
5|$|Though {{perhaps the}} actual total of {{cervical}} vertebrae was {{as high as}} seven or eight, the neck was only moderately long. The torso was relatively flat in side view, however, despite the belly being broad, it was not extremely vertically compressed as with ankylosaurs but taller than wide. The last three dorsal vertebrae had no ribs. <b>The</b> <b>spines</b> of the sacral vertebrae touched each other but were not fused into a supraneural plate. The quickly tapering tail was relatively short, probably representing about half of body length. The tail chevrons were strongly inclined to the rear. The hip area and tail base were stiffened by large numbers of ossified tendons.|$|E
5|$|When a stem is developing, {{the fungus}} is {{negatively}} geotropic, {{so that if}} the axis of the stem is tilted by 90 degrees, it will return to a vertical position within 24 hours. The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves diageotropic—they will grow {{at right angles to}} the direction of gravity. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> are positively geotropic, and will re-orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes. Because the second (cap formation) and third (spine formation) geotropic responses overlap, there is a brief period where two different geotropic responses are operating simultaneously. These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} ankylosaur osteoderms was {{published}} in 2000, and reviewed the armour of Struthiosaurinae. The group was represented by the single genus Struthiosaurus, known from head, cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal scutes. Only a few head osteoderms were identified, so it is unknown {{how much of the}} skull was armoured. Many cervical and dorsal scutes have been preserved alongside species of Struthiosaurus. They include cervical bands, which are groups of osteoderms fused together and attached to the vertebrae, and large spines found on the shoulders of nodosaurids like Sauropelta and Edmontonia, although it is not known if <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> were fused like the later of separate like the former. It is quite possible that small ovoid scutes found on Struthiosaurus could have formed a pelvic shield like polacanthids. The caudal scutes of struthiosaurines are small and rough. Even though osteoderms are well-known, it is not certain where they were positioned on the body.|$|E
