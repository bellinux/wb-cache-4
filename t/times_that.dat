50|$|The time-saving bias {{describes}} people's {{tendency to}} misestimate the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> {{could be saved}} (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) speed. In general, people underestimate the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> could be saved when increasing from a relatively low speed (e.g., 25 mph or 40 km/h) and overestimate the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> could be saved when increasing from a relatively high speed (e.g., 55 mph or 90 km/h). People also underestimate the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> could be lost when decreasing from a low speed and overestimate the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> could be lost when decreasing from a high speed.|$|R

5|$|Kepler-40b is {{the first}} (and only) planet {{discovered}} {{so far in the}} orbit of Kepler-40. It has a mass that is 2.2 <b>times</b> <b>that</b> of Jupiter's, the rough equivalent of 700 Earths. The planet also has a radius that is 1.17 <b>times</b> <b>that</b> of Jupiter and a density of 1.68grams/cm3. Kepler-40b has an equilibrium temperature of 1620 K, over six times hotter than the equilibrium temperature of Earth. It orbits its star every 6.87 days at a distance of 0.081 AU.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6b {{is a hot}} Jupiter, {{having a}} mass 0.669 <b>times</b> <b>that</b> of Jupiter, but an average {{distance}} of only 0.046 AU from its star and, thus, an orbital period of 3.23 days. It is almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is from our Sun. As a result, Kepler-6b is strongly irradiated by its star, heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K and puffing {{it up to a}} size 1.3 <b>times</b> <b>that</b> of Jupiter. It may also be the case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance {{from the center of the}} planet. However, additional observations are required to confirm or refute this possibility.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is a gas giant, with an {{estimated}} mass 2.6 <b>times</b> <b>that</b> of Jupiter's and a radius of 1.75 <b>times</b> <b>that</b> of jupiter and {{an estimated}} mean distance of 0.01 AU from its host star.It gives a temperature of 2200 kelvin It has an orbital period of approximately 18.4 hours. Although the mass and mean distance of MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is estimated, the confidence intervals are very large, indicating {{that there is a}} large uncertainty present. These uncertainties are largely due to how the exact parameters of the host star are not known.|$|E

5|$|The Sun is {{the star}} {{at the center of}} the Solar System.

5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million <b>times</b> <b>that</b> of heliumI and several hundred <b>times</b> <b>that</b> of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E
