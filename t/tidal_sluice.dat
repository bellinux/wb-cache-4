25|$|By {{the middle}} of the nineteenth century, the Marriott brothers, who owned a wharf at Narborough, and whose {{business}} included malting and selling coal and corn, also controlled the navigation. They formed an association, with some local landowners, to resist the construction of the Lynn and Dereham Railway line from King's Lynn to Dereham. Their cause was not successful, and the line opened from King's Lynn to Narborough on 1846, and onwards to Dereham in 1848, after which trade on the river declined. An Act of Parliament for the Nar Valley Drainage scheme, obtained in 1881, included a clause to remove the need to maintain the river for navigation, and navigation to Narborough ceased in 1884, when construction of the Old Nar <b>Tidal</b> <b>Sluice</b> prevented boats from accessing the river at King's Lynn.|$|E
25|$|The final {{stretch of}} the river, called Friars Fleet, was used by steam tugs and barges {{delivering}} gas water from Cambridge Gas Works to the West Norfolk Farmers Manure Works until 1932. To {{the south of the}} factory, the tidal doors of the Old Nar <b>Tidal</b> <b>Sluice</b> prevented the tide passing further upstream. A wharf called Boal Quay was served by coasters, and fishing boats moored in the channel. With the removal of the Kings Lynn Harbour Branch railway line which crossed a large loop on this section, the river was diverted to a new sluice close to the Ouse, although two-thirds of the loop remains as a tidal inlet. To mitigate against flood risks, a flood diversion channel was constructed between the Nar and the Ouse Flood Relief Channel in 2001, at the point at which they are closest. A sluice was constructed in the flood bank, which is controlled by electric motors, and the new channel joins the Flood Relief Channel upstream from Saddlebow Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|In 1784, Mill Drain was enlarged, {{with the}} {{intention}} of using it to drain parts of the East Fen, but this action was stopped by Fenmen blocking the drain, as they lived by fishing, fowling and cutting reeds, and these activities were threatened by drainage. A petition was presented to the Commissioners, signed by 105 Fenmen, of whom 86 were sufficiently literate to write their own name. As a result, a sluice was built on Valentine's Drain, which maintained the water level in the East Fen at a height sufficient to allow the Fenmen to continue their way of life. A series of reports had been made during the eighteenth century by the civil engineers John Smeaton, John Grundy, Sr., his son John Grundy, Jr., Langley Edwards, and others, but no action had been taken to implement them. With Sir Joseph Banks of Revesby Abbey pushing for a solution, the civil engineer John Rennie was asked to produce a plan for the drainage of both fens. Anthony Bower and James Murray carried out the surveys, and Rennie produced his report in September 1800. He concluded that the outfalls at Wainfleet and Maud Foster was inadequate, and that the internal drainage of the fens was not effective. He suggested catchwater drains to collect the runoff from the Wolds to prevent it entering the fens, and a new <b>tidal</b> <b>sluice</b> at Hobhole, closer to the Wash than the Maud Foster outlet. After some minor disputes were resolved, the plan formed the basis for an Act of Parliament obtained in 1801.|$|E
50|$|Passing through Pont Aberglaslyn, {{the river}} {{emerges from the}} gorge into the {{relatively}} flat agricultural land of Tremadog and Porthmadog. This wide flat valleynow called Traeth Mawrwas once the estuary of the Glaslyn before the Porthmadog Cob was created. This sealed off {{the mouth of the}} estuary enabling the land to be reclaimed. Once the river has crossed under the railway line, it meanders in large pools and marshes before eventually passing through the <b>tidal</b> <b>sluices</b> on the Cob at the south-eastern end of the town of Porthmadog, and from there into Tremadog Bay. Further south, the River Dwyryd also drains into Tremadog Bay.|$|R

40|$|Ca Mau Peninsula, {{which lies}} at the extreme {{southern}} tip of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, has experienced rapid environmental and socio-economic change, particularly since the 1990 s when the doi moi (renovation) policy introduced an agenda of agriculture-led growth. The peninsula lies entirely within the zone of saline intrusion, which previously extended up to 50 km inland during the dry season, thus limiting traditional rice production to only one rainy-season crop. To promote the intensification of rice production, a plan was devised to build a series of coastal embankments and <b>tidal</b> <b>sluices</b> to control salinity intrusion. The protected area lying within Bac Lieu Province, which covers approximately 160, 000 ha, is the focus for this discussion. Data collected on environmental and socio-economic conditions within the protected area {{during the study period}} reflect a complex spatial and temporal pattern of impacts. However, the pattern {{can be seen as a}} transition between a freshwater environment supporting rice production and a brackish environment supporting shrimp production. The impacts of these changes in environmental management strategies are discussed. A strategy favouring rice production depends on the operation of sluices in such a way that a freshwater environment is maintained. Intensification of the rice production system involve...|$|R

5000|$|As Harvey's and the Cornish Copper Company {{continued}} to thrive, the rivalry {{between the two}} grew into open hostility. Disputes regularly erupted over access to the sea as The Cornish Copper Company controlled the dock and the <b>tidal</b> <b>sluice</b> which they had built at Copperhouse.

50|$|Although {{the river}} is but a stream today, it {{appeared}} to have had amore potent flow in times gone by, large enough to appear on some maps of Britain. Some small vessels could almost reach Dinas Powys, but, like the River Thaw a few miles west, {{it is likely to}} have silted up, and the mouth became a mud channel before being redeveloped.The lower reaches of the river have been extensively modified in the past. In 1884, the Barry Railway Company began construction work on the Barry docks, which were cut into the natural estuary of the river, which was diverted away. The lower river should be <b>tidal,</b> but a <b>sluice</b> gate built {{at the same time as}} the docks keeps the water fresh.|$|R
2500|$|The Wainfleet Relief Channel is also crossed by the B1195 road, {{and shortly}} afterwards, the Lymn joins it.

Croft Lane bridge is next, after which the A52 and the Boston to Skegness railway cross, and the relief channel rejoins Wainfleet Haven. The final section contains three flood defence structures. Haven House Sluice is first, after which the channel splits. Wainfleet Clough Outfall is on the western channel, which is <b>tidal</b> below the <b>sluice.</b> The Burgh Sluice Relief Channel is to the east, and Burgh Sluice protects it from the sea just before the two channels rejoin.

He was aided in his negotiation by Brereton. Following its lease, the island was renamed from Banjulo to St Mary’s Island. The houses, barracks, stores, factories, forts and other buildings were built around the crescent-shaped sandbank and gradually the land behind was partly reclaimed. The barracks on the island could hold 80 soldiers and house six cannons. The town was drained with <b>tidal</b> <b>sluice</b> to prevent the flooding of the town by sea water.

40|$|Tidal {{power is}} a clean {{renewable}} energy. Furthermore, electricity is acknowledged as a key need for development. However, until recently, due to high capital costs and extensive environmental concerns, few tidal power plants are operative around the world. These problems are now being mitigated by the application of appropriate, modern practices and technologies. In particular the use of small scale technologies, innovative financing and the involvement of local communities creates the potential for tidal power to be a tool in coastal development. This thesis examines the appropriateness of tidal power in the rural coastal community of Bangladesh, where electricity demand is a major development problem. Coastal Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, especially from cyclones, tidal surges {{and the effects of}} global warming on sea-level rise. Consequently, most of this coastal area has been protected by embankments and sluice gates, which can accommodate the normal tidal head rise and fall. The potential of tidal power to use this infrastructure, together with its associated problems and mitigation measures, have been analysed by comparing existing and potential tidal power technologies around the world, including a proposed Kimberley tidal power project in Western Australia. The research has identified that a significant amount of power could be produced from the tidal range of coastal Bangladesh by using the simple low-cost technology of tidal wheels in the <b>tidal</b> embankment <b>sluice</b> gates. The electricity produced could be utilised by various coastal interests, such as agriculture, shrimp aquaculture and other resource producing activities. However, the real benefits of this technology are that it can be applied in a way that simultaneously enables the development of local infrastructure and the improvement in living conditions of the local people by creating income generation and employment opportunities in these coastal communities. The thesis puts forward a community based co-management model as a means of effectively integrating tidal power in coastal area management in Bangladesh...|$|R
500|$|The River Brue {{originates}} in hills {{to the southwest}} of the catchment area, close to the border with Dorset. The same hills are the locale {{of the sources of}} the River Wylye and the Dorset Stour which flow south to the English Channel. It descends quickly in a narrow valley to a point just beyond Bruton where it is joined by the River Pitt. Here it takes a meandering route through a broad, flat-bottomed valley between Castle Cary and Alhampton. By the time it reaches Baltonsborough it is only some [...] above sea level and the surrounding countryside is drained into it by way of numerous rhynes. It passes Glastonbury, where it acts as a natural boundary with nearby village of Street, before flowing in a largely artificial channel across the Somerset Levels and into the River Parrett at Burnham-on-Sea. It is joined by the North Drain, White's River (which takes the water of the River Sheppey, Cripps River (an artificial channel that connects it to the River Huntspill) and many drainage rhynes). It is connect to the River Axe through several of these channels which are controlled by <b>sluices.</b> It is <b>tidal</b> below the <b>sluices</b> at New Clyce Bridge in Highbridge.|$|R
40|$|The Rhine {{is one of}} {{the largest}} rivers on the European continent. It runs from Switzerland through Germany and the delta covers almost half of the area of the Netherlands. The river basin covers 185. 000 km 2. In early ages the river ended in the estuary ‘Zuiderzee’, an open, tidal estuary that {{provided}} habitat for many species of fish. The Zuiderzee was particularly famous for its rich fishery grounds. To prevent future flooding and to develop new agricultural polders the Zuiderzee was closed off and separated from the Wadden Sea in 1932 with a 32 km long dike, the ‘Afsluitdijk’. The dike served as a protection against storm floods and as salt levels gradually decreased this new lake ‘IJsselmeer’ transformed into a huge freshwater storage with significant economic benefits. On the downside, the gradual intertidal fresh-saltwater gradient disappeared, and so did many of the characteristic fish like smelt, houting, sea trout, sea lamprey, herring, alosa, anchovy, etc. The Afsluitdijk had become a barrier between salt and fresh and closed off one of the main doors for fish migration into the river Rhine. The current <b>tidal</b> discharge <b>sluices</b> only open to release superfluous freshwater in the rainy season and most of the time water currents are too high to allow fish to migrate from sea into the lake and hence the rivers upstream of the lake. The negative effects on fish populations resulted in a strong decrease of fishery. Commercial fishermen had to adapt to the new situation and their fishery had to change gradually into freshwater fishery. But nowadays this freshwater fishery is decreasing as well. It is widely accepted that opening the door for fish will greatly improve local and migratory fish populations and both biologists and engineers have proposed several solutions in the past. The major challenge in design remains the fact that the inland lake needs to remain fresh at all times. This limits the possibilities for the ideal solution; an open connection with free tidal characteristics. In 2012 both economic and nature conservation stakeholders have launched the idea of the Fish Migration River, designed to break the barrier. The idea is to construct an artificial river connecting the tidal saltwater Wadden Sea with the freshwater IJsselmeer, with enough length to buffer the saltwater flowing in during high tide. Situated next to the main sluices, a working Fish Migration River can serve multiple goals. It facilitates the return of freshwater fish unintentionally flushed out by the discharge sluices. It opens the dike for a wide range of migratory fish, and provides them with a gradual habitat for physiological adaptation. Furthermore this location has an added value for recreational and education activities. A visitor center is included in the plan as well. The plan has received positive reactions by local, regional and national government and a feasibility study has resulted in a primarily design. For an optimized design further research is needed. It is essential to understand both (local) ecological demands of the fish and potential morphological effects on the Wadden Sea...|$|R
