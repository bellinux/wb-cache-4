40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} concept for an Intelligent Adaptive Learning Environment (IALE) {{based on a}} {{holistic}} Multidimensional Instructional Design Model, applied on OLAT, an open source, Java LMS, developed at the University of Zurich, to support student and/or groups defined as “Learning Entities ” (LE). Based primarily on an Artificial Intelligence – Tutoring Subsystem, used to identify, monitor and adapt the student's learning path, considering the students actual knowledge, learning habits and preferred learning style. The proposed concept has the peculiarity of eliminating any didactical boundaries or rigid, implied course structures (also known as unlimited didactical freedom). Relying on “real time ” adapted profiles, it allows content authors to apply a dynamic course design, supporting tutored, collaborative sessions and activities, as suggested by modern pedagogy. The AI <b>tutoring</b> <b>facility</b> (eTutor), coupled with the LMS, is intended to support the “human tutor ” with valuable LE performance- / activity data, available from the integrated “Behavior Recorder Controller ” (BRC), allowing to confirm or manually modify actions suggested by the eTutor. The student has the option to select the level of tutoring interventions or switch to a “subject matter ” exercise mode if he feels, and is allowed to do so. The concept presented combines a personalized level of surveillance, learning activity- and/or learning path adaptation suggestions to ensure the students learning motivation and learning success...|$|E
40|$|This study {{took place}} in a {{university}} athletics <b>tutoring</b> <b>facility</b> which provides writing support to “underprepared” freshman student-athletes. Many students who are classified as underprepared students (often ethnic or linguistic minorities, international students, or first-generation college students) would not have the chance to attend a four-year university without their athletic ability and scholarships, making athletics writing support programs unique compared to campus-wide tutoring services. Athletics writing tutors are also subject to stricter National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) restrictions, making writing conferences in this setting a site of conflicting expectations and struggle. Since access to specialized tutoring services {{is an important factor in}} underprepared students’ college success, it is necessary to better understand the nature of these writing tutorials. In particular, it is essential to investigate whether and to what degree writing tutors who work with underprepared student-athletes are knowledgeable about the backgrounds, identities, and needs of this population, and how they navigate the NCAA restrictions on writing conferences. This case study charts the evolution of writing tutoring practices over a two-year span in one Division 1 state university’s athletic tutoring center. Through identifying needs and struggles of both underprepared students and writing tutors, I developed and implemented training modules that provided tutors with training in student-athlete identities, language varieties, and tutoring strategies for the process of American English academic writing. Post-training observations of writing conferences show qualitative differences in the ways that writing tutors approach students and their writing. In this paper, key data from observations, interviews, questionnaires, and training materials are utilized to explain how this evolution of tutoring practices took place...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of {{education}} studies has been on mainstream schools and institutions. However, the growing phenomenon of private tutoring has been largely overlooked by scholars. In Kazakhstan, numerous specialists offer private tutoring, and the tendency to supplement mainstream schooling continues to grow. The actual effectiveness of private tutoring, meanwhile, remains an open question. Since the study of English language {{is the most popular}} among the various subjects offered by tutors, this research studies the effectiveness of private tutoring of English and the way it can – or cannot – complement school education. This qualitative study explores the experiences of five private tutors and five privately tutored small groups of high-school students at private <b>tutoring</b> <b>facilities</b> in Astana, based on data obtained from semi-structured individual face-to-face and focus group interviews. The results of the study indicate that private tutoring is effective in enhancing students’ knowledge of English, as well as serves as a remedial purpose by helping students to form the knowledge required by mainstream schools. However, {{it should be noted that}} for other tutored subjects the situation may be different. Also, the results of the research may not be representative for the whole country due to the small size of the sample...|$|R

5000|$|The primary {{difference}} between Division III {{and the other}} Divisions is that athletics-based financial aid is prohibited in Division III. In Division I, athletics-based financial aid can keep a student athlete competing even if the athlete's enthusiasm declines. In Division III, such financial aid is prohibited; student athletes compete entirely per their own volition. In Division I, {{it is common to}} provide special academic support for athletes to make school easier for them. This can include <b>tutors,</b> <b>facilities,</b> staff who work with faculty to facilitate the athletes' experiences, and/or athletics department advising on course selections. While some Division I coaches do encourage athletes to work hard in athletics, this is not guaranteed, and a threat of withdrawal of financial support is a possibility if coaches feel that an athlete is making [...] "unnecessary" [...] academic efforts that conflict with athletic development. In Division III, athletes are expected to attend to academic responsibilities under the same conditions as the general student body, and are generally expected to be responsible students whose academic performance reflects well on the athletics program. The hours spent in training and competition use time that other students spend on study. This puts the athlete at an academic disadvantage. This means athletics actually makes school more difficult for Division III athletes, rather than easier.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this paper focuses on the hypothesis that an intelligent tutoring system that provides guidance with respect to students' meta-cognitive abilities can help them to become better learners. Our strategy is to extend a Cognitive Tutor (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995) so that it not only helps students acquire domain-specific skills, but also develop better general help-seeking strategies. In developing the Help Tutor, we used the same Cognitive Tutor technology at the metacognitive level that has been proven to be very effective at the cognitive level. A key challenge {{is to develop a}} model of how students should use a Cognitive <b>Tutor's</b> help <b>facilities.</b> We created a preliminary model, implemented by 57 production rules that capture both effective and ineffective help-seeking behavior. As a first test of the model's efficacy, we used it off-line to evaluate students' help-seeking behavior in an existing data set of student-tutor interactions. We then refined the model {{based on the results of}} this analysis. Finally, we conducted a pilot study with the Help Tutor involving four students. During one session, we saw a statistically significant reduction in students' meta-cognitive error rate, as determined by the Help Tutor's model. These preliminary results inspire confidence as we gear up for a larger-scale controlled experiment to evaluate whether tutoring on help seeking has a positive effect on students' learning outcomes...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedRecent {{years have}} seen {{a large number of}} game-based {{training}} systems or serious games developed for diversified learning domains. Despite the hypothesis that computer games are motivator to promote learning engagement, however, researchers reported various problems existing in these systems. One of the intractable problems, for example, is that games incentives may direct learners to unproductive learning activities, diverging from the original intention of educational software designers. Skeptics began to question the worth of employing game techniques in training systems, as constructing a serious game faces relatively longer development cycle and consumes more expensive resources.; Do unproductive learning activities in serious games falsify the hypothesis that games can promote learning? What kind of learners can benefit from the didactics of learning by playing? What design issues should be taken into consideration in order to reduce these unproductive activities? To what extent can pedagogy harness the power of computer games and still preserve their fun elements? This thesis attempts to answer these questions through in-depth research on improving the learning productivity of serious games. Iterative exploratory studies were carried for evaluating the training results and validating the design of a particular serious game, called the Tactical Language & Culture Training System (TLCTS), which coaches adult learners to rapidly acquire spoken communication skills. Evidence of the previous study was used to establish the hypothesis for the next controlled study, which further serves as the basis of qualitative and quantitative analysis on the generic issues of low learning productivity in serious games. Based on the analysis, this thesis presents a pedagogical framework tailored for serious game applications, which incorporate customized curriculum contents, implicit and explicit feedback, game scoring, scaffolding and fading, online student assessment, performance summarization as well as <b>tutor</b> advice <b>facilities.</b> This thesis also provides implementation details of this framework as a case study.; Preliminary results on adoption of this framework indicate that it helps reduce unproductive learning activities. We conclude that serious games should be engineered as coherent whole that harmonizes the cognitive and game design principles rather than a mere container of the curriculum contents...|$|R

When the first enclave was started at Mount Lawley College in 1976, it {{was seen as a}} place where Aboriginal students could retreat from the hustle and bustle of College life to be with people they felt comfortable with, and refresh themselves for return to the wider world again. A second enclave was established at the Nedlands Campus in 1982, an external one at Broome in 1983 and in 1985 new enclaves have been established at Churchlands, Claremont and Carnarvon. In 1986 an enclave at the new Bunbury Institute of Advanced Education commenced operation. Also 1986 is the year {{for the establishment of a}} new off campus centre to commence in 1987 at Kununurra. Within the enclave students get support from each other and from staff; have a place to work on assignments or take tutorials with their personal <b>tutor,</b> and have <b>facilities</b> for making tea and coffee etc. As they become confident about aspects of college life which might at first have seemed strange or intimidating, most students involve themselves fully in all aspects of college life, mixing with non-Aboriginal students and using college facilities in the same way as other students.

40|$|A Educação a Distância encontra-se em crescimento e os profissionais envolvidos no processo precisam capacitar-se para acompanhar a evolução da tecnologia e da metodologia do ensino. Entre esses profissionais encontra-se o professor-tutor, cujas funções são orientar, estimular, motivar e construir com o aluno sua trajetória de aprendizagem. Nessa perspectiva, a presente pesquisa, intitulada A Formação de Tutores e sua Atuação na Educação a Distância, teve como objetivo buscar a compreensão de duas situações referentes à tutoria. A primeira foi conhecer como o curso denominado Formação de Tutores prepara o participante para ser tutor; e a segunda situação consistiu em pesquisar como foi a atuação desses tutores, enquanto mediadores e orientadores no curso Tecnologia Assistiva - 4 ª ed. da Universidade Estadual Paulista, em parceria com a Universidade Aberta do Brasil, na modalidade da Educação a Distância. Definiu-se a pesquisa de acordo com os conceitos da abordagem qualitativa. Inicialmente, foi realizada uma revisão bibliográfica com autores, entre os quais se destacam: Freire, Perrenoud, Moran, Valente, Almeida, Morin, Kenski. Posteriormente, foram {{realizadas}} entrevistas semiestruturadas com quatro tutores que são professores, realizaram o curso de formação e atuaram como tutores no curso Tecnologia Assistiva, buscando saber suas concepções a respeito: da experiência como tutor; dificuldades encontradas no curso de formação; contribuições do curso de formação para a atuação como tutor; e fatores facilitadores e dificultadores na atuação do tutor. Complementando a coleta dos dados, recorreu-se à análise dos materiais pedagógicos dos dois cursos, bem como a apreciação das interações e mediações ocorridas entre professor-formador e tutores, e tutores e professores-cursistas nos fóruns, bate-papos (chat), agendas, diário de bordo e demais ferramentas do Ambiente Virtual de Aprendizagem (AVA) TelEduc. A análise das informações e dos dados obtidos possibilitou identificar que os tutores se capacitaram e se prepararam para cumprir de forma adequada e eficaz as atividades de ensinar, mediar e orientar os professores-cursistas. Quanto às categorias de comportamento do ser tutor, percebeu-se que identificar problemas, promover interação e dar feedback foram assinalados nas interações entre tutor-cursista e tutor-formador nos registros dos fóruns e chats do ambiente virtual de aprendizagem; conforme descrito nos preceitos de Piaget, identificou-se que os tutores agiram com autonomia durante sua atuação no curso de Tecnologia Assistiva, e foram incentivados pelos formadores no curso de Formação a agirem com autonomia. The {{distance education}} is growing and professionals {{involved in the}} process need to empower themselves to follow the evolution of technology and teaching methodology. Among this professionals, there is a teacher-tutor whose role is to guide, encourage, motivate and build the student in their learning process. In this perspective, the present research entitled "The formation of tutors and their role in distance education", aimed to seek the understanding of two situations regarding mentoring. The first situation was to know how the course entitled "Formation of Tutors" prepares the participant to be the tutor, the second situation, was to research how was the performance of these tutors, mentors and mediators while in the course "Assistive Technology- 4 ed. " of Paulista State University, in partnership with the Open University of Brazil, in the modality of Distance Education. The research was defined according to the qualitative approach. Initially was realized {{a review of the literature}} authors which are: Freire, Perrenoud, Moran, Valente, Almeida, Morin, Kenski. Besides the bibliographic research, were conducted semi-structured interviews with four teachers and tutors that realized the course of formation and acted as tutors on the course "Assistive Technology", seeking to know their conceptions about: experience as a tutor, difficulties found in the course of formation, the contributions of ongoing formation for acting as <b>tutor,</b> and <b>facilities</b> and difficulties in acting tutor. Complementing the data collection, we used the analysis of the pedagogical material from both courses, as well as appreciation of the interaction and mediations occurred between trainer and teacher-tutors, tutors and teacher-course participants in forums, chats, calendars, diary of board and other tools of the Virtual Learning Environment (AVA) TelEduc. The analysis of the information and data obtained, allowed to identify that tutors were trained and prepared to meet adequate and effective the activities taught, mediate and guide the teacher-course participants. Regarding the categories of behavior of "being tutor" was noticed that identify problems, promote interaction and provide feedback were reported in the interactions between tutor-course participants on the records of forums and chats of the virtual environment of learning; as described in the precepts of Piaget, it was identified that tutors acted with autonomy over its operations in the course of Assistive Technology, and were encouraged by the trainers in the course of training to act with autonomy...|$|R
