Ideas from this project later {{became a part of}} his Theory of the Consumption Function. Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice, which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes <b>that</b> <b>professional</b> licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.|$|E
5|$|Politics was a {{frequent}} subject of discussion in the Bradley household, {{and some of his}} relatives held local and county political offices. He majored in history at Princeton, and was present in the Senate chamber when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. Van Breda Kolff and many others who knew him predicted that Bradley would be Governor of Missouri, or President, by 40. He spent his time at Oxford focusing on European political and economic history. In 1978, he said that congressman Mo Udall, himself a former professional basketball player, had told him ten years earlier <b>that</b> <b>professional</b> sports could help prepare him for politics, depending on what he did with his non-playing time.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{proposes that}} there is an {{inherent}} paradox in the American political cultural: {{that there is}} a strong distaste for any professionals spawned in the political process, despite that process being so complex (increasingly so) <b>that</b> <b>professionals</b> are required to navigate its courses on behalf of potential political candidates. From a history of the campaign-consulting profession, the thesis explores the functions <b>that</b> these <b>professionals</b> carry out, the changing roles of the political parties who are seen to compete with these professionals for relevance, and then explores the role <b>that</b> <b>professionals</b> played in the presidential campaigns of 2008. ...|$|R

5|$|It was {{not until}} the years {{following}} the Second World War <b>that</b> <b>professional</b> wrestling enjoyed its first golden age. Pat O'Connor, a one-time NWA and AWA World Heavyweight Champion, was one of the earliest stars of that era. During the 1960s and 1970s, other wrestlers from New Zealand also travelled to the United States, where they enjoyed similar success in the National Wrestling Alliance and the World Wide Wrestling Federation. American wrestlers frequently toured New Zealand during this period and were well received by the public. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship was also defended several times in the country; in 1984 Ric Flair won the title from Harley Race in Wellington and Jeff Jarrett defeated Sting in Auckland to unify the title with Australia's WWA World Heavyweight Championship in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{accepted}} a re-appointment as {{the superintendent of}} the 1880 Census because a new law, spearheaded by Congressman James A. Garfield, had been passed {{to allow him to}} appoint trained census enumerators free from political influence. Notably, the 1880 Census's results suggested population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over Walker's 1870 census but an investigation revealed that the latter had been inaccurately enumerated. Walker publicized the discrepancy even as it effectively discredited the accuracy his 1870 work. The tenth Census resulted in the publication of twenty-two volumes, was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time, and definitively established Walker's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation. The Census was again delayed {{as a result of its}} size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its comprehensiveness and relevance. Walker also used the position as a bully pulpit to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau to not only ensure <b>that</b> <b>professional</b> statisticians could be trained and retained but that the information could be better popularized and disseminated. Following Garfield's 1880 election, there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to be Secretary of the Interior, but Walker had accepted the offer to become President of MIT in the spring of 1881 instead.|$|E
5|$|Stromberg demanded {{complete}} authenticity in casting, language, and {{the depiction}} of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. Van Dyke cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray Wise, the actor and cameraman (who later {{changed his name to}} Ray Mala), as the star of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. Wise was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian Jew who previously starred in the 1932 documentary film Igloo. Van Dyke wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected Wise. A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but he walked off the set in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, Van Dyke turned to Ray Wise. Not only could Wise perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as an immensely realistic actor. Wise came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on Igloo was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was able to offer his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state <b>that</b> <b>professional</b> actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume.|$|E

Olson argue that this sector of justice cannot be successful without <b>professionals.</b> They claim <b>that</b> <b>professionals</b> can aid in avoiding problems that come up with informal justice and propose the theory of democratic professionalism, where professionals are not just agents of the state - as traditional understandings would suggest - but as mediums, promoting community involvement while still protecting individuals' rights.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} enterprise social media (ESM) for organizational knowledge sharing and shows <b>that</b> <b>professionals</b> face ambiguities because their knowledge sharing behavior is informed by an institutional complexity that consists of 2 dissimilar institutional logics: Logics of the profession, and logics of the corporation. Our qualitative case study of an ESM at an IT consultancy organization shows <b>that</b> <b>professionals</b> find ways to manage the ambiguities they experience by engaging the affordances of ESM {{in such a way}} as to develop coping practices: Connection management, reputation management, and information management. By complementing the affordance perspective with an institutional logics perspective, we are able to advance scholarly understanding on how ESM can facilitate but also frustrate knowledge sharing...|$|R
40|$|Professionals {{progress}} through three stages of development; acquisition of knowledge, specialisation {{and integration of}} knowledge. Much of the current emphasis for professional development is on development of competencies. Entry into a profession {{is dependent on the}} professional acquiring a level of competency sufficient to practice. This paper argues <b>that</b> <b>professionals</b> need to acquire new specialist disciplines and/or to develop their knowledge beyond a competence/sufficiency level. Learning for this requires a greater depth than mere competency. The paper explores how Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) can enhance professionals' careers. Existing training practices of separating work and learning inhibit learning transfer. The complex and ill-structured nature of professionals' work demands <b>that</b> <b>professionals</b> draw on real world situations to develop the conceptual knowledge needed to be applied to novel situations. Professional Societies provide the context for learning, domain knowledge and learning environment so <b>that</b> <b>professionals</b> are able to apply the knowledge and skills gained through education. WIL is widely reported in literature as a philosophy of learning which is appropriate for development of professionals. It incorporates hands-on work experience that assumes a level of explicit knowledge/skill {{on the part of the}} learner and the exchange of tacit knowledge/skill from the real-world to the learner...|$|R

While insurance is sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an insurable interest, the equivalent in gambling is simply betting against one's own best interests (e.g., a sports coach betting against his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).|$|E
