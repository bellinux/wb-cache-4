This article focuses on antidumping, the linchpin of <b>trade</b> <b>remedies.</b> While antidumping is being justified as a safety valve for protectionist pressures, I argue in this article that antidumping is a faulty safety valve in that it provides arbitrary levels of protection for petitioners, results in undue uncertainties for respondents, and has too low a threshold for activation. I further demonstrate that antidumping exacerbates democracy deficit in trade policy, as the mechanical formulas used for calculating antidumping duties deprive the <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> process of the democratic participation that is essential for seeking consensus and compromises on trade protectionism. I propose to replace antidumping with a new country-specific safeguard that has a heightened injury standard and a mandatory public interest clause. I argue that this country-specific safeguard comports with the policy objectives of <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> and is politically feasible. The global safeguard currently in use, by contrast, cannot {{provide the kind of}} trade protection demanded by users of antidumping.

40|$|China is {{becoming}} {{integrated into the}} global food market, but it has found that most coun-tries are politically sensitive to rising food imports, especially from low cost suppliers. Importing nations are quite willing to use non-tariff trade barriers, such as <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> laws, to restrict imports from emerging exporters like China. There are three distinct categories of <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> law: antidumping (AD), coun-tervailing duty (CVD), and safeguards. China is a principal target of AD cases brought by food importers, especially the United States. These laws classify China as a nonmarket econ-omy, which typically results in very steep AD tariffs. The {{purpose of this article}} is to estimate how <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> laws have affected China’s abil-ity to break into the world market as a food exporter. While significant research has been conducted on the use of <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> laws in manufacturing, very little attention has been paid to agriculture (Blonigen 2004). We begin by summarizing trends in China’s food pro-duction and exports. Then we discuss specific <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> cases, mainly AD cases brought against horticultural exports from China.

40|$|This paper {{maps and}} {{examines}} the provisions on anti-dumping, countervailing duties and safeguards in seventy-four regional trade agreements (RTAs). The RTAs vary in size, degree of integration, geographic {{region and the}} level of economic development of their members. The key policy concern of the paper is that the elastic and selective nature of <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> may lead to more discrimination, with reduced <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> actions against RTA partners, but a greater frequency of <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> actions against non-members. The adoption of RTAspecific <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> rules increases this risk of discrimination, with <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> against RTA members being abolished outright or being subjected to greater discipline. The templates used for mapping the <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> provisions reflect this central concern. The results of the mappings suggest the need to be vigilant about increased discrimination arising from <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> rules in RTAs. A number of RTAs have succeeded in abolishing <b>trade</b> <b>remedies.</b> Probit and multinomial logit model estimations suggest that these RTAs are characterized by a higher share of intra-RTA trade and deeper forms of integration that go well beyond the dismantling of border measures. A fairly large number of RTAs have adopted RTA-specific rules that tighten discipline on the application of <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> on RTA members. In the case of anti-dumping for example, some provisions increase de minimis volume and dumping margin requirements and shorten the duration for applying anti-dumping duties relative to the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement. In similar fashion, many of the provisions on bilateral safeguards lead to tightened discipline or reduce the incentives to take safeguard actions. Safeguard measures can be imposed only during the transition period, have shorter duration periods and require compensation if put in place. Further, retaliation is allowed if there is no agreement on compensation. RTA provisions on global safeguards require that, under certain conditions, RTA partners be exempted from multilateral safeguard actions. This conflicts with multilateral rules which require that safeguard measures be applied to all sources of imports and highlights the problem of trade diversion. A small number of RTAs give a role to regional institutions to conduct anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations and to review final determinations of national authorities. There is a theoretical presumption and some empirical evidence to suggest that this reduces the frequency of anti-dumping initiations and final determinations against RTA members. In the case of CVDs, we are unable to find major innovations in CVD rules and practice by past and present RTAs. A major reason for this may be the absence of commitments in the RTA on meaningful or significant curbs on subsidies or state aid...|$|R

40|$|The World Trade Organization (WTO) {{is based}} on the rule of law but is {{anchored}} in the political economy of the member states. The multilateral trade rules are backed up by a system of litigation, through dispute settlement panels, that complements (rather than supercedes) rules found in national laws and in bilateral and regional trade agreements. Trade litigation at the WTO serves two essential functions: to clarify and interpret the agreements that have been negotiated in the WTO; and to prevent abuses that would diminish the benefits that countries derive from WTO membership and disturb the balance of benefits and obligations negotiated by the political process. This paper focuses on two aspects of trade litigation of particular interest to agriculture: the use of <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> by importing countries concerned about injury to domestic farm sectors, and the complaints by exporters about the subsidies used by importers and competing exporters that harm their own overseas markets. 1 Many countries have domestic legislation for <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> – anti-dumping and countervailing duty provisions and safeguards against import surges.

Although the content and degree of these modified systems may not be significant yet, they still set very important precedents, or 'seeds', for 'rule diversification' in the world trading system. Such modification typically aims to further liberalize mutual trade between FTA parties and thereby contribute to a freer world trading system. However, such rule diversification appears to be inconsistent with the mandate of Article XXIV of GATT by worsening economically inferior trade diversion. The reinterpretation of the legal obligations in Article XXIV commensurate with economically more reasonable structures implies that <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> rules in FTAs should be applied on a non-discriminatory basis. Moreover, an FTA safeguard measure must precede a WTO safeguard measure to ensure optimal competitive conditions among trading partners.

40|$|This thesis takes a {{corporate}} political strategy perspective of antidumping and countervailing duty cases {{to understand why}} some firms are more successful at the prosecution of these <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> measures. <b>Trade</b> <b>remedy</b> measures are long standing tools of US trade policy and their use has continued to grow globally amongst member countries of the World Trade Organisation. Between 1980 and 2007 a total of 1606 of these <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> cases were investigated by the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission, an average of 41 antidumping and 17 countervailing duty cases a year, with a value of around US$ 63 billion or 0. 3 % of all US imports. Thirty-seven {{percent of the cases}} by number and 54 % by value resulted in duties being imposed on the subject imports. This study uses archival material for five recent <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> investigations and forty-five semistructured interviews with business interests, trade attorneys and economic consultants that have experience of prosecuting these cases to understand why some firms may be more successful than others at achieving their preferred policy outcome. The imposition of duties is found to be only the simplest measure of success for US firms that file a case and does not capture the range of potential outcomes for foreign firms that face the duties. Successful prosecution of a trade case {{has been found to be}} firm specific, as the DOC determination of individual firm duty rates significantly affects what the outcome of case means for each firm in the US and foreign industries. The successful prosecution of US <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> cases is argued to be an informational corporate political strategy that is affected by statutory and administrative biases in the execution of the agency investigations, and creates the potential for indirect rent-seeking bias in the outcomes of cases. This informational corporate political strategy is based on three capabilities that firms need to develop, the capability to gather information, the capability to build and shape the administrative record at the agencies to reflect a firm’s policy preferences and the capability to align business practices with the US <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> institutions. These three capabilities are enabled by the bundling of corporate political expertise resources, organisational resources, financial resources and reputational resources. Some of these resources are internal to the firms, including staff, money and information, while other resources are external, such as the trade attorneys and economic consultants.

In order to prevent domestic producers from abusing antidumping remedies, courts should interpret the sham exception broadly enough to effectively foreclose non-price predation. At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission, under its vested antitrust authority, should strengthen its surveillance and enforcement activities to guard against the abuse of <b>trade</b> <b>remedies.</b> In the long-term, these targeted judicial and administrative interventions will lead the public and legislators alike to rethink the antidumping statute itself...|$|R
