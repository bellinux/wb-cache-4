5|$|At Kilve are {{the remains}} of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was {{discovered}} that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil but the company was unable to raise sufficient capital and this is now all that remains of <b>the</b> <b>anticipated</b> Somerset oil boom.|$|E

In {{this paper}} we study the {{existence}} and uniqueness of a class of stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motions with arbitrary Hurst parameter H ∈ (0, 1). In particular, the stochastic integrals appearing in the equations are defined in the Skorohod sense on fractional Wiener spaces, and the coefficients are allowed to be random, and even <b>anticipating.</b> <b>The</b> main technique used in this work is an adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>anticipating</b> Girsanov transformation of Buckdahn [4] for the Brownian motion case. By extending a fundamental theorem of Kusuoka [10] using fractional calculus, {{we are able to}} prove that <b>the</b> <b>anticipating</b> Girsanov transformation holds for the fractional Brownian motion case as well. We then use this result to prove the well-posedness of the SDE...|$|R

He was elected easily, and at the request of General William Henry Harrison, commanded troops from Kentucky at the Battle of the Thames. After the war, he declined President James Monroe's offer to become Secretary of War. In his last act of public service, Shelby and Andrew Jackson acted as commissioners to negotiate the Jackson Purchase from the Chickasaw Indian tribe. Isaac Shelby died, at his estate in Lincoln County, Kentucky, on July 18, 1826.|$|E

40|$|Two studies examine if people’s {{inability}} to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment {{effect is a}} result of failed perspective taking. The first study examined the effect of a financial incentive on people’s ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect, using 40 participants from psychology courses at Connecticut College. Analyses were conducted to test for egocentrism, and to determine how a financial incentive would affect people’s ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect. The results indicated that buyers trended toward being egocentric in that they underestimated the sellers’ average selling price (p=. 073), and that a financial incentive was not effective at improving people’s ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect (p=. 917). The second study implemented similarity and difference priming in order to help improve people’s ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect. This study used 81 participants from psychology courses at Connecticut College. The results indicated that the endowment effect only occurred in the control group (p=. 050). Statistical tests were conducted in order to determine whether people lacked <b>the</b> ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect, and if they did, if similarity or difference priming improved their ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect. Analyses revealed that buyers in the control and similarity prime groups had <b>the</b> most difficulty <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect (p=. 089, p=. 060, respectively), whereas sellers and those who were primed for differences tended to be the most accurate. People seem to need help remembering that other people may be different in order to overcome their inaccurate perspectives. The implications of <b>the</b> endowment effect, <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect, and accurate perspective taking are discussed...|$|R
