40|$|Emissions from <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sectors</b> (land <b>transport,</b> {{shipping}} and aviation) {{are among the}} major sources of tropospheric aerosol. Aerosol particles can {{have a significant impact}} on climate and can affect air quality, in particular in urban, densely populated areas, resulting in adverse health effects. The emissions from <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sectors</b> are expected to grow in the near future, especially in the developing countries. At the same time, various mitigation strategies are being applied in order to reduce air pollution and climate impacts. In this work we use the EMAC-MADE global aerosol model to quantify <b>the</b> impact of <b>transport</b> emissions on global aerosol (Figure 1). We consider a present-day (2000) scenario and four future (2030) RCP scenarios from the CMIP 5 emission dataset developed in support of IPCC AR 5. Number emissions are also included in the model and derived from mass emissions under different assumptions on the size distribution of particles emitted by <b>the</b> three <b>transport</b> <b>sectors.</b> Additional sensitivity experiments are performed to quantify the effects of the uncertainties related to such assumptions. The model simulations show that the impact of <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sectors</b> closely matches <b>the</b> emission patterns. Land <b>transport</b> is <b>the</b> most important source of black carbon pollution in the USA, Europe and the Arabian Peninsula (Figure 2). Shipping strongly contributes to aerosol sulphate concentrations along the most-travelled routes of the northern Atlantic and northern Pacific oceans, with a significant effect also along the coastlines. The impact of aviation is mostly confined to the upper-troposphere (7 – 12 km), in the northern mid-latitudes, although significant effects are also simulated at the ground, due to the emissions from landing and take-off cycles. The simulations further reveal that transport-induced perturbations of particle number concentrations are very sensitive to the assumptions on the size distribution of emitted particles, with the largest uncertainties simulated for <b>the</b> land <b>transport</b> <b>sector.</b> <b>The</b> climate impacts, due to aerosol direct and indirect radiative effects, are strongest for the shipping sector, as a consequence of large effects of sulphate aerosol on low marine clouds...|$|R

Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sector</b> in Mexico represents 44.7% of the total final consumption of energy, almost 17% more than the world average (28%). Thus, replacing low fuel efficient transport with alternative fuels is regarded as a considerable contribution to reduce 50% of its GHG emissions by the year 2050, as established by the General Law on Climate Change commitments. Therefore, incentives for PHEVs have been created both at regional and federal levels to decrease cost of ownership for the end-consumers.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009 it was {{reported}} that the Palestinian Authority had been urging Saudi Arabia through back channels to pressure Alstom and Veolia to abandon the project in return for the multi-billion dollar Haramain High Speed Rail Project and the $25 billion Gulf Railway project. The contract for the Haramain project was eventually awarded to a rival bidder. In November 2009, under the banner of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), Palestinian organizations launched a campaign on the six Gulf Cooperation Council states to withhold lucrative contracts for the Gulf railway project from the two companies unless they comply with demands to withdraw from the Jerusalem project. Veolia decided to sell its interests in the light railway, first to Dan Bus Company in 2009, and later to Egged, as part of a strategy to exit the transportation market. Veolia's interest in the Jerusalem Light Rail, together with its other transport business, was injected in 2011 in new subsidiary Veolia Transdev, jointly owned by Veolia and French financial institution Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations.

500|$|Freight {{transport}} by motor vehicles, {{commonly called}} [...] "motor transport" [...] by the Soviet authorities, {{due to the}} underdeveloped nature of the nation's road network, was of considerable significance to {{certain areas of the}} economy. In the 1980s, there were 13 million laborers employed in <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sector.</b> Of those, about 8.5 million were employed in motor transport. Inter-city freight transport remained underdeveloped during the whole Soviet epoch, with it constituting less than 1 percent of the motor-borne freight average. These developments can again be blamed on cost and administrative inefficiencies. Road transport as a whole lagged far behind that of rail transport; the average distance moved by motor transport in 1982 was , while the average for railway transport was 930km per ton and 435km per ton for water freight. In 1982 there was a threefold increase in investment since 1960 in motor freight transport, and more than a thirtyfold increase since 1940. Inter-city transport and the volume of road freight transport had also increased significantly. Motor transport was much cheaper and flexible over short distances (defined as less than 200km) than rail transport. There were many Soviet economists who argued that transferring some 100 million tons from the railways to road transport would save up to 120 million rubles. But in 1975, road transport was ...|$|E
