5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E
5|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> {{have found}} that it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
25|$|My {{sister was}} slim and {{beautiful}} and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E

25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over <b>the</b> <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
500|$|Strindberg had the {{reputation}} of a misogynist, something which all of his wives stoutly denied. Bosse wrote in an unpublished statement which she left to her daughter with Strindberg, Anne-Marie: [...] "During <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> knew and was married to Strindberg I saw only a completely natural, kind, honorable, faithful man—a 'gentleman'". However, all of Strindberg's marriages were blighted by his jealousy and a sensitivity which has sometimes been considered paranoid and delusional.|$|E
500|$|Ford was {{the only}} person to hold the {{president}}ial office without being elected as either president or vice-president. The choice of Ford to fulfill Spiro Agnew's vacated role as vice president was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty. [...] "In all <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word," [...] said Martha Griffiths.|$|E

500|$|Morgan met {{his first}} wife in Kent in the early 1980s. They married in 1982, but he left her when she became {{pregnant}} with twins. He met another woman after moving to Dorset. She also became pregnant, giving birth to a son, and they married in 1994, after living together for several years. Morgan {{had a reputation as}} a womaniser, seducing customers while working as an engineer. He continued this activity after becoming a lorry driver. Following Morgan's conviction, brother Ray Morgan said, [...] "He has had so many affairs over <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> have lost count." [...] He also had a violent temper. One friend, Dave Moemken, described him as being [...] "on a short fuse".|$|E

She acts as a spokeswoman for Avon's cosmetic products and serves as the honorary chair of the Avon Foundation, a charitable organization that supports women and focuses on breast cancer research and the prevention of domestic violence. Witherspoon is also committed to participating in cosmetics product development and appearing in commercial advertisements.

500|$|When {{asked why}} he had not asked Meckiff to bowl {{at the other end}} to gauge the {{judgment}} of the other umpire, Lou Rowan, Benaud replied [...] "over <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> have always accepted the umpire's decision". The Australian captain was criticised for being acquiescent, and one of his predecessors Lindsay Hassett believed Meckiff should have been used at reduced speed. Rowan later indicated his concurrence with Egar, writing in his book The Umpire's Story, [...] "There is nothing I can now say that will alter the opinions already expressed that his [...] delivery was unfair". For his part, Meckiff said: [...] "the game is bigger than the individual" [...] and he backed Benaud's decision because doing otherwise [...] "could only have added fuel to the controversy".|$|E

500|$|McGovern {{had made}} several real estate {{investments}} in the D.C.area and became interested in hotel operations. In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in Stratford, Connecticut, {{with the goal of}} providing a hotel, restaurant and public conference facility. It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in Wall Street Journal and the Nation's Restaurant News. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, [...] "I... wish that during <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> was in public office I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S.senator and a more understanding presidential contender." [...] His statement would still be resonating with American conservatives two decades later.|$|E
500|$|... "Virus Alert" [...] is a style {{parody of}} Sparks, {{specifically}} {{their work in}} the mid-1970s, such as their album Kimono My House (1974). It details [...] "the evil that lurks in your email inbox." [...] "Close but No Cigar" [...] is a style parody of Cake that {{tells the story of}} a man who breaks up with his seemingly perfect girlfriends due to the most inconsequential of flaws. The song was inspired by an actual friend of Yankovic's who was never satisfied with any of his dates; Yankovic later explained that [...] "the song was inspired by [...] attitude, that nothing could ever be good enough." [...] The final original recorded, [...] "Pancreas", is a song mainly about the biological functions of the aforementioned organ. The song is an imitation of the musical stylings of Brian Wilson, specifically his work found on the 1966 album Pet Sounds, released by the Beach Boys, and their aborted follow-up album, Smile. Yankovic joked that the reason the song was written was because [...] "my pancreas has given so much to me over <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> felt like I needed to give something back to it".|$|E
