5|$|Scholarly {{consensus}} favours an Anglo-Saxon, probably Kentish origin for the Bayeux <b>tapestry.</b> This famous {{narrative of}} the Conquest is not a true woven <b>tapestry</b> but an embroidered hanging worked in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures.|$|E

50|$|The <b>tapestries</b> {{are subject}} to {{scholarly}} debate about the iconography, the artists who designed the <b>tapestries,</b> and questions surrounding the sequence {{in which they were}} meant to be hung. Possibly the seven <b>tapestries</b> were not originally hung together.|$|R
5|$|The Oseberg <b>tapestry</b> fragments, {{discovered}} {{within the}} Viking Age Oseberg ship burial in Norway, feature a scene containing two black birds hovering over a horse, possibly originally leading a wagon (as {{a part of}} a procession of horse-led wagons on the <b>tapestry).</b> In her examination of the <b>tapestry,</b> scholar Anne Stine Ingstad interprets these birds as Huginn and Muninn flying over a covered cart containing an image of Odin, drawing comparison with the images of Nerthus attested by Tacitus in 1 CE.|$|E

50|$|Teniers' {{scenes with}} peasants were so {{well known that}} {{compositions}} with this subject {{came to be called}} 'tenierkens' ('small teniers') and <b>tapestries</b> with peasant scenes were referred to as 'Teniers tapestries'. Teniers did not design any Teniers <b>tapestries</b> himself. Only a few of these <b>tapestries</b> can be directly linked to works by Teniers. Teniers <b>tapestries</b> were particularly popular from the last third of the 17th century and well into the 18th century. The Teniers <b>tapestries</b> were woven by many Brussels weavers and also in other centers such as Lille, Oudenaarde, Beauvais and Madrid.|$|R

5|$|The second {{scenario}} {{revolved around}} the discovery of an ancient mausoleum by archaeologists. An ancient virus contained in the mausoleum has quickly killed all the archaeological team, but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented <b>tapestry</b> is hanging inside. The local government is planning to cleanse the area with a fuel-air explosion in 15 minutes, so the scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find the mausoleum, enter it (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the <b>tapestry</b> back prior {{to the destruction of}} the mausoleum and its contents.|$|E

5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving <b>tapestry</b> of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
50|$|The Wawel <b>Tapestries,</b> (mid 16th century) a {{collection}} of 134 <b>tapestries</b> at the Wawel Castle in Kraków, Poland displaying various religious, natural, and royal themes.

5|$|In two {{panels of}} the famous Bayeux <b>tapestry,</b> {{standards}} are shown which appear to be raven banners. The Bayeux <b>tapestry</b> was commissioned by Bishop Odo, the half-brother of William the Conqueror; {{as one of the}} combatants at the Battle of Hastings, Odo would have been familiar with the standards carried into the fight. In one of the panels, depicting a Norman cavalry charge against an English shield-wall, a charging Norman knight is depicted with a semicircular banner emblazoned with a standing black bird. In a second, depicting the deaths of Harold Godwinson's brothers, a triangular banner closely resembling that shown on Olaf Cuaran's coin lies broken on the ground. Scholars are divided as to whether these are simply relics of the Normans' Scandinavian heritage (or for that matter, the Scandinavian influence in Anglo-Saxon England) or whether they reflect an undocumented Norse presence in either the Norman or English army.|$|E
5000|$|The Holy Grail or San Graal <b>tapestries</b> are {{a set of}} six <b>tapestries</b> {{depicting}} {{scenes from}} the legend of King Arthur {{and the quest for}} the Holy Grail. The <b>tapestries</b> were commissioned from Morris & Co. by William Knox D'Arcy in 1890 for his dining room at Stanmore Hall, outside London. [...] Additional versions of the <b>tapestries</b> with minor variations were woven on commission by Morris & Co. over the next decade.|$|R
50|$|In the Lives of the Artists, Giorgio Vasari {{describes}} Gianfrancesco Penni as {{the painter}} of {{large parts of}} the designs for Raphael's <b>tapestries</b> in the Sala del Concistoro. Commissioned by Pope Clement VII, the theme of the <b>tapestries</b> is the life of Christ. The <b>tapestries</b> remained unfinished on Raphael's death, and along with <b>tapestries</b> for the Sala del Consistorio were woven in Brussels. The carved and gilded ceiling contains frescos by Cerubino Alberti and Paul Bril.|$|R
50|$|According to {{the words}} of Elvira Liiver, it is a miracle that the <b>tapestries</b> have {{remained}} until now. In 1909, a city commissioner and a businessman Albert Koba wanted to sell the <b>tapestries</b> and build a school or a hospital from the received money. The tapestries’ war reached from Tallinn’s newspapers’ front pages to the Riga’s and Saint Peterburg's press. By the help of public pressure, the <b>tapestries</b> were not sold. During the First World War, the <b>tapestries</b> traveled in sealed boxes to Moscow and returned home thanks to Jaan Poska with the Treaty of Tartu (Tartu Rahu). The <b>tapestries</b> are the property of the City Museum (Linnamuuseum) since 1937.|$|R
5|$|Paintings {{and other}} {{pictures}} of the Adoration of the Magi may include a depiction of the star in some form. In the fresco by Giotto di Bondone, it is depicted as a comet. In the <b>tapestry</b> of the subject designed by Edward Burne-Jones (and in the related watercolour), the star is held by an angel.|$|E
5|$|The Museum of Reading {{opened in}} 1883 in the town's {{municipal}} buildings.

5|$|Van der Weyden appears {{intelligent}} and handsome, but weather-worn. He inserted a self-portrait into one other work; the lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald, known through a <b>tapestry</b> copy in the Historical Museum of Bern. Later northern artists followed his lead, using self-portraits {{in their own}} depictions of Luke.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, {{a set of}} four large <b>tapestries</b> was {{commissioned}} to commemorate the battle. They were woven by Flemish weavers in Tournai, Belgium.

50|$|The seven {{colorful}} <b>tapestries</b> that {{decorate the}} main building in Tallinn, were ordered from the Netherlands by the Alderman Arent Pakebusch, who had prepaid 150 marka. After finishing the <b>tapestries</b> in 1548, he paid 341,5 marka and 4 killings. Two eight-metres-long <b>tapestries</b> depict Israel’s king and a country gold-coverer Solomon’s stories about his life from the Old Testament.|$|R
5|$|A <b>tapestry</b> copy of Picasso's Guernica {{depicting}} a massacre of innocent {{women and children}} during the Spanish civil war is displayed {{on the wall of}} the United Nations building in New York City, at the entrance to the Security Council room, demonstrably as a spur to the conscience of representatives from the nation states. Albert Tucker painted Man's Head to capture the moral disintegration, and lack of conscience, of a man convicted of kicking a dog to death.|$|E
5|$|After {{dinner on}} 8 September, the guests at Tranby Croft listened to music from Ethel Lycett Green until about 11pm, when the prince {{suggested}} {{a game of}} baccarat. Although the Wilsons {{did not have a}} suitably-sized table, Stanley Wilson improvised, putting two card tables alongside the smoking room table—all of which were of differing sizes—and covered them with a <b>tapestry</b> cloth. Among the evening's players were the prince, who acted as dealer; Sassoon, who took the part of banker; and Gordon-Cumming. Sitting next to the last-named was Stanley Wilson, who was on Levett's left.|$|E
5|$|Ilaiyaraaja {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies and string arrangements in Indian film music. This allowed him to craft a rich <b>tapestry</b> of sounds for films, and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences. The range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by Ilaiyaraaja's methodical approach to arranging, recording technique, and his drawing of ideas from a diversity of musical styles.|$|E
5000|$|Boeckhorst was a {{versatile}} painter who produced history paintings on religious and mythological subjects, allegorical works, genre scenes and portraits.
