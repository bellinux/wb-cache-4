25|$|As fashions {{changed over}} time, the Quaker ideal of plain dress stood out against {{contemporary}} clothing. As a result, the {{traditional forms of}} this practice were dropped by most Friends. Today, {{it is more likely}} that Friends will try to put their faith into action by dressing in a plain version of current fashions— such as avoiding clothing displaying designer labels. They may also try to buy only the clothing they need, and pay more for fairly traded clothing <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> ethically.|$|E
25|$|One {{objection}} <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> to {{this theory}} {{is that it is}} too complex. While it accounts for many possible sentences, it also requires introducing new rules and constraints, and treats bound variable pronouns differently from other types of pronouns. Proponents of this objection, such as linguist Tanya Reinhart, argue that the difference between bound variable pronouns and pronouns of other kinds should be a semantic rather than a syntactic difference. They propose that a syntactic theory that requires less rules would be a more preferable theory.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{progress}} <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> in African sleeping sickness and neglected disease research {{as a whole is}} a result of the other non-public funders. One of these major sources of funding has come from foundations, which have increasingly become more committed to neglected disease drug discovery in the 21st century. In 2012, philanthropic sources provided 15.9% of the total funding. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been a leader in providing funding for neglected disease drug development. They have provided $444.1 million US dollars towards neglected disease research in 2012. To date, they have donated over $1.02 billion US dollars towards the neglected disease discovery efforts.|$|E

500|$|In {{the course}} of the expedition, rumours {{circulated}} that Nansen had reached the North Pole, the first as early as April 1894, in the French Newspaper Le Figaro. In September 1895 Eva Nansen was informed that messages signed by Nansen had been discovered, [...] "sent from the North Pole". In February 1896 The New York Times ran a dispatch from Irkutsk, in Siberia, from a supposed Nansen agent, claiming that Nansen had reached the pole and found land there. Charles P. Daly of the American Geographical Society called this [...] "startling news" [...] and, [...] "if true, the most important discovery <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> in ages." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{day after}} the riot, Northwestern's head coach and team captain sent a {{telegram}} to University of Michigan president C. C. Little disavowing any claim by Northwestern to the Big Ten football championship. [...] They wrote: [...] "In view of the remarkable showing <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> by the 1925 football team of the University of Michigan, we believe that the University of Michigan is entitled to sole and undivided honors in the conference, and we wish you to know that Northwestern makes no claim for any share in them, but regards it as a privilege to be even for a few minutes placed in a class with the University of Michigan's team." [...] Following the announcement, Evanston police continued to guard Northwestern's football field to prevent the burning of the wooden stands. [...] The forces dispatched to the stands included a car mounted with a machine gun.|$|E

"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E
500|$|Christopher Hitchens and Isaac Chotiner {{challenged}} the film's portrayal of Winston Churchill's {{role in the}} abdication crisis. It is well established that Churchill encouraged Edward VIII to resist pressure to abdicate, whereas he is portrayed in the film as strongly supportive of Prince Albert and not opposed to the abdication. Hitchens attributes this treatment to the [...] "cult" [...] surrounding Churchill's legacy. In a smart, well-made film [...] "would the true story not have been fractionally more interesting for the audience?" [...] he wondered. They also criticised the film for failing to indict the appeasement of the era. While the film never directly mentions the issue, Hitchens and Chotiner argue that it implies that George VI was against appeasement, especially in the final scene portraying [...] "Churchill and the King at Buckingham Palace and a speech of unity and resistance being readied for delivery". Far from distancing himself from Chamberlain's appeasement policy, King George VI dispatched a car to meet Neville Chamberlain {{when he returned from}} signing the Munich Agreement with Hitler in September 1938. The King and Chamberlain then stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, acclaimed by cheering crowds. This led historian Steven Runciman to write that by acting as he did to endorse Chamberlain's foreign policy, King George VI perpetrated [...] "the biggest constitutional blunder <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> by any sovereign this century." [...] The Guardian corrected the portrayal of Stanley Baldwin as having resigned due to his refusal to order Britain's re-armament, when he in fact stepped down as [...] "a national hero, exhausted by more than a decade at the top".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{criticism}} <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> is that Markov {{models of}} language, including n-gram models, do not explicitly capture the performance/competence distinction. [...] This is because n-gram models are {{not designed to}} model linguistic knowledge as such, and make no claims to being (even potentially) complete models of linguistic knowledge; instead, they are used in practical applications.|$|E
2500|$|Renford Bambrough {{proposed}} that 'Wittgenstein solved {{what is known}} as [...] "the problem of universals"' and said of his solution (as Hume said of Berkeley's treatment of the same topic) that it is [...] "one of the greatest and most valuable discoveries <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> of late years in the republic of letters".
