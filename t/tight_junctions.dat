5|$|The larger arteries {{throughout}} the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries. These smallest {{of blood vessels}} in the brain, are lined with cells joined by <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries, thereby creating the blood-brain barrier. Pericytes {{play a major role in}} the formation of the <b>tight</b> <b>junctions.</b> The barrier is less permeable to larger molecules, but is still permeable to water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and most fat-soluble substances (including anaesthetics and alcohol). The blood-brain barrier is not present in areas of the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids, such as the pineal gland, area postrema, and some areas of the hypothalamus. There is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which serves the same purpose as the blood–brain barrier, but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems.|$|E
5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E

The permeability properties of this barrier are regulated in response to both physiological and pathophysiological stimuli, and this regulation has been modeled by pharmacological agents.

25|$|The BBB is {{compromised}} due {{to active}} recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes and their migration across the barrier. Release of chemokines {{allow for the}} activation of adhesion molecules on the lymphocytes and monocytes, resulting in an interaction with the endothelial cells of the BBB which then activate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases to degrade the barrier. This results in disruption of the BBB, causing an increase in barrier permeability due to the degradation of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> which maintain barrier integrity. Inducing the formation of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> can restore BBB integrity and reduces its permeability, {{which can be used}} to reduce the damage caused by lymphocyte and monocyte migration across the barrier as restored integrity would restrict their movement.|$|E

Structurally, the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> {{is comprised}} of transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins that are thought to assemble into stable complexes to determine function. In this study, we measure <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> protein dynamics in live confluent Madin–Darby canine kidney monolayers using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and related methods. Mathematical modeling shows {{that the majority of}} claudin- 1 (76 ± 5 %) is stably localized at the <b>tight</b> <b>junction.</b> In contrast, the majority of occludin (71 ± 3 %) diffuses rapidly within the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> with a diffusion constant of 0. 011 μm 2 s− 1. Zonula occludens- 1 molecules are also highly dynamic in this region, but, rather than diffusing within the plane of the membrane, 69 ± 5 % exchange between membrane and intracellular pools in an energy-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> undergoes constant remodeling and suggest that this dynamic behavior may contribute to <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> assembly and regulation...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of gene {{expression}} of <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> proteins Inflammatory bowel disease is frequently associated by increased permeability of the epithelial barrier. The <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> of epithelial cells {{plays an important}} role for barrier function of the intestine. The integrity of the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> can be disturbed by proinflammatory cytokines, which are released during inflammation. Aim {{of the study was to}} identify the promoters as in cis regulatory sequences essential for {{gene expression}} of the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> proteins claudin- 1, - 2, - 3, and - 4 and to investigate the effect of proinflammatory cytokines on promoter activity. Incubation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha reduced the activity of all four promoters, whereas interferon-gamma had no effect. The incubation of the promoter for claudin- 2, a protein which can increase the permeability of the epithelial <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> by forming cation selective pores, with interleukin- 6 led to an elevation of promoter activity. It can be concluded that the epithelial <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> is influenced by cytokines which can affect the promoter of <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> proteins during inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial paracellular barrier function, {{determined}} {{primarily by}} <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> permeability, is frequently disrupted in disease. In the intestine, barrier loss can be mediated by tumor necrosis factor (alpha) (TNF) signaling and epithelial myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activation. However, TNF induces only limited alteration of <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> morphology, {{and the events}} that couple structural reorganization to barrier regulation have not been defined. We have used in vivo imaging and transgenic mice expressing fluorescent-tagged occludin and ZO- 1 fusion proteins to link occludin endocytosis to TNF-induced <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> regulation. This endocytosis requires caveolin- 1 and is essential for structural and functional <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> regulation.

40|$|Abstract Background Zonula occludens, {{also known}} as the <b>tight</b> <b>junction,</b> is a {{specialized}} cell-cell interaction characterized by membrane "kisses" between epithelial cells. A cytoplasmic plaque of ~ 100 nm corresponding to a meshwork of densely packed proteins underlies the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> membrane domain. Due to its enormous size and difficulties in obtaining a biochemically pure fraction, the molecular composition of the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> remains largely unknown. Results A novel biochemical purification protocol has been developed to isolate <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> protein complexes from cultured human epithelial cells. After identification of proteins by mass spectroscopy and fingerprint analysis, candidate proteins are scored and assessed individually. A simple algorithm has been devised to incorporate transmembrane domains and protein modification sites for scoring membrane proteins. Using this new scoring system, a total of 912 proteins have been identified. These 912 hits are analyzed using a bioinformatics approach to bin the hits in 4 categories: configuration, molecular function, cellular function, and specialized process. Prominent clusters of proteins related to the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and vesicular traffic have been identified. Weaker clusters of proteins associated with cell growth, cell migration, translation, and transcription are also found. However, the strongest clusters belong to synaptic proteins and signaling molecules. Localization studies of key components of synaptic transmission have confirmed the presence of both presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins at the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> domain. To correlate proteomics data with structure, the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> has been examined using electron microscopy. This has revealed many novel structures including end-on cytoskeletal attachments, vesicles fusing/budding at the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> membrane domain, secreted substances encased between the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> kisses, endocytosis of <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> double membranes, satellite Golgi apparatus and associated vesicular structures. A working model of the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> consisting of multiple functions and sub-domains has been generated using the proteomics and structural data. Conclusion This study provides an unbiased proteomics and bioinformatics approach to elucidate novel functions of the <b>tight</b> <b>junction.</b> The approach has revealed an unexpected cluster associating with synaptic function. This surprising finding suggests that the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> may be a novel epithelial synapse for cell-cell communication.

40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} of autoimmune diseases is increasing {{along with the}} expansion of industrial food processing and food additive consumption. The intestinal epithelial barrier, with its intercellular <b>tight</b> <b>junction,</b> controls the equilibrium between tolerance and immunity to non-self-antigens. As a result, particular attention is being placed {{on the role of}} <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD. <b>Tight</b> <b>junction</b> leakage is enhanced by many luminal components, commonly used industrial food additives being some of them. Glucose, salt, emulsifiers, organic solvents, gluten, microbial transglutaminase, and nanoparticles are extensively and increasingly used by the food industry, claim the manufacturers, to improve the qualities of food. However, all of the aforementioned additives increase intestinal permeability by breaching the integrity of <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> paracellular transfer. In fact, <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> dysfunction is common in multiple autoimmune diseases and the central part played by the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> in autoimmune diseases pathogenesis is extensively described. It is hypothesized that commonly used industrial food additives abrogate human epithelial barrier function, thus, increasing intestinal permeability through the opened <b>tight</b> <b>junction,</b> resulting in entry of foreign immunogenic antigens and activation of the autoimmune cascade. Future research on food additives exposure-intestinal permeability–autoimmunity interplay will enhance our knowledge of the common mechanisms associated with autoimmune progression...|$|R
40|$|In {{polarized}} epithelial cells, the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> {{has been}} ascribed several functions including {{the regulation of}} the paracellular permeability, an impediment to the diffusion of molecules between the apical and basolateral domains, a site of delivery of transport vesicles for basolateral proteins, and a scaffold for structural and signaling molecules. The <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> is anchored physically into the apical actin cytoskeleton circumscribing the cell, which {{is known as the}} perijunctional actomyosin ring. This connection was first suggested by experiments using the actin depolymerizing drug cytochalasin, which was also found to disrupt the transepithelial permeability. Since then a large number of studies have reported the effects of drugs, molecular tools, or physiological and pathological conditions that alter coordinately actin organization and the <b>tight</b> <b>junction.</b> In support of this model, proteins of the <b>tight</b> <b>junction,</b> such as the members of the ZO family and occludin, have been shown to bind to actin. However, very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms by which the actin cytoskeleton modulates <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> functions. We have studied the role of the Exchange Factor for Arf 6, EFA 6, in <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> assembly. By combining a large panel of methods, including morphological, physiological, and biochemical, described in detail hereafter we demonstrated that EFA 6 plays a role in the physical association of the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> to the perijunctional actomyosin ring...|$|R

25|$|Water {{absorption}} at {{the colon}} typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives {{water into the}} lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.|$|E
25|$|MMP-3 {{has been}} implicated in {{exacerbating}} the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) through its disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Different {{studies have shown that}} after the brain undergoes trauma and inflammation has begun, MMP production in the brain is increased. In a study conducted using MMP-3 wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice, MMP-3 was shown to increase BBB permeability after traumatic injury. The WT mice were shown to have lower claudin-5 and occludin levels than the KO mice after TBI. Claudin and occludin are proteins that are essential for the formation of the <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> between the cells of the blood-brain barrier. Tissue from uninjured WT and KO mice brains was also treated with active MMP-3. Both the WT and KO tissues showed a drop in claudin-5, occludin, and laminin-α1 (a basal lamina protein), suggesting that MMP-3 directly destroys tight junction and basal lamina proteins.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> of {{epithelial}} cells excludes macromolecules but allows permeation of ions. However, {{it is not}} clear whether this ion-conducting property is mediated by aqueous pores or by ion channels. To investigate the permeability properties of the <b>tight</b> <b>junction,</b> we have developed paracellular ion flux assays for four major extracellular ions, Na+, Cl−, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 +. We found that the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> shares biophysical properties with conventional ion channels, including size and charge selectivity, dependency of permeability on ion concentration, competition between permeant molecules, anomalous mole-fraction effects, and sensitivity to pH. Our results support the hypothesis that discrete ion channels are present at the <b>tight</b> <b>junction.</b> Unlike conventional ion channels, which mediate ion transport across lipid bilayers, the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> channels must orient parallel to the plane of the plasma membranes to support paracellular ion movements. This new class of paracellular-tight junction channels (PTJC) facilitates the transport of ions between separate extracellular compartments...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> determines paracellular {{transport}} having mainly sealing function. However, numerous <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> proteins {{belonging to}} the family of claudins mediate permeability by forming paracellular channels with specific selectivity for cations, anions or water. The first subchapter of this essay deals with a channel-forming <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> protein. It was shown that the so far uncharacterized claudin- 17 forms anion-selective paracellular channels and was predominantly localized within the nephron. The observed anion selectivity was determinated by charged amino acids of its both extracellular loops. Transfer of these positions onto a structural model of claudin- 17 showed that the respective residues were located at the beginning, inside {{and at the end of}} a hypothetical furrow of the claudin- 17 based channel. Based on these results a first hypothetical structural model of a claudin-polymer-formed anion channel was presented. The second subchapter focused on barrier-forming <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> proteins. These qualify as targets of absorption enhancers affecting the paracellular barrier. Absorption enhancers are used to allow epi- and endothelial uptake of mid-size and macromolecular solutes, e. g. pharmaceuticals, which are usually hardly resorbed. For this, they open the <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> transiently. Three different approaches for enhanced absorption were presented. In the first study, a signaling pathway involved in the absorption enhancer-facilitated uptake of local anesthetics at the peripheral blood-nerve-barrier was elucidated resulting in down-regulation of claudin- 1. The second study suitable mutations of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin were used for interaction with several barrier-forming claudins resulting in loss of barrier function. In the third study, effects of the fatty acid salt caprate were analyzed, resulting in tow findings: while the claudin- 5 was removed from the bicellular <b>tight</b> <b>junction,</b> tricellulin was removed from the tricellular <b>tight</b> <b>junction.</b> Using fluorescence imaging we further showed that a 607 Da-sized molecule (biotin) was passing the tricellular <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> after caprate application. From these data hypothesize a novel way of paracellular transport for ions and macromolecules: while ions and small solutes pass the bicellular <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> in quantitatively relevant amounts through claudin-based paracellular channels, macromolecules pass through the 10 nm big central pore of the tricellular <b>tight</b> <b>junction...</b>|$|R

25|$|The blood–brain barrier acts very {{effectively}} {{to protect the}} brain from most pathogens. Thus, blood-borne infections of the brain are very rare. Infections {{of the brain that}} do occur are often very serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass. In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. However, not all drugs that are delivered directly to the CSF can effectively penetrate the CSF barrier and enter the brain. The blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation. This allows some antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the BBB. Examples of pathogens that can traverse the BBB and the diseases they cause include toxoplasma gondii which causes toxoplasmosis, spirochetes like Borrelia which causes Lyme disease, Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns, and Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis.
