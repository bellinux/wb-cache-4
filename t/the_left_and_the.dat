5|$|According to {{the terms}} of the new alliance, during the late summer, the Christian fleet {{assembled}} at Messina, under the command of Don John of Austria, who arrived on 23 August. By that time, however, Famagusta had fallen, and any effort to save Cyprus was meaningless. Before setting sail for the east, Don John {{had to deal with the}} mutual distrust and hostility among the various contingents, especially between the Venetians and the Genoese. The Spanish admiral tackled the problem by breaking the various contingents up and mingle ships from various states. Doria assumed command of the right wing, Don Juan kept the centre, the Venetian Agostino Barbarigo received <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Spaniard Alvaro de Bazan the reserve. Unaware of Famagusta's fate, the allied fleet left Messina on 16 September, and ten days later arrived at Corfu, where it learned of the Ottoman victory. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Müezzinzade Ali Pasha, had anchored at Lepanto (Nafpaktos), near the entrance of the Corinthian Gulf.|$|E

The brigade positioned itself between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right. Taking the lead, the regiment advanced close enough by 14:30 to charge the position on horseback, then dismounted and continued the attack on foot, all in the face of heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. No progress was made and they {{spent the rest of the}} day returning fire from cover. The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded.|$|E

5|$|In {{seeking the}} 51st House {{district}} state house seat, representing Loveland, Marostica first faced a challenge from Kevan McNaught in the Republican primary. McNaught {{was endorsed by}} the Colorado Club for Growth, who criticized Marostica for his support of higher taxes and his use of eminent domain {{when he was a}} member the Loveland city council. Marostica edged out McNaught in the Republican primary by about 250 votes, or 5% of voters. In contrast with McNaught's conservative credentials, Marostica was considered by observers on both <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right to be a moderate Republican; he supported Colorado's 2005 Referendum C, a loosening of state spending restrictions under the state's Taxpayer Bill of Rights.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{explore the}} {{underlying}} mechanism {{of depression in}} asthmatic patients, the ReHo in <b>the</b> insula <b>and</b> its FC was used to probe the differences between depressed asthmatic (DA) and nondepressed asthmatic (NDA) patients. Methods. 18 DA patients, 24 NDA patients, and 60 healthy controls (HCs) received resting-state fMRI scan, severity of depression, and asthma control assessment. Results. DA patients showed increased FC between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> ventral anterior insula (vAI) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> middle temporal gyrus compared with both NDA and HC groups. In addition, compared with HCs, <b>the</b> DA <b>and</b> NDA patients both exhibited increased FC between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> vAI <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), decreased FC between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> vAI <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bilateral parietal lobe, and increased FC between <b>the</b> right vAI <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> putamen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right caudate, respectively. Furthermore, the increased FC between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> vAI <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right ACC could differentiate HCs from both DA and NDA patients, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> increased FC between <b>the</b> right vAI <b>and</b> both <b>the</b> <b>left</b> putamen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right caudate could separate NDA patients from HCs. Conclusions. This study confirmed that abnormal vAI FC {{may be involved in}} the neuropathology of depression in asthma. The increased FC between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> vAI <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> MTG could distinguish DA from <b>the</b> NDA <b>and</b> HC groups...|$|R

Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 November 1757 the Prussian camp lay between Rossbach on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> village of Bedra on the right, facing the Allies. Charles, the Prince Soubise, {{commanding}} the French, and the Prince Saxe-Hildburghausen, commanding the Holy Roman Empire's forces, had maneuvered in the preceding days without giving Frederick an opportunity to begin fighting. Their forces were located to the west, with their right flank {{near the town of}} Branderoda and their left at Mücheln. The advanced posts of the Prussians stood in villages immediately west of their camp, those of the Allies on the Schortau hill and the Galgenberg.|$|E

5|$|Some {{distinctive}} {{characteristics in}} Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} eye and the bowl of the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters {{on the model of}} Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on <b>the</b> <b>left)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the italic 'h' bends inwards.|$|E
5|$|The UN counterattack at Inchon {{collapsed}} the North Korean {{line and}} forced {{them back on}} all fronts. On 16 September, however, 25th Infantry Division was still fighting North Korean forces behind its lines, and North Korean strong points existed on the heights of Battle Mountain, P'il-bong, and Sobuk-san. Kean felt that the division could advance along the roads toward Chinju only when the mountainous center of the division front was clear. He therefore believed {{that the key to}} the advance of the 25th Division lay in its center where the North Koreans held the heights and kept the 24th Infantry Regiment under daily attack. The 27th Infantry on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 35th Infantry on the right, astride the roads between Chinju and Masan held their positions and could not advance until the situation in front of the 24th Infantry improved.|$|E

Cornwallis' British men were declared prisoners of war, promised good treatment in American camps, and officers were permitted to return home after taking their parole.

5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} started advancing {{towards the}} village, the 8th Squadron on <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 10th with the 1st Squadron on the right. Covered by their machine-guns, but under heavy Turkish fire, they gradually moved forward on foot. Troops took turns to run forward {{while the rest}} of the squadron covered them. The intensity of the battle was demonstrated by the Inverness Battery Royal Horse Artillery, which was supporting the brigade and ran out of ammunition at 14:00. Two hours later the division's covering force reported Turkish reinforcements approaching, and Lieutenant-General Philip Chetwode, who was commanding the attack, decided to call it off. Almost simultaneously Edward Chaytor, commanding the brigade, ordered another attack. Covered by their machine-guns the men carried out a bayonet charge and the Turks to their front surrendered. By this time the other brigades had started to withdraw, but seeing what had happened, they turned back and also charge, capturing the position. The battle cost the regiment six dead and nineteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was being}} {{pressured}} by the divisional commander {{to increase the speed}} of the advance, Whitehead was said to be reasonably happy with the progress being made by the 2/48th along the central route, although he had misgivings about the performance of the 2/23rd on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 2/24th on the right. To some extent, the failure of the 2/24th to take the 2,200 feature could be attributed to the importance which the Japanese commander, Katagiri, placed upon its defence, however, Whitehead believed that the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Gillespie, was procrastinating and being overly cautious in his tactics. Nevertheless, it was later realised that the terrain which the 2/24th faced was more formidable than first thought, and that in order for the battalion to make progress, they too, like the 2/48th, would need tanks. Some attempt was made by the Australians to bring these up from the rear areas, but ultimately the fighting around Sattelberg came to an end before this could be effected. On the brigade's left, south of the main route, the pace of the 2/23rd's advance had also caused Whitehead some concern. Indeed, Whitehead went as far to express this to the 2/23rd's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Tucker, who pointed out that his lack of progress had been caused by the large number of tasks that the battalion had been assigned, namely the competing demands to secure the flank while attempting to move quickly through broken country in order to make its scheduled rendezvous with the 2/48th.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in May 1957, bids {{opened for}} the part of US 80 between Grossmont Boulevard in La Mesa and Chase Avenue in El Cajon, that would connect to the new SR 67 freeway. Groundbreaking took place on June 10, and the project was to cost $3.6 million. The {{rebuilding}} of the Cabrillo Freeway interchange became a priority due to the availability of federal funding, and due to the traffic problems encountered with having ramps entering from both <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right. In July, the Highway Development Association decided to formally {{raise the issue of}} the incomplete highway survey through Imperial County at the next California Highway Commission meeting. In 1958, federal funds were allocated to construct US 80 from Taylor Street to Fairmount Avenue as an eight-lane freeway, and from there to 70th Street as a divided highway. In August, the state announced that there were four proposed routes for US 80 through the mountains, including one with a tunnel. A contract was later awarded to construct the freeway from Taylor Street to the Cabrillo Freeway at a cost of $1.2 million. In November, Caltrans announced that the Walker Canyon route had been chosen for US 80, which would allow for the route to be constructed in stages, as well as being the least expensive alternative.|$|E

For a short distance, the three northbound lanes are on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> three southbound lanes are on the right, contrary to the normal traffic arrangement in the US. This anomaly is reversed north of the ramps for I-196 as the southbound lanes go over the northbound lanes. Running parallel to the Grand River on the west bank, the freeway designation begins {{across the river from}} the 6th Street Bridge Park and Belknap Hill north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum and the DeVos Place Convention Center. The west side of the freeway faces residential neighborhoods and the east side borders commercial businesses and the river. South of the Ann Street interchange, the highway crosses a line of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad. After crossing both the railroad and Ann Street, the highway widens to allow for a grassy median. The freeway leaves Grand Rapids and enters Walker north of Ann Street.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Thinang Chakri Maha Prasat {{buildings}} {{are composed of}} nine major and minor halls, structured in a similar scheme to the Maha Monthien Halls from north to south, however the two building groups contrasts greatly in styles. This group of palaces is situated at the centre, between the Maha Montein and Maha Prasat groups. The whole of the Chakri Maha Prasat group {{was the work of}} King Rama V and foreign architects in the 19th century. During the reign of King Rama I the area was once an expansive garden, later named Suan Sai (สวนซ้าย) or 'Left Garden', the twin of Suan Khwa (สวนขวา) or right garden, now the Siwalai Gardens. The two gardens were named according to their location on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right of the Maha Monthien buildings. During the reign of King Rama III a new residential pavilion called Phra Tamnak Tuek (พระตำหนักตึก) was constructed for his mother, Princess Mother Sri Sulalai. The new residence was composed of several low-lying buildings and pavilions. King Rama IV expanded the residence and gave it to his consort Queen Debsirindra. Within these buildings King Rama V was born (in 1853) and lived as a child.|$|E
