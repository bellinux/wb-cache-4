5|$|Increased {{traffic in}} the mid-1980s changed the politician's interests, and in 1988 Parliament voted {{to build a new}} main airport at Hurum, located on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Oslo as Fornebu, but further away. However, new weather data showed that Hurum was unsuitable, and the {{location}} was discarded. There were accusations that the data was fabricated to manipulate the political decision. In 1992, parliament made a final vote that started construction of a new airport at Gardermoen and mandated the closure of Fornebu.|$|E
5|$|The {{neutral zone}} {{that had been}} {{allocated}} to Belgian fans was largely occupied by Juventus supporters, {{many of whom were}} from the local Italian community. The neutral zone was in section Z, on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the ground as the Liverpool fans. The two groups thus stood yards apart, separated only by chicken wire. At approximately 7p.m., missiles began to be thrown between the two sets of fans; because the stadium was crumbling, fans could pick stones up and throw them across the divide.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} on the back wall are recognized as representing Minerva Punishing Arachne and Apollo's Victory Over Marsyas. Both stories involve Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom and patron of the arts. These two legends are both stories of mortals challenging gods and the dreadful consequences. One scholar {{points out that the}} legend dealing with two women, Minerva and Arachne, is on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the mirror as the queen's reflection while the male legend {{is on the side of}} the king.|$|E

5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves {{control all}} intrinsic {{muscles of the}} larynx except for the cricothyroid muscle. These muscles act to open, close, and adjust the tension of the vocal cords, and include the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscle to open the vocal cords. The nerves supply muscles on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body, {{with the exception of}} the interarytenoid muscle, which is innervated from both sides.|$|E
5|$|Engine failure causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.|$|E
5|$|Federer's next {{participation}} was in September in the inaugural Laver Cup, representing team Europe. Federer played his first singles match on day two, where he dispatched Sam Querrey in straight sets. Later on day two, he partnered with his rival Nadal in doubles, where they defeated the Team World duo of Sam Querrey and Jack Sock in the match tie breaker, {{which took place}} at one set all. This {{was the first time}} Federer and Nadal competed on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a doubles match. On day three, Federer competed in the final match of the tournament, where he sealed victory for Team Europe by defeating Nick Kyrgios in the champion's tiebreak (saving a match point). With three wins and seven points, Federer was the most accomplished player of the tournament.|$|E

50|$|Of {{surgical}} importance are two {{branches of}} the facial nerve that also pass through the middle ear space. These are the horizontal portion {{of the facial nerve}} and the chorda tympani. Damage to the horizontal branch during ear surgery can lead to paralysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face (<b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face as the ear). The chorda tympani is the branch of the facial nerve that carries taste from <b>the</b> ipsilateral half (<b>same</b> <b>side)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue.|$|R
5|$|Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern flatfish is their asymmetry, with both eyes on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always {{on the right side}} of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish) and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E
5|$|The okapi can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with the giraffe. While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe, only males bear horns in the okapi. The okapi has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs {{on either side of}} the body - and a long black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful in plucking buds and leaves as well as for grooming.|$|E
5|$|Bret Hart {{was booked}} {{to face his}} brother Owen, with whom {{he was in the}} middle of a feud. The storyline between the Hart {{brothers}} began at Survivor Series 1993, where they were competing on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> an elimination match. As Owen was fighting in the ring, Bret, who had sustained a kayfabe injury, was staggering along the ring apron. Owen ran into Bret, causing Owen to lose his focus and get eliminated from the match. After the match, Owen returned to the ring and had a confrontation with Bret. In the following weeks, Owen demanded a match with Bret, but Bret refused to accept the challenge. Eventually, the storyline had the brothers reunite to face The Quebecers at Royal Rumble 1994. During the match, Bret sustained another kayfabe injury, causing the referee to end the match. In a planned turn, Owen got upset by the loss and attacked Bret to restart the feud.|$|E

5|$|The {{solution}} circle may {{be either}} internally or externally tangent {{to each of}} the given circles. An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they lie {{on opposite sides of the}} tangent line at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an internal tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E
