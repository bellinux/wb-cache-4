25|$|The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) is an American {{environmental}} science satellite. The spacecraft {{is used to}} study carbon dioxide concentrations and distributions in the atmosphere. ATK produced the OCO-2's Variable Conductance Heat Pipes, {{an important part of}} its <b>thermal</b> <b>control</b> system, solar arrays, and solar array substrates.|$|E
25|$|If the PTCS cannot keep up {{with the}} heat load, an External Active <b>Thermal</b> <b>Control</b> System (EATCS) {{maintains}} the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space, and is circulated through radiators to remove the heat. The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including Kibō and Columbus, as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70kW. This is much more than the 14kW of the Early External Active <b>Thermal</b> <b>Control</b> System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss.|$|E

25|$|Water is {{consumed}} by crew members for drinking, cleaning activities, EVA <b>thermal</b> <b>control,</b> and emergency uses. It must be stored, used, and reclaimed (from waste water) efficiently since no on-site sources currently {{exist for the}} environments reached {{in the course of}} human space exploration. Future lunar missions may utilise water sourced from polar ices; Mars missions may utilise water from the atmosphere or ice deposits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>control</b> is {{maintained}} {{through the use}} of radiators, multi-layer insulation, and actively controlled heaters. The spacecraft must provide a benign environment for the instruments and on-board equipment. Two instruments, PFS and OMEGA, have infrared detectors that need to be kept at very low temperatures (about −180°C). The sensors on the camera (HRSC) also need to be kept cool. But the rest of the instruments and on-board equipment function best at room temperatures (10–20°C).|$|E
25|$|The Express Logistics Carrier 4 (ELC-4) carried several Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs). Among {{these were}} a Heat Rejection System Radiator (HRSR) Flight Support Equipment (FSE), which takes up one whole {{side of the}} ELC. The other primary ORUs were the ExPRESS Pallet Controller Avionics 4 (ExPCA #4). The HRSR {{launching}} on ELC4 was a spare, if needed, {{for one of the}} six radiators {{that are part of the}} station's external active <b>thermal</b> <b>control</b> system.|$|E

25|$|Parker Hannifin {{supplies}} the complete fuel package: inerting system, fuel measurement and management systems, mechanical equipment and fuel pumps. The fuel tank inerting system features air-separation modules to generate nitrogen-enriched air {{to reduce the}} flammability of fuel vapour in the tanks. Parker also provides hydraulic power generation and distribution system: reservoirs, manifolds, accumulators, <b>thermal</b> <b>control,</b> isolation, software and new engine- and electric motor-driven pump designs. Parker estimates the contracts will generate more than $2billion in revenues {{over the life of}} the programme.|$|E
25|$|The station's {{systems and}} {{experiments}} consume {{a large amount}} of electrical power, almost all of which converts to heat. Little of this heat dissipates through the walls of the station. To keep the internal ambient temperature within comfortable, workable limits, ammonia is continuously pumped through pipes throughout the station to collect heat, then into external radiators to emit infrared radiation, then back into the station. Thus this passive <b>thermal</b> <b>control</b> system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes.|$|E

25|$|Discussions on {{providing}} a docking module for the Shuttle-Mir programme began in May 1993 and approval was granted on 1 November, with the draft plan {{being developed by}} December. The module consisted of what were essentially two Soyuz TM-16 type Soyuz orbital modules cut in half, with a cylindrical central portion mounted {{in the center of}} the two halves which incorporated docking apparatus (the other two halves were not used). An APAS-89 docking port was mounted on each end. Mounting points were also provided for two boxes (containing new solar arrays) and other external experiments, and the module was provided with its own <b>thermal</b> <b>control,</b> television transmission, and telemetry systems. Rather than being covered in a newly-manufactured white thermal blanket, the module was flown with an unusual orange blanket, which was selected from pre-existing stock for financial reasons. Development of the simplified module was given priority over the more complex Mir-2 type SO-1, and the flight model, the first to make use of NASA's new Space Station Processing Facility, was delivered to Kennedy Space Center on 7 June 1995 alongside the new solar arrays which were to be launched with it.|$|E

500|$|The {{telescope}} {{is housed in}} an onion-shaped steel dome with an internal diameter of , manufactured by Brittain Steel. The telescope mount is located on a cylindrical concrete pier so that the centre of rotation is [...] above ground level, which lifts the telescope above ground-layer air turbulence for better seeing. A conventional up-down 6m-wide shutter with wind-blind, several large vents with extractor fans for <b>thermal</b> <b>control,</b> and a [...] capacity crane (used for moving the primary mirror e.g. for aluminising) are all incorporated. The {{size and shape of}} the shutter allow observations down to 12° above the horizon, which corresponds to an airmass of 4.8. The total moving mass of the dome is , which is mounted on top of a three-storey cylindrical building. The dome was designed to minimise wind stresses and can support up to its own weight again in ice during inclement weather. The dome and telescope rest on separate sets of foundations (driven [...] down into the volcanic basalt), to prevent vibrations caused by dome rotation or wind stresses on the building affecting the telescope pointing.|$|E

50|$|All optics {{are subject}} to {{manufacturing}} tolerances; even with perfect manufacture, optical trains experience thermal expansion. Focus mechanisms must accommodate part variations; even custom-built systems may have some means of adjustment.

The study found that for controlling mould growth on indoor surfaces there are two options available for different climatic conditions and housing designs: a conventional method for buildings designed for permanent <b>thermal</b> active <b>controls</b> and a newer method using passive building design and passive controls to keep the indoor relative humidity under 80 %. Implications from the study include the passive prevention of winter mould growth in houses without permanent active <b>thermal</b> <b>controls,</b> insulation levels and thermal resistance, appropriate insulation levels to prevent mould growth, winter daytime cross ventilation, temporary exhaust fan ventilation and temporary heating and their impacts on decreasing mean indoor relative humidity levels and the relative humidity of air near ceilings.
