5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop {{became interested in the}} possibilities of the instrument, hoping it would allow them to increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E
5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.|$|E
25|$|Cassette {{playback}} {{suffered from}} some flaws frustrating to both professionals and home recording enthusiasts. <b>Tape</b> <b>speed</b> could vary between devices, resulting in pitch {{that was too}} low or too high. Speed often was calibrated at the factory, {{and could not be}} changed by users. The slow <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> increased tape hiss and noise, and in practice delivered higher values of wow and flutter. Different tape formulation and noise reduction schemes artificially boosted or cut high frequencies and inadvertently elevated noise levels. Noise reduction also adds some artifacts to the sound, which a trained ear can hear sometimes quite easily.|$|E
50|$|Professional decks {{will use}} higher <b>tape</b> <b>speeds,</b> with 15 and 30 {{inches per second}} being most common, while lower <b>tape</b> <b>speeds</b> are usually used for smaller {{recorders}} and cassette players, {{in order to save}} space where fidelity is not as critical as in professional recorders. By providing a range of <b>tape</b> <b>speeds,</b> users can trade-off recording time against signal quality with higher <b>tape</b> <b>speeds</b> providing greater frequency response.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>tape</b> <b>speeds</b> {{which are in}} use {{in all sorts of}} <b>tape</b> recorders. <b>Speed</b> may be {{expressed}} in centimeters per second (cm/s) or in inches per second (in/s).|$|R
50|$|In general, {{the faster}} the speed, the better the {{reproduction}} quality. In addition, higher <b>tape</b> <b>speeds</b> spread the signal longitudinally over more tape area, reducing the effects of dropouts that can be audible from the medium. Slower <b>tape</b> <b>speeds</b> conserve <b>tape</b> and are useful in applications where sound quality is not critical.|$|R
25|$|For his tape {{recorders}} the specified recording times {{were at the}} highest Hi-Fi <b>tape</b> <b>speed.</b> High-fidelity – or hi-fi – reproduction is a term used by home stereo listeners and home audio enthusiasts (audiophiles) to refer to high-quality reproduction of sound or images that are very faithful to the original performance.|$|E
25|$|The album {{also served}} as a soundtrack album to a {{proposed}} science fiction film which would not be completed, though a direct-to-video film containing test footage from the project was released by Frank Zappa in 1987. The music is diverse in style, drawing from orchestral, jazz, blues and rock music. Uncle Meat was a commercial success upon release, and has been highly acclaimed for its innovative recording and editing techniques, including experiments in manipulation of <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> and overdubbing, and its diverse sound.|$|E
25|$|News reporting, documentary, {{and human}} {{interest}} broadcast operations often used portable Marantz PMD-series recorders for {{the recording of}} speech interviews. The key advantages of the Marantz portable recorders were the accommodation of professional microphones with an XLR connector, normal and double <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> recording for extended frequency response, Dolby and dbx noise reduction systems, manual or automatic gain control (AGC) level control, peak limiter, multiple tape formulation accommodation, microphone and line level input connections, unbalanced RCA stereo input and output connections, live or tape monitoring, VU meter, headphone jack, playback pitch control, and operation on AC power or batteries optimized for long duration. Unlike less-expensive portable recorders that were limited to automatic gain control (AGC) recording schemes, the manual recording mode preserved low noise dynamics and avoided the automatic elevation of noise.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{negative}} aspects of narrow head gaps, particularly for magnetic recording. The narrower the head gap, the more bias signal must be used to maintain linearity of the signal on tape which in turn will reduce the high frequency headroom or SOL (Saturated Output Level), particularly with slower <b>tape</b> <b>speeds.</b> Manufacturers must find a compromise between intended <b>tape</b> <b>speeds</b> and head gaps for this reason.|$|R
50|$|For home use, simpler reel-to-reel {{recorders}} were available, and {{a number}} of track formats and <b>tape</b> <b>speeds</b> were standardised to permit interoperability and prerecorded music.|$|R
5000|$|Because video signals have a {{very high}} bandwidth, and {{stationary}} heads would require extremely high <b>tape</b> <b>speeds,</b> in most cases, a helical-scan video head rotates against the moving tape to record the data in two dimensions.|$|R
25|$|The first {{electronic}} devices for performing music were {{developed at the}} end of the 19th century, and shortly afterward Italian futurists explored sounds that had not been considered musical. During the 1920s and 1930s, electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions for electronic instruments were made. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s, in Egypt and France. Musique concrète, created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s. An important new development was the advent of computers to compose music. Algorithmic composition was first demonstrated in Australia in 1951.|$|E
500|$|Portions of The Beatles' final Star-Club {{performances}} (along {{with other}} acts) were {{recorded by the}} club's stage manager, Adrian Barber, for Ted [...] "Kingsize" [...] Taylor. Barber used a Grundig home reel-to-reel recorder at a <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> of 3¾ inches per second, with a single microphone {{placed in front of}} the stage. Taylor, leader of The Dominoes (who were also playing at the club), said that John Lennon verbally agreed to the group being recorded in exchange for Taylor providing the beer during their performances.|$|E
500|$|A {{key feature}} of Sgt. Pepper is Martin and Emerick's liberal use of signal {{processing}} {{to shape the}} sound of the recording, which included the application of dynamic range compression, reverberation and signal limiting. Relatively new modular effects units were used, such as running voices and instruments through a Leslie speaker. Several innovative production techniques feature prominently on the recordings, including direct injection, pitch control and ambiophonics. Another is automatic double tracking (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. Although it had long been recognised that using multitrack tape to record doubled lead vocals produced an enhanced sound, before ADT it had been necessary to record such vocal tracks twice, a task that was both tedious and exacting. ADT was invented by Townsend during the Revolver sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who disliked tracking sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a technical solution to the problem. The process soon became a common recording practice in popular music. Martin playfully explained to Lennon that his voice had been [...] "treated with a double vibrocated sploshing flange... It doubles your voice, John." [...] Lennon realised that Martin was joking, but from that point on he referred to the effect as flanging, a label that was universally adopted by the music industry. Another important effect was varispeeding. Martin cites [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] as having the most variations of <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> on Sgt. Pepper. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.|$|E
50|$|Both NTSC and PAL/SECAM Betamax {{cassettes}} {{are physically}} identical (although the signals recorded {{on the tape}} are incompatible). However, as <b>tape</b> <b>speeds</b> differ between NTSC and PAL/SECAM, the playing time for any given cassette will vary accordingly between the systems. Other unusual lengths were produced from time to time, such as L-410.|$|R
5000|$|Standard <b>tape</b> <b>speeds</b> {{varied by}} factors of two — 15 and 30 in/s {{were used for}} {{professional}} audio recording; [...] for home audiophile prerecorded tapes; [...] for audiophile and consumer recordings (typically on [...] reels). [...] and occasionally even [...] were used for voice, dictation, and applications where very long recording times were needed, such as logging police and fire department calls.|$|R

500|$|The {{inclusion}} of reversed tape sounds on [...] "Rain" [...] (specifically, {{a portion of}} Lennon's vocal part) marked the first pop release to use this technique, although the Beatles had first used it, {{in some of the}} tape loops and the overdubbed guitar solo, on [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows". The backwards (or backmasked) guitar solo on [...] "I'm Only Sleeping" [...] was similarly unprecedented in pop music, in that Harrison deliberately composed and recorded his guitar parts with a view to how the notes would sound when the tape direction was corrected. The band's interest in the tones that resulted from varying <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> (or varispeeding) extended to recording a basic track at a faster tempo than they intended the song to sound on disc.|$|E
2500|$|Tape echoes became commercially {{available}} in the 1950s. An echo machine is the early name for a sound processing device used with electronic instruments to repeat the sound and produce a simulated echo. The device was popular with guitarists and was used by Brian May, Jimmy Page and Syd Barrett among others. One example is the Echoplex which used a tape loop. [...] The length of delay was adjusted by changing {{the distance between the}} tape record and playback heads. [...] Another example is the Roland Space Echo with a record and multiple playback tape heads and a variable <b>tape</b> <b>speed.</b> [...] The time between echo repeats was adjusted by varying the <b>tape</b> <b>speed.</b> [...] The length or intensity of the echo effect was adjusted by changing the amount of echo signal was fed back into the pre-echo signal. [...] Different effects could be created by combining the different playback heads. [...] Some models also included a spring reverb.|$|E
2500|$|Educational, religious, corporate, military, and {{broadcasting}} institutions {{benefited from}} messaging proliferation through accessibly priced duplicators, offered by Telex Communications, Wollensak, Sony, and others. The duplicators would operate at double (or greater) <b>tape</b> <b>speed.</b> Systems were scalable, enabling {{the user to}} purchase initially one [...] "master" [...] unit (typically with 3 [...] "copy" [...] bays) and add [...] "slave" [...] units for expanded duplication abilities.|$|E
50|$|As a {{practical}} matter, VITC {{can be more}} 'frame-accurate' than LTC, particularly at very slow <b>tape</b> <b>speeds</b> on analog formats. LTC readers can lose track of code at slow jog speeds whereas VITC can be read frame-by-frame if need be. Conversely, at high speeds (FF/rew.), the VITC is often unreadable due to image distortions, so the LTC is often used instead. Some VCRs have an auto selection between the two formats to provide the highest accuracy.|$|R

50|$|Like the DAT cassette, ProDigi and DASH {{machines}} also accommodated {{the obligatory}} 44.1 kHz sampling rate, but also 48 kHz on all machines, and a 96 kHz sampling rate on the last-generation units. They overcame {{the problems that}} made typical analog recorders unable to meet the bandwidth (frequency range) demands of digital recording {{by a combination of}} higher <b>tape</b> <b>speeds,</b> narrower head gaps used in combination with metal-formulation tapes, and the spreading of data across multiple parallel tracks.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{simplest}} configuration, rather than playing {{a pair of}} stereo channels of {{each side of the}} cassette, the typical [...] "portastudio" [...] used a four-track tape head assembly to access four tracks on the cassette at once (with the tape playing in one direction). Each track could be recorded to, erased, or played back individually, allowing musicians to overdub themselves and create simple multitrack recordings easily, which could then be mixed down to a finished stereo version on an external machine. To increase audio quality in these recorders, the <b>tape</b> <b>speed</b> sometimes was doubled to 3¾inches per second, in comparison to the standard 17⁄8 ips; additionally, dbx, Dolby B or Dolby C noise reduction provided compansion (compression of the signal during recording with equal and opposite expansion of the signal during playback), which yields increased dynamic range by lowering the noise level and increasing the maximum signal level before distortion occurs. Multi-track cassette recorders with built-in mixer and signal routing features ranged from easy-to-use beginner units up to professional-level recording systems.|$|E
50|$|The first operation, {{which was}} the {{changing}} of <b>tape</b> <b>speed,</b> was his primary technique. The faster the tape is played, the higher the pitch and vice versa. <b>Tape</b> <b>speed</b> is measured by ips or inches per second. So slowing a recording by half (7-1/2-ips), lowers all pitches by an octave. Le Caine created a three-octave keyboard {{that allows him to}} choose different speeds. All the different pitches during Dripsody were achieved by changing the <b>tape</b> <b>speed.</b> He, sometime in the process of creating the keyboard, assembled the pitches into a pentatonic (five note) scale pattern.|$|E
