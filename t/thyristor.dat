5|$|In the 1950s, Duewag {{started to}} develop an {{articulated}} variation of its four-axle Großraumwagen, based on articulation technology used by trams in Rome. This design was delivered to many tramways, particularly in Germany. In 1977 and 1978, Oslo Sporveier tested a Duewag GT8S (3052) tram from Rheinbahn. In 1979, Oslo Sporveier ordered ten vehicles from Duewag, with planned delivery in 1982. In addition, fifteen units would be license-built by Strømmens Verkseted, with delivery the following year. All the motors were built by the Norwegian company Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). The trams built in Germany were transported to Oslo by railway. The first vehicle was delivered on 13 April 1982 and put into service on 2 July. The last German-built tram was put into service on 13 September. The German trams were numbered 101 through 110. Oslo was the third tramway {{in the world to}} take into use <b>thyristor</b> controlled motors on the main part of their fleet of trams, after the systems in Helsinki, Finland, and Hanover, Germany.|$|E

25|$|A <b>thyristor</b> can be {{switched}} off if the external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased (a method known as natural, or line, commutation). In some applications {{this is done}} by switching a second <b>thyristor</b> to discharge a capacitor into the cathode of the first <b>thyristor.</b> This method is called forced commutation.|$|E
50|$|GTO <b>thyristors</b> {{capable of}} {{blocking}} reverse voltage {{are known as}} Symmetrical GTO <b>thyristors,</b> abbreviated S-GTO. Usually, the reverse blocking voltage rating and forward blocking voltage rating are the same. The typical application for symmetrical GTO <b>thyristors</b> is in current source inverters.|$|R
50|$|Practical {{conversion}} {{of power between}} AC and DC became possible {{with the development of}} power electronics devices such as mercury-arc valves and, starting in the 1970s, semiconductor devices as <b>thyristors,</b> integrated gate-commutated <b>thyristors</b> (IGCTs), MOS-controlled <b>thyristors</b> (MCTs) and insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBT).|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>thyristors</b> themselves, each inverse-parallel pair of <b>thyristors</b> has a resistor-capacitor ‘’snubber’ circuit connected across it, to force the voltage across the valve to divide uniformly amongst the <b>thyristors</b> and to damp the [...] "commutation overshoot" [...] which occurs when the valve turns off.|$|R
25|$|After {{the current}} in a <b>thyristor</b> has extinguished, a finite time delay must elapse before the anode can again be {{positively}} biased and retain the <b>thyristor</b> in the off-state. This minimum delay {{is called the}} circuit commutated turn off time (tQ). Attempting to positively bias the anode within this time causes the <b>thyristor</b> to be self-triggered by the remaining charge carriers (holes and electrons) {{that have not yet}} recombined.|$|E
25|$|A <b>thyristor</b> is a {{solid-state}} {{semiconductor device}} with four layers of alternating P and N-type materials. It acts exclusively as a bistable switch, conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, {{and continuing to}} conduct while the voltage across the device is not reversed (forward-biased). A three-lead <b>thyristor</b> is designed to control the larger current of its two leads by combining that current with the smaller current of its other lead, known as its control lead. In contrast, a two-lead <b>thyristor</b> is designed to switch on if the potential difference between its leads is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage).|$|E
25|$|This is {{a simple}} {{connection}} between two six-pulse <b>thyristor</b> bridges. The de-icer function can be achieved with only a two-winding step-down transformer. Unlike the other two, this circuit can simple controller because the two <b>thyristor</b> bridges can be triggered directly in parallel. As a result, this circuit produces {{a broader range of}} harmonic currents and voltages.|$|E
50|$|The static inverter, {{which is}} {{implemented}} as a twelve-pulse inverter, uses for each valve function a serial switch of 44 <b>thyristors</b> {{with a maximum}} blockade voltage of 4.2 kV and a maximum nominal DC current rating of 3790 A. The total number of <b>thyristors</b> used in the facility is 1056. The <b>thyristors</b> had a wafer diameter of 100 mm during construction and were, at the time, the largest <b>thyristors</b> of the world.|$|R
50|$|GTO <b>thyristors</b> {{incapable}} of blocking reverse voltage {{are known as}} asymmetrical GTO <b>thyristors,</b> abbreviated A-GTO, and are generally more common than Symmetrical GTO <b>thyristors.</b> They typically have a reverse breakdown rating {{in the tens of}} volts. A-GTO <b>thyristors</b> are used where either a reverse conducting diode is applied in parallel (for example, in voltage source inverters) or where reverse voltage would never occur (for example, in switching power supplies or DC traction choppers).|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>thyristors</b> themselves, each inverse-parallel pair of <b>thyristors</b> has a Resistor - Capacitor circuit connected across it, to force the voltage across the valve to divide uniformly amongst the <b>thyristors</b> and to damp the [...] "commutation overshoot" [...] which occurs when the valve turns off.|$|R
25|$|The <b>thyristor</b> {{has three}} p-n {{junctions}} (serially named J1, J2, J3 from the anode).|$|E
25|$|MCT — MOSFET Controlled <b>Thyristor</b> — It {{contains}} two additional FET structures for on/off control.|$|E
25|$|When the anode is at a {{positive}} potential VAK {{with respect to}} the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate, junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased, while junction J2 is reverse biased. As J2 is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if VAK is increased beyond the breakdown voltage VBO of the <b>thyristor,</b> avalanche breakdown of J2 takes place and the <b>thyristor</b> starts conducting (On state).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} results {{attained with}} SiC GTO <b>thyristors</b> terminated {{by a single}} step and a graded etched JTE. The comparison of both types of devices reveals {{no significant difference in}} the on-state and switching characteristics but a higher blocking capability of some <b>thyristors</b> with the latter kind of termination. The best devices showed a forward breakdown voltage of nearly 6 kV, which is a distinct progress as against previous results of <b>thyristors</b> with a graded etched JTE.

25|$|A. Nakagawa et. al. {{invented the}} device design concept of non-latch-up IGBTs in 1984. The {{invention}} {{is characterized by}} the device design setting the device saturation current below the latch-up current, which triggers the parasitic <b>thyristor.</b> This invention realized complete suppression of the parasitic <b>thyristor</b> action because the maximum collector current was limited by the saturation current and never exceeded the latch-up current. After the invention of the device design concept of non-latch-up IGBTs, IGBTs evolved rapidly and the design of non-latch-up IGBTs became a de facto standard.|$|E

40|$|Silicon-based power {{semiconductor}} devices, ranging from diodes, <b>thyristors,</b> gate turn-off <b>thyristors,</b> metal–oxide–semicon-ductor field-effect transistors, and, more recently, insulated-gate bipolar transistors, integrated gate-commutated <b>thyristors,</b> and metal–oxide–semiconductor turn-off <b>thyristors,</b> are the workhorse of power electronic systems and circuits. Silicon offers multiple advantages to power circuit designers, {{but at the}} same time suffers from limitations that are inherent to silicon material properties, such as low bandgap energy, low thermal conductivity, and switching frequency limitations. Wide bandgap semiconductors, such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), provide larger bandgaps, higher breakdown electric field, and higher thermal conductivity. Power semiconductor devices made with SiC and GaN are capable of higher blocking voltages, higher switching frequencies, and higher junction temperatures than silicon devices...|$|R

25|$|Although {{thyristors}} {{are heavily}} used in megawatt-scale rectification of AC to DC, in low- and medium-power (from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts) applications they have virtually {{been replaced by}} other devices with superior switching characteristics like Power MOSFETs or IGBTs. One major problem associated with SCRs {{is that they are}} not fully controllable switches. The GTO <b>thyristor</b> and IGCT are two devices related to the <b>thyristor</b> that address this problem. In high-frequency applications, thyristors are poor candidates due to long switching times arising from bipolar conduction. MOSFETs, on the other hand, have much faster switching capability because of their unipolar conduction (only majority carriers carry the current).|$|E
25|$|The gate pulses are {{characterized}} {{in terms of}} gate trigger voltage (VGT) and gate trigger current (IGT). Gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width {{in such a way}} that it is evident that there is a minimum gate charge required to trigger the <b>thyristor.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Thyristor</b> {{manufacturers}} generally {{specify a}} region of safe firing defining acceptable levels of voltage and current for a given operating temperature.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, works on <b>thyristor</b> {{circuits}} were carried at Bell Labs, IBM and RCA. Ian Munro Ross and David D'Azaro (Bell Labs) experimented with thyristor-based memory cells. Joe Logue and Rick Dill (IBM) were building counters using monojunction transistors. Torkel Wallmark and Harwick Johnson (RCA) used both the thyristors and field-effect transistors. The works of 1955–1958 that used germanium thyristors were fruitless. Only {{in the summer}} of 1959, after the inventions of Kilby, Lehovec and Hoerni became publicly known, D'Azaro reported an operational shift register based on silicon thyristors. In this register, one crystal containing four thyristors replaced eight transistors, 26 diodes and 27 resistors. The area of each <b>thyristor</b> ranged from 0.2 to 0.4mm2, with a thickness of about 0.1mm. The circuit elements were isolated by etching deep grooves.|$|E
