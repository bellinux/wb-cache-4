5|$|Ney's {{orders were}} to secure <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> Quatre Bras, {{so that he}} could later swing east and {{reinforce}} Napoleon if necessary. Ney found <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> Quatre Bras lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} griots are {{songs of}} praise, but Malouma used {{her voice to}} speak out against child marriages, racial and ethnic discrimination, slavery and other divisive issues facing a country at <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> the Arab world and Africa.

5|$|The food of {{the ancient}} Israelites was based on several {{products}} that still play important roles in modern Israeli cuisine. These were known as the seven species: olives, figs, dates, pomegranates, wheat, barley and grapes. The diet, based on locally grown produce, was enhanced by imported spices, readily available due to the country’s position at <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> east-west trade routes.|$|E
5|$|A wealthy {{resident}} of al-Rahba, Ibn Mahkan, revolted against the Fatimids and {{took control of}} the town shortly after Lu'lu departed. Though able to oust the Fatimid governor, Ibn Mahkan was unable to hold the town without outside support since al-Rahba was located amid <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> several regional powers who coveted the town. Thus, he gained the backing of the Mirdasid emir of the Banu Kilab tribe, Salih ibn Mirdas. Conflict arose between Ibn Mahkan and Salih leading the latter to besiege al-Rahba. The two reconciled and then Ibn Mahkan and his men captured the fortified town of Anah in Anbar. However, when Ibn Mahkan sought Salih's support in suppressing a revolt in Anah, the latter used the opportunity to kill Ibn Mahkan.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological discoveries {{show that}} the first {{settlements}} {{in the area of}} present-day Białystok occurred during the Stone Age. Tombs of ancient settlers {{can be found in the}} district of Dojlidy. In the early Iron Age a mix of Prussians, Yotvingians and Wielbark culture people settled in the area producing kurgans, the tombs of the chiefs in the area located in the current village of Rostołty. Since then, the Białystok area has been at <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> cultures. Trade routes linking the Baltic to the Black Sea favored the development of settlements with Yotvingia-Ruthenian-Polish cultural characteristics.|$|E

Utica is near <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> major electrical-transmission lines, with substations {{in the town of}} Marcy. An expansion project by the New York Power Authority, National Grid, Consolidated Edison, and New York State Electric and Gas (NYSEG) is planned. In 2009 city businesses (including Utica College and St. Luke's Medical Center) developed a microgrid, and in 2012 the Utica City Council explored the possibility of a public, city-owned power company. Utica's natural gas {{is provided}} by National Grid and NYSEG.|$|E
5|$|They {{concluded}} that the 'Greek lands' are located in a privileged geographic location at <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa, however, as the Ottoman administration was incapable of reinforcing the rule of law, economic activity couldn't flourish. Thus, they addressed {{the political and economic}} instability of the Ottoman Empire that struggled to maintain control over different ethnicities and huge territories. As a consequence of that lack of control, many Greeks were impelled to seek protection outside the Ottoman Empire, while the ones that had not abandoned their lands, suffered under a terrible Ottoman regime, and had no educational rights.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} of {{the area}} in 1962-1963 suggest that the original settlement was centred {{to the east of}} St Peter's Church, with Mary-le-Port on its western limit. The building of Bristol Castle {{in the latter part of}} the 11th century resulted in the focus of the settlement being moved to the west, where it developed into a symmetrical plan centred on <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> High Street, Wine Street, Broad Street and Corn Street. The area around Mary-le-Port Street was thus the most ancient part of the mediaeval city. Bristol Castle was home to the Norman garrison, and was a massive structure whose keep was comparable to that of the Tower of London. The castle occupied the whole of the eastern end of today's Castle park, from just east of St Peter's Church to Lower Castle Street.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck's {{location}} at <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> river, road, train and other geographical features {{has made it}} a site of many momentous events across the centuries. After the American defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington, George Washington and the troops of the Continental Army retreated across New Jersey from the British Army, traveling through Teaneck and crossing the Hackensack River at New Bridge Landing, which has since {{been turned into a}} state park and historic site commemorating the events of 1776 and of early colonial life. In 1965, Teaneck voluntarily desegregated its public schools, after the Board of Education approved a plan to do so by a 7–2 vote on May13, 1964. Teaneck has a diverse population, with large Jewish and African American communities, and growing numbers of Hispanic and Asian residents.|$|E
5|$|Five Bristol Fighters in bombing formation, {{took off}} at 11:40 with eight bombs each, which were dropped on {{retreating}} columns between Et Tire and Tulkarm. They also fired hundreds of machine gun bullets, scattering the retreating force towards Kakon and Tulkarm. At this time, machine gun {{fire from the}} ground aimed at the aircraft was fairly heavy, causing a number of casualties to the air crews. At 12:30, a second formation of three aircraft repeated {{the attack on the}} same retreating Ottoman column, which had reached the corner on the Tulkarm road. Six aircraft took off in the afternoon, two pursuing the retreating columns north of Kakon heading towards Baka, while four aircraft found soldiers, transport, artillery, horses, and camels moving from Tulkarm to Anebta. These they bombed and machine gunned, in a section of the road where it passed the little Wadi Zeimer, through a gorge with steep hills on either side. Before the column could escape, another formation of seven Bristol Fighters attacked them, at about 17:00 west of Anebta. The evening patrols reported the Ottoman Seventh Army headquarters still at Nablus, but the entire Eighth Army appeared to be in retreat, with their Tulkarm headquarters already captured. At <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>of</b> the Afulah and the coast roads at Sumrah, a supply base with hospital and grain dump was in flames and its inhabitants were seen retreating into the hills.|$|E
