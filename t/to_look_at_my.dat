He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that {{it has something to}} do with the fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> ideas and flip them around in a way that's just a little bit more twisted and interesting.

[...] His mixtape series Fahrenheit 1/15 featured a remix of Kanye West's [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] entitled [...] "Muhammad Walks", which went on to become very popular in the Muslim community.

[...] "So should the City Council vote to amend term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> record of independent leadership and then decide if I have earned another term." [...] Ronald Lauder who wrote New York City's term limits in 1993 and spent over 4 million dollars of his own money to enable the maximum years a mayor could serve to 8 years, in exchange was promised a seat on an influential board by Michael Bloomberg.

[...] Some people and organizations objected and NYPIRG {{filed a complaint with the}} City Conflict of Interest Board. [...] On October 23, 2008, the City Council voted 29–22 in favor of extending the term limit to three consecutive four-year terms, thus allowing Bloomberg to run for office again. After two days of public hearings, Bloomberg signed the bill into law on November 3.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the month, Giuliani {{participated in}} the November 28, 2007 YouTube Debate to respond to {{allegations}} of a perceived 9-11 centric candidacy and other criticisms, Giuliani responded that he [...] "...would like people <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> whole record.

[...] He also began airing his first television advertisement in key caucus-primary states. The ad concentrated solely on the transformation of New York City under the Giuliani mayoralty. Observers likened the ad to Republican icon Ronald Reagan's famous [...] "Morning in America" [...] ad. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Poll conducted November 28 found that in the crucial state of Florida 53% of voters found Giuliani to be the best candidate to fight the War on Terrorism. 33% of the Florida voters found Giuliani to be the best to deal with the Iraq conflict and 34% viewed him as the best candidate concerning economic issues. Giuliani led among primary voters in Florida receiving 38%, ahead of his closest rival, Mitt Romney by 21%. However, in head to head matchups, Giuliani was losing his lead. A November 911th poll had Clinton and Giuliani tied at 45% in the traditional red state of Virginia.|$|E
