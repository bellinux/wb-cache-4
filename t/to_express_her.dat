5|$|Higgins' song writing {{grew out}} of a desire <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> {{emotions}} when she was at school and her lyrics describe her feelings about her own life and relationships. The piano was the first instrument she learned to play, and she continues to use it as well as digital pianos including a Roland RD-300SX, RD-700 and KR-15. She also uses guitars extensively in her music particularly when touring, due to their portable nature and favours the Australian brand, Maton. On occasion she plays keytar, xylophone and melodica during performances.|$|E
5|$|In early 1801, Adams {{had sent}} Thomas Jefferson a brief note after {{returning}} to Quincy to which Jefferson did not respond. In 1804, Abigail wrote to Jefferson <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> condolences upon {{the death of his}} daughter Polly, who had stayed with the Adamses is London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, there had been no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani helped {{preserve}} {{key elements}} of Hawaii's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled The Queen's Songbook, was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust. Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions as a way <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> feelings for her people, her country, and {{what was happening in}} the political realm in Hawaii. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she would never leave the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture of her people would never be lost. The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaii.|$|E

5000|$|The Deneens {{returned}} to electoral politics in 1924, when Charles ran successfully for US Senate. Deneen described {{herself as a}} [...] "passive politician", but stumped actively for her husband during his final, failed Senate campaign in 1930. [...] Feeling uncomfortable with traditional political speeches, however, she confined herself <b>to</b> <b>expressing</b> <b>her</b> gratitude and recognition of the campaign workers' efforts.|$|R

5|$|Samantha Smith {{was born}} on June 29, 1972, {{in the small town}} of Houlton, Maine, on the Canada–United States border, to Jane Reed and Arthur Smith. At the age of five, she wrote a letter to Queen Elizabeth II in order <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> admiration to the monarch. When Smith had {{finished}} second grade in the spring of 1980, the family settled in Manchester, Maine, where she attended Manchester Elementary School. Her father served as an instructor at Ricker College in Houlton before teaching literature and writing at the University of Maine at Augusta while her mother worked as a social worker with the Maine Department of Human Services.|$|E
5|$|Several further {{instances}} {{have been}} expounded by critics. Taum notes that Yah's guilt over her {{past as a}} prostitute leads her to the (unfounded) fear that Tono would leave her if their relationship were known; her guilt ultimately causes their separation, while Tono feels nostalgic for the past, in which he felt happier. Balfas notes that a factor driving Tono from Tini is the latter's former relationship with Hartono; due to her guilt over the affair, she is unable <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> love for the doctor. Siregar writes that such a theme is reflected in dialogue between Tono and Hartono, from which he suggests the novel derives its title. Balfas writes {{that there is no}} solution to the human problems presented in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-four {{hours after}} his arrest, King {{was allowed to}} see local {{attorneys}} from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home {{after the birth of}} their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> concern for King while he was incarcerated.|$|E

50|$|The {{conflict}} of Irian in 1957 {{had made the}} relationship between Indonesia and Netherlands heaten up. It led the Indonesian government to issue an anti-Dutch sentiment which forced most of Dutch Indies families to move to Netherlands, including Wieteke’s family. At first, Wieteke could not stand the cold climate of Netherland nor its cuisine and then she wrote a song about it <b>to</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>her</b> longing <b>to</b> Indonesia.|$|R
5|$|Eventually she {{expanded}} beyond make-up artistry to {{body painting}} <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> own artistic vision. In August 1991, Demi Moore caused international artistic commotion by {{appearing on the}} cover of Vanity Fair seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue in the photo More Demi Moore, with Gair as the make-up artist and Annie Leibovitz as the photographer. Exactly one year later, she returned to the cover of the same magazine nude as a product of Gair and Leibovitz in a nearly equally as shocking body painting, Demi's Birthday Suit (pictured right). Gair was the primary body painter of this art and the magazine cover art propelled Gair to fame. Fifteen years later, it continues to be considered the most well-known example of modern body painting. The 1992 cover that entailed a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of make-up artists was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. The shooting was storied because photographer Annie Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot and reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses. The pop culture attention given to Gair and her body painting led Absolut Vodka to consider an Absolut Gair body painting promotion in 1993.|$|E
5|$|It is {{explained}} that, {{in the aftermath}} of her being left by Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) at the altar, Yang spent her honeymoon travelling with Meredith. Having just returned, she is shocked to learn that Burke has resigned from Seattle Grace, and relocated to an unknown location. Stevens has to deal with her romantic feelings for O'Malley, whose marriage to Torres is being threatened by his yet to be exposed affair.

The next video, [...] "Made of Sand", followed in October 2015 and also got praised for its artful lyricism and the authentic approach <b>to</b> <b>expressing</b> <b>her</b> truth.|$|R

25|$|From {{her youth}} onwards, Zinaida Serebriakova strove <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> {{love of the}} world and to show its beauty. Her {{earliest}} works, Country Girl (1906, Russian Museum) and Orchard in Bloom (1908, private collection), speak eloquently of this search, and of her acute awareness of the beauty of the Russian land and its people. These works are études done from nature, and though she was young at the time, her extraordinary talent, confidence and boldness were apparent.|$|E
25|$|In her {{quest for}} sanctity, she {{believed}} that it was not necessary to accomplish heroic acts, or great deeds, in order to attain holiness and <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> love of God. She wrote,Love proves itself by deeds, so how am I to show my love? Great deeds are forbidden me. The only way I can prove my love is by scattering flowers and these flowers are every little sacrifice, every glance and word, and the doing of the least actions for love.|$|E
25|$|On November 19, Parrish {{spoke to}} the press about her {{expulsion}} from caucus. She said that had she been in Martin's place, she {{would have done the}} same. She went on to say, however, that the party under Martin had fallen into disarray and that Martin and his inner circle ran the party using guerrilla warfare tactics. She said she would still vote with the Liberals on the vast majority of legislation, but would now be free <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> views without fear of reprisal.|$|E

50|$|The Demon King of Melancholy, {{who spends}} {{most of her time}} as a very popular {{musician}} in Earth's virtual world.

25|$|In this {{tradition}} the expensive medium of oil-on-canvas itself, {{and the lack}} of farm-workers in the image are cited as further evidence, and Mrs Andrews' somewhat stiff seated position is said <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> inferior and passive status, as she is placed on display like other assets of her husband. Harsh things are said about the appearance and facial expressions of the two sitters, their dress and poses, and Mr Andrews carrying a gun. To some authors in {{this tradition}}, Gainsborough's intention in making the portrait was in part satirical, something most art historians are unlikely to agree with.|$|E
25|$|Anna Seward was {{a prodigious}} {{correspondent}} and her vast collection of letters {{was published in}} six volumes after her death (1811) revealing an encyclopaedic breadth of knowledge of English literature and its development and casting considerable light on the literary culture of the Midlands of her day. Early in life (1762–1768) she used an imaginary friend 'Emma' <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> thoughts, writing thirty–nine letters to her in all. She was recognised, to varying degrees, as an authority on English literature by her contemporaries, including Walter Scott, Samuel Johnson and Robert Southey. Seward also wrote a biography, Memoirs of the Life of Dr Darwin (1804).|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{painting of}} this type dates to 1346 and is at the Museo Nazionale in Palermo, Italy. It represents a Madonna seated on a small cushion just above the ground. The Child Jesus that she holds partially looks at the viewer. The painting bears the inscription Nostra Domina de Humiltate,with the low cushion intended <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>her</b> humility. This painting in Palermo is, however, of a somewhat mediocre quality and was perhaps based on a work of Simone Martini. A similar painting in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, and both paintings were probably based on a Madonna of humility by Martini. A Virgin of humility fresco by Simone Martini survives in the Palais des Papes in Avignon, France.|$|E
