5|$|As of 2014, Spokane {{is still}} trying to make the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more service-oriented economy {{in the face of a}} less {{prominent}} manufacturing sector. Developing the city's strength in the medical and health sciences fields has seen some success, resulting in the expansion of the University District with two medical school branches. The city faces challenges such as a scarcity of high-paying jobs, pockets of poverty, and areas of high crime.|$|E

He successfully negotiated the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland and won a substantial reduction in foreign debts.|$|E

5|$|Photons are emitted in many natural processes. For example, when {{a charge}} is {{accelerated}} it emits synchrotron radiation. During a molecular, atomic or nuclear <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lower energy level, photons of various energy will be emitted, ranging from radio waves to gamma rays. Photons {{can also be}} emitted when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle are annihilated (for example, electron–positron annihilation).|$|E
5|$|The <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{more radical}} form of poetry {{seems to have}} taken place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together.

In 1952 the Gulf Freeway, then part of U.S. Route 75, was completed providing a fast automobile link between Houston and Galveston.

5|$|After the war area {{economic}} diversification {{brought on by}} the war effort helped in the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> peacetime economy. NASA's Johnson Space Center was established in 1963 helping to spur explosive growth in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s. The remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore urbanized and development connected the area to Houston. Tourism and recreation re-emerged and blossomed particularly around the Clear Lake area and the nearby shoreline.Barrington (2008), p. 266.Antrobus (2005), p. 57.|$|E
5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly {{believed}} this process {{would be set}} in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> police state.|$|E

While {{the election}} was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet. According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and tried unsuccessfully to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet {{as director of the}} Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E
5|$|Following Romania's <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Socialist Republic, {{the monarchy}} was excoriated by {{communist}} officials. Several biographies {{of the royal}} family described Marie either as a drunkard or as a promiscuous woman, referring to her many alleged affairs and to orgies she had supposedly organised before and during the war. In the years preceding the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Marie's popularity recovered and she was offered as a model of patriotism to the population. Marie is primarily remembered for her work as a nurse, but is also known for her extensive writing, including her critically acclaimed autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} the Columbia's watershed {{for more than}} 15,000years, with a <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sedentary lifestyle based mainly on salmon starting about 3,500years ago. In 1962, archaeologists found evidence of human activity dating back 11,230years at the Marmes Rockshelter, near {{the confluence of the}} Palouse and Snake rivers in eastern Washington. In 1996 the skeletal remains of a 9,000-year-old prehistoric man (dubbed Kennewick Man) were found near Kennewick, Washington. The discovery rekindled debate in the scientific community over the origins of human habitation in North America and sparked a protracted controversy over whether the scientific or Native American community was entitled to possess and/or study the remains.|$|E

The regime worked for the safe repatriation of Norwegians held in German prisoner-of-war camps. Privately, Quisling had long accepted that National Socialism would be defeated. Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945 left him free to pursue publicly his chosen end-game, a naïve offer of a <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> power-sharing government with the government-in-exile.|$|E
5|$|The Federal {{government}} retired Air Marshal Jones in 1952 {{and replaced}} him with Air Marshal Donald Hardman, RAF, who proceeded to re-organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines, establishing Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands in October 1953. The first was re-formed from Eastern Area Command {{as it was}} considered the RAAF's de facto operational organisation. The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command, {{as it was the}} hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and last functional command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne. The <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Areas.|$|E
