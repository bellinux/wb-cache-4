5|$|Princess Elizabeth {{was then}} given a Pembroke Corgi of her own, named Susan, for her 18th {{birthday}} in 1944. She {{had a strong}} connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> which was hidden under rugs in the Royal Carriage following her wedding to Prince Philip. Susan became the progenitor of all the Corgis owned by the Royal Household since. The Queen has bred ten generations of dogs from Susan, owning personally more than 30 of the dogs which were either pure-bred Pembroke Welsh Corgis or crossbreed Corgi/Dachshunds called Dorgis.|$|E

5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E

5|$|Everyone in {{the family}} has to create budget cuts in their daily routine, such as Homer having {{to give up on}} buying beer and Marge having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly lottery ticket. Bart must get his hair cut at a local barber school, Lisa can no longer get her volumes of Encyclopedia Generica, and Maggie's clothes have to last a little bit longer. They {{eventually}} save up enough money for the operation, which is a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the morale of the family suffers and they take their annoyance out on Santa's Little Helper. Feeling unwanted, he runs away from home and goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> pound, and adopted by Mr. Burns, who trains him to be one of his vicious attack hounds.

25|$|The Japanese Army {{received}} about 25,000 dogs from their ally Germany and organized several dog training schools in Japan, {{and one in}} China at Nanjing. Some dogs were trained for demolition, but instead of strapping explosives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> it was attached to dog-drawn carts. Their deployment had little success, mostly due to poor training. In the late 1940s, anti-tank dogs were used by the Viet Minh forces fighting in Indochina.|$|E

The McDaniels have vehemently rejected that theory, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> and girlfriend he left behind as well as doubting that he would have knowingly subjected them to that level of grief after seeing how his brother's death had affected them.|$|E

25|$|Curvature of the back, called roaching, {{might be}} caused by patella {{problems}} with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to lean forward onto the forelegs. This might also just be a structural fault with little consequence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b> Many Bostons cannot tolerate excessive heat and also extremely cold weather, due to the shortened muzzle, so hot or cold weather combined with demanding exercise can bring harm to a Boston Terrier. A sensitive digestive system is also typical of Boston Terriers. In the absence of good quality, proper diet, flatulence {{is associated with the}} breed. Their large and prominent eyes make Boston Terriers prone to corneal ulcers.|$|E
25|$|After {{eight days}} waiting for transit, the {{division}} returned to San Francisco and boarded {{a convoy of}} seven Matson Line ships, including the S.S. Lurline and USS Hugh L. Scott at Pier 42. The convoy (SF 43) was escorted by the cruiser USS Indianapolis and two corvettes. Four days out of San Francisco, the Lurline ship's crew discovered the division's mascot, a dog named Vicksburg. She was named for the town {{she was born in}} and the location of the final major campaign of the American Civil War. (Vicksburg was killed in a road accident in Southport, Australia on 8 October 1942) A monument <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> still exists at the former entrance to Camp Cable.|$|E
25|$|Analyses of the {{mitochondrial}} DNA of 1576 dogs worldwide {{revealed that}} one Kishu and one Siberian husky possessed the same haplotype as a Japanese wolf, indicating past cross-breeding. A more-refined study of Japanese wolf mitochondrial DNA showed {{that they could}} be further divided into two separate groups, and that the sequences from one Kishu, one Siberian husky and one Shiba Inu could also be divided into the two groups. These dogs correspond to clade F of the mDNA phylogenetic tree among worldwide dogs, with clade F haplogroup dogs originating from a rare admixture between male dogs and more than one female ancestor of Japanese wolves, which have contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> gene pool.|$|E

25|$|Ehrlichia is a rickettsial {{bacteria}} {{belonging to}} the family Ehrlichiaceae. There are several species of Ehrlichia, but the one that most commonly affects dogs and causes the most severe clinical signs is Ehrlichia canis. This species infects monocytes in the peripheral blood. The brown dog tick, or Rhipicephalus sanguineous, that passes the organism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> is prevalent {{throughout most of the}} United States, but most cases tend to occur in the Southwest and Gulf Coast regions where there is a high concentration of the tick. Ehrlichia is found {{in many parts of the}} world and was first recognized in Algeria in 1935. During the Vietnam War ehrlichiosis became well known as a dog disease due to the infection and death of many military working dogs. Two types of human ehrlichiosis have been identified in the United States: human monocytic ehrlichiosis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to {{his screen}} test, Trevor made his film {{debut in the}} 1927 film, Ranger of the North, where he played second fiddle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> star, Ranger.

Productions (FBO – also known as FBO Pictures Corporation), and later by RKO Radio Pictures, after FBO was merged with RCA to from RKO. While he never worked with Dix, he did work with other famous film figures of that era, including Mary Astor, Bryant Washburn, Chester Conklin, Noah Beery, the comedy team of Wheeler & Woolsey (Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey), Betty Compson, and Lowell Sherman. In 1929, Trevor was romantically linked with actress Aileen Pringle, following their working together on the film, Beau Broadway the prior year. During his film career he was also romantically linked with another co-star, Betty Compson, who at one point was considering marrying him (after her divorce from James Cruze).|$|E

Furthermore, this individual had kept him bound to a bed on the second floor of the house throughout much of the time he had been held against his will, repeatedly sodomizing him, drugging him, and injecting his throat with drain cleaner to diminish his ability to speak loudly. As Bryson spoke, the officers also noted that in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> collar and broken foot, Bryson had red, swollen eyes, and visible scars and welts across his entire body. Two officers were told to maintain a discreet surveillance of the property, as Bryson was driven to the Menorah Medical Center, accompanied by a third officer, for treatment as the fourth officer radioed the Kansas City Police Department to request a formal search warrant of the property be drafted.|$|E
