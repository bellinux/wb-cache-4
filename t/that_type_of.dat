5|$|Two other Mad Max games, {{developed}} by Cory Barlog and Interplay Entertainment respectively, were in production before {{the announcement of}} this game, but neither of them were successfully released. Although Mad Max {{is not based on}} the film series, it was inspired by its universe, and franchise creator George Miller was consulted during the game's pre-production. Avalanche Studios found developing a vehicular-combat video game a challenge because of their inexperience with creating <b>that</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> game. Announced at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo, the game was re-tooled during development and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were canceled.|$|E

5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with <b>that</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E

Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in <b>that</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E

5|$|Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{created a}} {{company-wide}} narrative {{that led to}} an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines {{that led to the}} event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker T to the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused to listen and continued his assault, causing Sting to hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a reason as to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent in their current rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end <b>that</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing <b>that</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E
