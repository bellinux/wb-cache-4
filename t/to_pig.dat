40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of initial bacterial concentrations in animal plasma on growth performance of weanling pigs. In Exp. 1 during the experimental period (d 0 <b>to</b> 14), <b>pigs</b> fed plasma had increased ADG and ADFI compared <b>to</b> <b>pigs</b> fed the control diet. Pigs fed the irradiated AP 920, as well as source 1 and source 2 regular (nonirradiated) food grade plasma had increased ADG compared to the control diet. Furthermore, pigs fed irradiated AP 920, regular AP 820, regular and irradiated source 1 food grade and regular source 2 food grade animal plasma had improved ADFI compared <b>to</b> <b>pigs</b> fed the control diet. No differences in F/G were observed between treatments. No differences were detected between pigs fed diets that contained irradiated plasma compared to those fed it in the regular form. For the overall experiment (d 0 <b>to</b> 24), <b>pigs</b> fed irradiated AP 920 had a tendency for improved F/G compared <b>to</b> <b>pigs</b> fed the control diet. In Exp. 2 during the experimental period (d 0 <b>to</b> 14), <b>pigs</b> fed diets containing plasma had improved ADG and F/G compared <b>to</b> <b>pigs</b> fed the control diet. Pigs fed irradiated AP 820 food grade plasma had higher ADG compared <b>to</b> <b>pigs</b> fed regular AP 820. For the overall experiment (d 0 <b>to</b> 24), <b>pigs</b> fed diets containing irradiated AP 820 had increased ADG, final body weight, and ADFI compared <b>to</b> <b>pigs</b> fed regular AP 820. Since irradiation of food grade plasma (low initial bacteria) did not improve growth performance while irradiation of feed grade plasma (initially high bacteria) improved performance, the initial bacteria level of animal plasma appears to influence growth performance of nursery pigs...|$|R

5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke <b>to</b> <b>pig</b> iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) {{are by far the}} most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E

25|$|The sparse {{remains of}} another 24 people {{were found in}} a cave {{at the base of}} the cliff.

Carbon dating of textiles found with the remains in the cave indicate they are contemporaneous with the period of the revolt, and pig bones were also present (occasionally occurring for Roman burials due <b>to</b> <b>pig</b> sacrifices); this indicates that the remains may belong to non-Jewish Roman soldiers or civilians who occupied the site before or after the siege. Zias also questioned whether as many as 24 individuals were present, since only 4% of that number of bones was recovered.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the week}} of July 7, 2008, Pearls Before Swine parodied the {{tendency}} of Funky Winkerbean towards killing off main characters when it killed off Rat and the strip's own author, Stephan Pastis (the two would later {{be returned to the}} strip via the intervention of United Feature Syndicate), with Tom Batiuk even allowing Pastis to use his representation of the Angel of Death in the second to last strip in the series. A year earlier, as part of a long series featuring multiple storylines, Pastis remarked <b>to</b> <b>Pig</b> that serial strips handle long stories better and featured Funky, Holly, Lisa, and Les in a parody referencing, among other things, Lisa's breast cancer. Pastis was given Batiuk's blessing to run the strip, but just before it was scheduled to run the controversy over the cancer storyline grew to the point where Pastis pulled it from publication as he believed, although he never mentioned the disease by name, anyone who read his strip could infer that he was making light of cancer patients and Pastis did not wish to have Pearls drawn into the controversy.|$|E
