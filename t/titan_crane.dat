Only seven properties in Clydebank were undamaged, {{in one of}} the worst bombing raids in Britain. The raids, involving 260 Luftwaffe bombers on the first night and 200 on the second, targeted the industry of Clydeside, but the <b>Titan</b> <b>crane</b> was undamaged.|$|E
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} regeneration {{plan for}} the site is being implemented by West Dunbartonshire Council and Scottish Enterprise. This includes making the Clydebank waterfront more accessible to the public. Restoration of the historic <b>Titan</b> <b>Crane</b> — built by Sir William Arrol & Co. for the shipyard — was completed in 2007. A new campus for Clydebank College was opened in August 2008. Regeneration plans also include improved infrastructure, modern offices, a light industrial estate and new housing, retail and leisure facilities. It was hoped {{that as part of}} the plan Queen Elizabeth 2 would be returned to the city and river where she was built, but on 18 June 2007 Cunard Line announced that she would be sold to Dubai as a floating hotel.|$|E

50|$|In 1966, Hercules crane {{received}} a new boiler, it used diesel instead of charcoal fuel. Hercules was used at Panama canal {{until a new}} floating crane was purchased, the Herman the German also called the <b>Titan,</b> a 350-ton <b>crane,</b> that replaced Hercules in 1996. The Hercules crane {{is now part of}} the reserve fleet at the Panama canal.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the closure}} of the shipyard, the crane was sold to the Panama Canal Commission and it was transported on the semi-submersible ship Sea Swan (...) in 1996 to the Panama Canal Zone, where it {{currently}} serves as the floating <b>crane</b> <b>Titan.</b> Titan retired Ajax and Hercules that has served the Panama Canal since construction in 1914.|$|R

5000|$|A major {{employer}} {{in the town}} was its founding firm, the John Brown & Company shipyard, which built several well-known ships, including the RMS Lusitania, Hood, Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and Queen Elizabeth 2. Later it became part of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, which {{was the scene of}} a famous [...] "work-in" [...] in the 1970s. The yard and associated engineering works continued to operate under a succession of owners until it was closed in 2000. The site is {{now in the process of}} being redeveloped, with tourist attractions such as the <b>Titan</b> Clydebank <b>Crane</b> and a new campus for Clydebank College a new college for further education.|$|R
50|$|However, it was {{subsequently}} decided that, as the naval floating <b>crane</b> <b>Titan</b> {{was available in}} Sydney and was capable of lifting weights up to 200 tons, the problem was solved. So the bogies, central pivot, undercarriage and gun were unloaded in the Port of Sydney direct on the rails, at Jones Bay, Darling Harbour. From there, the gun was hauled to the N.S.W.G.R. Eveleigh Workshops, where {{with the assistance of}} Lieut. George Norman Pockett, Australian Army Engineer Ordnance Corps, all fittings and parts were reassembled.|$|R
50|$|On 22 January 1984, the Karrabee {{began taking}} water after {{competing}} in the annual Great Ferry Race. After disembarking its passengers, it sank at Circular Quay. It {{had just returned from}} an overhaul at the Urban Transit Authority's Balmain yard. It was raised two days later by the floating <b>crane</b> <b>Titan</b> and laid up while investigations into the sinking took place. Ultimately the cause of the sinking was found to be a buildup of rubbish around the bilge pump inlet and this severely restricted the ability of the pumps to clear the water.|$|R

He lived in a council {{tenement}} in Drumchapel until the early 1970s.Before becoming a full-time writer {{he worked as a}} steelworker/draftsman in Glasgow shipbuilding yards close to the <b>Titan</b> <b>Crane.</b> He worked on the squad that built the QE2, launched 1967 and attended a gala dinner on board in 2008 to mark the ship's retirement to become a floating hotel in Palm Jumeirah, Dubai.|$|E

25|$|Sydney {{paid off}} at Sydney on 8 May 1928 {{and arrived at}} Cockatoo Island in 1929, where she was broken up. The ship's {{foremast}} was retained, and in 1934, it was erected at Bradleys Head by the floating <b>crane</b> <b>Titan.</b> This initially served as {{a monument to the}} engagement against Emden, but was rededicated in 1964 as a monument for all Australian ships lost and all sailors killed in the line of duty. Part of the bow, including the stem head, jackstaff, and fairleads, was set into the seawall at Milsons Point, under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. One of the cruiser's derricks is on display in the Victory Memorial Gardens in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, and a compass stand is located at Port Macquarie, New South Wales. The main top-mast was erected at Environa, New South Wales, but rotted at the base and collapsed. It was later moved to Jervis Bay.|$|R

50|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals {{was made at}} the <b>Titan</b> <b>Crane</b> on the River Clyde in Clydebank on Monday, October 10 at 2pm and was {{streamed}} live on Periscope by Irn-Bru's football Twitter account. The draw was be made by former Dundee United and Scotland striker Kevin Gallacher and Rio 2016 silver medallist Dan Wallace. There was no seeding for the draw however, as with the previous round, teams from Northern Ireland and Wales, should they qualify, would not be drawn against each other. The ties {{took place on the}} weekend of November 12 and 13.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, the North British Diesel Engine Works {{was built}} at the company's Clydeholm Shipyard in Whiteinch, a seminal modernist {{building}} designed by Karl Bernhard and supervised by John Galt that was influenced by Peter Behrens' 1909 AEG turbine factory in Berlin and continues to stand today. In 1920 a large <b>Titan</b> <b>Crane</b> was constructed on the quayside adjacent to the engine works at the Clydehom Yard by Sir William Arrol & Co. to enable transfer of engines for fitting out of ships berthed alongside. It remains one of four examples {{to remain on the}} River Clyde, along with those at Finnieston, Clydebank and Greenock.|$|E
50|$|In December 1999, after Kvaerner {{announced}} a {{withdrawal from the}} shipbuilding industry, the Govan yard was purchased by Clydeport and then taken on a long-term 20-year lease by BAE Systems Marine, who also owned the former Yarrow Shipbuilders yard in Scotstoun on the Clyde. It {{is now part of}} BAE Systems Surface Ships. Continued investment in capital equipment such as Plasma cutting and Panel Line welding, has seen the Govan Shipyard emerge as BAE Systems' Steelwork Centre of Excellence. The 220 ton capacity Fairfield <b>Titan</b> <b>Crane,</b> built in 1911, was demolished in 2007 to make way for construction of modules for the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers at the yard.|$|E

5000|$|The major {{supplier}} of cranes in the cinema of the United States throughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s was the Chapman Company (later Chapman-Leonard of North Hollywood), supplanted {{by dozens of}} similar manufacturers around the world. The traditional design provided seats for both the director and the camera operator, and sometimes a third seat for the cinematographer as well. Large weights {{on the back of}} the crane compensate for the weight of the people riding the crane and must be adjusted carefully to avoid the possibility of accidents. During the 1960s, the tallest crane was the Chapman <b>Titan</b> <b>crane,</b> a massive design over 20 feet high that won an Academy Scientific & Engineering award. Most such cranes were manually operated, requiring an experienced boom operator who knew how to vertically raise, lower, and [...] "crab" [...] the camera alongside actors while the crane platform rolled on separate tracks. The crane operator and camera operator had to precisely coordinate their moves so that focus, pan, and camera position all started and stopped at the same time, requiring great skill and rehearsal.|$|E
