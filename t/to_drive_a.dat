During his stay Bader met the Desoutter brothers, who were beginning to make lightweight artificial legs from aluminium.

He was able <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>a</b> specially modified car, play golf and even dance. During his convalescence, Bader met his future wife Thelma Edwards, a waitress at a nearby pub called the Pantiles.|$|E

The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>a</b> wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.|$|E

For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E

5|$|The {{solar power}} source is via {{photovoltaic}} modules that convert light directly to electricity.

Although simple, this circuit {{is not the most}} energy efficient circuit <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>an</b> LED, since energy is lost in the resistor.

The system operated smoothly through intermittent clouds and continued generating electricity long into the night. Solar Two was decommissioned in 1999, and was converted by the University of California, Davis, into CACTUS, an Air Cherenkov Telescope, in 2001, measuring gamma rays hitting the atmosphere.|$|E

Osborn's next plan involves using a drunken Flash Thompson <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>a</b> truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage. This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle.

5|$|In 1873, a {{group of}} Circassians from Sivas in Anatolia settled in Quneitra. This initial group did not {{cultivate}} the area {{for a number of}} years. A second wave of Circassians, numbering about 2,000, arrived in the Golan in 1878 via Acre after fleeing Bulgaria due to the Russo-Turkish War. Along with Quneitra, they settled or built number of other villages in the vicinity. The Circassians began farming the area and each family was given title to 70 to 130 dunams of land by the government depending on the family's size. The Ottomans encouraged Circassian settlement in the Golan as a means <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>a</b> wedge between the frequently rebellious Druze villages of Mount Hermon and those in Jabal Hauran. The Circassians of Quneitra engaged in sustained conflicts with the Druze and the Al Fadl through the remainder of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 {{the fragile}} {{relations}} between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile finally reached their breaking point when, on April 13, the Germans announced via the Katyn Commission {{the discovery of the}} bodies of 20,000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the Soviets and buried in Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, Russia. Stalin claimed that the atrocity had been carried out by the Germans, while Nazi propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels successfully exploited the Katyn massacre <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>a</b> wedge between Poland, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, did not acknowledge responsibility for this and similar massacres of Polish officers until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} an alien who preys on men in Scotland in Jonathan Glazer's science fiction movie Under the Skin (2013). The film, an {{adaptation}} of Michel Faber's novel of the same name, took nine years to complete. For the role, she learned <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>a</b> van and speak with an English accent. Johansson improvised her conversations with non-professional actors on the street, who were unknowingly participating in the film; these scenes were filmed with hidden cameras.

It earned Johansson a BIFA Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a British Independent Film nomination.|$|E

At the station, a man named Johnson says that he was robbed and forced <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>a</b> man to Lufkin at gunpoint. While on the road, Ramsey receives a report about an armed suspect, and a brief chase ensues.
