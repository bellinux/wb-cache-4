25|$|The TGF beta family include: TGFβ1, TGFβ2, TGFβ3. Like the BMPs, TGF betas are {{involved}} in embryogenesis and cell differentiation, {{but they are also}} involved in apoptosis, as well as other functions. They bind to <b>TGF-beta</b> receptor type-2 (TGFBR2).|$|E
25|$|Several {{other types}} of T cell have suppressive activity, but do not express FOXP3. These include Tr1 cells and Th3 cells, which are thought to {{originate}} during an immune response and act by producing suppressive molecules. Tr1 cells are associated with IL-10, and Th3 cells are associated with <b>TGF-beta.</b> Recently, Treg17 cells {{have been added to}} this list.|$|E
25|$|As {{the theory}} of immune {{intolerance}} {{as a cause of}} pre-eclampsia has become accepted, women who with repeated pre-eclampsia, miscarriages, or in vitro fertilization failures could potentially be administered key immune factors such as <b>TGF-beta</b> along with the father's foreign proteins, possibly either orally, as a sublingual spray, or as a vaginal gel to be applied onto the vaginal wall before intercourse.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two other}} SMADs which {{complete}} the SMAD family, the inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADS), SMAD6 and SMAD7. They {{play a key role}} in the regulation of TGF beta signaling and are involved in negative feedback. Like other SMADs they have an MH1 and an MH2 domain. SMAD7 competes with other R-SMADs with the Type I receptor and prevents their phosphorylation. It resides in the nucleus and upon TGF beta receptor activation translocates to the cytoplasm where it binds the type I receptor. SMAD6 binds SMAD4 preventing the binding of other R-SMADs with the coSMAD. The levels of I-SMAD increase with TGF beta signaling suggesting that they are downstream targets of <b>TGF-beta</b> signaling.|$|E
500|$|<b>TGF-beta</b> is a {{regulator}} {{of tissue}} remodeling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in development, and promotes metastasis in cancer. [...] A {{number of studies}} have identified NEDD9 as a downstream effector in the <b>TGF-beta</b> signaling pathway, essential for promoting EMT. In MCF-7 cells, NEDD9 negatively regulates expression of the epithelial protein E-cadherin, preventing association of E-cadherin with cell membrane and activating SRC-kinase. Activated SRC provides internalization and lysosomal degradation of E-cadherin. Consistent with these findings is a study demonstrating downregulation of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, occludin, β-catenin) and concurrent upregulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin) in response to NEDD9 overexpression in MCF-10 cells.|$|E
500|$|P115 is {{the primary}} target for proteasomal {{degradation}} of NEDD9. Proteasomal degradation of NEDD9 is triggered {{by a number of}} stimuli, including induction of <b>TGF-beta</b> signaling. An effector of the TGFbeta receptor, Smad3, may interact directly with APC subunit APC10 and thus recruit the APC complex. CDH1 subunit of the APC complex recognizes NEDD9 and regulates ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of NEDD9. [...] NEDD9 is also degraded by the proteasome at the end of mitosis, following completion of activities with Aurora-A that support mitotic progression.|$|E
500|$|The 5' {{region of}} the NEDD9 {{promoter}} is regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and contains a retinoic acid response element (RARE) that is specifically bound by a retinoid X receptor (RXR)/retinoic acid receptor (RAR) heterodimer. NEDD9 is also induced by the environmental pollutant dioxin, based on regulation through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). One study has found NEDD9 repressed by estrogen, based on binding of the SAFB1 co-repressor. NEDD9 is induced by Wnt signaling in colon cancer, based on binding to T-cell factor (TCF) factors in the promoter region. NEDD9 is induced by hypoxia and loss of VHL, based on binding of hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) transcription factors to the NEDD9 promoter. Prostaglandin E2 induces NEDD9 transcription. [...] The Fox transcription factor Forkhead box C1 (FoxC1) [...] and PAX5 transcription factor [...] {{have been reported to}} induce NEDD9 transcription. <b>TGF-beta</b> induces NEDD9 transcription. [...] Based on inspection of sequence, the NEDD9 promoter also has potential binding sites for a number of additional transcription factors, including STAT5A and NF-kappa B.|$|E
2500|$|BMP and activin {{membrane}} bound inhibitor (BAMBI), has {{a similar}} extracellular domain as type I receptors. It lacks an intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase domain and hence is a pseudoreceptor. It binds to the type I receptor preventing it from being activated. It serves as a negative regulator of TGF beta signaling and may limit <b>tgf-beta</b> expression during embryogeneis. It requires BMP signaling for its expression ...|$|E
2500|$|... 14-3-3 {{proteins}} {{also contribute}} to the autoinhibition. As 14-3-3 proteins are all known to form constitutive dimers, their assemblies have two binding sites. Thus the dimer acts as a [...] "molecular handcuff", locking their binding partners at a fixed distance and orientation. When the precisely positioned twin 14-3-3 binding motifs are engaged by a single 14-3-3 protein dimer (such as 14-3-3 zeta), they become locked into a conformation that promotes autoinhibition and does not allow the disengagement of the autoinhibitory and catalytic domains. This [...] "lockdown" [...] of c-Raf (and other Rafs as well as KSRs) is controlled by motif phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated 14-3-3 associating motifs do not bind their partners: they need to get phosphorylated on conserved serines (Ser 259 and Ser 621) first, by other protein kinases. The most important kinase implicated in this event is <b>TGF-beta</b> activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and the enzymes dedicated for removal of these phosphates are the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complexes.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{already noted}} the {{importance}} of a woman's immunological tolerance to her baby's paternal genes, several Dutch reproductive biologists decided to take their research a step further. Consistent with the fact that human immune systems tolerate things better when they enter the body via the mouth, the Dutch researchers conducted a series of studies that confirmed a surprisingly strong correlation between a diminished incidence of pre-eclampsia and a woman's practice of oral sex, and noted that the protective effects were strongest if she swallowed her partner's semen. A team from the University of Adelaide has also investigated to see if men who have fathered pregnancies which have ended in miscarriage or pre-eclampsia had low seminal levels of critical immune modulating factors such as <b>TGF-Beta.</b> The team has found that certain men, dubbed [...] "dangerous males", are several times more likely to father pregnancies that would end in either pre-eclampsia or miscarriage. Among other things, most of the [...] "dangerous males" [...] seemed to lack sufficient levels of the seminal immune factors necessary to induce immunological tolerance in their partners.|$|E
50|$|Betaglycan {{also known}} as Transforming growth factor beta {{receptor}} III (TGFBR3), is a cell-surface chondroitin sulfate / heparan sulfate proteoglycan >300 kDa in molecular weight. Betaglycan binds to {{various members of the}} <b>TGF-beta</b> superfamily of ligands via its core protein, and bFGF via its heparan sulfate chains. It is not involved directly in <b>TGF-beta</b> signal transduction but by binding to various member of the <b>TGF-beta</b> superfamily at the cell surface it acts as a reservoir of ligand for <b>TGF-beta</b> receptors.|$|E
5000|$|SKI {{negatively}} regulates transforming growth factor-beta (<b>TGF-beta)</b> by directly {{interacting with}} Smads and repressing the transcription of <b>TGF-beta</b> responsive genes. [...] This {{has been associated}} with cancer due to the large number of roles that peptide growth factors, of which <b>TGF-beta</b> are a subfamily, play in regulating cellular functions such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, specification, and developmental fate.|$|E
50|$|PPM1A {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with Metabotropic glutamate receptor 3.In 2006, Dr. Feng found that PPM1A can terminate <b>TGF-beta</b> signaling by inactivating Smad3 via dephosphorylation. Smad3 is an essential component of the <b>TGF-beta</b> signalling pathway.|$|E
50|$|The protein {{produced}} by the RET gene {{plays an important role}} in the <b>TGF-beta</b> (transforming growth factor beta) signaling system.

50|$|SMAD2 mediates {{the signal}} of the {{transforming}} growth factor (<b>TGF)-beta,</b> and thus regulates multiple cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. This protein is recruited to the <b>TGF-beta</b> receptors through its {{interaction with the}} SMAD anchor for receptor activation (SARA) protein. In response to <b>TGF-beta</b> signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the <b>TGF-beta</b> receptors. The phosphorylation induces the dissociation of this protein with SARA and the association with the family member SMAD4. The association with SMAD4 {{is important for the}} translocation of this protein into the cell nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors. This protein can also be phosphorylated by activin type 1 receptor kinase, and mediates the signal from the activin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} {{function of}} human ectodermin {{to act as}} a negative regulator of Smad4 suggests that this specific function is conserved among the vertebrate lineage. The sequence identity between FAM homologs is higher than 90% when comparing the homologs of Xenopus, zebrafish, mouse, and human, suggesting that this might also be conserved among other organisms. Indeed, knockout gene inactivation in mouse embryos showed that the function of ectodermin as inhibitor of <b>TGF-beta</b> signaling is conserved. Embryos lacking of ectodermin show defective development of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), which is the first tissue that is induced by <b>TGF-beta</b> signals in mouse embryos; in accordance with loss of an inhibitor, ectodermin-/- embryos showed enlarged AVE induction. As the AVE is a natural source of secreted <b>TGF-beta</b> antagonists, this primary AVE expansion caused secondarily, at later stages, an inhibition of extracellular <b>TGF-beta</b> ligands, resulting in embryos lacking of mesoderm development. This model was confirmed by the finding that ectodermin-/- embryos were rescued to wild type (normal AVE, normal mesoderm development) by lowering the genetic dosage of the main <b>TGF-beta</b> ligand of the emrbyo, Nodal. Further supporting a role as <b>TGF-beta</b> inhibitor, tissue-selective deletion of ectodermin from the epiblast (from which the mesoderm, but not the AVE, derive) left the AVE untouched but caused this time an expansion of anterior mesodermal fates, indicative of increased responsiveness to <b>TGF-beta</b> signals. Collectively, these data confirmed with genetic tools a cell-autonomous role for ectodermin as inhibitor of Smad4 responses previously identified in Xenopus embryos and human cell lines.|$|E

50|$|These {{regulatory}} Th17 {{cells are}} generated by <b>TGF-beta</b> plus IL-6 in vitro. They produce IL-17 and IL-10 and {{low level of}} IL-22 and suppress autoimmune and other immune responses. CD4+ T cells polarized with IL-23 and IL-6 are pathogenic upon adoptive transfer in type 1 diabetes while cells polarized with <b>TGF-beta</b> and IL-6 are not pathogenic., The intracellular aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is activated by certain aromatic compounds, is specifically expressed in Treg17 cells. These cells are regulated by IL-23 and <b>TGF-beta.</b> The production of IL-22 in this subset of Th17 cells is regulated by AhR and Treg17 cells are depend on activation of the transcription factor Stat3. In a steady state, <b>TGF-beta</b> and AhR ligands induce low expression of IL-22 along with high expression of AhR, c-MAF, IL-10, and IL-21 that might play a protective role in cell regeneration and host microbiome homeostasis.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} shown that endoglin {{expression}} and <b>TGF-beta</b> secretion are attenuated in bone marrow stromal cells when they are cocultured with prostate cancer cells. Also, the downstream TGF-beta/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which includes Smad1 and Smad2/3, were attenuated along with Smad-dependent gene transcription. Another result in this study was that both Smad1/5/8-dependent inhibitor of DNA binding 1 expression and Smad2/3-dependent plasminogen activator inhibitor I had a reduction in expression and cell proliferation. Ultimately, the cocultured prostate cancer cells altered the <b>TGF-beta</b> signaling in the bone stromal cells, which suggests this modulation is a mechanism of prostate cancer metastases facilitating their growth and survival in the reactive bone stroma. This study emphasizes the importance of endoglin in <b>TGF-beta</b> signaling pathways in other cell types other than endothelial cells.|$|E

50|$|When {{faced with}} {{pressure}} overload, the heart attempts to compensate {{with a number}} of structural alterations including hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and increase of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Rapid accumulation of ECM proteins causes excessive fibrosis resulting in decreased myocardial compliance and increased myocardial stiffness. The exact mechanisms involved in excessive fibrosis are not fully understood but there is evidence that supports involvement from local growth factors FGF-2, <b>TGF-beta</b> and platelet-derived growth factor. TGF-β1 {{plays an important role in}} cardiac remodelling through the stimulation of fibroblast proliferation, ECM deposition and myocyte hypertrophy. The increase in <b>TGF-beta</b> 1 expression in a pressure-overloaded heart correlates with the degree of fibrosis, suggesting <b>TGF-beta</b> 1 involvement in the progression from a compensated hypertrophy to failure. Through an autocrine mechanism, <b>TGF-beta</b> 1 acts on fibroblasts by binding <b>TGF-beta</b> 1 receptors 1 and 2. Upon receptor activation, the receptor-associated transcription factor Smad becomes phosphorylated and associates with Co-Smad. This newly formed Smad-Co-Smad complex enters the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor modulating gene expression.Cardiac remodelling of the ECM is also regulated by the CNP/NPR-B pathway as demonstrated by the improved outcomes in transgenic mice with CNP over-expression subjected to myocardial infarction. Binding of CNP to NPR-B catalyzes the synthesis of cGMP, which is responsible for mediating the anti-fibrotic effects of CNP.Fibrotic heart tissue is associated with an increase risk of ventricular dysfunction which can ultimately lead to heart failure. Thus, anti-fibrotic strategies are a promising approach in the prevention and treatment of heart failure.|$|E

50|$|Lefty, a {{divergent}} {{member of}} the transforming growth factor-β (TGF beta) superfamily of proteins, was originally discovered in the Hamada lab at the Osaka University using deletion screening of cDNA libraries in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells to find clones that did not differentiate when induced to differentiate using retinoic acid. From these screens, researchers found one gene that was a tentative {{member of the}} <b>TGF-beta</b> superfamily that was predominantly expressed {{on the left side}} the embryo and aptly named it lefty. Like other members of the <b>TGF-beta</b> superfamily, lefty is synthesized as a preproprotein, meaning that the protein is proteolytically cleaved and excreted to produce the active form of the protein.
