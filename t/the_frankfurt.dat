5|$|Although {{the award}} {{was created by}} The Bookseller, {{the idea of an}} award celebrating books with odd titles was {{proposed}} by Trevor Bounford of the Diagram Group in order to provide entertainment during <b>the</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> Book Fair in 1978. Originally known as the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at <b>the</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> Book Fair, any book that was at the fair could be nominated, but other books outside of the fair were also included. In 1982, Horace Bent, diarist for The Bookseller, took over administrative duties. Following two occasions in 1987 and 1991 when no prize was given {{due to a lack of}} odd titles, The Bookseller opened suggestions to the readers of the magazine. In 2000, the winner was voted for by the public instead of being decided by Bent. In 2009, online submissions sent on Twitter were accepted. This resulted in the highest number of submissions for the prize in its history, with 90 books being submitted (50 from Twitter), almost three times the number from the previous year (32). However, Bent also expressed his annoyance at people who gave submissions that broke the rules, with some of the books mentioned being published as far back as 1880. The 2014 prize allowed nominations from self-published works, the first book being Strangers Have the Best Candy by Margaret Meps Schulte, which won the prize.|$|E
5|$|German {{philosophy}} is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; {{the establishment of}} classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; the development of <b>the</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> School by Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse and Jürgen Habermas have been particularly influential.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{was criticized}} {{severely}} {{by the international}} press for lax security measures in Frankfurt Airport that allowed Demeke to smuggle a pistol on board, and for allowing the hijacked aircraft to leave after refueling in Hannover. Frankfurt Airport, the busiest airport in Europe at the time, had recently come under fire after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, when it had been alleged that the explosives had been loaded in Frankfurt. Since the 1988 bombing, <b>the</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> airport had performed numerous security reviews and implemented more stringent security procedures.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon, {{expecting to}} win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had {{withdrawn}} the offer. When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations {{on the basis of}} accepting <b>the</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however he rejected the term. The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed; they prevailed. Napoleon adamantly refused.|$|E

5|$|Paying {{money to}} enemy {{subjects}} – some of Speyer's friends had made claims at <b>the</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> bank for payment of sums {{due to them}} {{that were in the}} hands of Speyer in London. Speyer had authorised the payments, although this was not allowed by the wartime regulations. The committee commented that in similar circumstances it had shown leniency to others doing the same thing, and would not have attached great importance to the matter if it had stood alone.|$|E
5|$|Various Germanic tribes have {{inhabited}} the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed {{a central part}} of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> Parliament establishing major democratic rights.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{also made}} {{a variety of other}} {{contributions}} in economic history, as well as economic theory and methodology.

After the First World War, Max Weber was among the founders of the liberal German Democratic Party. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic Weimar Constitution of 1919. After contracting Spanish flu, he died of pneumonia in 1920, aged 56.|$|E

5|$|Garamond died in 1561 and his punches and {{matrices}} {{were sold}} off by his widow. Purchasers included the Le Bé type foundry in Paris {{run by the}} family of Guillaume Le Bé and master printer Christophe Plantin of Antwerp who was in Paris at the time; <b>the</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> foundry often referred to by historians as Egenolff-Berner also came to acquire materials of Garamond's. These sales spread Garamond's work and reputation across Europe, but the division of materials caused problems for printers: Le Bé's son {{is known to have}} written to Plantin's successor Moretus offering to trade matrices so they could both have complementary type in a range of sizes. Egelhoff-Berner showcased various types of Garamond's and other French engravers in a specimen in 1592, which would later be a source for historians.|$|E
5|$|He was {{allocated}} to NFL Europe on January 27, 2004, {{where he played}} for <b>the</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> Galaxy during the 2004 season.

His 91.9 passer rating was also second best in the league. He missed the final two games of the regular season due to his father's death. The Galaxy finished the year with a 7–3 regular season record, which granted them a berth in World Bowl XII. In World Bowl XII, against the Berlin Thunder, O'Sullivan completed 19 of 33 passes for 210 yards and 3 touchdowns with 2 interceptions in the 30–24 loss.|$|E

In the latter country, Triumph International has also acquired the majority stake in the luxury dealer Journelle and has since opened two Triumph stores in New York City. The Triumph International AG, headquartered in Munich, under which the company's German business is associated, was once again fully acquired by the company in 2011 through the exclusion of minority shareholders. Since then, company stocks have no longer been traded on <b>the</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> Stock Exchange, {{and the company is}} wholly owned by the Braun and Spiesshofer families.|$|E
