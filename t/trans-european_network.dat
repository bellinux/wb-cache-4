50|$|The European Commission has {{mandated}} that European railways to publish their deployment planning {{up to the}} 5 July 2017. This {{will be used to}} create a geographical and technical database (TENtec) that can show the ETCS deployment status on the <b>Trans-European</b> <b>Network.</b> From the comparative overview the commission wants to identify the needs for additional coordination measures to support the implementation. Synchronous with the publication of ETCS SRS 3.6.0 on 15 June 2017 the Regulation 2016/796/EC was published. It mandates the replacement of the European Railways Agency by the European Union Agency for Railways. The agency was tasked with the creation of a regulatory framework for a Single European Railway Area (SERA) in the 4th Railway Package to be resolved in late June 2016. A week later the new EU Agency for Railways emphasized the stability of B3R2 and the usage as the foundation for oncoming ETCS implementations in the EU. Based on projections in the Rhine-Alps-Corridor a break-even of the cross-border ETCS implementation is expected in the early 2030s. A new memorandum of understanding was signed on InnoTrans in September 2016 for a completion of the first ETCS Deployment Plan targets by 2022. The new planning was accepted by the European Commission in January 2017 with a goal to have 50% of the Core Network Corridors equipped by 2023 and the remainder in a second phase up to 2030.|$|E
50|$|The Public Roads Administration {{announced}} on 10 January 2012 that {{they intended to}} build a second tube for the tunnel along with a second carriageway on the section of National Road 23 from the tunnel to the Vassum Interchange on E6 in Frogn. The investment was proposed financed through {{an extension of the}} toll collection for an additional twelve to fifteen years. Construction is proposed to start in 2016 and the new tube may be opened in 2019. The project is estimated to cost NOK 2.4 billion. The 6 km section of highway between Måna and Vassum is proposed upgraded to four-lane motorway standard. This involves rebuilding the roundabout at Måsa to an interchange, construction of a parallel tube for the 1610 m Frogn Tunnel, a parallel bridge for the 212 m Bråtan Bridge and a reconstruction of Vassum Tunnel, which acts as a gradient between a single- and twin-tubed tunnel. Should the project be carried through, the toll collection is proposed prolonged until 2028. The ministry asked for alternatives, and two bridge proposals were but forward in 2013. The one involves the original crossing via Håøya, estimated to cost NOK 7 billion. Of this, NOK 5 billion would be for the bridges and would have a total length of 13 km. The second involves a suspension bridge to be built further south in Drøbaksundet, from Vestby, estimated to cost NOK 10 billion. It would have a main span of between 1300 and 1500 m and demand 11 km of new road. The latter bridge allows for a railway to be carried as well. Should a bridge be built, the tunnel would be closed.

Construction is proposed to start in 2016 and the new tube may be opened in 2019. The project is estimated to cost NOK 2.4 billion. The second tube is planned located parallel with the current tube, shifted 250 m to the side, to be built south of the current tube. This will allow each of the tubes to act as an emergency exit for the other. This design was built into the original plans, in which the road administration anticipated building the crossing as a full motorway in two phases. The two tubes will be connected by emergency exits every 250 m. The second tube will have to closely follow the route of the current tunnel, thus eliminating the possibility of a less steep gradient. The Public Roads Administration regards the section through sediments at Hurum as the most challenging part and is considering altering the tunnels positions, both horizontally and vertically, through this part. The 6 km section of highway between Måna and Vassum is proposed upgraded to four-lane motorway standard. This involves rebuilding the roundabout at Måsa to an interchange, construction of a parallel tube for the 1610 m Frogn Tunnel, a parallel bridge for the 212 m Bråtan Bridge and a reconstruction of Vassum Tunnel, which acts as a gradient between a single- and twin-tubed tunnel.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{undertakes}} a discourse-centred {{investigation of}} the underlying rationales of European Union (EU) transport-sector investments. Its central contribution is the ‘Conflicting-Storylines Proposition’, stating that EU transport investments lack consistence and sustainability due {{to the existence of}} partially complementary, partially competing EU development objectives which are in turn expressed through four key storylines: ‘cohesion’, ‘polycentricity’, ‘missing links ’ and, most recently, ‘bottlenecks’. EU decision-making remains deeply conflicted and contested. Transport sector investments have to satisfy different aims related to growth, competitiveness, cohesion and sustainability. The <b>Trans-European</b> <b>Network</b> priority projects violate cohesion and sustainable development goals by concentrating investments in already privileged areas...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{role of the}} <b>Trans-European</b> <b>network</b> as an {{integrated}} international system is compromised due to poor interconnectivity. Improved interconnections can result in more competitive multi-modal alternatives to uni-modal road transportation and contribute to CO 2 emissions reduction. However, {{the fact is that}} nowadays 73 % of all kilometres completed through long-distance trips in Europe are made by road. One of INTERCONNECT goals was to investigate to what extent reducing interconnectivity costs (between different modes and between local and long-distance networks) may result in an optimised transport system, induce modal shifts towards rail and contribute to decrease CO 2 emissions. Conclusions indicate that although these impacts are likely to happen, depending on which specific strategies are adopted to reduce interconnectivity costs, rebound effects may also appear, thereby compromising any potential benefits...|$|E
