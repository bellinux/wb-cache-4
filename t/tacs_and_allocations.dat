40|$|Quota, a {{computer-based}} simulation game, originated as {{an experimental}} game for testing alternative multi-resource management regimes or systems. Highly flexible, it allows specification for a standard common-property, open-access fishery with user-specified bio-economic fishery growth model and multiple sized producers with individual harvest and cost functions. In addition to demonstrating overfishing under open-access, {{various forms of}} Property Rights Systems can be implemented, including the setting of an overall Total Allowable Catch (<b>TAC)</b> <b>and</b> further <b>allocation</b> of the TAC to individual producers [...] Individual Quota Rights (IQR) [...] that may be based on historical catch during initial periods of Open Access fishing or equal shares or shares determined by bargaining amongst the players (producers). Subsequent trading of IQRs is also implemented using a highly developed computerized trading game. Recent use of the game have been as an educational tool in university classes on resource economics and in the field at meetings of Regional Fishing Management Organizations that govern the major tuna fisheries around the world...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of modern resource management in post-war fishery policies involved a strict regulation regime for fisheries. Among the measures are limited entry, the {{introduction of}} total allowable quota (<b>TAC)</b> <b>and</b> individual vessel quotas in addition to technical regulations for the execution of fishing. Also, institutional measures to reduce overcapacity are established. However, the management of shrimp trawling fisheries in the Norwegian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and in the Fisheries Protection Zone around Svalbard provides exceptions to this management regime. No <b>TAC</b> is established <b>and</b> the fleet is not restricted by vessel quotas. During recent {{years there has been}} a massive increase in catch capacity and the management authorities have suggested total quotas as a new management strategy. An introduction of total quotas involves a number of potential conflicts at different levels; it creates allocation problems across nations <b>and</b> internal <b>allocation</b> problems in the Norwegian shrimp fleet. This article presents the driving forces behind the increase in capacity, a process that stands {{in sharp contrast to the}} government's expressed goal to prevent overcapacity. With no <b>TAC</b> <b>and</b> the absence of allocation at different levels, it is difficult to monitor the capacity development. An assessment of various allocation models shows that the problem of overcapacity first becomes evident when total quotas <b>and</b> <b>allocation</b> are put on the agenda.

40|$|Background:  Therapeutic drug {{monitoring}} of immunosuppressant drugs {{are used to}} monitor drug efficacy and toxicity and to prevent organ transplant rejection. This study evaluates the analytical performance of semi-automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIA) for cyclosporine (CSA), tacrolimus (<b>TAC)</b> <b>and</b> sirolimus (SRL) on the Roche cobas e 411 analyzer at a major transplant hospital to assess method suitability and limitations. Methods: Residual whole blood samples from patients undergoing immunosuppressant therapy were used for evaluation. Imprecision, linearity, functional sensitivity, method comparisons and lot-to-lot comparisons were assessed. Results: Total imprecision ranged from 3. 3 to 7. 1 % for CSA, 3. 9 to 9. 4 % for <b>TAC,</b> <b>and</b> 4. 6 to 8. 2 % for SRL. Linearity was verified from 30. 0 to 960. 9 μg/L for CSA, from 1. 1 to 27. 1 μg/L for <b>TAC,</b> <b>and</b> from 0. 5 to 32. 3 µg/L for SRL. The functional sensitivity met the manufacturer’s claims and {{was determined to be}} < 6. 5 μg/L for CSA, 1. 1 μg/L for <b>TAC,</b> <b>and</b> < 0. 1 µg/L for SRL (CV≤ 20 %). Deming regression analysis of method comparisons with the ARCHITECT immunoassay yielded slopes of 0. 917 (95 %CI: 0. 885 - 0. 949) and r of 0. 985 for CSA, 0. 938 (95 %CI: 0. 895 - 0. 981) and r of 0. 974 for <b>TAC,</b> <b>and</b> 0. 842 (0. 810 - 1. 110) and r of 0. 982 for SRL.

40|$|Determining {{effective}} {{cleaning and}} disinfection regimes of livestock housing is vital to improving the health of resident animals and reducing zoonotic disease. A cleaning regime consisting of scraping, soaking with or without detergent (treatment and control), pressure washing, disinfection and natural drying was applied to multiple pig pens. After each cleaning stage, samples were taken from different materials and enumerated for total aerobic count (<b>TAC)</b> <b>and</b> Enterobacteriaceae (ENT). Soaking with detergent (Blast-Off, Biolink) caused significantly greater reductions of <b>TAC</b> <b>and</b> ENT on metal, <b>and</b> <b>TAC</b> on concrete, compared with control. Disinfection effect (Virkon S, DuPont) was not significantly associated with prior detergent treatment. Disinfection significantly reduced <b>TAC</b> <b>and</b> ENT on concrete and stock board but not on metal.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} commercial fish stocks {{in the waters of}} eastern Canada straddle the boundary between Canada's exclusive fishing zone and the high seas. Management of these stocks by Canada and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) has failed to prevent stock depletion. It is argued that NAFO has faced a major problem in developing a successful management regime for these straddling stocks: lack of an effective enforcement capability to make members comply with its total allowable catches (<b>TACs),</b> quota <b>allocations,</b> <b>and</b> technical measures and to prevent nonmember fishing within its Regulatory Area. Long-standing Canadian concern about NAFO's ability to enforce proper management of straddling stocks in the high seas area of the Grand Banks, prompted passage of an amended Coastal Fisheries Protection Act in May 1994 which allowed Canada to arrest and fine foreign vessels fishing beyond Canada's exclusive fishing zone (EFZ) in contravention of NAFO's conservation and management regime. It appears that use of this Act in 1994 eliminated fishing by non-members on the Nose and Tail of the Bank, while action against Spanish and Portuguse vessels in March 1995 may provide the help that NAFO needs in terms of noncompliance with its management regime by member states. ...|$|R

Sirolimus are also metabolized by CYP 3 A subfamily and are substrates of the P-gp. The aim was to determine whether these polymorphisms affect tacrolimus (<b>TAC)</b> <b>and</b> sirolimus (SRL) trough concentrations and dose requirements after renal transplantation. 153 renal transplant recipients were enrolled into this study, 112 were treated with TAC-based regimen, Another 43 recipients received SRL-based regimen. The recipients’ mean follow-up time was 20 mo (range 15 – 27 mo). All renal transplant recipients were all in a stable stage. The trough concentration and daily dose of <b>TAC</b> <b>and</b> SRL were gained from each recipient. All recipients were genotyped for CYP 3 A 5 (6986 A>G), CYP 3 A 4 intron 6 (CYP 3 A 4 * 22), CYP 3 A 4 * 18, ABCB 1 exon 26 (3435 C>T), exon 12 (1236 C>T) and 2677 G>T/A SNPs by HRM analysis (high-resolution melting curve analysis).

Neither PK profiles of SRL nor those of TAC were altered by simultaneous administration. Dose-corrected AUC and C 0 of TAC correlated with SRL (r(2) = 0. 8 and 0. 8, respectively).

Material and Methods: After fertilization, female rats (n= 9) were randomly divided into three groups: Control, Mobile phone -exposure and Exposure to 50 Hz electromagnetic field using a solenoid (LF). In LF group, female rats were placed daily inside a solenoid (50 Hz and 1. 5 mT) for 30 minutes until giving birth.
