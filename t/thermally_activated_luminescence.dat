40|$|In {{this work}} {{results of the}} {{investigation}} of <b>thermally</b> <b>activated</b> <b>luminescence</b> of conjugated polymers are presented. Chemiluminescence produced by oxidative processes is a highly sensitive indicator of the thermooxidative stability of polymers. On the other hand, thermoluminescence can be excited by thermal and irradiative activation. This method is well suited to observe changes in morphology and structure of polymers. Stilbenes were used as simple models of conjugated polymers. The thermooxidative stability of such stilbene oligomers depends on the length of their conjugation, the type of polymer matrix used for imbedding the stilbenes as well as on their concentration within the polymer matrix. Furthermore, the ambient gastype, the intensity of irradiation, the wave length and the time of storage also influence the thermooxidative stability of stilbenes. The various poly(p-phenylene vinylene) 's represent a class of conjugated polymers with special spectral properties, therefore they have been intensively investigated for several years. The thermooxidative stability of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) 's and analogous model compounds can be modified by variation of substituents, polymer (orig.)

40|$|The {{luminescence}} of BaF_ 2 - and BaF_ 2 :Dy" 3 "+-crystals {{was investigated}} after selective excitation with synchrotron radiation. The concentration of Dy" 3 "+-ions in the crystals {{was up to}} 2000 ppm. In BaF_ 2 -crystals cross-luminescence and the radiative decay of self-trapped excitons (STE luminescence) is observed. The broadening of the cross-luminescence bands with increasing temperature is explained by electron-phonon coupling. The density of states in the anion-valence band and in the conduction band is analyzed {{with the help of}} the cross-luminescence. The intensity of the cross-luminescence and the STE-luminescence is investigated in the temperature range between 6 K and 650 K. The STE-luminescence is analyzed as a function of temperature and excitation energy. Maximum STE-intensity is observed after the direct excitation of anion-type excitons. Higher excitation energy causes a delayed STE creation and an elongated STE decay time. Dysprosium doping originates additional emissions, which are assigned to 4 f- 4 f transitions of Dy" 3 "+-ions. This emissions are mainly caused by transitions from the " 4 F_ 9 _/_ 2 level to different " 6 H levels. Maximum intensity of the Dy" 3 "+ emissions is reached at 440 K. At temperatures above 250 K <b>thermally</b> <b>activated</b> <b>luminescence</b> of the " 4 I_ 1 _ 5 _/_ 2 level is observed.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{investigations into}} methodologies {{that can be}} applied to overcome imaging problems associated with carbonate minerals on scanning electron microscope-based cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) systems. The problem arises due to the persistent nature of luminescence from carbonate minerals, which causes ghosting or streaking across SEM-CL images. Two methodologies were tested: • The first methodology (Lee 2000) applied very long image acquisition times that, in certain situations proved capable of producing excellent images at higher resolution than is possible using optical-based CL systems. However, the image acquisition times are too slow (c. 40 minutes per image) to be useful in most day-to-day situations. • The second methodology (Reed and Milliken 2003) uses an optical filter to remove the portion of the CL spectrum responsible for the persistent luminescence (in this case in the yellow to red portion of the visible light spectrum). This enabled capture of SEM-CL images at far faster acquisition times (c. 5 minutes per image) than was possible without the filter. However, the resulting ‘filtered’ images suffer from relatively poor contrast and zoning apparent in these images did not always match zoning observed in optical Cl or unfiltered SEM-CL images. Poor image contrast was observed in the filtered images because the luminescence in the studied carbonates is predominantly due to activation by substitution of Mn, which predominantly occurs in the orange to red portion of the visible spectrum. Therefore, this type of luminescence was effectively excluded by the filter. Consequently the measured signals from the detector reflect the much less intense intrinsic luminescence of the carbonate or luminescence activated by other substituted cations (e. g. rare earth elements) or <b>thermally</b> <b>activated</b> <b>luminescence.</b> Although filtered SEM-CL carbonate imaging met with variable levels of success, the filtered imaging approach will prove useful in the SEM-CL analysis of quartz in mixed quartz-carbonate-bearing lithologies such as carbonate-cemented sandstones, which have previously been hindered by the persistence of the luminescence from the carbonates...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} <b>thermally</b> <b>activated</b> ionization and <b>thermally</b> <b>activated</b> crossover as the {{two possibilities}} of quenching of 5 d luminescence in Pr 3 +-doped Y 3 Al 5 -xGaxO 12. Varying the Ga content x gives the control over the relative energy level location of the 5 d and 4 f 2 :PJ 3 states of Pr 3 + and the host conduction band (CB). Temperature-dependent luminescence lifetime measurements show that the 5 d luminescence quenching temperature T 50 % increases up to x= 2 and decreases with further increasing Ga content. This peculiar behavior is explained by a unique transition between the two quenching mechanisms which have an opposite dependence of thermal quenching on Ga content. For low Ga content, <b>thermally</b> <b>activated</b> crossover from the 4 f 5 d state to the 4 f 2 (PJ 3) states is the operative quenching mechanism.
