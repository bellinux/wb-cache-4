40|$|Dry {{clutches}} {{are widely}} used in conventional and innovative automotive drivelines and represent a key element for automated manual transmissions (AMTs). In practical applications, it is fundamental to model the clutch behavior through its torque transmissibility characteristic, i. e., {{the relationship between the}} <b>throwout</b> <b>bearing</b> position (or the pressure applied by the clutch actuator) and the torque transmitted through the clutch during the engagement phase. In this paper, a new model for the torque transmissibility of dry clutches is proposed. It is analyzed how the transmissibility characteristic depends on: friction pads geometry, cushion spring compression, cushion spring load, and slip-speed-dependent friction. Corresponding functions are suitably composed determining the torque transmissibility expression. An experimental procedure for tuning the characteristic parameters is presented. The clutch-torque transmissibility model is tested on a detailed cosimulation model with a typical AMT controller...|$|E

40|$|In Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) {{based on}} electro-actuated dry-clutch design the {{frictional}} material properties, the sensors accuracy, {{the response of}} the <b>throwout</b> <b>bearing</b> actuator, and the control strategies to drive the engagement operation are mutual interdependent and only an optimized mechatronic design could lead to an effective target from several points of view: passengers' comfort, fuel economy, system reliability, performance, driving feeling, etc. In such transmissions, the quality of the vehicle propulsion as perceived by driver and passengers is largely dependent on either the quality of the control strategies and the fast dynamics of the clutch subsystems. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on control schemes for this type of transmissions have shown that uncertainties on the prediction of the actual torque transmitted by the clutch can severely affect the engagement performance. In this paper a high order dynamic model of the powertrain system which includes the electro-hydraulic actuator dynamics has been analysed to design a feedback controller based on multiple Model Predictive Controller (MPC). Simulations of start-up manoeuvres prove the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and encourage the development of real-time routines for the testing on transmission control unit...|$|E
40|$|In Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) {{the clutch}} control {{strategies}} {{to manage the}} engagement operation and clutch vibrational behaviour are mutual interdependent and only an optimized mechatronic design could lead to an effective target from several points of view: passengers' comfort, fuel economy, system reliability, performance, driving feeling, etc. In fact, noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) phenomena are crucial subjects in the modern automotive industry. In passenger car equipped with automatic transmissions the electronic management of the coupling between engine and transmission couldn’t provide sensible improvement of comfort and overall vehicle performance during gearshifts without the availability of dependable models of the flywheel, clutch and driveline as powerful tools for vehicle design engineers. In this paper, simulations of driveline vibrational behaviour have been performed by implementing a high-order multi-body model for the dry clutch mechanism {{with the purpose of}} studying the excitation of torsional vibration caused by frictional actions during the slip phase of the clutch engagement in manual or automated manual transmissions. The analysis aims at deepen about the coupling between pressure plate wobbling and torsional motions in order to improve the current understanding of the excitation mechanisms in the frequency region of the so-called “eek noise”, 250 - 500 Hz. The results of this work substantiate that enhancing of torsional motion in the characteristic frequency range of the eek effect occurs in vehicle launch and gear shifting operations regardless of the rigid wobbling motion of the pressure plate. Such outcomes underline the need to include the non-linear characteristic of the clutch cushion spring in the simulation frictional induced vibration originated at clutch level. Simulations of gear-shifting operations have been carried out by applying ramp profiles to the clutch <b>throwout</b> <b>bearing</b> according to the requirements of typical manoeuvres in passenger cars...|$|E
40|$|An Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) is {{directly}} {{derived from a}} manual one through the integration of actuators; then, development and production costs are generally lower than other automatic transmissions, while the reliability and durability are at highest level. For high class sport cars, vehicle dynamic performances and driving quality can be strongly improved with respect to automatic transmissions [1]. AMTs systems are generally constituted by a dry or wet clutch assembly and a multi-speed gearbox, both equipped with electro-mechanical or electro-hydraulic actuators, which are driven by a control unit, the transmission control unit (TCU). The operating modes of AMTs are usually two: semiautomatic or fully automatic. In both cases, after the gear shift command, the TCU manages the shifting steps according to current engine regime, driving conditions and selected program. In this transmission type {{the quality of the}} vehicle propulsion as perceived by the driver is largely dependent {{on the quality of the}} control strategies. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on control schemes for AMTs have shown that uncertainties in clutch torque characteristic can severely affect the performance of the clutch engagement: modeling in detail the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a crucial issue in order to design robust engagement control strategies [2, 3 and 4]. This paper aims at investigating the engagement performance of an actuated dry clutch by taking into account the inference of the pressure on the facing materials and the sliding speed. In fact, according to literature outcomes [5], the friction coefficient after a first rising behavior with the sliding speed shows an asymptotic value for a typical clutch facing; the same material exhibits a nearly linear dependence of the friction coefficient on the pressure. The simulations consider: reduced-order dynamic system for simulation of passenger car driveline, control algorithm, experimental maps of the n-D clutch transmission characteristic, and gear shift maneuvers in different operating conditions. The outcome of this analysis could provide valuable issues for designers of automated clutches and control engineers to overcome the well known poor engagement performances of open loop motion strategy of the <b>throwout</b> <b>bearing</b> where cost reason and complexity don’t permit the use of displacement sensor...|$|E
40|$|An Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) {{system is}} {{generally}} constituted by a dry or wet clutch assembly and a multi-speed gearbox, both equipped with electro-mechanical or electro-hydraulic actuators, which {{are driven by}} a control unit, the transmission control unit (TCU). The operating modes of AMTs are usually two: semiautomatic, with the driver requesting a sequential gear shift {{by means of a}} proper interface or fully automatic. In both cases, after the gear shift command, the TCU manages the shifting steps, through suitable signals to the engine, the clutch assembly and the gearbox, according to current engine regime, driving conditions and selected program. For market sectors such as large-series and ecological cars, AMT has the advantage of lower weight and higher efficiency with respect to other typologies of automatic transmissions. Furthermore, an AMT is directly derived from a manual one through the integration of actuators; then, development and production costs are generally lower than other automatic transmissions, while the reliability and durability are at highest level. For high class sport cars, vehicle dynamic performances and driving quality can further improve the results of the automatic transmissions [1]. This transmission type is also an affordable and robust solution, but the quality of the vehicle propulsion as perceived by the driver is largely dependent {{on the quality of the}} control strategies. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on control schemes for AMTs have shown that uncertainties in clutch torque characteristic can severely affect the performance of the clutch engagement: modelling in detail the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a crucial issue in order to design robust engagement control strategies [2, 3].

The outcome of this analysis could become a key element for designers of automated clutches and control engineers to recast the cushion spring conception to overcome the poor engagement performance exhibited by AMTs after repeated gear shifting...|$|E
40|$|Automated manual {{transmissions}} {{based on}} dry clutch are wide spreading in modern automotive transmissions {{because of the}} possible improvements in performance and comfort with respect to manual transmissions. A key issue for an efficient control of electro-actuated dry clutch transmissions is {{the knowledge of the}} clutch torque transmitted during the engagement. The torque transmitted by the clutch can be directly measured by means of setups which are difficult to be implemented in commercial products. Therefore it is fundamental to define an accurate torque transmissibility model to be exploited for the estimation of the clutch torque. A possible estimator is based on the inversion of the driveline dynamic model like showed by Gliemo et al. (2006) and by Amari et al. (2009), but the robustness of this type of estimation drastically depends on the availability of the system parameters and on clutch disk acceleration and engine torque measurements. As proposed by Vasca et al. (2008), a possible alternative consists in using an analytical model describing the friction phenomena and providing the torque transmitted by the clutch starting from the <b>throwout</b> <b>bearing</b> position. Unfortunately, the nominal characteristic (torque vs position) is influenced by several variables. Some of them, such as friction pads wear and diaphragm spring fatigue, have a “long term” effect, like showed by Mauro et al. (2002). Other variables have a direct influence also on each engagement maneuver. These variables, such as slipping speed, pressure, slipping acceleration and temperature affect the friction coefficient, as tested by Senatore et al. (2011), Feng et al. (2010) and by LuK (1996), and the normal force (D’Agostino et al., 2012) (Cappetti et al., 2012). The difficulties in representing the contributions of the different variables in the clutch torque transmissibility characteristic lead to the definition of corresponding lumped models, so as in the works of Myklebust et al. (2012; 2013). In this paper a temperature dependent torque transmissibility model for dry clutch transmissions is proposed. The model estimates the clutch torque by considering separately the influence of the slipping speed and temperature on the friction coefficient and the influence of the temperature on the normal force determined by the flat spring. In order to estimate the temperatures of interest, two thermal models of a dry dual clutch transmission with a central disk are proposed. The temperatures estimated by means of the proposed thermal models are then used for the analysis of open loop and closed loop operating conditions in a realistic dry dual clutch transmission...|$|E
