5|$|In 2014, Wilcher {{released}} Heaven-Haven. The {{music was}} performed by The Linden String Quartet. During production of the CD, Wilcher saw press reports about the fatal attack of 18-year-old Sydney resident Thomas Kelly; Wilcher was unable to separate the sorrow he felt for Kelly and his family from the sentiment he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> through his music. He eventually dedicated the project to Kelly and announced that proceeds from the album would benefit the Thomas Kelly Youth Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Other translators {{have placed}} much greater weight on <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> {{a sense of}} the poetic forms used by Du Fu. Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English-style rhyme schemes, whereas Keith Holyoak in Facing the Moon approximates the Chinese rhyme scheme; both use end-stopped lines and {{preserve}} some degree of parallelism. In The Selected Poems of Du Fu, Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation.|$|E
25|$|Probably Delacroix's best-known painting, Liberty Leading the People is {{an unforgettable}} image of Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward {{under the banner}} of the tricolour {{representing}} liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, he seems to be <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> the will and character of the people, rather than glorifying the actual event, the 1830 revolution against Charles X, which did little other than bring a different king, Louis-Philippe, to power. The warriors lying dead in the foreground offer poignant counterpoint to the symbolic female figure, who is illuminated triumphantly, as if in a spotlight.|$|E

500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well what would it be like if I did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convey?</b> When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E

500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.

2500|$|Diogenes is {{discussed}} in a 1983 book by German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk (English language publication in 1987). In [...] Sloterdijk's Critique of Cynical Reason, Diogenes is used {{as an example of}} Sloterdijk's idea of the [...] "kynical"– in which personal degradation is used for purposes of community comment or censure. Calling the practice of this tactic [...] "kynismos", Sloterdijk explains that the kynical actor actually embodies the message he is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convey.</b> The goal here is typically a false regression that mocks authority– especially authority that the kynical actor considers corrupt, suspect or unworthy.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2016 Milwaukee riots, CNN {{showed a}} clip of Sylville Smith's sister, Sherelle Smith, urging rioters: [...] "Don't bring that {{violence}} here," [...] and referred to her as calling for peace.

Y'all burning down shit we need in our community. [...] Take that shit to the suburbs! [...] Burn that shit down! [...] We need our weave. [...] I don't wear it, but we need it." [...] After being called out for selective editing, a CNN reporter involved in the story tweeted that they had [...] "shorthanded" [...] the quote and posted a link to a corrected video on CNN's website, which began with the screen shot that read: [...] "An earlier version of this story mischaracterized what the victim's sister was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convey.</b> She was calling for peace in her community, urging the protesters to go elsewhere." ...|$|E

[...] "The song was pretty much laid out intact melodically, lyrically and structurally, but Lanois didn't see it. Thought it was pedestrian. Took it down the Afro-polyrhythm route—multirhythm drumming, that sort of thing. Polyrhythm has its place, but it doesn't work for knife-like lyrics <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> majesty and heroism." [...] Dylan offered the song to Sheryl Crow, who recorded it for The Globe Sessions, released in 1998, before Dylan revisited it for Love and Theft. [...] Three outtakes of [...] "Mississippi" [...] from the Time Out Of Mind sessions were included on [...] (two versions on the generally released discs and one on a bonus disc included with the Deluxe Edition of the album).|$|E
2500|$|When {{the case}} reached the High Court on 16 February 2009, {{involving}} 18 {{families and the}} culmination of a ten-year legal process, evidence was put forward describing how, between 1985 and 1997, there existed a possibility that expectant mothers could have been affected by toxic waste which could either have travelled by air as a consequence of dust, or could have been ingested after landing on vegetables or other items. The area was constantly coated with a thick, red dust, including an open air market selling vegetables and other produce. The vehicles were uncovered, and there was no adherence to procedures such as the wheel washing of the vehicles. David Wilby, QC, leading counsel for the claimants, stated in court that one expert, in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> the appearance of the minute particles hanging over the town at that time, had described it as an [...] "atmospheric soup of toxic materials". Some of the open-backed lorries transported so-called 'wet waste', containing dioxins and heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and chromium.|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2012 {{edition of}} Sports Illustrated, Jackson talked about several issues, and also was {{critical}} of the Baseball Writers' Association of America as he believes they have lowered their standards when voting for prospects in the Hall of Fame. He has also been critical of players associated with performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), including distant cousin Barry Bonds, stating [...] "I believe that Hank Aaron is the home run king, not Barry Bonds, as great of a player Bonds was." [...] Of Alex Rodriguez, whom Jackson has worked alongside as {{special assistant to the}} Yankees, Jackson remarked, [...] "Al's a very good friend. But I think there are real questions about his numbers. As much as I like him, what he admitted about his usage does cloud some of his numbers." [...] On July 12, the Yankees released a statement from Jackson after the Sports Illustrated interview had been released. The press release included Jackson saying, [...] "In <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> my feelings about a few issues that I am passionate about, I made the mistake of naming some specific players." [...] It had been reported [...] he had been told by the Yankees to steer clear from the team, although general manager Brian Cashman stated he had not been banned but only told to not join the club on a road trip to Boston and would later be free to interact with the club. After the SI article became known and Jackson's status with the Yankees being talked about, Jackson confirmed in his statement [...] "I continue to have a strong relationship with the club, and look forward to continuing my role with the team." ...|$|E
