5|$|In 1914, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{deactivated}} for {{the winter}} in between January 12–15 and relit between March 14–16.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{automated}} in 1979, {{people were}} in charge of the light on a continuous basis. The heads and first assistants of the light played a prominent role in carrying out the daily processes of the light.|$|E
5|$|Designed by Robert Stevenson {{and built}} by James Smith of Inverness <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> first {{exhibited}} on 15 October 1833. The oil-burning light was converted to incandescent in 1906 and the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation on 23 October 1980, {{when the last}} keepers were withdrawn.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a {{complete}} <b>light</b> characteristic <b>is</b> [...] "Gp Oc(3) W 10s 15m 10M". This indicates that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> a group occulting light in which {{a group of three}} eclipses repeat every 10 seconds; <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> white; <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> 15 metres above the chart datum and is visible for 10 nmi km.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second example}} {{can be read}} [...] "If both switch A and switch B <b>are</b> closed, then <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on. Therefore, it is either true that if switch A <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on, or that if switch B <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on." [...] Here, the most likely natural-language {{interpretation}} of the [...] "if ... then ..." [...] statements would be [...] "whenever switch A <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on", and [...] "whenever switch B <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on". Again, under this interpretation both clauses of the conclusion may be false (for instance in a series circuit, with a light that only comes on when both switches are closed).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Methinks,' said Esclairmonde, 'that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> there, even as <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> also before <b>the</b> eyes of {{the true}} knight; {{but it is not}} only there.' ...|$|R
5|$|On 28 March 1961 <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> electrified, with mains {{electricity}} {{as the power}} source, and an intensity of 1,000,000cd. The drive was replaced with a 0.3 amp electric motor. At {{the same time the}} staff was cut from three lightkeepers to two.|$|E
5|$|The Round Island Lighthouse {{is located}} {{just south of}} the island on the small, {{uninhabited}} Round Island. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> built in 1894 and automated in 1924. Extensive restoration efforts began in the 1970s and the exterior and structure have since been repaired.|$|E
5|$|The lantern {{initially}} {{contained a}} fourth order Fresnel lens giving a red light; a short mast {{on the roof}} of the lantern bore a radio beacon antenna. The fog signal was a horn powered by compressed air. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> activated in 1935.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the energy in <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> also {{decreased}} when {{the wall is}} moving away, because <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> doing work on the wall by radiation pressure. Because <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> reflected, <b>the</b> pressure is equal to twice the momentum carried by <b>light,</b> which <b>is</b> E/c. <b>The</b> {{rate at which the}} pressure does work on the wall is found by multiplying by the velocity: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1901, <b>the</b> Front <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> about 360 ft {{southeast}} of the southeastern angle of Fort Moultrie, and <b>the</b> other <b>light</b> <b>was</b> about 190 ft {{to the east of}} <b>the</b> Front <b>light.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> eventually removed at an unknown date.|$|R
25|$|The {{site and}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>are</b> {{operated}} by <b>the</b> Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The island is accessible by boat, but both {{the site and}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>are</b> closed to <b>the</b> public.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> again poor on {{the fourth}} day, but England did not appeal against it. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} to erase the deficit and build a lead, to force Australia to chase a target on an erratic surface if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket. Bradman thought that rain might come, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensive leg theory so England {{would not be in}} the lead should a sticky wicket arise. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{automated}} and demanned in 1994. It {{was one of}} {{the last}} stations in Australia to demanned, after over 90 years of being staffed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{automated}} in 1979. Today, {{the lighthouse}} displays an occulting red light with a four-second period, having a nominal range of 12 nautical miles. During the navigation season {{that runs from}} April 1 to November 1, the fog signal sounds a two-second blast every fifteen seconds.|$|E
6000|$|The {{part that}} loves <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> called <b>the</b> Leaf. It {{is an old}} Saxon word; I cannot get at its origin. The part that hates <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> called <b>the</b> Root. {27} ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Penfield Reef <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} in 1874. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> an active aid to navigation.|$|R
5000|$|The 12 m tall {{lighthouse}} has an {{occulting light}} that flashes white, red, and green. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> can <b>be</b> seen {{for up to}} [...] [...] <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> activated from July 21 until May 16 each year. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> inactive and unnecessary during the late {{spring and early summer}} due to the midnight sun.|$|R
5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> again poor, but England did {{not appeal}} to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress {{in the hope that}} the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park {{includes}} {{a number of}} navigational aids, {{as well as an}} ornamental structure built to resemble a lighthouse. The Fowey Rocks Light is a skeleton-frame cast iron structure built in 1878. Already included within the boundaries of the park, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> acquired by the Park Service on October 2, 2012. The unmanned Pacific Reef Light is about three miles (5 km) offshore from Elliott Key. The original 1921 structure was replaced in 2000 and its lantern was placed on display in a park in Islamorada.|$|E
5000|$|About 30 ft from <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>are</b> two bronze plaques located where <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>light</b> <b>was,</b> one listing <b>the</b> {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and <b>the</b> other listing keepers who looked after <b>the</b> <b>light</b> until it <b>was</b> {{taken over by}} the Coast Guard: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> modern {{construction}} {{established in}} 1980. It is a skeletal tower covere by aluminium panels with <b>the</b> <b>light</b> on <b>the</b> top, <b>the</b> characteristic <b>light</b> <b>is</b> not available.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> current <b>light</b> {{characteristic}} <b>is</b> {{one white}} flash every five seconds (Fl.W. 5s). <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> partially obscured.|$|R
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} a 1989 {{failure of the}} submarine cable and problems with the diesel generator, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> converted to solar power with battery storage. The caretaker stayed in the premises until March 1991, when lease arrangement difficulties and the previous failure of the mains forced the caretaker's withdrawal. It only took until September 1991 for vandals to destroy the keepers' cottages by fire. In 1992 the Australian Construction Services cleared the site and stabilised some of the building elements, and a security fence was installed.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, a Ralphi Rosario mix of her 1995 song Talking to the Universe {{became her}} seventh {{consecutive}} No. 1 {{hit on the}} Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. In March of the same year, she was awarded the 20,000-euro ($26,400) Oskar Kokoschka Prize in Austria. From June 19 to September 9, her work To <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery in London. It was held {{in conjunction with the}} London 2012 Festival, a 12-week UK-wide celebration featuring internationally renowned artists from Midsummer's Day (June 21) to {{the final day of the}} Paralympic Games on September 9.|$|E

50|$|Photoresistors can {{be placed}} in streetlights to control when <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on. Ambient <b>light</b> falling on <b>the</b> {{photoresistor}} causes the streetlight to turn off. Thus energy is saved by ensuring <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> only on during hours of darkness.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> current <b>light</b> <b>is</b> a fixed green {{signal that}} is visible for [...] <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> made green by an acrylic {{cylinder}} {{that surrounds the}} lens.|$|R
5|$|Into <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in September 2012. He went on an into the Light Tour in September, October, and November 2013. West released his sixth studio album, Live Forever, on April 28, 2015. His seventh studio album, All In, {{is set to}} release on September 22, 2017, and will be immediately followed by his All In tour.|$|E
5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was seasonal, work on site being undertaken {{only in the}} spring and summer, when <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over winter in the tracing house (that of York has both a fireplace and a privy) to prepare designs for the next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of May 20, 2013, the general public witnessed, through a {{dedicated}} webcam, that the bulb had apparently burned out. The next morning, an electrician {{was called in to}} confirm its status. It was determined that the bulb had not burned out when the uninterruptible power supply was bypassed, using an extension cord. The dedicated power supply was found to have been faulty. Approximately seven hours had transpired before <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> reestablished.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> current <b>light</b> source <b>is</b> a solar powered 12 volt Halogen Lamp, with an {{intensity}} of 37,000 cd. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> characteristic shown <b>is</b> a white flash every five seconds (Fl.W. 5s). <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> visible for ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{criticism}} of the CONMEBOL regarding <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>was</b> decided to improve <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> of <b>the</b> stadium, {{in the process of}} adapting <b>the</b> new <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> failures. Even in a night game of the Copa Colombia, between Tolima and Atletico Nacional, on September 6, the system collapsed due to overload one of the transformers. Currently, the director of the agency in charge of Murillo Toro said the participation of Deportes Tolima in <b>the</b> Copa Libertadores <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> in perfect condition. <b>The</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>was</b> at 260 lumen and happened to have a capacity of 750 lumen.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> {{characteristic}} <b>is</b> {{marked by}} a flash every twenty seconds, whereby <b>the</b> <b>light's</b> colour <b>is</b> alternating red and green. Originally, at night, the tower shaft itself was lit green and red according to its markings, but now, after the reopening on May 2009, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> white.|$|R
