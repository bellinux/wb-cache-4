On October 3, 1811, he married his third wife, Elizabeth (Thompson) Rodes, a widow from Scott County.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of conserving B.brownii in its present disease-exposed locations, it is an especially suitable candidate for ex situ conservation measures, such as the cold-storage of seed, and the translocation of plants to disease-free locations. Seed of B.brownii has been collected by Western Australia's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that would otherwise have been lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts. A seed orchard was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 disease-free, healthy plants, some of which had grown more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> rate of those in the wild.

5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch has a {{population}} of 45,080 according to a 2007 census, making it the fourth most populous settlement in Dorset. It lies in the South East Dorset conurbation {{which is one of the}} South Coast's major urban areas with a total population of over 400,000. Over the three decades between 1971 and 2001, Christchurch's population increased by 32% from 33,768 to 44,865; and between 1991 and 2001 by 8.5%. This was more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> average for England and Wales (2.5%), and it is expected to grow by a further 16% to 52,100 by 2028. Between 1999 and 2006 there was a net gain of 4,200 people from migration alone (i.e. excluding births and deaths). On average 3,100 people enter the borough and 2,500 leave each year, giving a net average gain of 600 migrants. The population density of Christchurch is four times the UK average with 873 people per square kilometre (2,307 per sq mi).|$|E
5|$|Rubidium-87 has a {{half-life}} of years, {{which is}} more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> {{age of the universe}} of years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium–strontium dating).|$|E
