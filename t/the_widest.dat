5|$|In graph algorithms, <b>the</b> <b>widest</b> path {{problem is}} the problem of finding a path between two {{designated}} vertices in a weighted graph, maximizing the weight of the minimum-weight edge in the path. <b>The</b> <b>widest</b> path problem is also known as the bottleneck shortest path problem or the maximum capacity path problem. It is possible to adapt most shortest path algorithms to compute widest paths, by modifying them to use the bottleneck distance instead of path length. However, in many cases even faster algorithms are possible.|$|E

30|$|The urgent {{problem of}} the {{relaying}} protection in the modern AC/DC hybrid connected grid {{and the development of}} <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area communication, <b>the</b> information process and the intelligent technology powerfully promotes the development of the technology of <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area relaying protection (WARP), which has become a research hotspot that attracts extensive attention. Originated from the basic concept of <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area relaying protection, this paper analyses the advantages, the effects and the functions of <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area relaying protection. The two main approaches to realize <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area protection, which are on-line adaptive setting (OAS) principle and fault element identification (FEI), are introduced in this paper. Aimed at improving the performance of the backup protection, the research content and the technology demand of <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area protection are proposed, meanwhile, the basic principle and the algorithm of the fault element identification are introduced. At last, the scheme of <b>the</b> limited <b>wide</b> area relaying protection based on the existing pilot channel of the main protection is discussed.|$|R

5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for <b>the</b> <b>widest</b> path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E

Vocalizing emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.|$|E
