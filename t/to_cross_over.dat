5|$|The {{familiar}} {{forms of}} entertainment {{have the capacity}} <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.|$|E
5|$|All the {{buildings}} are interconnected through steps and stairways made in rocks. There are a few rickety wooden bridges along the paths and stairways also <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over.</b> The temple {{at the highest level}} has a frieze of Buddha. Each building has a balcony, which provides lovely views of the scenic Paro valley down below. The Monasteries have ancient history of occupation by monks, as hermitages.|$|E

5|$|General Clinton began {{movements}} <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> to {{the northern}} end of Sullivan's Island. Assisted by two sloops of war, the flotilla of longboats carrying his troops came under fire from Colonel William Thomson's defenses. Facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire, Clinton abandoned the attempt.|$|E
5|$|The pilots' smaller stories {{actually}} make a bigger point, {{which is that}} we're all {{together in the same}} robot … Either we get along or we die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.|$|E
5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's {{hallucination}} of Peter points {{out to her}} {{that there is a}} way to tell if she is from the prime universe: by confirming her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in the parallel universe. During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to the parallel universe shortly after Ella answers. As she is removed from the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E
25|$|If {{terminal}} fusion (restitutional meiosis of anaphase II or {{the fusion}} of its products) occurs, a little over half the mother's genetic material {{is present in the}} offspring and the offspring are mostly homozygous. This is because at anaphase II the sister chromatids are separated and whatever heterozygosity is present is due <b>to</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>over.</b> In the case of endomitosis after meiosis the offspring is completely homozygous and has only half the mother's genetic material.|$|R

5000|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out with G. australasiae to study the time of genetic {{recombination}} in relation to the sequence of stages in meiosis, the relationship of chiasmata <b>to</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>over,</b> and the mechanism of recombination. [...] Combined cytological and autoradiographic analyses of meiosis showed that <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> is achieved by breakage and exchange of segments of nonsister, homologous chromatids, and each such exchange event results in the formation of a cytologically visible chiasma. The meiotic stage at which this form of recombination takes place has been identified as “early pachytene,” and it is well removed from premeiotic chromosome duplication.|$|R
5|$|Edward and {{his allies}} amongst the Welsh princes soon began to quarrel, and in early 1282 {{rebellion}} broke out, led by Llwelyn's brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd. Edward responded to the revolt by mobilising a royal army of 8,000 foot soldiers and 750 cavalry, which he marched north to Rhuddlan, while in South and mid-Wales Marcher Lord forces advanced from Carmarthen and Montgomery. Edward then mounted a naval invasion of the Isle of Anglesey and formed a temporary bridge <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> onto the mainland, taking the war into the Welsh heartlands of Snowdonia. Llywelyn was killed that December, and in early 1283 Dafydd was captured and executed.|$|E
5|$|MD7's name {{changes to}} Old Philadelphia Road as it crosses Grays Run. Beyond Stepney Road, the state highway curves to the {{southeast}} <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision, passing between industrial parks before reaching its eastern terminus at US40 (Pulaski Highway) on {{the western edge of}} Aberdeen. Old Philadelphia Road continues east as MD159 before becoming a county highway that serves an industrial area, intersects MD715 (Short Lane), and passes the historic home Poplar Hill, after which the highway merges with US40 just west of downtown Aberdeen.|$|E
5|$|Near the Lake Ontario shoreline, NY18F {{connects to}} the Fort Niagara spur of the Niagara Scenic State Parkway via a partial diamond interchange. Only {{westbound}} access is permitted at the location; access to the eastbound spur, and thus the parkway mainline, is provided via NY93 in Youngstown or by NY18 farther east. Past the exit, NY18F turns east and begins to parallel the lakeshore. The route also parallels the mainline Moses Parkway for a short distance before curving south <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> the parkway and terminate at NY18 {{in the vicinity of}} Four Mile Creek State Park in Porter.|$|E

Betty played her sophomore year at Grant High School in Grant, OK. She originally learned the six-player game of basketball while in Oklahoma. She struggled when her family moved to Missouri, as she was not used <b>to</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> the center line to be a defensive player, as she had only been an offensive player while in Oklahoma.|$|R

5|$|Tarantino {{finished}} the script on April 26, 2011, and handed {{in the final}} draft to The Weinstein Company. In October 2012, frequent Tarantino collaborator RZA {{said that he and}} Tarantino had intended <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> Django Unchained with RZA's Tarantino-presented martial-arts film The Man with the Iron Fists. The crossover would have seen a younger version of the blacksmith character from RZA's film appear as a slave in an auction. However, scheduling conflicts prevented RZA's participation.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening in}} 1885 of the Saint-Louis–Dakar railway {{increased}} the traffic over the bridge. The railway reached {{all the way}} to Sor and all the goods hauled between the coast and the railway station had <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> the bridge. To prevent the breakdown of the bridge a special decree was given so that the maximum weight for a vehicle that crosses the bridge to be less than one and a half tonnes. With all its difficulties the bridge remained in service 32 years, until 1897 when it was dismantled.|$|E
5|$|The track layout is {{such that}} each line has its own pair of tracks {{and a pair of}} double {{switches}} between these tracks, and each service has its own island platform serving these tracks. In regular operation, no service needs <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> the tracks of another service. The tracks are numbered sequentially from east to west, with the N train at tracks 1 and 2; the Q at tracks 3 and 4; the F at tracks 5 and 6; and the D at tracks 7 and 8.|$|E

5|$|When the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western {{expanded}} the Kingsland Shops in 1903, a new station depot was constructed of brick {{along with a}} cut and cover tunnel. The tunnel itself cost $71,500 (1903 USD) and permitted the local street, Schuyler Avenue <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> the rail line. The new station depot was built on Ridge Road over the tracks, with platforms crossing over the new bridge. The design of the station depot located above the tracks was later replicated by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western's Montclair Branch for its Watsessing Avenue station in Bloomfield, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was {{eaten by}} miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The {{technician}} {{who did the}} research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional fillings have included {{a wide variety of}} locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.|$|E
5|$|At {{the funeral}} parlour, Rose wakes up {{along with the}} newly-reanimated corpses of Mrs. Peace and Mr. Redpath. The Doctor and Dickens arrive and break into the parlour {{just in time to}} rescue Rose. After hearing about the trouble with the corpses, the Doctor convinces Gwyneth to help him hold a séance to attempt to {{communicate}} with the dead. The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift that exists {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over.</b> The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E

50|$|Past NY 170A, {{as well as}} {{the hamlet}} of Salisbury {{centered}} around the junction, NY 29 continues to Salisbury Center. In the center of the community, NY 29A, a northerly alternate to NY 29, splits off and heads east toward the southernmost reaches of Adirondack Park. NY 29, however, curves south, paralleling Spruce Creek to the village of Dolgeville, located on the Herkimer-Fulton County line. Within the village, NY 29 meets NY 167 prior <b>to</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> the East Canada Creek (and entering Fulton County) and leaving Dolgeville.|$|R
5|$|By 17:00, the Luftwaffe {{was ready}} to strike again. Radar {{stations}} were now plotting more German formations off the Kent coast and over the Pas-de-Calais area. Having attacked Biggin Hill and Kenley, Luftflotte 2 was now going after the Sector Station RAF North Weald and RAF Hornchurch. Some 58 Do 17s of KG 2 were sent to bomb Hornchurch and 51 He 111s of KG 53 were directed to attack North Weald. The two raiding formations were to pass over the coast at the same time; so the He 111s attacking North Weald, with further to go, left 15 minutes earlier. The He 111s were <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> at Foulness, the Dorniers at Deal. Fighter escort was provided by 140 Bf 109s and Bf 110s from JG 3, JG 26, JG 51, JG 54 and ZG 26.|$|E
5|$|By summer 821, Thomas had {{consolidated}} {{his position}} in the East, though the Opsician and Armeniac themes still eluded his control. He {{set his sights on}} the ultimate prize, Constantinople, the possession of which alone conferred full legitimacy to an emperor. Thomas assembled troops, gathered supplies, and built siege machines. To counter the powerful Imperial Fleet stationed in the capital, he built new ships to augment his existing fleet, which came from the Cibyrrhaeot and Aegean Sea naval themes, and possibly included task forces from the theme of Hellas. Thomas recalled Gregory Pterotos, a general and nephew of Leo V whom Michael had exiled to the island of Skyros, and gave him command of the fleet. By October, the thematic fleets loyal to Thomas had finished assembling at Lesbos, and Thomas's army began marching from the Thracesian Theme towards Abydos, where he intended <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> into Europe.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Greta–Olivia {{was one of}} ten named Atlantic hurricanes <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> Central America {{into the}} eastern Pacific while {{remaining}} a tropical cyclone. The seventh named storm of the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season, Greta formed from a tropical wave just northwest of Trinidad on September13, and despite being in a climatologically unfavorable area, gradually intensified while moving west-northwestward. On September16, it became a hurricane south of Jamaica. Two days later, the well-defined eye approached northeastern Honduras but veered to the northwest. After reaching peak winds of 130mph (215km/h) that day, Greta weakened while paralleling the northern Honduras coast just offshore. On September19, it made landfall on Belize near Dangriga and quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing Guatemala and southeastern Mexico. After entering the eastern Pacific, the system re-intensified into a hurricane and was renamed Olivia, which weakened before dissipating over Chiapas on September23.|$|E
50|$|SR 178 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 1/SR 4 (South State Street) in Lyons, in Toombs County. It heads southeast through rural areas until it intersects SR 56, west of Reidsville. The highway continues {{to the southeast}} and meets SR 147, near the Georgia State Prison. The two routes head concurrent into Tattnall County. Just prior <b>to</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> the Ohoopee River, SR 178 curves {{to the east and}} continues in that orientation until it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 121/SR 144/SR 169 southwest of Glennville.|$|R
