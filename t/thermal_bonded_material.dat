40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} related to HVDC applications {{is the presence of}} space charge within the dielectrics, which distorts the electric field distribution and contributes to accelerated ageing and consequent failure of the cable insulation. In this paper, an attempt is made to explore the space charge characteristics using different electrode materials and temperature conditions to highlight the variation in space charge formation and distribution in the system using pulsed electro acoustic (PEA) technique. To simulate a real cable manufacturing process, XLPE insulation was sandwiched between two layers of <b>thermal</b> <b>bonded</b> semicon <b>material.</b> The experimental results revealed that the semiconductive materials has a greater influence on the space charge formation. It was found the electrode materials {{play a vital role in}} determining the charge distribution in the insulation and significant dependence on the electrode materials under the same applied stress and temperature conditions. <b>Thermal</b> <b>bonded</b> semicon samples have a stronger charge injection and greater charge amount within the bulk and high temperature can greatly increase the charge mobility for both polarities as well as enhances charge injection. These findings are discussed in conjunction with unbonded sample (conventional setup) for the space charge measurements...|$|R

40|$|The Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) treats spent {{nuclear fuel}} using an electro-chemical process that {{separates}} the uranium from the fission products, sodium <b>thermal</b> <b>bond,</b> and cladding <b>materials</b> [REF 1]. Upon immersion into the ER electrolyte, the sodium used to thermally bond the fuel to the clad jacket chemically reacts with the UCl 3 in the electrolyte producing NaCl and uranium metal. The uranium in the spent fuel is separated from the cladding and fission products {{by taking advantage of}} the electro-chemical potential differences between uranium and the other fuel components. Assuming all the sodium in the <b>thermal</b> <b>bond</b> is converted to NaCl in the ER, the difference between the cumulative bond sodium mass in the fuel elements and the cumulative sodium mass found in the driver ER electrolyte inventory provides an upper mass limit for the sodium that migrated to the upper gas region, or plenum section, of the fuel element during irradiation in the reactor. The plenums are to be processed as metal waste via melting and metal consolidation operations.

40|$|The Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF) treats spent {{nuclear fuel}} using an electrometallurgical process that {{separates}} the uranium from the fission products, sodium <b>thermal</b> <b>bond</b> and cladding <b>materials.</b> Material accountancy is necessary at FCF for two reasons: first, it provides a mechanism for detecting a potential loss of nuclear material for safeguards and security; second, it provides a periodic check of inventories to ensure that processes and material are under control. By weighing material entering and leaving a process, and using sampling results to determine composition, an inventory difference (ID) results when the measured inventory is compared to the predicted inventory. The ID and its uncertainty, based on error propagation, determines the degree of assurance that an operation proceeded according to expectations. FCF uses the ID calculation in two ways: closeout, which is the ID and uncertainty for a particular operational step, and material accountancy, which determines an ID and its associated uncertainty for a material balance area through several operational steps. Material accountancy over the whole facility for a specified time period assists in detecting diversion of nuclear material. Data from depleted uranium operations are presented to illustrate the method used in FCF...|$|R

To analyze the sensing accuracy of the FBG strain sensor, a simplified longitudinal strain transmission model is established to discuss the transfer coefficient issue.

40|$|Semiconductor disk lasers {{have been}} shown to be a {{versatile}} laser technology providing tunable high power operation and good beam quality at wavelengths from 670 nm to 2. 3 pim [1 - 2]. The addition of a second harmonic generation (SHG) crystal allows this wavelength range to be extended further into the visible, and even into the UV [1]. The limiting factor to the output power of these devices is heating, and two principal techniques have been developed for thermal management. The first is to remove most or all of the substrate, and bond the semiconductor chip to a high thermal conductivity heatsink. The alternative is to use an optical window of high <b>thermal</b> conductivity <b>material</b> <b>bonded</b> to the intracavity surface of the semiconductor chip. Substrate thinning has been very effective in devices around 1 rtm, but at more challenging wavelengths, where the thermal impedance of the semiconductor materials is much greater, the intracavity heatspreader allows heat to be removed over a larger area, improving the efficiency of thermal management (see Figure 1).
