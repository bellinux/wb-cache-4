5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E

The citizens of Enterprise, Alabama, erected <b>the</b> <b>Boll</b> Weevil Monument in 1919, perceiving that their economy had been overly dependent on cotton, and that mixed farming and manufacturing were better alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Boll weevils was {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} political epithet by Democratic Party leaders, implying that <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> weevils were unreliable on key votes or not team players.

40|$|A highly {{replicated}} 3 -year {{field study}} was conducted to determine the seasonal patterns of bacterial colonization of cotton fiber from the time of dehiscence of <b>the</b> <b>bolls</b> (<b>the</b> point at which <b>the</b> <b>bolls</b> just begin to open) through harvest and commercial ginning. Bacterial numbers on fiber samples from 16 plots were determined by dilution pour plating with tryptic soy agar containing cycloheximide, and numbers of gram-negative bacteria were determined by plating on tryptic soy agar containing vancomycin and cycloheximide. Populations of bacteria varied from year to year, but in all three seasons the pattern of colonization was generally a pattern consisting of a rapid increase following opening of <b>the</b> <b>bolls</b> and a more or less stable number thereafter throughout the growing season. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 50 % or more of the recoverable bacterial population. We hypothesized that the luxuriant bacterial flora developed {{as a result of the}} availability of sufficient free water in <b>the</b> <b>bolls</b> to allow bacterial proliferation with the carbon sources remaining after fiber maturation. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the threshold moisture level allowing growth of bacteria on fiber in <b>the</b> <b>bolls.</b> Bacterial proliferation occurred when as little as 2 % moisture was added to air-dried fiber. Using simulated bolls, we demonstrated bacterial growth resulting from dew formation on fiber held in controlled-humidity chambers...|$|R

Higher percentages of emergence and lowest mortality in bolls occurred in bolls collected in November as compared to bolls collected in December.

Dodd evaluated French aircraft and favored adopting the Salmson two-seater for reconnaissance work. Eventually 705 Salmsons were purchased for the Air Service; of these 557 saw front-line service.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>boll</b> weevil (Anthonomus grandis) is a beetle which {{feeds on}} cotton buds and flowers. Thought to be native to Central Mexico, it {{migrated}} into the United States from Mexico {{in the late}} 19th century and had infested all U.S. cotton-growing areas by the 1920s, devastating the industry and the people working in the American South. During the late 20th century, it became a serious pest in South America as well. Since 1978, <b>the</b> <b>Boll</b> Weevil Eradication Program in the U.S. allowed full-scale cultivation to resume in many regions.|$|E
25|$|Until the mid-20th century, Florida was {{the least}} populous Southern state. In 1900, its {{population}} was only 528,542, of whom nearly 44% were African American, the same proportion as before the Civil War. <b>The</b> <b>boll</b> weevil devastated cotton crops.|$|E
25|$|Other {{avenues of}} control {{that have been}} {{explored}} include weevil-resistant strains of cotton, the parasitic wasp Catolaccus grandis, the fungus Beauveria bassiana, and the Chilo iridescent virus.

It would also prevent textile mill workers from being exposed to the cotton dust of bract origin...|$|R

25|$|After the Civil War, {{the state}} refused {{for years to}} build human capital by fully educating all its citizens. In addition, the {{reliance}} on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of cotton crops due to the devastation of <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> weevil in the early 20th century, devastating floods in 1912–1913 and 1927, collapse of cotton prices after 1920, and drought in 1930.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, {{thousands}} of African Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration north to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings. <b>The</b> <b>boll</b> weevil infestation and agricultural problems cost many sharecroppers and farmers their jobs. The mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers. Beginning in the 1940s, blacks went West to California for jobs in its expanding defense industries.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the rhetoric}} {{surrounding}} lynchings frequently suggested {{they were to}} protect the virtue and safety of white women, the actions basically arose out of white attempts to maintain domination in a rapidly changing society and their fears of social change.

25|$|Boll weevils {{begin to}} die at {{temperatures}} {{at or below}} −5°C (23°F). Research at the University of Missouri indicates they cannot survive {{more than an hour}} at −15°C (5°F). The insulation offered by leaf litter, crop residues, and snow may enable the beetle to survive when air temperatures drop to these levels. <b>The</b> <b>boll</b> weevil lays its eggs inside buds and ripening bolls (fruits) of the cotton plants. The adult insect has a long snout, is grayish color, and is usually less than 6mm long.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Younger, Older, and Oldest dryases, a century-long period of colder climate, similar to the Younger Dryas in abruptness, has occurred within both <b>the</b> <b>Bølling</b> oscillation and <b>the</b> Allerød oscillation interstadials. The cold period, which occurred within <b>the</b> <b>Bølling</b> oscillation, {{is known as the}} intra-Bølling cold period (ICBP), and the cold period, which occurred within the Allerød oscillation, is known as the intra-Allerød cold period (ICAP [...] ). Both cold periods are comparable in duration and intensity with the Older Dyras and began and ended quite abruptly. The cold periods have been recognized in sequence and relative magnitude in paleoclimatic records from Greenland ice cores, European lacustrine sediments, Atlantic Ocean sediments, and the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela.|$|R
