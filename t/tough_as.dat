5|$|In mid-1960s, {{he began}} to attend {{regional}} referee tryouts {{in the hopes of}} becoming an NBA referee; however, he was rejected for nine straight years due to his small physique and unimposing size. Bavetta was finally hired by the NBA in 1975 following the retirement of Mendy Rudolph. He debuted December 2, 1975 at Madison Square Garden in an NBA game between the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics. His first ten years in the league were <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> he was constantly ranked bottom among NBA referees in performance evaluations and led the league in technical fouls and ejections called.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Filmation began {{producing}} several new {{series for the}} Big Three television networks. They started creating live action series, instead of just animation ones, and also series that combined both. While {{a majority of the}} series was animated, live-action segments involving actual animals were also included to separate different scenes in an episode. According to Scheimer, filming with the animals was <b>tough,</b> <b>as</b> the bulldog who portrayed Tyrone would often chase the cats on set around and not stay still during filming.|$|E
5|$|He joined Swansea City for a £160,000 fee in January 1982 {{and added}} a Welsh Cup winners medal to his {{collection}} four months later. However the effects of Parkinson's disease began to reduce his effectiveness on the pitch, and he dropped into the Fourth Division with Hartlepool United in November 1983. During the 1984–85 season he spent a brief time as player-manager of Cyprus club Pezoporikos and later played for Northern League club Ashington. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in November 1984. His life after football was <b>tough,</b> <b>as</b> he {{had to deal with}} the effects of Parkinson's, the loss of his business, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage. He remained reliant on charity to fund his medical expenses, and was forced to sell his medal collection and caps in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E
25|$|Steel Magnolias is a 1989 American comedy-drama {{film about}} the bond {{among a group of}} women from Louisiana, who can be as {{beautiful}} as magnolias, but are as <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> steel.

25|$|Law 3: A tool {{must remain}} intact during its use unless its {{destruction}} {{is required for}} its use or for safety. For example, Dremel disks {{are designed to be}} as <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> possible without breaking unless the job requires it to be spent. Furthermore, they are designed to break at a point before the shrapnel velocity could seriously injure someone (other than the eyes, though safety glasses should be worn at all times anyway).|$|E

50|$|Moist heat cooking {{methods include}} braising, pot roasting, stewing and sous-vide.

25|$|English Shepherds {{are often}} larger than Border Collie, but {{the quickest way}} to tell the two apart is to put them on stock. Border Collies tend to herd with a {{distinctive}} strong eye contact and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style. English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from the meanest bull to baby chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or as <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> necessary with the stock.|$|E

In August Saidy competed at his first World Championships, still only 19 years old. The {{competition}} in the 2003 World Championships in Paris proved too <b>tough,</b> <b>as</b> Saidy once again failed to reach the second round. With 21.42 seconds, he finished sixth out of seven in a heat where eventual silver medalist Darvis Patton, among others, ran. Saidy did however have the fastest reaction time in his heat with 0.128 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Engineer Les Harris, who had {{conducted}} dingo {{research for}} over a decade, said that, contrary to Cameron's findings, a dingo's carnassial teeth can shear through material as <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> motor vehicle seat belts. He also cited {{an example of a}} captive female dingo removing a bundle of meat from its wrapping paper and leaving the paper intact. Evidence was also presented to the effect that a dingo was strong enough to carry a kangaroo and a report of the removal of a three-year-old girl by a dingo from {{the back seat of a}} tourist's motor vehicle at the camping area just weeks before, an event witnessed by the parents.|$|E

Brody—found the going <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> the Japanese positions were well-hidden, and they found themselves under heavy machine gun and automatic weapons fire. Tanks moved up {{to help with the}} assault, and the Marines advanced slowly as the tank fire eliminated the enemy emplacements. Late that afternoon, the advance was halted and a heavy artillery concentration, in preparation for a full-scale attack by the 1st Battalion, 21st Marine Regiment against the enemy defenses in front of the Marines. The artillery fire raged through the enemy positions and Companies B and C placed mortar fire almost on top of their own positions.|$|E
25|$|In 1862, he and Satyendranath Tagore {{were the}} first two Indians to sail to England to prepare for and appear in the Indian Civil Service examinations. The {{competition}} {{was one of the}} stiffest, if not the stiffest, in the world at that time, but more so because any plan to cross the seas and travel to Europe was bound to meet with the strongest opposition from the Indian society. Preparations for the examination was <b>tough,</b> <b>as</b> they had to pick up many subjects not taught in India. Moreover, Ghose was subject to racial discrimination. The examination schedules and syllabus were altered. He sat for the examinations twice but failed to succeed. Satyendranath Tagore went through and became the first Indian to join the ICS.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{was signed}} by Kerry Packer for World Series Cricket in 1977. As one of the {{brightest}} talents in Australia his signature was considered vital for the marketing and success of the brand. In the first year of WSC (1977/78) Davis played 3 Supertests scoring a best of 84 against the World XI. He would play 2 more Supertests in the 1978/79 season scoring just 48 runs (ave. 12). Davis found breaking into the WSC Australian XI just as <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> the official side his path being blocked by McCosker and Bruce Laird. The fact that Davis averaged roughly half as many runs in Supertests as he did in official tests highlights the high level of competition in WSC. It was during the second Supertest that Australian batsman David Hookes suffered a broken jaw from an Andy Roberts bouncer. Packer was said to encourage his bowlers to be aggressive. Traditional cricket followers became shocked by the posteuring and bad-language broadcast via pitch microphones. The highly charged atmosphere and Packer's preference for fast bowling led to many of the WSC stars, including Davis, to wear protective helmets. A piece of cricket equipment Davis would later help develop after retirement.|$|E

There are night missions, where the player goes under cover in a captured enemy tank.|$|R
50|$|Whilst in the Southern League Southern Division, Road-Sea silenced {{their critics}} as they pushed for {{promotion}} to the Premier Division and after finishing a highly creditable 3rd in their debut season behind champions Fisher Athletic and Folkestone, they won promotion as champions in 1983-84. Road-Sea continued {{to thrive in}} the highly competitive Premier Division as they then finished a marvellous 5th in 1984-85. The following season was much <b>tougher</b> <b>as</b> the club finished mid-table.|$|R
500|$|A major fault reviewers {{found with}} Wipeout 3 was the steep {{learning}} {{curve of the}} game. David Canter of The San Diego Union-Tribune described the difficulty progression as [...] "ludicrous", with the tournament game mode going from [...] "easy as pie to <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> nails". Though {{the use of the}} analogue stick was positively noted as helping to increase control over the onscreen craft, GamePro found that proper handling required large amounts of patience and practice.|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Super Meat Boys {{platforming}} elements, {{and often}} {{commented on the}} game's difficulty. X-Play reviewer Alexandra Hall said the game had [...] "riveting platforming action", and added that [...] "Super Meat Boys designers are masters of their craft." [...] Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar felt the platforming was [...] "perfect". He wrote that [...] "while it's always tough and demanding, it never feels cheap, or like the game is cheating you." [...] A reviewer from GameTrailers stated that [...] "the difficulty rides the perfect line between driving you utterly bonkers when you fail and making {{you feel like a}} platform pro when you succeed". Joystiq's Richard Mitchell echoed other reviewers' comments: [...] "Super Meat Boy is <b>tough,</b> <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> the toughest nails in the toughest universe." [...] Gilbert cited the level of difficulty, which he believed made the game inaccessible to some players, as his reason for not awarding the game a perfect score. Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the game's [...] "precise control", [...] "excellent level design", and [...] "smooth difficulty curve". Reviewer Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer warned that Super Meat Boy is [...] "a hard game. It should make you want to throw the pad across the room".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reactions}} {{towards the}} introduction of Kate Freelander was also mixed. Mark Wilson stated [...] "the growling sass-mouth feels out of place. Darshi's performance is good, at least, so we'll {{just have to see}} if the writers are capable of integrating her into the cast." [...] John Sinnot meanwhile, started [...] "I always found [...] a bit irritating, so it was no big loss. [...] For some reason however, they've replaced her with another annoying young woman, Kate Freelander.

500|$|According to Time {{television}} critic James Poniewozik, {{by the end}} of {{the first}} episode, it becomes clear that Underwood both literally and figuratively uses meat as his metaphor of choice. He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because [...] "I'm feelin' hungry today!", and he depicts his life with meat metaphors. For example, he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: [...] "She’s as <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> a two-dollar steak" [...] and plans to destroy an enemy the way [...] "you devour a whale. One bite at a time". He also endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, as he tells the audience, by [...] " [...] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet." ...|$|E
50|$|Davenport walked {{straight}} into the Ayresome Park first team under manager Bruce Rioch but managed just four goals from 24 games in 1988-89 as Boro slipped back into the Football League Second Division just one season after promotion. 1989-90 was even <b>tougher</b> <b>as</b> Boro narrowly avoided a second successive relegation and Davenport managed a mere three goals from 35 league games, {{and by the end}} of the season Rioch had gone and Boro were now managed by Colin Todd.|$|R
