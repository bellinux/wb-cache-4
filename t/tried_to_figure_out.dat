25|$|In {{the ensuing}} altercation, one officer, Phillip Cardillo, {{was shot at}} close range with his own gun. Another officer's gun was missing, never to be recovered. Police {{reinforcements}} arrived, as did the news media, and word spread throughout the neighborhood {{that the police had}} committed some outrage in the mosque that they were trying to cover up. An angry and restless crowd had gathered as the police secured the inside of the mosque and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what had happened. Two men were arrested and the other worshippers were in custody. Seedman was planning to interrogate them when he showed up.|$|E
25|$|Another accused conspirator, Morton Sobell, fled to Mexico City, {{where he}} <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> {{a way to}} reach Europe without a passport. Abandoning that effort, he {{returned}} to Mexico City, from which {{he claimed to have}} been kidnapped by members of the Mexican secret police and driven to the U.S. border, where he was arrested by U.S. forces. The government claimed Sobell was arrested by the Mexican police for bank robbery on August 16, 1950, and extradited the next day to the United States in Laredo, Texas. He was charged and tried with the Rosenbergs on one count of conspiracy to commit espionage.|$|E
25|$|Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial {{candidate}} (and the late Congressman Flood's nephew), Harry F. Byrd supported creation of Shenandoah National Park, as did his friend William E. Carson, a businessman {{who had become}} Virginia's first chairman of the Commission on Conservation and Development. Development of the western national parks had assisted tourism, which produced jobs, which Byrd and local politicians supported. The land that became Shenandoah park was scenic, mountainous, and had also lost about half of its trees to the Chestnut blight (which was incurable and affected trees as they reached maturity). However, it had been held as private property for over a century, so many farms and orchards existed. After Byrd became governor and convinced the legislature to appropriate $1 million for land acquisition and other work, Carson and his teams (including surveyors and his brother Kit who was Byrd's law partner) <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> who owned the land. They found that it consisted of more than 5,000 parcels, some of them inhabited by tenant farmers or squatters (who were ineligible to receive compensation). Some landowners, including wealthy resort owner George Freeman Pollock and Luray realtor and developer L. Ferdinand Zerkel, had long wanted the park created and had formed the Northern Virginia Park Association {{to win over the}} national park selection committee. However, many local families who had lived in the area for generations (especially people over 60 years old) did not want to sell their land, and some refused to sell at any price. Carson promised that if they sold to the state, they could still live on their homesteads {{for the rest of their}} lives. Carson also lobbied the new President Herbert Hoover, who bought land to establish a vacation fishing camp near the headwaters of the Rapidan River (and would ultimately donate it to the park as he left office; it remains as Rapidan Camp).|$|E

500|$|Bleed Like Me is a {{departure}} from the heavily electronic music of previous albums Version 2.0 and Beautiful Garbage in favor of a basic alternative rock sound. Vig said that while the band <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> a new sound for the record, they [...] "went back to getting great sounds from guitars". The band tried a more spontaneous approach; Manson did most of her singing in the first take and the drums were recorded in a way [...] "that everything was not perfectly balancedand not so electronic". The band members tried to translate the energy of the band's live performances onto the album; Marker said that the album showed that above all, Garbage is [...] "a loud rock band". Vig still thought that some of the songs resembled the band's earlier material, such as [...] "Metal Heart", with [...] "a lot of weird electronics that Steve and Duke did, as well as some pretty gnarly guitar." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of Martha's storylines were {{central to}} her on-off {{relationship}} with Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien). Viewers saw the couple go through marriage, divorce, a second marriage and Martha being widowed. Holy Soap said that Martha and Jack {{proved to be}} one of the [...] "best loved couples", before they married for the first time. However, their marriage does not last long and they split. Martha and Jack start to lead separate lives, but Jack is there for Martha after she has an abortion. Martha is feeling low at this point and kisses him; Jack's girlfriend Sam Tolhurst (Jessica Chapnik) sees this. O'Brien stated: [...] "I think Jack felt like 'Oh this is nice, but I've moved on, I've finally moved on and found someone', but deep down he still wants Martha." [...] Martha is left [...] "shattered" [...] after Jack plans to marry Sam. Martha was caught trying on Sam's wedding dress as she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> if she still had feelings for Jack. Gordon said that from day one, Jack and Martha have wanted to be together, but [...] "they're never in the same headspace". O'Brien added that he believes Jack was always in love with Martha, even whilst he was in a relationship with Sam. Both O'Brien and Gordon agreed that when Jack and Martha first broke up it was a bad time for Jack, as his life was spiraling out of control, he needed her, but she left him when he needed her the most. They later become friends; O'Brien believed it was hard to understand how Jack could be so forgiving toward her.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> something Homer was really good at, and {{he came up with}} the idea of Homer being a good husband. While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E
