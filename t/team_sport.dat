40|$|This article {{explores the}} discursive {{behaviour}} of professional male <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> players in post-match interviews {{from a social}} identity construction perspective. Drawing on a data set of 160 televised post-match interviews from two different <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> and two {{different regions of the}} world, this article identifies stances players orient to when presenting themselves in these media interviews. A supplementary data set of ethnographic semi-structured interviews with professional <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> players is also used to develop insider perspectives on the discursive behaviour of professional <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> players when speaking to the media. What is argued is that the acts and stances employed by <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> players can be interpreted as indexing a media self, or media identity, one that professional <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> players construct in order to strategically negotiate a public version of self that presents them positively to their audience and maintains their relationships with other members of their team...|$|R

This paper proposes that the field of visualization has been applied within <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> in various ways to provide these participants with representations of these datasets. This has resulted in data-augmented games which are easier to play, judge and watch respectively. This paper provides a review of past and current applications of visualization within <b>team</b> <b>sports.</b> A model is presented to classify sports visualizations along conceptual axes. This model will allow future or potentially untapped applications of <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> visualization to be identified and classified. 1...|$|R

Sport marketing was studied from the perspective of three professional <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> organizations and three not-for-profit amateur <b>sports</b> organizations. Professional <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> were found to leverage from their high profile players, high profile brand, and the numbers in the audience to attract large monetary sponsors, whereas amateur <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> did not have the same exposure and profile as professional <b>team</b> <b>sports.</b> Amateur <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> leveraged off the numbers playing the game in order to attract sponsors.

5|$|Curling is a <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> that is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. A men's tournament {{was held}} at the 1924 Winter Olympics before the sport was removed from the {{official}} programme until the 1998 Games. For 82years, the 1924 tournament was considered a demonstration sport, so the medals were not officially counted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The tournament was won by a team from the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in Scotland, who represented Great Britain. In 2006, Scottish newspaper The Herald conducted an investigation that found evidence that curling {{had been part of the}} official programme. The IOC subsequently recognized the top three teams as full medal winners.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} joint effects of movie smoking {{exposure}} and <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> participation on established smoking. Design: Longitudinal study. Setting: School- and telephone-based surveys in New Hampshire and Vermont between September 1999 through November 1999 and February 2006 through February 2007. Participants: A total of 2048 youths aged 16 to 21 years at follow-up. Main Exposures: Baseline movie smoking exposure categorized in quartiles assessed when respondents were aged 9 to 14 years and <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> participation assessed when respondents were aged 16 to 21 years. Main Outcome Measure: Established smoking (having smoked ≥ 100 cigarettes in one's lifetime) at follow-up. Results: At follow-up, 353 respondents (17. 2 %) were established smokers. Exposure {{to the highest}} quartile of movie smoking compared with the lowest increased the likelihood of established smoking (odds ratio= 1. 63; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 03 - 2. 57), and <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> nonparticipants compared with participants were {{twice as likely to}} be established smokers (odds ratio= 2. 01; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 47 - 2. 74). The joint effects of movie smoking exposure and <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> participation revealed that at each quartile of movie smoking exposure, the odds of established smoking were greater for <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> nonparticipants than for participants. We saw a dose-response relationship of movie smoking exposure for established smoking only among <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> participants. Conclusions: <b>Team</b> <b>sports</b> participation clearly plays a protective role against established smoking, {{even in the face of}} exposure to movie smoking. However, movie smoking exposure increases the risk of established smoking among both <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> participants and nonparticipants. Parents, teachers, coaches, and clinicians should be aware that encouraging <b>team</b> <b>sports</b> participation in tandem with minimizing early exposure to movie smoking may offer the greatest likelihood of preventing youth smoking. © 2009 American Medical Association.
