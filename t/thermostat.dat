5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps. In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a <b>thermostat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bush left Tufts in 1919, {{although}} he remained employed by AMRAD, {{and joined the}} Department of Electrical Engineering at MIT, where he worked under Dugald C. Jackson. In 1922, he collaborated with fellow MIT professor William H. Timbie on Principles of Electrical Engineering, an introductory textbook. AMRAD's lucrative contracts from World War I had been cancelled, and Bush attempted to reverse the company's fortunes by developing a thermostatic switch invented by Al Spencer, an AMRAD technician, on his own time. AMRAD's management {{was not interested in}} the device, but had no objection to its sale. Bush found backing from Laurence K. Marshall and Richard S. Aldrich to create the Spencer <b>Thermostat</b> Company, which hired Bush as a consultant. The new company soon had revenues in excess of a million dollars. It merged with General Plate Company to form Metals & Controls Corporation in 1931, and with Texas Instruments in 1959. Texas Instruments sold it to Bain Capital in 2006, and it became a separate company again as Sensata Technologies in 2010.|$|E
40|$|This report {{investigates the}} history of <b>thermostats</b> to better {{understand}} the context and legacy regarding the development of this important tool, as well as thermostats' relationships to heating, cooling, and other environmental controls. We analyze the architecture, interfaces, and modes of interaction used by different types of <b>thermostats.</b> For over sixty years, home <b>thermostats</b> have translated occupants' temperature preferences into heating and cooling system operations. In this position of an intermediary, the millions of residential <b>thermostats</b> control almost half of household energy use, which corresponds to about 10 percent of the nation's total energy use. <b>Thermostats</b> are currently undergoing rapid development in response to emerging technologies, new consumer and utility demands, and declining manufacturing costs. Energy-efficient homes require more careful balancing of comfort, energy consumption, and health. At the same time, new capabilities will be added to <b>thermostats,</b> including scheduling, control of humidity and ventilation, responsiveness to dynamic electricity prices, and the ability to join communication networks inside homes. Recent studies have found that as many as 50 percent of residential programmable <b>thermostats</b> are in permanent "hold" status. Other evaluations found that homes with programmable <b>thermostats</b> consumed more energy than those relying on manual <b>thermostats.</b> Occupants find <b>thermostats</b> cryptic and baffling to operate because manufacturers often rely on obscure, and sometimes even contradictory, terms, symbols, procedures, and icons. It appears that many people are unable to fully exploit even the basic features in today's programmable <b>thermostats,</b> such as setting heating and cooling schedules. It is important that people can easily, reliably, and confidently operate <b>thermostats</b> in their homes so as to remain comfortable while minimizing energy use...|$|R
5000|$|As with clock <b>thermostats,</b> basic digital <b>thermostats</b> {{may have}} just one cycle that is run {{every day of the}} week. More-sophisticated <b>thermostats</b> may have a weekday {{schedule}} and a separate weekend schedule (so-called [...] "5-2" [...] setting) or separate Saturday and Sunday schedules (so-called [...] "5-1-1" [...] settings), while other <b>thermostats</b> will offer a separate schedule for each day of the week ("7 day" [...] settings). The selection of which days are defined as the [...] "weekend" [...] is arbitrary, depending on the user's heating and cooling schedule requirements. Often, a manufacturer will sell three similar <b>thermostats</b> offering each of those levels of functionality, and there is no obvious difference in the <b>thermostats</b> other than the factory programming and the price.|$|R

25|$|A {{variety of}} <b>thermostat</b> {{algorithms}} {{are available to}} add and remove energy from the boundaries of a MD simulation in {{a more or less}} realistic way, approximating the canonical ensemble. Popular methods to control temperature include velocity rescaling, the Nosé-Hoover <b>thermostat,</b> Nosé-Hoover chains, the Berendsen <b>thermostat,</b> the Andersen <b>thermostat</b> and Langevin dynamics.

25|$|On many {{automobile}} engines, {{including all}} Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the <b>thermostat</b> does not restrict {{flow to the}} heater core. The passenger side tank of the radiator {{is used as a}} bypass to the <b>thermostat,</b> flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the <b>thermostat</b> opens, and allows the heater to function before the <b>thermostat</b> opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the <b>thermostat</b> fails.|$|E
25|$|A <b>thermostat</b> is {{a device}} for {{regulating}} {{the temperature of}} a system so that the system's temperature is maintained near a desired setpoint temperature. The <b>thermostat</b> does this by switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as needed, to maintain the correct temperature. The <b>thermostat</b> was invented in 1883 by Warren S. Johnson.|$|E

40|$|The master {{equation}} {{approach to}} Lyapunov spectra for many-particle systems {{is applied to}} non-equilibrium <b>thermostatted</b> systems to discuss the conjugate pairing rule. We consider iso-kinetic <b>thermostatted</b> systems with a shear flow sustained by an external restriction, in which particle interactions are expressed as a Gaussian white randomness. Positive Lyapunov exponents are calculated by using the Fokker-Planck equation to describe the tangent vector dynamics. We introduce another Fokker-Planck equation to describe the time-reversed tangent vector dynamics, which allows us to calculate the negative Lyapunov exponents. Using the Lyapunov exponents provided by these two Fokker-Planck equations we show the conjugate pairing rule is satisfied for <b>thermostatted</b> systems with a shear flow in the thermodynamic limit. We also give an explicit form to connect the Lyapunov exponents with the time-correlation of the interaction matrix in a <b>thermostatted</b> system with a color field. Comment: 10 page...|$|R
