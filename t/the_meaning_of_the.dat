5|$|Unlike a teacher-student relationship, {{in which}} the student memorizes and repeats the {{material}} back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each student {{in the position of}} analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text.|$|E
40|$|People can {{communicate}} by using hand actions, e. g., signs. Understanding communicative actions {{requires that the}} observer knows that the actor has an intention to communicate and <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actions. Here, we investigated how this prior knowledge affects processing of observed actions. We used functional MRI to determine changes in action processing when non-signers {{were told that the}} observed actions are communicative (i. e., signs) and learned <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actions. Processing <b>of</b> hand actions activated the left and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, BA 44 and 45) when <b>the</b> communicative intention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actor was known, even when <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actions remained unknown. These regions were not active when the observers did not know about <b>the</b> communicative nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand actions. These findings suggest that the left and right IFG play a role in understanding <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actor, but do not process visuospatial features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communicative actions. Knowing <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand actions further enhanced activity in <b>the</b> anterior part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IFG (BA 45), the inferior parietal lobule and posterior inferior and middle temporal gyri in the left hemisphere. These left-hemisphere language regions could provide a link between meanings and observed actions. In sum, the findings provide evidence for <b>the</b> segregation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> networks involved in <b>the</b> neural processing <b>of</b> visuospatial features of communicative hand actions and those involved in understanding the actor’s intention and <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actions...|$|R
2500|$|Cases like [...] "battery" [...] and [...] "coffee" [...] also {{demonstrate}} the often great difference between <b>the</b> literal <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual morphemes in a word, and <b>the</b> overall <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire word.|$|R
25|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{should not}} be confused with Chinese words, as <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> modern Chinese words, unlike their Old Chinese and Middle Chinese counterparts, are written with two or more characters, each character representing one syllable and/or morpheme.

5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|Actress Shweta Bhardwaj was {{therefore}} selected {{to perform the}} item number instead.

Bhardwaj was afraid of dancing, suspecting a possible sprain, and found the costumes uneasy, but had to continue upon the choreographer's insistence. Canadian-born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal's friend in the film.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution.

40|$|Examining <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{experiences}} <b>of</b> advanced practice nurses (APNs) {{who chose}} to work with older adults and why they {{continue to work with}} this population was <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> this hermeneutic qualitative research study. Twelve geriatric APNs currently practicing in two South Central states were interviewed using an open-ended interview guide. Using Gadamerian hermeneutics, the researchers identified Gerontology Found Me as the significant expression that reflected <b>the</b> fundamental <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experience as a whole. Four themes emerged that further described <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants’ personal, educational, and professional experiences: Becoming a Gerontology Nurse, Being a Gerontology Nurse, Belonging to Gerontology, and Bringing Others to Gerontology. This study concluded that APNs’ personal and professional experiences were more influential than educational experiences to become geriatric nurses, and having these personal and professional experiences of being in relationship with older individuals further contributed to their choice of gerontology...|$|R
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts Re:coded {{was also}} {{included}} in the collection, featuring the Nintendo DS game adapted into a cinematic retelling, similar to how Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days was included in Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix.

5|$|One of {{the major}} points that Asch makes is that {{participants}} are not completely blind in the experiment and making arbitrary choices based on this bias.
