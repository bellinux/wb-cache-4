40|$|Supersonic {{combustion}} ramjets, or scramjets, {{have the}} potential to facilitate more ef-ficient <b>transatmospheric</b> <b>flight</b> and airplane-like operations of launch vehicles. A scramjet is an airbreathing engine which uses the compression of air over the forebody and in-let to achieve the conditions necessary for supersonic combustion, using no mechanical compressor. The highly complex flow experienced by three-dimensional hypersonic inlets, demanding performance requirements, and engine design strongly coupled to the vehicle create a need for simulation-based design. Therefore, efficient high-fidelity computation of gradients is desired. In this paper, the derivation, verification, and application of an adjoint formulation for an objective relevant to thrust (mÌ‡) will be presented. The design problem addressed is the optimization of a simple hypersonic inlet geometry, however this method is applicable to other engineering problems...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} that provides advance information about unpredictable atmospheric density dispersions {{that must be}} accommodated during random operations of aeroassisted-orbital-transfer vehicles (AOTVs). The principal feature is that a test or 'scout' projectile precedes the AOTV through the same region of the atmosphere {{as that of the}} predicted <b>transatmospheric</b> <b>flight</b> trajectory. The atmospheric density structure is determined from the vehicle's aerodynamic deceleration characteristics by on-board or ground-based tracking equipment. The time lag between passage of the projectile and the AOTV can be adjusted to only that time necessary to implement required guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) corrections. The various strategies available to control the projectile's flight characteristics are analyzed in detail. The results are correlated with aerothermodynamic heating and materials requirements to ensure the survival of the projectile and, consequently, the capability of the AOTV to navigate a variable upper atmosphere within specified limits...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the full}} {{pressure}} suits {{currently in the}} USAF operational inventory provide acceptable performance and crew protection for these missions, there is considerable room for improvement, especially {{in the areas of}} comfort, mobility, glove and helmet performance, and maintenance/supportability. As future aircraft push the envelope towards operations at higher and higher altitudes and <b>transatmospheric</b> <b>flight,</b> advances in full pressure suit technology will be needed. Also, enhanced pressure suit technology will be required to meet NASA's need for protection during future EVA operations for both on-orbit and planetary surface missions. This presentation will review the results of efforts at the Armstrong Laboratory to develop and demonstrate advanced full pressure suit technology for use in future high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and transatmospheric vehicle operations. For those readers who may not be familiar with this area of life support equipment, a brief review of the important physiological and operational requirements for full pressure suits used in these applications will be addressed first, followed by a summary of the current state-of-the-art in USAF pressure suit technology. Ongoing and recently completed work on enhanced mobility pressure suit joints and improved pressure suit gloves will then be reviewed. The presentation will conclude with discussion of the technical challenges for successful development of an advanced full pressure suit for aerospace operations in the 21 st century...|$|E
40|$|Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute {{has been}} {{developing}} transatmospheric 'Lightcraft' technology aimed at creating an efficient, economically affordable, hypersonic mass transportation system. The system utilizes laser-energized airbreathing engines to accelerate minimum-volume passenger capsules. The system gains {{a high level of}} reliability by using remote 'centralized' space power sources, e. g., satellite solar power stations. The most critical portion of the Lightcraft's acceleration trajectory involves flight propulsion at hypersonic velocities within the Earth's atmosphere, using a 'Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic (MHD) Fanjet' mode. Of all the propulsion modes proposed for the Lightcraft's combined-cycle engine, the MHD-Fanjet mode has received the least critical inquiry, largely because of its complexity. During the 1991 - 1992 academic year, Rensselaer's ADP teams produced a detailed conceptual design for the MHD-Fanjet engine, including the specific details of its integration with the other three propulsive modes. To facilitate this process, students built a full-scale mockup of a 1 / 12 th section of this annular engine, complete with a working model of the shroud translation system. The class also made preliminary design calculations for the double-dipole, 'cuspfield' superconducting magnets that provide the external magnetic field needed by the MHD air accelerator, as well as for an onboard microwave power system to enhance the electrical conductivity of the air plasma working fluid. In addition, a large hypersonic model of the MHD accelerator was designed for future tests in RPI's Hypersonic Shock Tunnel in order to validate present analytical performance models. Another group continued design work on a full-sized prototype of a one-person 'Mercury Lightcraft' (a <b>transatmospheric</b> <b>flight</b> simulator), with major emphasis on the detailed design of the major structure, robotic landing gear, and exterior aeroshell...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to reflect on current focuses in certain areas of {{hypersonic}} flow research by examining recent works and their issues. Aspects of viscous interaction, flow instability, and nonequilibrium aerothermodynamics pertaining to theoretical interest are focused upon. The field is a diverse one, and many exciting works may have either escaped the writer's notice or been abandoned {{for the sake of}} space. Students of hypersonic viscous flow must face the transition problems towards the two opposite ends of the Reynolds or Knudsen number range, which represents two regimes where unresolved fluid/gas dynamic problems abound. Central to the hypersonic flow studies is high-temperature physical gas dynamics; here, a number of issues on modelling the intermolecular potentials and inelastic collisions remain the obstacles to quantitative predictions. Research in combustion and scramjet propulsion will certainly be benefitted by advances in turbulent mixing and new computational fluid dynamics (CFD) strategies on multi-scaled complex reactions. Even for the sake of theoretical development, the lack of pertinent experimental data in the right energy and density ranges is believed to be among the major obstacles to progress in aerothermodynamic research for hypersonic flight. To enable laboratory simulation of nonequilibrium effects anticipated for <b>transatmospheric</b> <b>flight,</b> facilities capable of generating high enthalpy flow at density levels higher than in existing laboratories are needed (Hornung 1988). A new free-piston shock tunnel capable of realizing a test-section stagnation temperature of 10 (exp 5) at Reynolds number 50 x 10 (exp 6) /cm is being completed and preliminary tests has begun (H. Hornung et al. 1992). Another laboratory study worthy of note as well as theoretical support is the nonequilibrium flow experiment of iodine vapor which has low activation energies for vibrational excitation and dissociation, and can be studied in a laboratory with modest resources (Pham-Van-Diep et al. 1992) ...|$|E
40|$|Propulsion, while {{conventionally}} {{included on}} the list of important aeronautical disciplines along with aerodynamics, structures, etc., is in itself a systems endeavor, analogous to the engineering of the entire vehicle; indeed propulsion encompasses important aspects of all the other disciplines. In recognition of this fact, the panel focused its discussion on those aspects of the key disciplines that are especially or uniquely important to propulsion. From the initial development of the airplane, the propulsion system has been {{recognized as one of the}} pacing technologies. It is perhaps because of the technological disparity between the reciprocating engine and the primitive airframe that the two remained relatively and separate, were developed somewhat independently, usually by different organizations. In recent years, the maturing of the gas turbine power plant and the advance in high-speed airframes have rendered this separation somewhat artificial. The power plant and the airframe now share common structural and aerodynamic elements; as the flight Mach number rises, the degree of interaction increases. By the year 2000, this interdependence will have increased in many respects to a point where independent design may not be practical or possible. During the period since the initiation of the aircraft gas turbine, the solid propellant rocket and the liquid propellant rocket, a vast array of other novel engines have been studied, covering the full spectrum of flight conditions from low subsonic to hypersonic and <b>transatmospheric</b> <b>flight.</b> In each instance, performance limits have been investigated under the assumption that current technology or reasonably foreseeable technology would be available for their development. Among the extensive list of advanced, high-performance concepts and cycles examined are the hypersonic ramjet, the variable cycle, runway-to-orbit airbreathing engine, the ram rocket (airbreathing and rich solid propellant rocket), and the air turborocket. At various times, these systems have come relatively close to meriting development and application. In many instances, limitations of materials and technologies curtailed development. As important and with almost equal frequency, the lack of commercial or military utility of the concept precluded the necessary funding. It is instructive to note that two former items on this list, the turbofan (bypass engine) and the high-speed turboprop, are respectively a mainstay engine and a promising development. In the case of the turbofan, its full potential could not be realized until turbine cooling technology had been developed and new materials developed to permit the construction of transonic fans. In the case of the highspeed turbopropeller engine, not only were the material and turbine technologies needed, but, in addition, the rise in fuel costs provided the impetus to take advantage of its favorable fuel consumption characteristic. As the basic technologies progress and as new missions become attractive, the engines in the foregoing list become candidates for new feasibility studies and further technology development. At the present time, the ram rocket is the prime contender to augment the range of small missiles. Of interest also is the hypersonic ram jet and its logical extension, the runway-to-orbit airbreathing engine. Much of this report deals with the development of current or near-future power plant concepts. First, the motivating factors for aeronautical propulsion research are reviewed as a reminder of the importance of continued effort in a field that has often been characterized as mature. Next, technical areas are discussed in which the panel feels additional research effort is warranted and would lead to the realization of the technological potentials between now and the year 2000. Under these guidelines, new cycles (e. g., isothermal energy exchange) were not considered by the panel. Finally, although facility requirements were not a prime consideration in the current projections, the panel believes that the increasing complexity of propulsion systems; the need for more refined interaction between propulsion system, airframe, and controls; and increasing operation in adverse weather will require test capabilities beyond those now available (see appendix). Enhanced test capability is needed in the areas of propulsion airframe integration and in largescale icing research with proper concurrent treatment of altitude, temperature, and speed...|$|E
