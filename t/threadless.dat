25|$|American Apparel {{began by}} selling {{high-quality}} T-shirts to screen-printers and boutiques in 1990 under the American HEAVY label. Although {{it has made}} its transition into a primarily retail brand, the company {{is still one of}} the largest wholesalers in the country. American Apparel shirts are used as band merchandise and concert T-shirts for the bands, among many others, Hanson, Van Halen, Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie, Foursquare, Vampire Weekend, Metric, and Flogging Molly as well as websites like <b>Threadless,</b> Busted Tees. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the animal rights advocacy group, prints its merchandise on American Apparel clothes because they are made domestically and animal-free.|$|E
25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a <b>threadless</b> collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E

50|$|Co-founders Jake Nickell and Jacob DeHart started <b>Threadless</b> in 2000 with $1,000. <b>Threadless</b> {{began as}} a t-shirt design {{competition}} on the now defunct dreamless.org, a forum where users experimented with computers, code, and art. Nickell and DeHart invited users to post their designs on a dreamless thread (hence the name <b>Threadless),</b> and they would print the best designs on t-shirts.|$|E
50|$|Quill systems predate <b>threadless</b> systems. With {{the advent}} of <b>threadless</b> stems, {{manufacturers}} {{no longer need to}} provide a range of threaded forks for a given model; all <b>threadless</b> system forks are made with the same length steerer tube (long). The steerer tubes are then cut to length to fit upon installation. Unthreaded forks often require less labor to swap than threaded forks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Threadless</b> stems, {{the newer}} {{of the two}} styles, are widely popular and have {{displaced}} quill stems as the industry standard on sport bikes. <b>Threadless</b> stems feature a modular design where the stem clamps around {{the outside of the}} top of the fork steerer tube that protrudes above the headset. <b>Threadless</b> stems are commonly available in lengths up to about 130 millimeters (5 inches).|$|E

50|$|Most <b>Threadless</b> t-shirts {{are printed}} with the screen {{printing}} technique. Plastisol or water based inks {{are applied to}} the shirt through mesh screens which limits the areas where ink is deposited. <b>Threadless</b> printing techniques include gradients and simulated process, UV color change, oversized printing, puff, belt printing, vinyl, super glow, flock, embroidery, suede, metallic, blister, foil, and high density.|$|E
50|$|Somewhat counterintuitively, {{the term}} <b>threadless</b> derives not from whether the stem itself is {{threaded}}, but from whether a headset lock nut threads onto the fork steer tube. Quill stems require a threaded headset of specific length for each bicycle model. <b>Threadless</b> stems require an unthreaded steerer tube, which may vary in length for each bicycle model.|$|E
