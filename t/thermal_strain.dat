This environmental chamber study compared physiological responses of volunteers exercising in MOPP 0, MOPP 1, and MOPP 4 with equivalent SIPE configurations, including SIPE 4 with and without ambient air microclimate cooling (MCC). Responses to all uniforms were compared over 100 minutes of continuous treadmill walking at 30.0 deg C, 50% rh. Responses to MOPP 4 and SIPE 4 with no cooling were also compared over 100 minutes at 18.5 deg C, 50% rh. Responses to MOPP 4 and SIPE 4 MCC were compared over four hours of intermittent work-rest cycles at 30.0 deg C, [...]50% rh. There were no differences between MOPP 0 and SIPE 0, MOPP 1 and SIPE 1, and MOPP 4 and SIPE 4 with no cooling (in both environments) [...] Core temperature, skin temperature, heat storage, and heart rate were lower in SIPE 4 MCC than in MOPP 4; while evaporative cooling was greater in SIPE 4 MCC than in MOPP 4. Three volunteers completed the 4-hour tests in SIPE 4 MCC with similar advantageous trends apparent from the cooling. It is concluded that the SIPE clothing did not increase <b>thermal</b> <b>strain</b> compared to equivalent MOPP levels, and MCC, (although increasing uniform weight by approximately 10 kg) reduced <b>thermal</b> <b>strain</b> at 30.0 deg Celsius.|$|E
50|$|Flux {{method is}} a method of crystal growth where the {{components}} of the desired substance are dissolved in a solvent (flux). The method is particularly suitable for crystals needing to be free from <b>thermal</b> <b>strain.</b> It takes place in a crucible made of highly stable, non-reactive material. For production of oxide crystals, metals such as platinum, tantalum, and niobium are common. Production of metallic crystals generally uses crucibles made from ceramics such as alumina, zirconia, and boron nitride. The crucibles and their contents are often isolated from the air for reaction, either by sealing them in a quartz ampoule or by using a furnace with atmosphere control. A saturated solution is prepared by keeping the constituents of the desired crystal and the flux at a temperature slightly above the saturation temperature long enough to form a complete solution. Then the crucible is cooled in order to allow the desired material to precipitate. Crystal formation can begin by spontaneous nucleation or may be encouraged by the use of a seed. As material precipitates out of the solution, the amount of solute in the flux decreases and the temperature at which the solution is saturated lowers. This process repeats itself as the furnace continues to cool until the solution reaches its melting point or the reaction is stopped artificially.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the magnetic state and the cluster-related disorder upon thermal treatment of the icosahedral i-Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystals were studied on single-crystalline samples subjected to different thermal annealing sequences involving short and long annealing times and slow or fast cooling modes. In this way, thermal equilibration of the samples was systematically changed by varying the amount of vacancies and <b>thermal</b> <b>strains.</b> The results show that different thermal treatments can reduce or increase reversibly the paramagnetic magnetization of the i-Al-Pd-Mn samples of nominally the same composition by a factor up to 26. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements have demonstrated comparable importance of the vacancies and <b>thermal</b> <b>strains</b> {{on the size of}} the mean effective magnetic moment per Mn atom. While the reduced vacancy concentration reduces the mean effective moment, <b>thermal</b> <b>strains</b> induced by rapid cooling increase it. Theoretical ab-initio calculations of the effect of vacancies and <b>thermal</b> <b>strains</b> on the magnetic properties of a periodic approximant model to the i-Al-Pd-Mn phase predict that vacancies at specific Al sites introduce magnetic moments at the Mn sites, which are otherwise nonmagnetic in the perfect structure. Removal of <b>thermal</b> <b>strains</b> by relaxation of the structure containing vacancies acts in the opposite way by decreasing the moments. X-ray diffraction experiments with full reciprocal space sampling revealed that the cluster-related disorder cannot be improved noticeably by annealing at either 800 degrees C or 600 degrees C even for annealing times as long as three months, suggesting that this disorder may be intrinsic to the i-Al-Pd-Mn phase, needed for the electronic or entropic stabilization of the structure.

The viscoplastic deformation in the mushy zone is addressed by a model in which the coherent mush is considered as a porous medium saturated with liquid. The thermal straining of the mush is accounted for by a recently developed model {{taking into account that}} there is no <b>thermal</b> <b>strain</b> in the mushy zone at low solid fractions because the dendrites then are free to move in the liquid, and that the <b>thermal</b> <b>strain</b> in the mushy zone tends toward the <b>thermal</b> <b>strain</b> in the fully solidified material when the solid fraction tends toward one. In the present work, the authors determined how variations in the parameters of the constitutive equation for <b>thermal</b> <b>strain</b> influence the hot tearing susceptibility calculated by the criterion. It turns out that varying the parameters in this equation has a significant effect on both liquid pressure drop and viscoplastic strain, which are key parameters in the hot tearing criterion.
