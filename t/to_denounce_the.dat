5|$|The march {{originally}} was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition {{of blacks in}} the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended <b>to</b> <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E

5|$|If {{this were}} the case, Helble {{concluded}} that the United States should tell Diệm that his regime must condemn {{the actions of the}} troops and punish the culprits. If Diệm refused, the United States should threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from Vũng Tàu in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. William Trueheart, {{who was in charge of}} the US Embassy, Saigon while Ambassador Frederick Nolting was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State Nguyễn Đình Thuận about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day. Thuận appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what blister gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those of mustard gas and passed on the US threat <b>to</b> <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> regime for the chemical attacks.|$|E

50|$|After showings of Yawar Mallku, Sanjinés {{learned that}} many peasants had {{criticism}} {{about the difficulty}} of his films due {{to the use of}} flashback for narration, as his film-making was greatly influenced by European art cinema, and about the lack of attention <b>to</b> <b>denouncing</b> <b>the</b> causes of the indigenous peoples' issues.

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1954, Scelba {{approved}} a package of measures against the Communist party and trade unions that was largely modelled on United States psychological warfare plans first elaborated in 1951–2.

Its half-hearted implementation exacerbated Washington's resentment toward its Italian allies and barely affected PCI's organizational structure.
