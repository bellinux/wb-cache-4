[...] Like all quarks, the top quark is an elementary fermion with spin , and experiences all four fundamental interactions: gravitation, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions. It has an electric charge of +e, It has a large mass of 172.44 ± 0.13 (stat) ± 0.47 (syst), which is about the same mass as an atom of tungsten. [...] The antiparticle of the top quark is the top antiquark (symbol: , sometimes called antitop quark or simply antitop), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|E

The idea was first described by Yoichiro Nambu and subsequently by Vladimir Miransky, Masaharu Tanabashi, and Koichi Yamawaki (Is the <b>t</b> <b>Quark</b> Responsible for the Mass of W and Z Bosons?) and developed into a predictive framework, based upon the renormalization group, by William A. Bardeen, Christopher T. Hill, and Manfred Lindner in the article Minimal Dynamical Symmetry Breaking of the Standard Model. Top quark condensation is essentially based upon the [...] "quasi-infrared fixed point" [...] for the top quark Higgs-Yukawa coupling, proposed in 1981 by Hill in the paper Quark and Lepton Masses from Renormalization Group Fixed Points. The simplest top condensation models predicted that the Higgs boson mass would be larger than the 175 GeV top quark mass, and have now been ruled out by the LHC discovery of the Higgs boson at a mass scale of 125 GeV.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{a search}} for pair {{produced}} vector-like <b>T</b> <b>quarks</b> in pp collision data from the LHC at √(s) = 13 Te- 0. 06667 emV is presented. The data were collected with the CMS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 2. 6 fb^- 1. Vector-like quarks are hypothetical new particles predicted by many extensions of the Standard Model in which the Higgs boson is a composite state of an unknown strong interaction. Vector-like <b>T</b> <b>quarks</b> are assumed to decay via three different decay modes to either bW, tZ or tH, with branching fractions that are not fixed and can {{vary depending on the}} particular model featuring vector-like quarks. This search focuses on decays of the T T system in which at least one muon or electron is present in the final state, and in which {{at least one of the}} <b>T</b> <b>quarks</b> decays to a top quark and a Higgs boson. As the <b>T</b> <b>quarks</b> are expected to be quite heavy, their decay products are significantly Lorentz-boosted in the reference frame of the T T system. The subsequent decay products of the Higgs boson are then emitted with a very small angle between them. This search is optimised for the main decay channel of the Higgs boson to two bottom quarks and attempts to reconstruct the two b quarks within a single jet with a large cone size. Dedicated jet substructure techniques, in combination with algorithms to identify jets originating from the fragmentation of a b quark, are then used to reconstruct the entire H → b b decay. The event categories of this search are also combined with the categories of {{a search for}} pair-produced <b>T</b> <b>quarks</b> that focuses on the T → bW decay. This approach provides a high sensitivity to T T production for many different combinations of branching fractions to the three possible decay modes.
