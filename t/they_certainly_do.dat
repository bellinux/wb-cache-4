Lange also expressed support for a New Zealand republic, stating: [...] "Do such things matter? <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do.</b> We suffer in this country {{from a lack of}} emotional focus... New Zealand will become a republic just as Britain will be blurred into Europe".|$|E
2500|$|The {{group has}} {{attracted}} widespread criticism internationally for its extremism, from governments and international bodies {{such as the}} United Nations and Amnesty International. On 24 September 2014, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon stated: [...] "As Muslim leaders {{around the world have}} said, groups like ISIL – or Da’ish – {{have nothing to do with}} Islam, and <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not represent a state. They should more fittingly be called the 'Un-Islamic Non-State'." [...] ISIL has been classified a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, the European Union and its member states, the United States, Russia, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and many other countries (see [...] ). Over 60 countries are directly or indirectly waging war against ISIL (see [...] ). The group was described as a cult in a Huffington Post column by notable cult authority Steven Hassan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characters}} of VII received near-unanimous praise from critics for their original appearance. In {{an article on}} GameSpot, it was stated that, despite the premise not being unique, it was [...] "Cloud's interactions with other characters, especially between him and [...] which make the story so special". Thierry Nguyen of Computer Gaming World found that both the story and character development were strong, saying that as the players progressed through the game, [...] "these characters intrigue you, and you get so attached to them that you might jump {{as a reaction to}} a shocking event on the first disc. Final Fantasy VII evokes that kind of emotional response." [...] Steve Bauman of Computer Games Magazine called the characters [...] "funky", saying that the characters [...] "worked wonders" [...] on some of the poorer dialogue. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer praised the characters' [...] "clear motivations, desires and flaws". RPGFan generally praised the characters, especially Cloud, Tifa and Sephiroth, and said that [...] "while on the surface <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> appear to fit certain stereotypes, a second look will reveal that they transcend these qualities and are compelling and complex personalities underneath." ...|$|E

60|$|Peter looked, {{and sure}} enough there was a pollywog {{with a pair of}} legs {{sprouting}} out. They were his fore legs, and <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> make him look funny. And only a few days before there hadn't been a sign of legs.|$|R
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> their best, {{for they}} began on Monday, and each morning through the week {{went to the}} mighty task with daily {{increasing}} courage and skill. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> needed the former, for even good-natured Nancy got tired of having [...] "the young ladies messing round so much," [...] and looked cross as the girls appeared in the kitchen.|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he said. [...] "There is the Princess and Cecil, and Major Forrest and Miss Le Mesurier. No one else. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> look {{as though}} they were going to land here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] replied Philemon, still smiling, [...] "perhaps they are. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> {{look as if}} {{they had}} seen better days; and I am heartily glad to see them making so {{comfortable}} a supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> seem to {{have the}} whip-hand; it would be {{difficult}} to imagine a more impregnable position. [...] "The vested rights described in the text are so fully recognized in practice that they are frequently the subject of sale or mortgage." ...|$|E
60|$|A wish of Grace's aided my application, and Emily {{placed the}} {{ornaments}} around her throat.

6000|$|Sir James {{looked at}} him keenly. [...] "You had worked that out, had you? Not bad--not at all bad.

6000|$|In fact, Knox himself merely {{says that}} he had [...] "reasoned with" [...] pastors and the learned; he does not say that they agreed with him, and <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not. Despite the reserve of Bullinger and of Calvin, Knox was of his new {{opinions}} still. These divines never backed his views.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "those quagmires {{and forests}} up yonder appeal to you. It's a little {{difficult}} for any reasonable person to see why they should, but <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do.</b> So does the sea. The love of it's in both of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's his line? Ouch! Jiminy, {{these shoes}} pinch my feet. I used to could dance all night, but I'm getting fat, I guess, ha! ha! Put on seven pounds last month. Ouch! Gee, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> pinch my toes. What {{business}} {{you say your}} father's in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh!" [...] exclaimed Jenny Wren. [...] "Distance doesn't bother Hummer any. You needn't {{worry about}} those wings of his. He goes clear down to South America. He has ever so many {{relatives}} down there. You {{ought to see}} his babies when they first hatch out. They are no bigger than bees. But <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> grow fast. Why, they are flying three weeks {{from the time they}} hatch. I'm glad I don't have to pump food down the throats of my youngsters the way Mrs. Hummingbird has to down hers." ...|$|E
60|$|About {{that time}} {{an officer of}} the Berkshire Regiment {{represented}} the condition of his men as requiring attention. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> require it, for they had been without food since four o'clock that morning, and were consequently in urgent need of provender as well as rest and water--the last having been all consumed.|$|R
60|$|And, by Jove, <b>they</b> <b>did!</b> <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did,</b> by George!

6000|$|... "Don't worry," [...] replied Jenny Wren. [...] "They won't stay long. I don't {{know anybody}} equal {{to them for}} roaming about. Here are most of us with {{families}} on our hands and Mr. and Mrs. Bluebird with a second family and Mr. and Mrs. Robin with {{a second set of}} eggs, while those gadabouts up there haven't even begun to think about housekeeping yet. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> like those cherries, but I guess Farmer Brown can stand the loss of what they eat. He may have fewer cherries, but he'll have more apples because of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut! You can ask more silly {{questions}} than anybody of my acquaintance," [...] retorted Jenny Wren. [...] "Of course they don't live on buds and blossoms. If they did {{they would soon}} starve to death, for buds and blossoms don't last long. They eat a few just for variety, but they live mostly on bugs and insects. You ask Farmer Brown's boy who helps him most in his potato patch, and he'll tell you it's the Grosbeaks. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> love potato bugs. They eat some fruit, {{but on the whole}} they are about as useful around a garden as any one I know. Now run along, Peter Rabbit, and don't bother me any more." ...|$|E
60|$|The Kruboys in {{the north}} and the Kabinda boys in the south have been {{described}} as the Irishmen of West Africa: <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> the most work; and trading-ships would find it almost impossible to trade without them. During the last twenty years they have not improved in efficiency even on board men-of-war. In 1861-65 the gangs with their headmen willingly engaged for three years. Now they enlist only for a year; they carefully keep tallies, and after the tenth monthly cut they begin to apply for leave. Thus the men's services are lost just as they are becoming valuable. It is the same with the Accra-men. When the mines learn the simple lesson l'union fait la force they will combine not to engage Krumen for less than two years.|$|E
40|$|Ours is an oral tradition. My {{people told}} {{stories about the}} raids and slaves–they sang about slavery. But they did not write books or {{newspaper}} stories about their suffering.

The original of that document, with the date and their names, will be forthcoming soon enough." ...|$|R
5000|$|One author said {{of these}} works, [...] "Meštrović's finest monumental sculptures are his Chicago Indians (1926-27), {{they are not}} too {{obviously}} stylized: the muscles on the horsemen are almost anatomically realistic... These statues show how much more important true sculptural feeling is than ideology, for Meštrović hardly knew anything about {{the ideals of the}} American Indians and <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not move him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Section 20. Finally, we note two {{series of}} buds of cells, one {{on either side}} of the archenteron in Figure 7 ii. In 8 these buds have become hollow vesicles, growing out from it, the coelomic pouches. They are further {{developed}} in 9; and in 9 ii., which is a diagrammatic figure, they are indicated by dotted lines. They finally appear to (? entirely) obliterate the segmentation cavity-- <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> so throughout the body; and their cavities are in time cut off from the mesenteron, by the gradual constriction of their openings. In this way the coelom (body cavity) arises as a series of hollow [...] "archenteric" [...] outgrowths, and ms. becomes the alimentary canal. mt.c., the metapleural canals, probably arise subsequently to, and independently of, the general coelomic space, by a splitting in the body-wall substance.|$|E
60|$|But {{the absence}} of the {{numerous}} peculiar groups of African birds is so exactly parallel to the same phenomenon among mammals, that we are justified in imputing it to the same cause, the more especially as some of the very groups that are wanting--the plantain-eaters and the trogons, for example,--are actually known to have inhabited Europe along with the large mammalia which subsequently migrated to Africa. As to the peculiarly Eastern genera--such as Copsychus and Hypsipetes, with a Dicrurus, a Ploceus, a Cisticola, and a Scops, all closely allied to Indian or Malayan species--although very striking to the ornithologist, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not outweigh the fourteen African genera found in Madagascar. Their presence may, moreover, be accounted for more satisfactorily than by means of an ancient Lemurian continent, which, even if granted, would not explain the very facts adduced in its support.|$|E
60|$|But it was known, or {{at least}} supposed, that the Esquimaux were fierce and cruel savages, if not cannibals. Their very name implies {{something}} of the sort. It signifies eaters of raw flesh, and was bestowed on them by their enemies the Muskigons. They call themselves Innuit-men, or warriors; and although <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> eat raw flesh when necessity compels them--which it often does--they asserted that they never did so from choice. However, be this as it may, the remembrance of their misdeeds in the first expeditions was fresh {{in the minds of}} the men in the service of the fur-traders, and they evinced a decided unwillingness to venture into such a country and among such a people,--an unwillingness which was only at length overcome when Mrs Stanley and her little daughter heroically volunteered to share the dangers of the expedition in the manner already narrated.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> so, {{for more}} bear steaks were {{laid on the}} embers, and while one of the newcomers, {{stripping}} a cartridge, rubbed powder grains into the flesh another produced {{a few of the}} fern roots which in times of scarcity the Siwash Indians eat. When at last they had finished, one of the party, pushing back his fur cap, turned to me.|$|R
5000|$|Even if the Fourth Geneva Convention {{had applied}} at one point, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not apply once the Israel {{transferred}} governmental powers to the Palestinian Authority {{in accordance with}} the 1993 Oslo Accords, since Article 6 of the convention states that the Occupying Power would only be bound to its terms [...] "to the extent that such Power exercises the functions of government in such territory....".|$|R
50|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{of this part}} of Ireland in pre-Danish times were a pastoral people moving from place to place with their flocks or else given to hunting. They did not build towns, unless we admit as towns the settlements that sometimes sprang up in the neighbourhood of Monasteries. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not build seaports, and it was as a seaport that Waterford had its beginning.|$|R
