5|$|During this time, Alexander adopted some {{elements}} of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>that</b> Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it.

5|$|For {{the second}} time in Spain, in April 1616 Hasekura met again with the King, who {{declined}} to sign a trade agreement, on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese Embassy {{did not appear to be}} an official embassy from the ruler of Japan Tokugawa Ieyasu, who, on the contrary, had promulgated an edict in January 1614 ordering the expulsion of all missionaries from Japan, and started the persecution of the Christian faith in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in the cracks in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E
5|$|In Marbury, the Supreme Court {{held that}} Madison's failure {{to deliver the}} {{commission}} to Marbury was illegal, but did not grant Marbury a writ of mandamus on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the Court to issue such writs under its original jurisdiction. Stuart v. Lairdinvolving a civil judgment rendered by a circuit court constituted under the Midnight Judges Act and enforced by a circuit court constituted under the Judiciary Act of 1802challenged the constitutionality both of abolishing the circuit judgeships and of requiring the Supreme Court justices to ride circuit. In a brief opinion, the Court rejected both challenges.|$|E
5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong, the {{respondent}} challenged his conviction for corruption on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which extends {{the effect of}} the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens (but not non-citizens) occurring outside Singapore, discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12(1). The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act's object, which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it. The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations.|$|E
50|$|CEQA plaintiffs such as {{community}} {{and environmental groups}} often challenge projects with negative declarations, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> EIRs should have been carried out.

50|$|As psychoanalysts {{continued}} {{to explore the}} glossed of unconscious motives, Otto Fenichel distinguished different sorts of rationalization—both the justifying of irrational instinctive actions on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> they were reasonable or normatively validated, and the rationalizing of defensive structures, whose purpose is unknown on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> they have some quite different but somehow logical meaning.|$|R
50|$|This {{conviction}} was quashed in July 2004 by the Court of Criminal Appeal on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> had {{new evidence}} of bank accounts {{been available to}} the trial jury they might have had raised doubts therefore rendering the conviction unsafe.

5|$|It {{has been}} argued that this results in the {{different}} treatment of persons in like situations, and thus violates Article 12(1). Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object, the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed. However, the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest, and to advance its policies step by step. Despite this, resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness, if used indiscriminately, may result in the watering down of the equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12(1).|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} Czech {{government}} and the Sudeten Germans dragged on through mid-1938. They achieved little result; Sudeten leader Konrad Henlein was under private instructions from Hitler not to reach an agreement. On 3 August, Walter Runciman (by now Lord Runciman) travelled to Prague as a mediator sent by the British government. Over the next two weeks, Runciman met separately with Henlein, the Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš and other leaders, but made no progress. On 30 August Chamberlain met his Cabinet and Ambassador Henderson and secured their backing—with only First Lord of the Admiralty Duff Cooper dissenting against Chamberlain's policy to pressure Czechoslovakia into making concessions, on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> Britain was then {{in no position to}} back up any threat to go to war.|$|E
5|$|On Burton's first appeal, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} {{his convictions}} because venue and vicinage {{could not be}} proper in the Eastern District of Missouri on the sole ground that Burton's bank sent the check to St. Louis after he cashed it. Further, the Court cited the prejudicial refusal of jury instructions. After Burton was retried and convicted, the Court affirmed, inter alia, on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> the agreement between Burton and Rialto had occurred in St. Louis.|$|E

5|$|On October 11, 2007, Mauffray {{found that}} Bell had {{violated}} {{the terms of}} his probation for previous convictions. The judge sentenced Bell to 18 months in a juvenile facility on two counts of simple battery and two counts of criminal destruction of property, and Bell was taken into custody. According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and {{it had not been}} referred to during the Barker proceedings. The defense filed a motion to dismiss the Barker charges on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> retrying Bell would amount to double jeopardy. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.|$|E
5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> {{he or she}} has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar.

5|$|The {{integration}} process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, representing the Muslim League, strongly supported {{the right of}} the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the Government of Pakistan accused India of hypocrisy on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan—which India refused to recognise—and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as de jure Pakistani territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of untouchability {{has been declared}} an offence punishable by law under Article 17, and the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 has been enacted by the Parliament to further this objective. Article 18 prohibits the State from conferring any titles other than military or academic distinctions, and the citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign state. Thus, Indian aristocratic titles and title of nobility conferred by the British have been abolished. However, awards such as the Bharat Ratna have been held to be valid by the Supreme Court on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> they are merely decorations and cannot {{be used by the}} recipient as a title.|$|E
5|$|Early on 31 August, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion {{began moving}} towards KB Mission, with 'D' Company {{leading the way}} and {{struggling}} through muddy conditions along the track, which {{had been turned into}} a quagmire due to the heavy rain and equally heavy traffic. After passing through the 61st Infantry Battalion's position, at around 9:00am they began their counterattack along the north coast of Milne Bay. As the Australians went they were harassed by snipers and ambush parties. They also encountered several Japanese soldiers who tried to lure the Australians in close for attack by pretending to be dead. In response, some Australians systematically bayoneted and shot the bodies of Japanese soldiers. At noon, the 9th Infantry Battalion, a Militia unit from the 7th Infantry Brigade, dispatched two companies to occupy some of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> the 2/12th had regained around No. 3 Airstrip and the mission.|$|E
