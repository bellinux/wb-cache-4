5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition.

5|$|Derek da Cunha has {{proposed}} that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> large numbers favours the GRC system. According to the theory, {{the large number}} of voters from GRC wards generally, though not necessarily always, reflects the popular vote. This was evident at the 2006 elections, at which the PAP garnered an average of 67.04% of the votes in a contested GRC, while the average was 61.67% for a SMC ward. The national average for the 2006 elections was 66.6%. Similar trends can be seen from previous elections. In fact, the percentage difference in the PAP votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3% in 1991, and remained stable at around 5% in the 1997, 2001 and 2006 elections. This may be attributable to the enlargement of the size of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> large numbers.|$|E
