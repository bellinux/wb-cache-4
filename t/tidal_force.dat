5|$|Most of {{the comets}} seen {{close to the}} Sun seem to have reached their current {{positions}} through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to {{the gravity of the}} Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis directed toward the galactic centre and compress it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun. The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} between the celestial <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> and earthquakes has been a controversial problem, although its research history is very long. This paper analyzes {{the relation between the}} <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> and all the earthquakes of magnitudes no less than 7. 0 which occurred in the entire world from year 1900. 0 to 2000. 0 by calculating <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> and the run tests which yields the runs of earthquakes near the extreme and non-extreme values of the <b>tidal</b> <b>forces.</b> It is shown that the occurrence of an earthquake is relevant to the <b>tidal</b> <b>forces.</b> From the analysis of the relation between the ecliptic longitudes of the lunar ascending node and the seismic activities of the principal seismic belts and regions in the world, it is also shown that the lunar node tide is possibly one of the important astronomical contributing factors of the seismic activities there. The results enrich and support the relevant study of the relation between celestial <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> and earthquakes...|$|R
2500|$|The {{limiting}} {{distance to}} which a satellite can approach without breaking up depends on the rigidity of the satellite. [...] At one extreme, a completely rigid satellite will maintain its shape until <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> break it apart. [...] At the other extreme, a highly fluid satellite gradually deforms leading to increased <b>tidal</b> <b>forces,</b> causing the satellite to elongate, further compounding the <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> and causing it to break apart more readily.|$|R
50|$|Now imagine {{these four}} objects as {{connected}} {{parts of a}} larger object. A rigid body will resist distortion, and internal elastic forces develop as the body distorts to balance the <b>tidal</b> <b>forces,</b> so attaining mechanical equilibrium. If the <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> are too large, the body may yield and flow plastically before the <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> can be balanced, or fracture, producing either a filament or a vertical line of broken pieces.|$|R
5|$|The Oort cloud is a {{hypothetical}} spherical cloud {{of up to}} a trillion icy objects that {{is thought to be}} the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000AU (around 1light-year (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000AU (1.87ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> exerted by the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The moons {{discovered}} by Galileo—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are {{among the largest}} satellites in the Solar System. The orbits of three of them (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors {{at the same point}} in every orbit it makes. The <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} {{a relationship between}} variations in gravitational <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> and rainfall. A possible mode of interaction of the <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> on atmospheric processes is suggested {{to explain how the}} <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> which are small may induce detectable effects on atmospheric circulation, considering both synoptioscale and shortperiod processes in the atmosphere. The variability of gravitational <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> is compared with variations in precipitation as revealed by statistical studies. The interrelation between thermar and <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> is brought out to account for the anomalous distribution of maximum precipitation in the United States during the synodic month when classified according to seasons, geographical areas, and periods of high versus low solar activity.

25|$|Of {{the many}} forces {{discussed}} in this paragraph, <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> is still highly debated and defended as a possible principle driving force of plate tectonics. The other forces are only used in global geodynamic models not using plate tectonics concepts (therefore beyond the discussions treated in this section) or proposed as minor modulations within the overall plate tectonics model.|$|E
25|$|Maclaurin used Newton's {{theory to}} show that a smooth sphere covered by a {{sufficiently}} deep ocean under the <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> of a single deforming body is a prolate spheroid (essentially a three-dimensional oval) with major axis directed toward the deforming body. Maclaurin was the first to write about the Earth's rotational effects on motion. Euler realized that the tidal force's horizontal component (more than the vertical) drives the tide. In 1744 Jean le Rond d'Alembert studied tidal equations for the atmosphere which did not include rotation.|$|E
25|$|The solar {{gravitational}} {{force on the}} Earth is on average 179 times stronger than the lunar, but because the Sun is on average 389 times farther from the Earth, its field gradient is weaker. The solar <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> is 46% {{as large as the}} lunar. More precisely, the lunar tidal acceleration (along the Moon–Earth axis, at the Earth's surface) is about 1.1 × 10−7 g, while the solar tidal acceleration (along the Sun–Earth axis, at the Earth's surface) is about 0.52 × 10−7 g, where g is the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface. Venus has the largest effect of the other planets, at 0.000113 times the solar effect.|$|E

40|$|The {{manner in}} which {{interstellar}} clouds fragment into subcondensations capable of becoming stars is still unknown. A variety of mechanisms {{may be responsible for}} cloud fragmentation. The considered investigation is concerned with a mechanism which is based on <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> due to a companion cloud. A 3 D code is used to study the tidal effects of point sources of various masses located in the equatorial plane of an initially uniform density, uniformly rotating, isothermal gas cloud. It is found that <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> can be quite effective at inducing fragmentation in an initially uniform cloud, although the effects are most pronounced for low thermal energy clouds, perturbed by perhaps unreasonably large <b>tidal</b> <b>forces.</b> It is also seen that <b>tidal</b> <b>forces</b> may be much less efficient at preventing the collapse of a cloud than has previously been supposed...|$|R
500|$|When a {{globular}} cluster has a close {{encounter with a}} large mass, such as the core region of a galaxy, it undergoes a tidal interaction. The difference in the pull of gravity between {{the part of the}} cluster nearest the mass and the pull on the furthest part of the cluster results in a <b>tidal</b> <b>force.</b> A [...] "tidal shock" [...] occurs whenever the orbit of a cluster takes it through the plane of a galaxy.|$|E

500|$|Chiron, {{the name}} of the planet, is {{the name of}} the only non-barbaric centaur in Greek mythology and an {{important}} loregiver and teacher for humanity. The name also pays homage to James P. Hogan's 1982 space opera novel Voyage from Yesteryear, in which a human colony is artificially planted by an automatic probe on a planet later named by colonists as Chiron. In the game, Chiron has two moons, named after the centaurs Nessus and Pholus, with the combined <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> of Earth's Moon, and is the second planet out from Alpha Centauri A, the innermost planet being the Mercury-like planet named after the centaur Eurytion. Alpha Centauri B is also dubbed Hercules, a reference to him killing several centaurs in mythology, and the second star preventing the formation of larger planets. The arrival on Chiron is referred to as [...] "Planetfall", which is a term used in many science fiction novels, including Robert A. Heinlein's Future History series, and Infocom's celebrated comic interactive fiction adventure Planetfall. Vernor Vinge's concept of technological singularity is the origin of the Transcendence concept. The game's cutscenes use montages of live-action video, CGI, or both; most of the former is from the 1992 experimental documentary Baraka.|$|E

500|$|Most places {{experience}} {{two high}} tides each day, occurring at intervals of about 12 hours and 25 minutes, half {{the period that}} it takes for the Earth to make a complete revolution and return the Moon to its previous position relative to an observer. The Moon's mass is some 27 million times smaller than the Sun, but it is 400 times closer to the Earth. <b>Tidal</b> <b>force</b> or tide-raising force decreases rapidly with distance, so the moon has {{more than twice as}} great an effect on tides as the Sun. A bulge is formed in the ocean at the place where the Earth is closest to the Moon, because it is also where the effect of the Moon's gravity is stronger. On {{the opposite side of the}} Earth, the lunar force is at its weakest and this causes another bulge to form. These bulges rotate around the Earth as the moon does. The Sun's effect is less powerful but, when the Sun, Moon and Earth are all aligned at the full and new moons, the combined effect results in the high [...] "spring tides". In contrast, when the Sun is at 90° from the Moon as viewed from Earth, the combined gravitational effect on tides is correspondingly reduced, causing the lower [...] "neap tides".|$|E
2500|$|As {{the orbit}} has been assumed circular, the total {{gravitational}} force and orbital centrifugal force {{acting on the}} main body cancel. [...] That leaves two forces: the <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> and the rotational centrifugal force. The <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> depends on the position {{with respect to the}} center of mass, already considered in the rigid model. [...] For small bodies, the distance of the liquid particles {{from the center of the}} body is small in relation to the distance d to the main body. [...] Thus the <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> can be linearized, resulting in the same formula for FT as given above.|$|E
2500|$|Because the {{gravitational}} field {{created by the}} Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force {{on the side of}} the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to [...] "stretch" [...] the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the <b>tidal</b> <b>force,</b> particularly horizontally. [...] As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to [...] "catch up" [...] to the state it would eventually reach if the <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> were constant—the changing <b>tidal</b> <b>force</b> nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tidal</b> <b>forces</b> are {{dependent}} on the gradient of a gravitational field, rather than its strength, and so tidal effects are usually limited to the immediate surroundings of a galaxy.
