In the present paper, the emphasis is placed on the modelling of a structural response of the jointed concrete pavement as a system of interacting rectangular slabs <b>transferring</b> <b>wheel</b> loads into an elastic layered subgrade. The finite element plate analysis is combined with the assumption of a linear contact stress variation over triangular elements of the contact region division. The linking forces are introduced to model the load transfer across the joints. The unknown contact stress nodal intensities as well as unknown linking forces are determined in an iterative way to fulfil slab/foundation and slab/slab contact conditions. The temperature effects are also considered and space is reserved for modelling of inelastic and additional environmental effects. It is pointed out that pavement design should be based on full data of pavement stressing, in contradiction to procedures accounting only for the axle load induced stresses...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the failure of concrete around dowel bars in jointed rigid pavements, and the resulting effect on the pavement performance. In fact, under repetitive vehicle loading, concrete in contact with the dowel bar deteriorates, particularly at the joint face. The degradation of concrete around the dowel negatively affects the latter's performance in terms of <b>transferring</b> <b>wheel</b> loads through vertical shear action. In this context, a nonlinear 3 D Finite Element analysis was performed using the commercial FE code Abaqus (v- 6. 11). The FE model was validated with classical analytical solutions of shear and moment along the dowel. A concrete damaged plasticity model was used for the PCC slab to model the degradation of concrete matrix around the dowels under incremental loading. Results obtained show, among other things, that the degradation of concrete matrix around the dowel was found to initiate at the face of the joint and propagate towards the interior of the dowel. Also, results obtained confirmed the decrease in load transfer capability of the dowels as the PCC matrix deteriorates. The central dowels under the wheel load lost a significant portion of their load-transfer capacity as the PCC matrix around them deteriorated, while dowels farther away from the wheel load became more engaged in load transfer.

40|$|The {{prestressed}} concrete railway sleepers (or railroad ties), which are installed in railway track systems as the crosstie beam support, {{are designed to}} carry and <b>transfer</b> the <b>wheel</b> loads from the rails to the ground.

In many cases, it has been reported from the fields that concrete sleepers are lacking of support due to mud pumping or excessive but localised track settlement, so-called ‘voided sleepers’. This paper presents a numerical study to evaluate dynamic responses of the voided concrete sleepers to impact loading. A simplified finite element model of concrete sleepers was developed and validated against experimental data. The model has then been used to evaluate the effect of voids on the dynamic responses of concrete sleeper to a typical impact loading. The outcome of this study will help engineers to determine the life of assets and to investigate the failure mode of concrete sleepers and associated track components in actual ballasted tracks. It also gives better insight into the dynamic behaviour of voided concrete railway sleepers...|$|R

5000|$|This style limited-slip {{differential}} {{works by}} using a gerotor pump to hydraulically compress a clutch to transfer torque to the wheel that is rotating slower.

40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway tread braking is {{developed}} {{for use in}} routine calculations of wheel and brake block temperatures. Two-dimensional finite-element models of block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel through thermal contact resistances. The surface temperature variations around the wheel circumference as caused by frictional heating and intermediate cooling are accounted for in a mean sense, assuming high-speed sliding conditions. The thermal power generated at the block-wheel interface during braking is determined from train braking data. A model for heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is developed where a film with thermal contact resistance is placed at the wheel-rail contact interface. The present model {{can be used to}} efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle stop braking, drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can be calculated. The inclusion of heat <b>transfer</b> from <b>wheel</b> to rail means that the model is useful for comparing brake rig tests, where normally the chilling influence from the rail is not included, with in-field tests. Two companion papers with experimental results supplement the present numerical modelling.

40|$|Dowel bars in jointed plain {{concrete}} pavement (JPCP) have the important function of <b>transferring</b> <b>wheel</b> loads from one slab to the other, hence {{ensuring that the}} deflections {{on each side of}} the joint are kept almost equal. As well, the dowels should not impede the concrete pavement movements due to environmental effects (temperature and moisture). Dowel bar misalignment, attributed to deficient construction practice, is a major cause of joint distress or faulting by inhibiting the free movement of the slab at the joint. To prevent these issues, tolerance guidelines on misalignment levels are implemented by transportation agencies. Review of previous studies indicate that many researchers analysed the effects of dowel bar misalignment on pavement behaviour using a pull-out test, that is a forcebased opening of the joint. These approaches neglect that joints movements in the field are strain-governed by non-linear temperature and shrinkage actions, leading to combined axial movements and curling of the slab. In this study, the fundamental dowel bar behaviour under shrinkage and thermal loading was determined through detailed 3 D finite element modelling (3 D-FEM). To that end, models of dowel jointed concrete slabs were developed and subjected to realistic non-linear profiles of shrinkage and thermal strains. Studies were carried out on a single-bar model, taking into account bar-concrete friction and plastic concrete behaviour. The parameters that were investigated included different configurations and levels of bar misalignment and different friction coefficients between the steel and the concrete, simulating the use of bond-breakers. To interpret the results from the numerical analysis, criteria for concrete damage were developed and used in parallel with measures of joint load transfer efficiency; these were obtained by examining the response of the slab under a Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) drop at the joint. The results were verified by comparing the outputs of a model consisting of one half of a slab to published data. The analysis of the models revealead that none of the models showed signs of significant damage after the application of shrinkage and two thermal cycles. Analyses with up to ten thermal cycles did not indicate progressive accumulation of damage, suggesting that for the chosen parameters there is no the concrete around the dowel bar will not fail. Models with bars placed higher in the slab and bars with angular misalignment exhibited more damage than the non-misaligned models without reaching the damage criteria used in this study. The models did not exhibit the amount of damage reported in the studies on dowel bar misalignment having used pull-out tests. It was found that no significant difference existed between uncoated and coated dowel bars models results with regards to concrete damage at the joint. However, a high coefficient of friction between the dowel and the concrete, simulating dowel bar corrosion, proved to be the most detrimental to joint integrity. All of the models performed very well with respect to joint load transfer efficiency, suggesting that the plastic strains in the concrete around the dowel did not have a significant impact on joint performance for the realistic range of parameters investigated...|$|R
40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} sleepers (or railroad ties) {{are among}} the major and the most common structural components of railway track structures. Their main duty is to carry and <b>transfer</b> the <b>wheel</b> loads from the rails to the ground. In general, railway tracks suffer with the extreme loading conditions, which are attributable to the train operations with either wheel or rail abnormalities such as flat wheels, dipped rails, etc. These loads are of very high magnitude but short duration, {{as well as they}} are of low-possibility occurrence during the design life of the prestressed concrete sleepers. In spite of the most common use of the prestressed concrete sleepers in railway tracks, their impact responses and behaviours are not deeply appreciated nor taken into the design consideration. This experimental investigation was aimed at understanding the progressive dynamic behaviours of prestressed concrete sleepers in railway track structures under repeated impact loading, in order to form {{the state of the art}} of limit states design concept for prestressed concrete sleepers. A high-capacity drop weight impact testing machine was constructed at the University of Wollongong as to achieve the purpose. Series of repeated impact tests for the in-situ prestressed concrete sleepers were carried out, ranging from a low drop height to the ultimate drop height where the ultimate failure occurred.

The effects of track environment including soft and hard tracks together with the relationship between the resultant bending moment of prestressed concrete sleepers and the applied impact force as a design guideline were also presented...|$|R

They are subjected to impact loading conditions that are resulted from train operations over wheel or rail abnormalities, such as flat wheels, dipped rails, crossing transfers, rail squats, corrugation, etc. The magnitude of the shock load relies on various factors such as axle load, types of wheel/rail imperfections, speeds of vehicle, track stiffness, etc. This paper demonstrates the development of finite element modelling to evaluate the dynamic responses of prestressed tendons or wires embedded in concrete sleepers, particularly under a variety of impact loads. The force prediction under high speed rail environment was conducted using D-TRACK. The 3 D finite element model of prestressed concrete sleeper has been developed using a finite element package, LS-Dyna. It has been verified by the experiments carried out using the high capacity drop-weight impact machine at the University of Wollon-gong, Australia. The experimental results provide very good correlation with numerical simulations.

Over a period of time, a railway track could experience various types of static and dynamic loading conditions, which are attributable to commercial train operations. Previous studies have established two main limit states for the design consideration of concrete sleepers: ultimate limit states under extreme impact and fatigue limit states under repeated probabilistic impact loads. Prestressed concrete has {{played a significant role}} in maintaining the high endurance of the sleepers under low to moderate repeated impact loads. Despite the most common use of the prestressed concrete sleepers in railway tracks, their remaining lives are not deeply appreciated nor taken into account for track maintenance and renewal. The present experimental investigation was aimed at determining the residual prestressing force of railway concrete sleepers after revenue services using the dynamic relaxation technique. Fifteen sleepers were extracted from a heavy-haul rail network for testing using experimental facilities at the University of Wollongong in Australia. The structural evaluation program included quasi-static bending tests, dynamic impact tests, and tests to establish the current level of prestress in the steel wires using the dynamic relaxation technique.
