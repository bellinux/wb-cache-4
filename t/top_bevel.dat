50|$|Teeth design {{comes in}} many variations: ATB (Alternating <b>top</b> <b>bevel),</b> FTG (Flat Top Grind) and TCG (triple chip grind) {{are the most}} common. Each design is {{optimized}} for a specific material and edge treatment.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increased}} interest in constructing Pre-Cast (PC) Twin and Triple Reinforced Concrete Box (RCB) culverts in Iowa due to the efficiency associated with their production in controlled environment and decrease of the construction time at the culvert sites. The design of the multi-barrel PC culverts is, however, based on guidelines for single-barrel cast-inplace (CIP) culverts despite that the PC and CIP culverts have different geometry. There is scarce information for multiplebarrel RCB culverts in general and even fewer on culverts with straight wingwalls as those designed by Iowa DOT. Overall, the transition from CIP to PC culverts requires additional information for improving the design specifications currently in use. Motivated {{by the need to}} fill these gaps, an experimental study was undertaken by IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering. The goals of the study are to document flow performance curves and head losses at the culvert entrance for a various culvert geometry, flow conditions, and settings. The tests included single-, double- and triple-barrel PC and CIP culverts with two span-to-rise ratios set on mild and steep slopes. The tests also included optimization of the culvert geometry entrance by considering various configurations for the <b>top</b> <b>bevel.</b> The overall conclusion of the study is that by and large the current Iowa DOT design specifications for CIP culverts can be used for multi-barrel PC culvert design. For unsubmerged flow conditions the difference in the hydraulic performance curves and headloss coefficients for PC and CIP culverts are within the experimental uncertainty. Larger differences (specified by the study) are found for submerged conditions when the flow is increasingly constricted at the entrance in the culvert. The observed differentiation is less important for multi-barrel culverts as the influence of the wingwalls decreases with the increase of the number of barrels...|$|E
50|$|The nearby Stac an Armin reaches 196 metres (643 ft), {{making these}} the highest sea stacks in Britain. Seen from the south, the rock appears as an {{imposing}} cliff as broad as high, while {{from the west}} it has the aspect of a thin needle with a <b>top</b> <b>bevelled</b> at an angle of 45°. The most impressive view is that obtained from the south-east, from where Stac Lee looks like a giant hook.|$|R
5000|$|The Bowie knife's design also {{lends itself}} {{to use as a}} hunting knife for {{skinning}} or butchering game. The curved <b>top</b> clip <b>bevel</b> of the blade, when suitably sharpened, may be used to remove the skin from a carcass, while the straight portion of the blade edge, toward the guard, can be used for cutting meat. Arkansas culturalist and researcher Russell T. Johnson describes the James Black knife in the following manner {{and at the same time}} captures the quintessence of the Bowie Knife: [...] "It must be long enough to use as a sword, sharp enough to use as a razor, wide enough to use as a paddle, and heavy enough to use as a hatchet." [...] Most such knives intended for hunting are only sharpened on one edge, to reduce the danger of cutting oneself while butchering and skinning the carcass.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the grips, {{it is important to know}} that the handle of a racquet always consists of 8 sides, or in other words, has an octagonal shape. A square shape would hurt the hand, while a round shape would not give enough friction to gain a firm grip. The eight sides of the handle are called bevels. The bevels can be numbered from 1 to 8; with the racquet surface perpendicular to the ground, the bevels are numbered from the <b>top</b> anti-clockwise. So <b>bevel</b> 1 would be the narrow bevel at the 'North' position, bevel 2 would be the diagonal bevel at the 'Northwest' position, etc.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeveral 65 μm thick {{epitaxial}} diamond films prepared on (100) Ib substrates by {{high power}} pulsed microwave plasma assisted {{chemical vapour deposition}} (HP-MPCVD) are studied {{as a function of}} surface treatments by cathodoluminescence (CL) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies. They are either asgrown, or polished, or etched by a microwave oxygen plasma, or after applying subsequently the two last processes. In CL spectra, bands due to defects occur at 2. 3 eV, 3. 07 eV, 3. 7 eV and 4. 7 eV, the last one being specific of polished surfaces, with nearly no contrast in the luminescence image. A fundamental result consists in demonstrating that the defects induced by polishing can be removed by oxygen plasma etching. Additionally, in order to assess how luminescence spectra originate from a peculiar depth or not, a bevelled sample is studied. PL spectra are acquired on the sample side while CL spectra are measured at several points on the <b>bevel</b> <b>top</b> side till to the Ib substrate. Comparison of the two sets of result show that the H 3 signal originates from the Ib substrate even if it is present in the CL spectra of the film. An analysis of the change in the intensity of the TO free exciton line, defect bands and H 3 signal, along decreasing photon energies, {{as a function of the}} thickness of the remaining HP-PMPCVD film, is performed with the help of a model taking the diffusion of the unrecombined excitonic pairs and the re-excited photoluminescence into account. CL images recorded at specific wavelengths, which do not show inverted contrast, are also assessed. From these data, the exciton diffusion length is evaluated to 11 μm in the major part of the epitaxial layer except for the first 20 μm close to the Ib substrate where it decreases down to 2 μm. This study sheds light on the interpretation of luminescence spectra excited by an electron beam in undoped diamond layers. Defects bands due to damages induced by polishing and etching processes are also documented...|$|R
