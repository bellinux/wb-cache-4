On April10, 1936, the predominantly Russian city of Maykop, as well as Giaginsky District and Khansky Selsoviet of Maykopsky District, became a part of <b>the</b> <b>autonomous</b> oblast (with the selsoviet having been incorporated into Giaginsky District). At the same time, the administrative center of <b>the</b> <b>autonomous</b> oblast was moved from Krasnodar to Maykop. Tuapse, a port on the Black Sea, was considered for the role of the administrative center, but the idea was rejected as it would give the native population access to the sea.|$|E

5|$|On July15, 1940, Ponezhukaysky District {{was renamed}} Teuchezhsky after Adyghe poet Tsuga Teuchezh. On December7, 1956, {{the districts of}} <b>the</b> <b>autonomous</b> oblast were enlarged: the {{territory}} of Shovgenovsky District was divided among Giaginsky, Koshekhablsky, and Krasnogvardeysky Districts, while Techezhsky District was merged into Takhtamukaysky District. This enlargement, however, did not prove successful, so on August5, 1957 Takhtamukaysky District was split back into Takhtamukaysky and Teuchezhsky Districts within their old borders. At the same time, Takhtamukaysky District was renamed Oktyabrsky. Shovgenovsky District was restored in its old borders on March21, 1958. On February1, 1963, changes in administrative and territorial structure of <b>the</b> <b>autonomous</b> oblast led to the abolition of Koshekhablsky, Maykopsky, and Oktyabrsky Districts: Koshekhablsky District was merged into Shovgenovsky, Maykopsky District into Giaginsky, and Oktyabrsky District into Teuchezhsky. This change, however, was reverted in 1965, when, after several changes, <b>the</b> <b>autonomous</b> oblast became divided into six districts (Giaginsky, Koshekhablsky, Krasnogvardeysky, Maykopsky, Shovgenovsky, and Teuchezhsky).
