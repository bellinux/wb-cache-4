He stated: [...] "There's {{a lot of big}} stuff out there that we will be wrapping up to a certain extent. In the writers' room we were fully aware that we were coming up on this hiatus, so we definitely wrote to it. I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a little shocked." ...|$|E
500|$|For this reason, Sony {{titled the}} album #1's, as Carey {{felt the need}} to express the album's true content, a {{collection}} of her number one hits. In December 2001, Columbia released the album Greatest Hits, which featured Carey's number one singles alongside songs she said [...] "needed to be really heard," [...] such as [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] and [...] "Forever." [...] In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding the album. [...] "There's a lot of songs that I'm happy are gonna see the light of day. I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> like this Greatest Hits because there are songs on it that were not necessarily singles." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Peter Berg said {{prior to}} Hancocks release {{that if the}} film pulls in as much {{business}} as predicted, a sequel, Hancock 2, would likely follow. [...] After the film's release on DVD and Blu-ray Disc, actor Will Smith {{said that there was}} ongoing discussion about a possible sequel, [...] "The ideas aren't [...] developed, but we are building out an entire world; I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be very surprised at the new world of Hancock." [...] In August 2009, Columbia Pictures hired screenwriters Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara to write the sequel, and the studio plans to bring back the producing team from the original film. [...] Charlize Theron confirmed that she would reprise her role, and Berg said to expect a third actor to star as another figure with powers like Smith's and Theron's characters.|$|E

60|$|Evening {{meditation}} and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and having {{decided that she}} wouldn't be vain enough to <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy wouldn't {{do anything to make}} her hurt his poor feelings. A call at Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still further fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about and run away.|$|R
5000|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Evan Bernard, features Winona Ryder, Giovanni Ribisi and John C. Reilly as the Blues Explosion with Judah, Russell and Jon acting. The singer told MTV Online: [...] "I <b>think</b> that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> really <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> surprised {{when they see}} the acting {{on the part of the}} Blues Explosion. When people get a load of some of the heavy, dramatic, really very intense scenes that we pulled out from our souls, I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> really <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> blown away...".|$|R
500|$|On {{the quality}} of 3-D in film, Burke told Los Angeles Times, [...] "I think it's good, actually. I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the {{work has been done}} very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3-D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really {{impressed}} with it, actually." [...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way." ...|$|E
500|$|For this reason, Sony {{titled the}} album #1's, as Carey {{felt the need}} to express the album's true content, a {{collection}} of her number one hits. Carey has frequently cited [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] (1996) and [...] "Breakdown" [...] (1998) as examples of songs she was unsuccessful in releasing. In the album's liner notes, Carey wrote that she was releasing a collection of her number one singles as a [...] "thank you" [...] and a tribute to her fans, and explained that someday she would release a true greatest hits album containing songs that were not released as singles, as well as singles that did not reach number one. In December 2001, Columbia released the album Greatest Hits, which featured Carey's number one singles alongside songs she said [...] "needed to be really heard", such as [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] and [...] "Forever". In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding the album: [...] "There's a lot of songs that I'm happy are gonna see the light of day.

500|$|As part of {{the secrecy}} campaign, Benedict Cumberbatch denied that he was playing Khan during interviews, {{describing}} Harrison as simply a terrorist with his own purposes, as well as [...] "someone that's activated and manufactured in a way by Starfleet, and it's a scene that has {{come back to haunt}} him." [...] He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage [...] "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," [...] adding parallels to the current world order [...] "whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists." [...] Into Darkness writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom—"It’s so easy to fall into the trap of doing something because you <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> love it. You must come up with what the movie can be on its own and then, if it turns out the villain maybe can be Khan, then you can do it. But you can’t start there."—but for fitting the sequel's theme of [...] "how far will we go to exact vengeance and justice on an enemy that scares us." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the campaign, Kennedy was {{frequently}} met by large crowds. Keating accused Kennedy {{of being a}} carpetbagger. Kennedy responded to these charges in a televised town meeting by saying, [...] "If the senator {{of the state of}} New York <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>be</b> selected on who's lived here the longest, then I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> vote for my opponent. If it's <b>going</b> <b>be</b> selected on who's got the best New York accent, then I think I'm probably out too. But I think if it's <b>going</b> <b>be</b> {{selected on the basis of}} who can make the best United States senator, I think I'm still in the contest." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{musical score}} was {{composed}} by Brian Tyler, who scored the third, fourth, and fifth installments of the series. [...] "There's an emotional component to Fast & Furious 7 that is unique", said Tyler about his experience scoring. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> really <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> amazed by it." [...] A soundtrack album {{to the film}} was released by Atlantic Records on March 17, 2015.|$|R
5000|$|Celia Kirwan said:I think George {{was quite}} {{right to do}} it. ... And, of course, {{everybody}} <b>thinks</b> that these <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> shot at dawn. The only thing that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to happen to them}} was that they wouldn't be asked to write for the Information Research Department.|$|R
2500|$|Around this time, Wilson {{announced}} that he was developing another concept album, titled Pleasure Island: A Rock Fantasy. Accordingly: [...] "It’s about some guys who took a hike, and they found a place called Pleasure Island. And they met all kinds of chicks, and they went on rides and — it’s just a concept. I haven’t developed it yet. I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> love it — it could be the best thing I’ve ever done." [...] The album has yet to surface, and for several years, Wilson has consistently maintained in interviews that he wishes his [...] "next album" [...] to be more rock-oriented.|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 2017, Thune {{became the}} center of media {{attention}} for his response to the mass murder in Las Vegas. [...] "It sounds like [...] used conversion kits and other things, you know, to make the weapons more lethal," [...] Thune said. [...] "We’ll look at the facts when we get them all in here. I think a lot of us want {{to do everything we can}} to prevent tragedies like that from happening again. You know - it's an open society. And when somebody does what he wants to do - it's going to be hard to prevent anything. But I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions. To protect themselves. And in situations like that, you know, try to stay safe. As somebody said — get small.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The 16 year–old actress Lacey Turner {{was cast}} in the role. Turner had {{originally}} gone to audition for {{a part in the}} Miller family, but was given the part of Stacey instead. Commenting on her role, Turner said [...] "I was speechless when I found out that I had been cast as Stacey Slater especially as I knew I would be working with Jessie Wallace who is my favourite actress. I've watched the show since I was about four years old, and I used to live in a house that backed onto the EastEnders set so I used to watch them filming all the time. I always dreamt of being on the show and so I can't believe that I've fulfilled my greatest ambition!" [...] She added, [...] "I'm not like Stacey at all although I love playing her! She's a real challenge [...] I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> love to hate her like they did with [...] Janine Butcher." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another Hyperion {{joins the}} Avengers in Jonathan Hickman's The Avengers vol. 5, #1 (December 2012). Hickman {{described}} {{the decision to}} use a new Hyperion, rather than an existing one:"This is yet another parallel universe Hyperion. This is not King Hyperion, or Supreme Power Hyperion, this is not Gruenwald's Hyperion. This is Hyperion without all that baggage. This is Hyperion with a fresh slate, for a very specific purpose. He comes out of what the big story is behind the whole Avengers three-year plan that I have. He's very important, very pivotal, and I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> really <b>going</b> to dig where we go with that. He's not <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> our poor analogue for Superman." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the box set's track listing, Wainwright stated, [...] "I've mourned {{over the}} kittens {{that have been}} put in the sack, that didn't make it into the box. That was an aspect that was {{difficult}} at that stage - choosing what could be included and what couldn't be included because there were digital space requirements. ... I took one song off because it made my wife wince too much. I cut her some slack. It takes a lot to make me wince; as far as I'm concerned, bad taste is timeless. I like to wince. I like to <b>think</b> that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> 'Eeeghegh!' I put one song on there that I never had the guts to put on a record - which was this song called [...] "Laid" [...] - so I thought, 'What the hell? I'm almost dead. I'll put it out there'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Referring to the 12-man voting board, Jim Bouton said, [...] "How {{did these}} people vote, {{and why are}} their votes kept secret? And why aren't there more players on that {{committee}}? Hank Aaron, Jim Bunning, Bob Gibson, Ferguson Jenkins—they're all on the committee for reviewing the managers and umpires. Essentially, the decision for putting a union leader in the Hall of Fame was handed over {{to a bunch of}} executives and former executives. Marvin Miller kicked their butts and took power away from the baseball establishment—do you really <b>think</b> those <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to vote him in? It's a joke... I blame the players. It's their Hall of Fame; it's their balls and bats that make the hall what it is. Where are the public outcries from Joe Morgan or Reggie Jackson, who was a player rep? Why don't these guys see that some of their own get on these committees? That's the least they owe Marvin Miller. Do they think they became millionaires because of the owners' generosity?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Flint Journal Walker said, [...] "'Fall' was a huge hit for us. I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> want to see us and ticket sales are already going up. As long as {{people want to hear}} us -- and I feel like they do -- we're going to get out and give it to them." ...|$|E
5000|$|During an {{interview}} in May 2010, Marquess was asked about Brendan {{and if he was}} a bad boy. He replied: [...] "Oh, definitely — hes an absolute bastard! I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> think, Heres the next Warren, but theyll be surprised when they find out what the real story is. He is Cheryls half-brother… and Cheryl wont hear a bad word against him..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the film, {{original}} footage is seamlessly {{interspersed with}} the dramatisation. Richard Dimbleby is seen {{both in the}} drama and in the BBC report he gave in 1945. Johnston and Sington watch footage of a tractor scooping up corpses ready for burial, and Johnston tells Sington [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> want to see this." [...] But Sington disagrees. He tells Johnston [...] "I think people should see this." ...|$|E
5000|$|In February 2017, Dollanganger was {{the support}} for {{the last leg of}} Code Orange's Forever tour with {{industrial}} act Youth Code. [...] On the subject of the tour's lineup diversity, Jami Morgan stated, “Regardless of what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> saying, I like mixed bills. It’s our tour. We’re happy we got to have bands that we like. I’m really happy with the mix. I don’t <b>think</b> it’s something <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get to see every day. It’s gonna be a very jarring experience. And our set’s <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a jarring experience. And the whole show <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a jarring experience, so that’s what we’re all about.” [...] She also collaborated with grindcore band Full of Hell for their upcoming LP Trumpeting Ecstasy, out in May of 2017.|$|R
5000|$|Touring {{in support}} of Forever began with a January-February 2017 US tour {{featuring}} Youth Code, Gatecreeper, Nicole Dollanganger, Lifeless and Disgrace. The tour was noted for its wide variety of music genres among the bands on the bill. On {{the subject of the}} variety of bands, Morgan said: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> it's something <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get to see every day. It's gonna be a very jarring experience. And our set's <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a jarring experience. And the whole show <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a jarring experience, so that's what we're all about." [...] Guitarist Eric Balderose collaborated with Drumcorps to create a mixtape under the moniker Shade titled It's Almost Forever that will be played between sets and exclusively sold on cassette on this tour.|$|R
5000|$|Fraites {{emphasizes}} {{the simplicity of}} the group's style, stating, [...] "we’re not reinventing the wheel or doing anything that different, the songs are super simple. The ideas themselves are very simple ideas. Anyone who can play an instrument can play a Lumineers song. I think there’s a certain cinematic aspect of our music that I really like." [...] Launchpad similarly writes, [...] "where most bands these days look for that new, original sound to enhance the digital revolution, 'The Lumineers' do superbly in taking it back to simplicity." [...] In another interview, Fraites explains, [...] "I just <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> enamored of <b>going</b> into a room and watching people play their own instruments and sing, rather than using Auto-Tune and a lot of digital equipment to get their sound across. There is so much digital-ness all around us. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> almost taken aback when you do the opposite of that. It’s inspiring." ...|$|R

5000|$|On December 8, 2011, Mraz told Jeff Benjamin of Billboard {{that the}} [...] "album is finished" [...] {{except for one}} track he was {{attempting}} to re-work as an acoustic version. Describing the album, he said, [...] "It's not a departure in {{the sound of the}} genre in any way, it's just different tones, different textures. Musically, I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> like it. It's personal. It's melodic. And it's mellow. There's a couple of up-tempo tunes, but mostly the rhythm of the heartbeat kind of takes precedence on this record. Medium-tempo tunes; which I love. It feels more like the pace of life. At least, based on my life and what I've been doing." ...|$|E

We got a few breaks at various times and managed to get the points.”“I don’t always feel the {{silverware}} {{is as important as the}} outside thinks, but it is important. I thought it important we stayed at the game - they’re a resilient bunch, they’ve been through a fair bit.“We had nine Munster final debutants, sometimes <b>people</b> <b>think</b> we’ve <b>been</b> <b>going</b> since the year 2000. We had nine people who played their first Munster final there - I think that’s good, to have that transition.“I thought a five-point win - maybe those who watch the game don’t call it a close game, but for me it was as close as it gets. I didn’t relax until the last minute of play.“We’ve been through close games and sometimes we’ve come out the wrong side of them, but you have to be careful judging a team who come out the wrong side of a game by a point or two. I was always happy the team would be capable of winning a really tight match, and today was a really tight match.” ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} given to Rolling Stone, former Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora says {{the album is}} a return to [...] "rock and roll" [...] and said [...] "There’s going to be some big choruses on there. It sounds like Bon Jovi, but it sounds fresh. We experimented with a lot of new sounds and had a really good time working with John Shanks, who is also a really good guitar player, so he and I did a lot of ‘weaseling’ with the guitar sounds. There are a lot of really good guitar sounds and new kind atmospheres on the new Bon Jovi record, that I think makes it really modern. I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> dig it, man. And it rocks hard." ...|$|E

[...] Haigh revealed that he had come across Daniel Conway's artwork after [...] "trawling the internet looking for an artist". Haigh was immediately drawn to Conway because of the cohesion between his work and the album's lyrical and conceptual themes; [...] "We’ve always been a visual band and I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> realise that when they see the artwork.
