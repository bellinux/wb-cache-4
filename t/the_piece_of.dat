5|$|In 1949, the Department of Highways paved <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> State Route 664 from Gallagher Township to the Lycoming County line. In 1951, {{the section}} between Swissdale and Little Plum Run Road was paved once again. Two years after that, the section from the Lycoming County line to State Route 44 was {{improved}} in its condition. That lone section was improved in 1966. There {{have been no}} recorded changes in alignment since its 1930 assignment.|$|E
5|$|By 1926, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> current NY9N from Hague to Ticonderoga was {{designated}} as the easternmost leg of NY47, which continued west to Chestertown on modern NY8. In 1927, most of NY6 north of Round Lake was replaced by US9 when U.S. Highways were first signed in New York. The lone exception was between Elizabethtown and Keeseville, where US9 followed a previously unnumbered highway to the east instead. The bypassed section of NY6 between the two locations was redesignated as NY9W at this time. NY9W was renumbered to NY9N {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, eliminating the alphanumerical duplication between itself and US9W.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers widened, straightened, and deepened the canal. As part {{of their}} work, the agency {{constructed}} a vertical lift bridge across the canal. Between 1924 and 1926, the Maryland State Roads Commission constructed approaches to the new bridge {{on both sides of}} the expanded canal, eliminating two narrow and dangerous bridges and four right-angle turns in Chesapeake City. The new route along the part of Lock Street south of Hemphill Street became part of US 213 in 1927. After the tanker Franz Klasen destroyed the vertical lift bridge on July 28, 1942, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the present tied arch Chesapeake City Bridge and new approach roads to the bridge between 1946 and 1949. US 213 was moved to the new Chesapeake City Bridge, and MD 537B was assigned to the bypassed portion of highway between the canal and county-maintained Hemphill Street, as well as <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> Lock Street that connected with US 213.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance of NY32 {{is split}} between the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and the highway {{departments}} of several different jurisdictions. Within the cities of Newburgh and Watervliet, the route is entirely city-maintained. In four other cities—Albany, Cohoes, Glens Falls, and Kingston—NY32 is mostly locally maintained. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the route {{in the city of}} Mechanicville, meanwhile, is city-maintained north of Frances Street, a local street four blocks south of NY67. One last locally maintained section exists in the Albany suburb of Bethlehem, where the route is county-maintained between Feura Bush Road and the Delmar Bypass. This section is co-signed as County Route52 (CR52), which continues northwest of NY32 to a junction with NY140 near Slingerlands.|$|E
5|$|Space Shuttle Discovery docked on 10 March 2001, {{bringing}} to the ISS the new long-duration three-person crew of Expedition 2, as well as four short-term crew members of STS-102. A few hours after docking, the hatch opened, and all ten astronauts greeted each other, setting a new record for the number people simultaneously in the ISS. The day after docking, American astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms began a spacewalk which ended up being nearly nine hours long, and still holds {{the record for the}} longest spacewalk ever performed, as of August 2010. The length of the spacewalk was partially due to some mistakes, including Voss accidentally releasing a small tool. Unable to retrieve it, NASA engineers tracked the tool, and decided to use Discoverys thrusters on 14 March to boost the station four kilometers higher, to ensure the ISS would not collide with <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> space debris.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> NY167 between Richfield Springs and Paines Hollow, a small hamlet {{southwest}} of Little Falls, was originally {{part of an}} unsigned legislative route in the early 20th century. Farther north, the segment between Little Falls and Dolgeville {{was added to the}} legislative route system in 1910. In 1924, the Richfield Springs–Paines Hollow route became part of NY28; however, that route was altered as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to follow a new alignment to the west. NY28's former routing between Richfield Springs and Paines Hollow became part of the new NY167, which continued north through Little Falls to Dolgeville as it does today.|$|E
5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel {{to get to a}} dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E
5|$|Harry learns from Snape's memories, {{that while}} Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, {{he loved his}} late mother, Lily. Following her death, Snape worked {{secretly}} with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe {{he saw in the}} woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all. He fakes being dead, and Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead after confirming that Draco is okay.|$|E

5|$|PA 106 was {{originally}} an alignment of PA47 designated in 1927. This alignment stretched from US 11 in Kingsley to the intersection with US 6 in Carbondale. In {{the plan for}} the U.S. Highway System from November 11, 1926, the road between Wyalusing and Carbondale {{was to be a}} part of US 6 while US 106 was to run from US 6 in Wyalusing to the New York border at the Delaware River in Narrowsburg via Scranton. By 1928, US 6 and US 106 switched alignments between Wyalusing and Carbondale. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> US 106 that is now PA 106 began in the community of Kingsley and went to the city of Carbondale. The route remained intact for almost 45 years. On December 3, 1971, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the elimination of the US 106 designation. On March 14, 1972, US 106 was decommissioned and replaced with PA 706 between US 6 in Wyalusing and US 11 south of New Milford, PA 106 between US 11 in Kingsley and US 6 in Carbondale, and PA 652 between US 6 in Indian Orchard and the Delaware River. The remainder of the route was removed from concurrencies with US 11 between south of New Milford and Kingsley and US 6 between Carbondale and Indian Orchard. Signs were changed by April of that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{specimen}} MACN Pv-RN 975, {{first described}} by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, {{may be a}} jaw fragment of Ferugliotherium, although {{it has also been}} identified as an unrelated multituberculate. The fossil preserves a bladelike premolar, identified as the fourth premolar, and <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the jawbone below it. A diastema (gap) is present between the premolar and the incisor that would have been located in front of it. The alveolus (socket) of the lower incisor extends {{all the way through the}} fossil. The p4 bears eight ridges on both sides of the longitudinal crest and is supported by two roots at the front and back. The p4 assigned to Argentodites also has eight ridges on both sides, which descend from cusps on the upper margin, and roots at the front and back. According to Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues, it differs from that of MACN Pv-RN 975 in its rounded, as opposed to angular shape. However, Gurovich and Beck attribute this difference to the fact that the latter has undergone much more wear.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{was elected}} bishop by the New Hampshire diocese on June 7, 2003, at St. Paul's Church in Concord. Thirty-nine clergy votes and 83 lay votes were the {{threshold}} necessary {{to elect a}} bishop in the Diocese of New Hampshire at that time. The clergy voted 58 votes for Robinson and the laity voted 96 for Robinson on the second ballot. The Episcopal Church requires in its Canon 16 that the election procedure and the candidate who is elected be subjected to review and must be consented to by the national church. No objections were raised to the procedure of the election. If diocesan election occurred within 120 days (3 months) of a General Convention, canon law requires consent by the House of Deputies and then the House of Bishops at the General Convention itself. Consent to the election of Robinson was given in August at the 2003 General Convention. The General Convention of 2003 became the center for debate over Robinson's election, as conservatives and liberals within the Church argued over whether Robinson {{should be allowed to}} become bishop. Some conservative factions threatened a schism within both the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion should Robinson be elected. Before the House of Deputies can vote on a resolution, a legislative committee must examine <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legislation first. The Committee on the Consecration of Bishops held a two-hour hearing on Robinson's election and supporters and opponents were allowed to speak. One of the speakers was Robinson's daughter, Ella, who read a letter from his ex-wife Boo in strong support of Robinson. The House of Deputies, which consists of laypersons and priests, voted in the affirmative: the laity voted 63 in favor, 32 opposed, and 13 divided; the clergy voted 65 in favor, 31 opposed, and 12 divided.|$|E
