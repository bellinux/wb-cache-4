Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969. [...] The results were [...] "generally very positive"; children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and their attention was sustained over <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour.</b> [...] However, {{the researchers found that}} although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the [...] "Street" [...] segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together.

The producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused, and had recommended that human actors and Muppets not be shown together. As {{a result of this}} decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than they would have liked, so the show's producers knew they needed to make significant changes, including defying the recommendations of their advisers and show the human and Muppet characters together. Lesser called this decision [...] "a turning point in the history of Sesame Street". [...] Muppet creator Jim Henson and his coworkers created Muppets for Sesame Street that could interact with the human actors, and many segments were re-shot.|$|E

He was positive towards Jim and Pam's reconciliation, but felt [...] "something hollow about their reunion". He {{also noted that}} the Jim-Pam storyline caused the Dwight-Angela relationship to go [...] "darker". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the episode a slightly more mixed review writing that [...] "the non-Andy parts of [...] "Livin' the Dream" [...] were fairly interesting". He appreciated the drama coming from Angela's desperation, despite disagreeing with the logic in the situation. Sepinwall praised the Jim-Dwight dynamic in the episode, considering it an enjoyable payoff, and also praised Jim and Pam's reconciliation, particularly them annoying their co-workers with their flirting. Joshua Alton of The A.V. Club was more negative towards the episode, saying it felt [...] "padded-out" [...] to fill <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour</b> timeslot, and that [...] "this episode might be the nadir for the show's hour-long installments". He was complimentary towards the Jim-Pam storyline, but felt [...] "there wasn't much happening" [...] beyond Pam overhearing Jim's talk with Darryl. Alton praised the Dwight storyline and his dynamic with Jim and Pam, calling it [...] "the true fan service". Alton gave the episode a [...] "C–".|$|E

Beck called it a miracle. He also said he received a call from the Smithsonian saying they wanted [...] "items from the event preserved for the Smithsonian."

2500|$|The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode the highest grade of the site, an [...] "A". Alasdair Wilkins writes [...] "Steven Moffat’s script is inordinately clever {{in how it}} uses {{the trappings of a}} fluffy, silly Christmas special to crank up the scariness of a good old-fashioned monster story. But after all that, tonight’s episode manages {{something}} that not all of its Christmas predecessors manage, as it anchors its story in something that feels particular to the holidays. There is a melancholy to the comings and goings that define this time of year, and “Last Christmas” recognises that from its title outward." [...] Praise was also given to Capaldi's performance in the special, [...] "If there’s one thing we never really saw in Capaldi’s first season as the Doctor, {{it was the kind of}} unabashed joy that so animated the 10th and 11th Doctors and made the tail-end of the 9th Doctor’s journey—including his Santa claim to Rose at the end of “The Doctor Dances”—so powerful. Well, it takes <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour,</b> but “Last Christmas” gets us there. It was worth the wait." [...] Digital Spy awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, stating that [...] "Moffat pulls off a number of difficult balancing acts spectacularly well, refusing to deliver another throwaway special that's heavy on the frothy festive cheer but light on real substance". They closed their review by saying [...] "Last Christmas is an absolute cracker. The festive fun factor is high, as is only right and proper, but it's often been said that Doctor Who is at its best when its roots are showing and here Moffat apes both Christopher Nolan's Inception and Ridley Scott's Alien to provide the viewer with both food for thought and fuel for our nightmares". The Daily Telegraph awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "marvellously merry" [...] and stating that it [...] "had heart as well as head, so ended like a festive special should: happily, with a cockle-warming cosy glow". The Mirror also praised the episode, saying that it [...] "might have borrowed, somewhat heavily, from a few films, but it still had the Doctor Who spin". They also expressed praise over Clara's continuation, saying [...] "It’s great news that we will have another series with these two verbally sparring" [...] and closed their review by claiming the episode [...] "was [...] real Christmas treat to join Capaldi and Coleman on another adventure, and it was the icing on the cake that Clara is staying with the Doctor".|$|E
6000|$|No ditch or wall {{encompassed}} my abode. The {{window was}} open; the door too stood open to that best {{friend of my}} work, the warm, still sunshine of the wide fields. They lay around me infinitely helpful, but truth to say I had not known for weeks whether the sun shone upon the earth and whether the stars above still moved on their appointed courses. I was just then giving up some days of my allotted span to the last chapters of the novel [...] "Nostromo," [...] a tale of an imaginary (but true) seaboard, which is still mentioned now and again, and indeed kindly, sometimes {{in connection with the}} word [...] "failure" [...] and sometimes in conjunction with the word [...] "astonishing." [...] I have no opinion on this discrepancy. It's the sort of difference that can never be settled.

For that too is the wrestling of men with the might of their Creator, in a great isolation from the world, without the amenities and consolations of life, a lonely struggle under a sense of over-matched littleness, for no reward that could be adequate, but for the mere winning of a longitude. Yet a certain longitude, once won, cannot be disputed. The sun and the stars and the shape of your earth are the witnesses of your gain; whereas a handful of pages, no matter how much you have made them your own, are at best but an obscure and questionable spoil. Here they are. [...] "Failure"--"Astonishing": take your choice; or perhaps both, or neither--a mere rustle and flutter of pieces of paper settling down in the night, and undistinguishable, like the snowflakes of a great drift destined to melt away in the sunshine.|$|E
