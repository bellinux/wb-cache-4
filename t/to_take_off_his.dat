5|$|The Byzantine Emperor, John V Palaiologos visited Louis in Buda {{in early}} 1366, seeking his {{assistance}} against the Ottoman Turks , who had {{set foot in}} Europe. This was the first occasion that a Byzantine Emperor left his empire to plead for a foreign monarch's assistance. According to Louis's physician, Giovanni di Conversino, at {{his first meeting with}} Louis, the emperor refused to dismount and <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat, which offended Louis. John V pledged that he would promote the union of the Byzantine Church with the Papacy, and Louis promised to send him help, but neither the emperor nor Louis fulfilled their promises. Pope Urban encouraged Louis not to send help to Constantinople before the emperor guaranteed the Church union.|$|E

On September 1, 1987, while being brought into court, Vanunu tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> helmet and started shouting in an apparent attempt {{to talk to the}} reporters nearby. His guards stopped him using physical force, and police sirens were turned on to drown out his voice.|$|E
25|$|In {{one scene}} Hassan is {{attacked}} {{and it is}} suggested that he is raped. The filmmakers wanted Ahmad <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> pants for the shooting, but his father refused to let him do that. The boy has said that he would never have taken the role had he known Hassan would be raped. Reports vary on whether he and his family were properly informed in advance. The scene has now been depicted in a less harrowing manner than originally planned, and there is no nudity in it. Nevertheless, a body double was used to show the boy's pants being tugged slightly down.|$|E

25|$|Pascal {{had another}} auspicious {{encounter}} {{when he was}} young while walking along the shore of the Mediterranean. A much older man, George Bernard Shaw, was swimming naked holding onto a buoy. A conversation ensued and Shaw dared the young Pascal on the shore <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> clothes and join him in the water. He was impressed when Pascal immediately did so, and this began their friendship. Shaw was impressed with Pascal's youthful enthusiasm for art and his bravado and invited him to come visit him one day when he was entirely broke. This chance meeting was {{to play a major role}} in Pascal's later career.|$|E
25|$|Under the Zaydi rule, the Jews were {{considered}} to be impure, and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim's food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by youth, a Jew was not allowed to fight them. In such situations he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.|$|E
25|$|The {{confrontation}} between Konnan and Pierroth Jr. {{was just a}} preview for their match later that night, in the semi-final position of the show. The two faced off in a Dog collar match, which meant that the two were joined together by a long steel chain that was connected to a dog collar {{around the neck of}} each competitor. The collar was then locked to prevent one of the wrestlers from getting out of the collar during the match. At some point Pierroth Jr. either stole the key from the referee, or had a spare key hidden somewhere as he was able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> collar, use the freedom of movement to tie up Konnan and hit him repeatedly with the steel chain. With Konnan down Pierroth Jr. was able to touch the top turnbuckle on all four corners, which was how the match was won.|$|E

He visited the Great Wall, Ming Tombs and the Temple of Heaven, where he felt compelled <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> shoes with holy awe. He left Peking, accompanied by Joseph Edkins, and headed for Shandong by mule cart to visit Jinan, Taishan, where they ascended the sacred Mount Tai, carried by four men on chairs. Leaving Mount Tai on 15 May, they visited Confucius Temple and the Forest of Confucius at Qufu, where he {{climbed to the top}} of Confucius' burial mound.

25|$|In April 1943, the two Jabo {{units were}} amalgamated into Schnellkampfgeschwader 10 (SKG 10) which {{switched}} to night operations over southern England, {{a role in}} which the Fw 190 proved unsuccessful, taking heavy casualties from the de Havilland Mosquito night fighters. On the night of 16/17 April, on this unit's first operation, four Fw 190s which were attempting to attack London, got lost over Kent. Three of them tried to land at RAF West Malling: Yellow H of 7./SKG 10, flown by Feldwebel Otto Bechtold landed and was captured, his Fw 190 later being evaluated by the RAE at Farnborough; another Fw 190 of 5./SKG 10, flown by Leutnant Fritz Sezter landed several minutes later. When Setzer realised he had landed on an enemy airfield and attempted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> <b>his</b> aircraft was destroyed by an armoured car. Setzer surrendered to Wing Commander Peter Townsend. A third Fw 190 undershot the runway and was also destroyed, the pilot escaping with a concussion. The fourth Fw 190 crashed at Staplehurst, killing the pilot.|$|E

500|$|An infamous {{incident}} occurred in Australia's second innings. As Australia were 247 runs {{behind on the}} first innings and forced to follow on, they played for a draw and Brown and Fingleton batted slowly in the second innings. Sections of the crowd heckled his slow batting by using a slow hand clap. Bradman then sent Mervyn Waite out to deliver orders to the openers that they should back away from their positions and hold up proceedings until the barracking stopped. Fingleton {{said that he was}} not perturbed by the crowd but obeyed; umpire Frank Chester and England captain Wally Hammond had no issues with this. At one point, Fingleton theatrically decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> gloves, put down his bat and sit down on the pitch and refusing to resume before the gallery quietened, but this only caused a huge uproar. Wisden later criticised him, saying that he lost [...] "all true sense of the situation...an extraordinary action {{on the part of a}} cricket in a Test match." [...] They regarded the gesture as disrespectful as a majority of the spectators had not heckled him.|$|E
