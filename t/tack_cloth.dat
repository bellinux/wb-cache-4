50|$|<b>Tack</b> <b>cloth</b> (tack rag; tac cloth) is a {{specialized}} type of wiping cloth that is {{treated with a}} tacky material. It is designed to remove loose particles of dust, dirt and lint that would contaminate a surface {{that is to be}} painted, coated, laminated, photo-etched, or otherwise finished.|$|E
5000|$|The cloth {{component}} is most commonly a cotton gauze textile, but the grade and quality can vary greatly. Typical gauze specifications are in weaves of between 29 (commodity) to 44 or more (commercial/professional) yarns per square inch, with the cloth weights, wiping properties and overall cost varying accordingly. Gauze may be bleached and scoured (like medical quality) or unbleached quality that contains more contaminants. A standard {{size of the}} cotton gauze varieties is 18 in. &times; 36 in. in North America (other standards are found in other countries, such as 50 cm &times; 80 cm). Other textiles used in tack cloths are made from continuous filament (non-fibrous) synthetic yarns to eliminate linting or from various non-woven fabrics that can reduce cost. It {{is important to consider}} that the textile type, style, grade, quality and size are the greatest factors in <b>tack</b> <b>cloth</b> cost, and that these variables can differ greatly among <b>tack</b> <b>cloth</b> brands and product designs.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recent decades}} {{researchers}} have developed lint-free <b>tack</b> <b>cloths,</b> made from continuous filament (non-fibrous) synthetic yarns and finished edges (similar to electronics cleanroom wipers, this design is commonly required for paint process in automotive assembly plants). Another innovation has been modification of common <b>tack</b> <b>cloths</b> that are normally electrically resistive {{to perform at}} antistatic levels, defined by independent standards organizations (like ASTM, IEEE, MIL-SPEC, etc.).|$|R
50|$|The tack {{component}} is typically {{a kind of}} resinous material, often a petroleum derivative. The resin system may be solvent-based, water-based, or (more commonly in North America) a hot-melt. Different tack treatment materials, formulations and systems present different advantages or disadvantages. Concerns with different tack treatments {{may be seen in}} the tendencies of some to dry-out or to leave residues from free oils or evaporating solvents, or with liabilities due to content of hazardous air pollutants (HAP's), or in health risk from volatile organic components (VOC's), and in materials that can chemically interfere with paints, 'etc.' Common misnomers for tack treatments are varnish, lacquer, beeswax or other references that do not describe the actual materials in modern commercial <b>tack</b> <b>cloths.</b> Adjuncts may be incorporated into the tack treatments, such as anti-static additives, fire retardants, dyes or other performance-enhancing materials.|$|R
50|$|More recent {{developments}} {{have been made}} in tack treatments that are water-soluble, allowing them to be washed from hands, tools or a surface to reduce the incidence of tack transfer from accumulated resins or to wash the <b>tack</b> from the <b>cloths.</b> They can be recycled like utility wipes. Water-soluble tack also improves antistatic performance, and offers potential for improved compatibility with water-based paints.|$|R
50|$|A {{new type}} of <b>tack</b> <b>cloth</b> has been {{developed}} at the Y-12 National Security Complex, a nuclear weapons plant. Its purpose was to clean up microscopic beryllium particles that posed a health hazard. The inventor, Ron Simandl, also found he could dry-buff the alloy wheels on his car. The stubborn brake and road dirt came right off and left the wheels clean and bright.|$|E
50|$|Irish Crochet Lace is {{made with}} a very fine steel crochet hook and fine crochet cotton or linen thread. It begins with an outline of the pattern {{on a piece of}} cloth. Each motif is then crocheted separately, using cotton cord for volume and shaping. The {{finished}} motifs are then basted (sewn with a loose stitch for temporary <b>tacking)</b> onto a <b>cloth</b> {{in the shape of the}} pattern. The motifs are then joined using chains and picots. When all the motifs have been joined together forming one piece of lace the basting stitch is removed from the back cloth revealing the completed lace.|$|R
