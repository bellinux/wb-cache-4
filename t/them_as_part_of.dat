5|$|Croatia {{first elected}} 12 {{members of the}} European Parliament (MEPs) in a {{by-election}} held after its accession to the EU in 2013. Thereafter, its number of members in the European Parliament was reduced to 11 and the country elected <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the regular election in 2014. The elections are regulated by special legislation enacted by the Sabor. Provisions of the legislation {{are very similar to}} the parliamentary-election legislation, with the main difference being that the 11 members of the European Parliament are elected in a single constituency encompassing all of Croatia, instead of multiple constituencies used in the parliamentary elections.|$|E
5|$|Government {{publications}} on {{the dangers}} of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, {{in large part because of}} public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Islands are a Micronesian island nation, {{located in}} the western Pacific Ocean midway between Hawaii and Australia.

Japan occupied the Islands during World War I and formally annexed <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its postwar South Pacific Mandate. The Marshall Islands were placed under United States control in 1944. The islands granted independence in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association with the United States.|$|E

5|$|The priory prospered {{until the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540, {{when it was}} {{abolished}} along with England's other monastic communities. The priory buildings were demolished and the stone re-used in other buildings in Guisborough. The east end of the priory church was left standing with its great window forming a distinctive arch, a well-known landmark used as a symbol for Guisborough. It {{became part of the}} estate of the Chaloner family, who acquired it in 1550. The east window was preserved by <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a Romantic vista adjoining their seat, Gisborough Hall, from which the priory takes its idiosyncratically spelled name.

5|$|The {{refugees}} needed buildings such as schools, hospitals, warehouses, {{places of}} worship were built for <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the second phase, temporary villages were built and by mid-1955, most of the one million refugees were living in rows of temporary housing settlements, mostly near highways leading out of Saigon, in provinces adjacent to the capital. The largest concentration of housing in this second stage was located {{to the north of}} the capital. Only a minority could be sent to the fertile Mekong Delta, as the area was already overcrowded. It was also restive due to the presence of militant religious sects, so the most of the military evacuees were sent there.|$|E
5|$|After leaving WWE, Moretti {{began working}} in the {{landscaping}} industry. Moretti also worked with her niece to help the pet population affected by Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Moretti volunteered for an organization called Best Friends Animal Society, which is a no-kill animal shelter (a shelter that does not euthanize to control animal populations) in Utah. She also worked with her local animal shelter on San Juan Island in northwestern Washington, where she has resided since 2000. While working at the shelter, she met her eventual business partner Jessica Ray, with whom she opened Downtown Dog in 2007. The facility is an animal daycare, {{as well as a}} training, grooming, and cat boarding company located in Friday Harbor, Washington. In June 2007, they expanded the business to include veterinary care and later the Bow Wow Bus, which takes the dogs on outings. Moretti has taken classes to learn how to groom animals and now grooms <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the business.|$|E

5|$|By August the {{division}} was {{still waiting to}} be deployed, but now plans envisioned using <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a larger force. Operation Transfigure involved {{the division}}, the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, the US 101st Airborne Division, and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade landing at Rambouillet St Arnoult, {{to close the gap}} between Orléans and Paris. Operation Axehead, using the same force, was to seize the bridges over the River Seine in support of 21st Army Group. Operation Boxer, with the same force, was to seize Boulogne and assault V1 flying bomb sites. Near the end of the month, Operation Linnet, with the same units as before, was formulated to seize crossings over the Escaut. Operation Infatuate, drawn up in early September, involved the entire I Airborne Corps landing in Belgium to trap the retreating German armies in the Scheldt estuary, as well as aiming to threaten Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} {{with a more}} experimental ethos until the company began {{to run out of}} capital. The Canadian government loan that had funded Polytron's prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase. They also lost funding from the organization that preceded the Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered canceling the project. In March 2011, the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their own game, Warp. Trapdoor assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game.|$|E
5|$|Flies are {{eaten by}} other animals at {{all stages of}} their development. The eggs and larvae are {{parasitised}} by other insects and are eaten by many creatures, some of which specialise in feeding on flies but most of which consume <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a mixed diet. Birds, bats, frogs, lizards, dragonflies and spiders are among the predators of flies. Many flies have evolved mimetic resemblances that aid their protection. Batesian mimicry is widespread with many hoverflies resembling bees and wasps, ants and some species of tephritid fruit fly resembling spiders. Some species of hoverfly are myrmecophilous, their young live and grow within the nests of ants. They are protected from the ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members. Bombyliid bee flies such as Bombylius major are short-bodied, round, furry, and distinctly bee-like as they visit flowers for nectar, and are likely also Batesian mimics of bees.|$|E

5|$|From the start, one of {{the main}} efforts of the Confederate Navy was to counter the {{blockade}} of its ports by the Union Navy. Mallory believed that by attacking the merchant shipping that carried trade to Northern ports he could force his Union counterpart, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, to divert his own small fleet to defend against the raiders. In {{the early days of the}} war, the Confederacy tried to enlist the services of private shipowners in the service by offering letters of marque and reprisal. Issuance of the letters was not in the purview of the Navy Department, but Mallory was aware of them and saw <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his plan. For several reasons, the privateers did not have the success that was hoped for. Although they ventured out throughout the war, they had only fleeting success, and that had ceased by the end of the first year.|$|E
5|$|Rudd was {{offering}} generous terms that few competitors {{could hope to}} even come close to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini–Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he {{had at the time}} between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the proposed agreement nonetheless.|$|E
5|$|Rupert's Land was ceded to Canada by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869 and {{incorporated}} into the Northwest Territories; a {{lack of attention to}} Métis concerns caused Métis leader Louis Riel to establish a local provisional government as part of the Red River Rebellion. In response, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald introduced the Manitoba Act in the Canadian House of Commons, the bill was given Royal Assent and Manitoba was brought into Canada as a province in 1870. Louis Riel was pursued by British army officer Garnet Wolseley because of the rebellion, and Riel fled into exile. The Canadian government blocked the Métis' attempts to obtain land promised to <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Manitoba's entry into confederation.

5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 has {{received}} universal acclaim from modern critics who consider the title {{to be one}} of the best games of all time. Edge considered Super Mario Bros. 3 Nintendo's standout title of 1989, and commented that its success outshone the first Super Mario Bros.s sales milestone; the first title sold 40million copies but was bundled with the NES. They lauded the overworld map as an elegant alternative to a menu to select levels. Allgame's Skyler Miller praised the game's level design, graphics, music, and nonlinearity. Dengeki referred to the game as a popular title and expressed excitement over its re-release on the Game Boy Advance system. The items hidden in the game's levels, such as the warp whistles, were well-received: Rignall regarded <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the game's addictiveness, and Sheff stated that finding them provided a sense of satisfaction. Both Screw Attack and GamesRadar ranked it the best NES game made. GamesRadar claimed that while Super Mario Bros. defined its genre, Super Mario Bros. 3 perfected it.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} border {{conflicts}} between Colombia and Peru {{in the early}} part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the Salomón-Lozano Treaty in an attempt to resolve <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> this treaty, the border town of Leticia and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the Amazon River. On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land as a result organised an armed takeover of Leticia. At first, the Peruvian government did not recognise the military takeover, but President of Peru Luis Sánchez Cerro decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The Peruvian Army occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations. After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded. In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and Putumayo Rivers, and a pledge of non-aggression.|$|E
