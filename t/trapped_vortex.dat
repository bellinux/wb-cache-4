40|$|Passive {{and active}} control {{studies have been}} {{conducted}} to investigate the feasibility of stabilising a <b>trapped</b> <b>vortex.</b> Passive stabilisation is achieved using distributed steady wall suction. An enhanced aerodynamic performance with lower drag and higher lift has been achieved as a result of passive stabilisation, but only up to moderate suction rates. When the <b>trapped</b> <b>vortex</b> is stabilised, vortex shedding is completely suppressed and flow unsteadiness is significantly reduced. Compared with steady suction, pulsed suction reduces the required suction rate for stabilisation by over 50 % at an optimum pulsing frequency. Using slow suction reduction from a stable state, savings in mean suction are also possible provided the rate of suction reduction is small enough. It appears, however, that such reduction is dependent on the specific shape of the aerofoil’s cavity. A bifurcation analysis has shown that the loss of stability of a <b>trapped</b> <b>vortex,</b> from a stable state to unstable cortex shedding, is also dependent on the cavity configuration. A linear feedback controller with an optimum gain G extends the slow suction reduction results by achieving stabilisation at a reduced mean suction compared with passive stabilisation. Using DVM’s ability to simulate unsteady suction and blowing, active stabilisation using vorticity flux control achieves 16 % reduction in mean flow rate compared with linear control and 19 % compared with passive stabilisation. The pulsed suction technique remains the most efficient method of stabilisation. Simplified power calculations have shown suction control to be effective but only within a small range of suction rates.

In the simulations, the large eddy simulation (LES) was used to predicate the transient flow field in the cavity. Simulation results showed that the core of the <b>trapped</b> <b>vortex</b> {{was in the middle of}} the cavity at Hf/L = 0. 8, and the velocity profile of the vortex was better organized than those of other combustors with different Hf/L ratios. Moreover, the simulated period of vortex swirling was the shortest at Hf/L = 0. 8.

40|$|Abstract. During {{helicopter}} forward flight, {{the retreating}} blade revolves at high {{angle of attack}} compared to advancing blade in order to balance the lift and also to stabilise the helicopter. However, due to the aerodynamics limitations of the retreating blade at forward flight, stall may occur at high angle of attack compared with the advancing blade. This phenomenon is dangerous for pilot when controlling and balancing the helicopter while flying against strong wind. This paper investigates the capabilities of introducing multiple <b>vortex</b> <b>traps</b> on the upper surface of the helicopter airfoil in order to delay the stall angle of retreating helicopter blade. Blade Element Theory (BET) was applied to scrutinize the lift force along the helicopter blade. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analyses using the Shear-Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model was carried out to investigate the effect of groove on delaying the stall and to predict the separation of flow over the airfoil.
