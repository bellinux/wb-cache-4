5|$|The {{balance of}} {{payments}} accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries.

The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper tackles {{the problem}} of {{composition}} of <b>transaction</b> services, which are governed by various <b>transaction</b> standards. Among others, we can cite the Object <b>Transaction</b> Service, Java <b>Transaction</b> Service, or Web Services Atomic <b>Transaction.</b> However, the Web Services Atomic <b>Transaction</b> standard encloses legacy <b>transaction</b> standards to support the Web Services application platform. This encapsulation introduces an additional complexity to the system and hides the specificities of legacy <b>transaction</b> standards. When composing heterogeneous legacy applications, the underlying <b>transaction</b> services are basically not composed transparently. This paper presents an approach to build an Adapted <b>Transaction</b> Service, named ATS, which supports several <b>transaction</b> standards concurrently. The objective of ATS is to facilitate the <b>transaction</b> standards composition. To introduce ATS we detail how the Object <b>Transaction</b> Service, Web Services Atomic <b>Transaction,</b> and Java <b>Transaction</b> Service standards can be composed. Besides, an ATS implementation is introduced using the GoTM framework. We show that this fine-grained component-based approach does not introduce an additional overhead to legacy applications and supports well scalability. Moreover, this approach can be extended to other standards...|$|R

40|$|Previous alliancing {{research}} has seldom addressed {{the implication of}} <b>transaction</b> costs {{and the impact of}} <b>transaction</b> attributes on <b>transaction</b> costs in project alliancing. Using multiple regression analysis on a sample of Australian alliances, this study tests the differential impact of uncertainty, frequency, and various dimensions of contracting parties&# 039; asset specificity on three individual <b>transaction</b> cost elements (set-up, monitoring, and enforcement costs). The results indicate that the impact of <b>transaction</b> attributes on <b>transaction</b> costs varies. Uncertainty has a positive impact on all three <b>transaction</b> cost elements. Frequency and some dimensions of contracting parties&# 039; asset specificity are positively associated with set-up costs and monitoring costs, which, however, does not apply to enforcement costs. The findings provide empirical evidence in support of the <b>transaction</b> cost economics&# 039; prediction regarding the influence of <b>transaction</b> attributes on <b>transaction</b> costs in the Australian construction industry, and thereby add another perspective to the knowledge base in the construction management discipline.

40|$|In this {{conceptual}} paper, {{we argue}} that the organizational focus on <b>transaction</b> costs needs to be balanced by an attention to <b>transaction</b> benefits, both at the individual and organizational levels. To the <b>transaction</b> characteristics suggested by <b>transaction</b> costs economics, we add four additional ones likely to foster <b>transaction</b> benefits: intensity of knowledge, segmentation of knowledge, dispersion of knowledge, and scarcity of knowledge. The need to maximize <b>transaction</b> benefits while minimizing <b>transaction</b> costs results in the mixing of governance structures, where two (or more) “pure” governance structures are combined. We create {{a model of the}} relationships between <b>transaction</b> characteristics, mix of governance structures, <b>transaction</b> costs and benefits, and information systems; from an instantiated version of this general model, we elaborate four propositions. Moreover, with two “real world ” examples (Google and JBoss), we illustrate the existence of the proposed <b>transaction</b> characteristics and mixed governance structures. We conclude by discussing how information systems generate opportunities for creating <b>transaction</b> benefits...|$|R
