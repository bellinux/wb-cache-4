500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I beg you will let me see you {{as often as you}} can", pleaded Churchill in a letter to Sarah Jennings, [...] "which I am sure you ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> care for my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E
500|$|... "Skyfall" [...] is an orchestral pop {{song with}} a {{duration}} of four minutes and forty-six seconds [...] Epworth stated that although [...] "Skyfall" [...] is an original composition, he and Adele had worked to capture [...] "the James Bond feeling" [...] of previous theme songs. The song intentionally references Monty Norman's [...] "James Bond Theme" [...] after the first chorus. Norman said that the song had his seal of approval and that including the leitmotif he wrote for the Bond character was [...] "a pretty sensible thing <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to feel the 'James Bond quality' of the music". Epworth said that while [...] "Skyfall" [...] was his first experience writing film music, he had been involved with the production of James Bond music before: while Epworth was a tape operator at AIR Studios, he recorded some film soundtracks including David Arnold's Tomorrow Never Dies.|$|E
500|$|At a basic level, {{the entries}} in Harris's List detail each woman's age, her {{physical}} appearance (including {{the size of}} her breasts), her sexual specialities, and sometimes a description of her genitals. [...] Additional information such as how long she had been active as a prostitute, or if she sang, danced or conversed well, is also included. [...] Addresses and prices, which range from five shillings to five pounds, are provided. [...] The types of prostitute the lists present vary from [...] "low-born errant drabs", to prominent courtesans like Kitty Fisher and Fanny Murray; later editions contain only [...] "genteel mannered prostitutes worthy of praise". [...] The charms of a Mrs Dodd, who lived at number six Hind Court in Fleet Street, were listed in 1788 as [...] "reared on two pillars of monumental alabaster", continuing: [...] "the symmetry of its parts, its borders enriched with wavering tendrils, its ruby portals, and the tufted grove, that crowns the summit of the mount, all join to invite the guest to enter." [...] In the same edition, a similarly lurid description precedes the latter part of Miss Davenport's entry, which concludes: [...] "Her teeth are remarkably fine; she is tall, and so well proportioned (when you examine her whole naked figure, which she will permit you <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> perform the Cytherean Rites like an able priest) that she might be taken for a fourth Grace, or a breathing animated Venus de Medicis... she has a keeper (a Mr. Hannah) both kind and liberal; notwithstanding which, she has no objection to two supernumerary guineas." [...] Miss Clicamp, of number two York Street near Middlesex Hospital, is described as [...] "one of the finest, fattest figures as fully finished for fun and frolick as fertile fancy ever formed... fortunate for the true lovers of fat, should fate throw them into the possession of such full grown beauties." [...] More characteristic of Harris's List though, is the 1764 entry for Miss Wilmot, which tells of an amorous encounter with King George III's brother, the Duke of York: ...|$|E
