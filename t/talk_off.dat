6000|$|... "It is {{in working}} within limits that the master reveals himself," [...] and the limitation, the very {{condition}} of any art is style. However, {{we need not}} linger any longer over Shakespeare's realism. The Tempest is the most perfect of palinodes. All that we desired to point out was, that the magnificent work of the Elizabethan and Jacobean artists contained within itself the seeds of its own dissolution, and that, if it drew some of its strength from using life as rough material, it drew all its weakness from using life as an artistic method. As the inevitable result of this substitution of an imitative for a creative medium, this surrender of an imaginative form, we have the modern English melodrama. The characters in these plays talk on the stage exactly as they would <b>talk</b> <b>off</b> it; they have neither aspirations nor aspirates; they are taken directly from life and reproduce its vulgarity down to the smallest detail; they present the gait, manner, costume and accent of real people; they would pass unnoticed in a third-class railway carriage. And yet how wearisome the plays are! They do not succeed in producing even that impression of reality at which they aim, and which is their only reason for existing. As a method, realism is a complete failure.|$|E
5000|$|Liz and her {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{meet with}} The Girlie Show new network executive Jack Donaghy. Jack tells Liz and Pete {{that he has}} been sent to 30 Rock to re-tool The Girlie Show. After he inadvertently insults her, Liz takes an initial dislike to Jack. Jack asks Liz to hire Tracy Jordan, star of the film Honky Grandma Be Trippin, as part of the cast. Liz is skeptical as Tracy has a history of problematic behaviour, including running down Interstate 405 in his underwear while shouting [...] "I am a Jedi!" [...] and falling asleep on his neighbor's roof. In comparison to Liz, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), the narcissistic star of The Girlie Show, takes to Jack upon their first meeting. She begins to worry when she hears that Tracy may become the new star of the show. Against her own judgment, Liz meets Tracy at a restaurant, but when Tracy discovers that he does not like the food they go to another restaurant. While Liz tried to convince Tracy not to join The Girlie Show, he discusses conspiracy theories. After the meeting, Tracy offers to take Liz back to the studio, but he makes a detour to a strip club in the Bronx. While trying to get home, Liz learns that Jack fired Pete earlier that day.

40|$|Windshear is {{the sudden}} {{change of wind}} speed and/or direction. Many of the {{aviation}} accidents {{in the past few}} decades were related to occurrence of windshear near the airport. In particular, windshear events associated with the passage of a strong gust front or the occurrence of severe microbursts (strong sudden downdrafts) near the runway are particularly hazardous to aircrafts landing or <b>talking</b> <b>off.</b> In the present study, based on idealized and actual wind observations near an international airport, a mathematical model will be used to analysis and distinguish different types of windshear along the runway. Different headwind, tailwind and cross wind situations can be visualized using this model. An alert system can be made from this result. Idealized and real cases will be used to demonstrate the usefulness of this model...|$|R
