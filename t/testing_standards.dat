25|$|If GFHS missed AYP in the 2011–2012 school year, the {{restructuring}} plan {{was supposed to be}} implemented in the 2012–2013 school year. The Montana Office of Public Instruction said on August 4 that the school missed AYP for the 2010–2011 school year. However, in August 2011 the state sought and received a waiver from the U.S. Department of Education which kept <b>testing</b> <b>standards</b> static for the 2010–2011 school year rather than raising them, which allowed hundreds of schools across the state to meet AYP. This did not affect Great Falls High school, however. The school had until September 13, 2011, to appeal its AYP test scores and meet AYP.|$|E
25|$|Vermont {{was named}} the nation's smartest state in 2005 and 2006. In 2006 there was a gap between state <b>testing</b> <b>{{standards}}</b> and national, which is biased {{in favor of the}} state standards by 30%, on average. This puts Vermont 11th-best in the nation. Most states have a higher bias. However, when allowance for race is considered, a 2007 US Government list of test scores shows Vermont white fourth graders performed 25th in the nation for reading (229), 26th for math (247). White eighth graders scored 18th for math (292) and 12th for reading (273). The first three scores were not considered statistically different from average. White eighth graders scored significantly above average in reading. Statistics for black students were not reliable because of their small representation in the testing.|$|E

25|$|In addition, NIOSH {{researchers}} are pursuing {{a line of}} research related to ambulance safety. In the U.S., an ambulance {{may be one of}} a number of vehicle body types, and there are no comprehensive safety standards that specify requirements for safety and crashworthiness. Of special concern is the safety of workers in the ambulance patient compartment, where work tasks are not compatible with the use of occupant restraints and where equipment and interior layout put workers at high risk of injury in the event of a crash. Sled and crash tests of ambulances conducted by NIOSH and partners show that retrofitting patient compartments with redesigned occupant restraints will allow EMS workers the level of mobility needed to care for patients and at the same time afford greater protection from injury than standard lap belts. NIOSH work in this area has led to development of new voluntary standards for crash-testing of ambulances. The research program has now expanded to address the full range of human-factors concerns about worker safety in ambulance patient compartment, with a number of other manufacturing standards and <b>testing</b> <b>standards</b> in progress.|$|E

500|$|The Pinto's design {{positioned}} its {{fuel tank}} between the rear axle and the rear bumper, a standard practice in US subcompact cars at the time. The Pinto's vulnerability to fuel leakage and {{fire in a}} rear-end collision was exacerbated by reduced rear [...] "crush space", a lack of structural reinforcement in the rear, and an [...] "essentially ornamental" [...] rear bumper (though similar to other manufacturers). [...] Crash testing, conducted in 1970 with modified Ford Mavericks, {{as part of a}} response to NHTSA proposed regulations, demonstrated vulnerability at fairly low crash speeds. [...] Design changes were made, but post launch tests showed similar results. These tests were conducted to develop crash <b>testing</b> <b>standards</b> rather than specifically investigating fuel system integrity.

40|$|The {{blast wave}} emanating from an {{explosion}} produces an almost instantaneous rise in pressure which can then cause Blast Overpressure (BOP) injuries to nearby persons. BOP injury criteria are specified in <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> to relate BOP measurements in a testing environment to {{a risk of}} BOP injury. This study considered the adequacy of <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> in evaluating BOP protection concepts for the torso. Four potential BOP injury scenarios were studied to determine the likelihood of injury and the adequacy of <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> for appropriate protection concepts. In the case of vehicle blast, BOP injury is unlikely and <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> are adequate. In the scenario involving an explosive charge detonated within a vehicle, and the close proximity to a hand grenade scenario, <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> are not available. The demining scenario was identified as of importance as <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> are available, but do not mandate the evaluation of BOP protection. A prototype South African Torso Surrogate (SATS) was developed to explore this scenario further. The SATS was required to be relatively inexpensive and robust. The SATS was cast from silicone (selected to represent body tissue characteristics) using a torso mould containing a steel frame and instrumented with chest face-on pressure transducer and accelerometer. The SATS was subjected to an Anti-Personnel (AP) mine test and the Chest Wall Velocity Predictor and Viscous Criterion were used to predict that BOP injuries would occur in a typical demining scenario. This result was confirmed by applying the injury criteria to empirical blast predictions from the Blast Effects Calculator Version 4 (BECV 4). Although limitations exist {{in the ability of}} injury criteria and measurement methods to accurately predict BOP injuries, generally a conservative approach should be taken. Thus, it is recommended that the risk of BOP injuries should be evaluated in demining personal protective equipment <b>test</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R

Test standards and guidelines are necessary to ensure best practices, minimize and bound systematic and random errors, and to ensure comparable results from different testers and vendors. Test standards are by their nature static but exist in a dynamic environment of advancing technology and radiation effects research. New technologies, failure mechanisms, and advancement in our understanding of known failure mechanisms drive the revision or development of <b>test</b> <b>standards.</b> Changes to standards must be weighed against their impact on cost and existing part qualifications.

The complexity of some new technologies exceeds the scope of existing <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> and may require development of a guideline specific to the technology.

500|$|Airbus {{intended}} the A330 {{to compete in}} the Extended-range Twin-engine Operation Performance Standards (ETOPS) market, specifically with the Boeing 767. (ETOPS is a standard that allows longer range flights away from a diversion airport for aircraft that have met special design and <b>testing</b> <b>standards.)</b> Instead of the [...] "ETOPS out of the box" [...] or [...] "Early ETOPS" [...] approach taken by Boeing with its 777, Airbus gradually increased ETOPS approval on the A330 using in-service experience. [...] Airbus suggested that the A340 and A330 were essentially identical except for their engine number, and that the A340's experience could be applied to the A330's ETOPS approval. [...] The plans were for all three engine types to enter service with 90-minute approval, before increasing to 120 minutes after the total A330 fleet accumulated 25,000 flight hours, and then to 180 minutes after 50,000 flight hours, in 1995. Aer Lingus and Cathay Pacific were two important airlines assisting Airbus in this endeavour by building up in-service flight hours on over-ocean flights. In November 2009, the A330 became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS–240 approval, which has since been offered by Airbus as an option.|$|E
