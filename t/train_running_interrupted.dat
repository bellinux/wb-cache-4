40|$|Making use of {{long-term}} transverse vibration monitoring data of DaShengGuan Bridge, the early-warning method of <b>train</b> <b>running</b> {{safety of the}} high-speed railway bridge is established by adopting principal component analysis (PCA) method. Firstly, the root mean square (RMS) of the transverse acceleration of the main girder is used as the monitoring parameter for the <b>train</b> <b>running</b> safety. The correlation model between the RMS values measured from different positions is further adopted as the evaluating model for the <b>train</b> <b>running</b> safety. Finally, {{the effects of the}} environmental changes on the evaluating model are eliminated using the PCA method and the warning index for the <b>train</b> <b>running</b> safety is further constructed. The analysis results show that the correlation between the RMS values of the accelerations from different measuring positions on the main girder can be analyzed by a quadratic polynomial fitting model. The PCA method can effectively remove the environmental effects on the quadratic polynomial fitting model. The proposed warning method provides a good capability for detecting the abnormal changes of the measured transverse accelerations and hence it is suitable for early-warning of the <b>train</b> <b>running</b> safety...|$|R
