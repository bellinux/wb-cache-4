40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is {{the process}} of {{introducing}} foreign genomic materials into host cells to elicit a therapeutic benefit. Although initially the main focus of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> was on special genetic disorders, now diverse diseases with different patterns of inheritance and acquired diseases are targets of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> There are 2 major categories of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy,</b> including germline <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> and somatic <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> Although germline <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> may have great potential, because it is currently ethically forbidden, it cannot be used; however, to date human <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> has been limited to somatic cells. Although numerous viral and nonviral gene delivery systems have been developed in the last 3 decades, no delivery system has been designed that can be applied in <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> of all kinds of cell types in vitro and in vivo with no limitation and side effects.
