50|$|The {{original}} runway {{built in}} 1998 required complete reconstruction in 2011 {{following the discovery}} of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in the Portland cement concrete runway. Since the runway was the only landing surface at the airport, an <b>alternate</b> <b>temporary</b> runway was necessary to maintain service during the main runway's reconstruction. Stimulus funds of $9 million ($ million in today's dollars) from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) allowed XNA to accelerate the alternative runway construction project. Upon completion of the alternate runway in 2012, all aircraft operations were shifted to the new surface and demolition and replacement of the primary runway began.|$|R
40|$|The {{human brain}} may be {{regarded}} as an irreversible system which is constrained by a fixed inflow of free {{energy in the form}} of chemical nourishment from within the body and information from the environment. The evolution of the internal spontaneous process may be described as a path on the saddle surface of entropy production rate in the configuration space of the process variables. From any initial state of high entropy production the system evolves towards the saddle point by a series of regessions to <b>temporary</b> minima <b>alternating</b> with fluctuations which introduce new internal constraints and open new channels for regression. The spontaneous regression steps of the process are {{to be associated with the}} learning process and the deductive processes of thought since information is necessarily being stored, whereas the fluctuation or nucleation steps are to be associated with the inductive or creative part of the thought process. The state of consciousness is to be associated with the system undergoing regression. If, under certain boundary conditions, the system attains the stable saddle point, a state of unconsciousness is attained in which no change of state variables occurs in time. The stability of this state is indicated by its resistance to perturbation...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the period which influenced The Theatre on Dlouha Street and its activities for more than one year. The period under consideration starts on 14 th of August 2002, when the theatre building was flooded due to the damaged sewerage, and ends by a gala re-opening evening of The Theatre on Dlouha Street after a general reconstruction on 24 th October 2003. This work aims at summarizing information and data which refer to and describe the way of solving the crisis situation. I tried to focus on every aspect of the theatre activities which were influenced by the floods. That?s why therefore I dwell on the first moments and salvage operations immediately after the floods, the alternate crisis plan for staging, the bill of damages and costs of reparations, conditions of <b>temporary</b> playing in <b>alternate</b> spaces in other theatres where The Theatre on Dlouha Street moved, the way the tickets were sold, financial resources for the theatre and the theatre building reconstruction...|$|R

50|$|In 1915, the Oroville-Quincy Highway was {{designated}} as Legislative Route Number 30. This route was {{abandoned by the}} state in 1924. In the late 1930s, there was a <b>temporary</b> routing of <b>Alternate</b> US 40 that ran from Davis through Yuba City to Oroville thence to Quincy along Oroville-Quincy Highway, and Bucks Lake Road. The Oroville-Quincy Highway begins in Oroville at Oro-Dam Blvd E just past Olive Highway and runs east. It continues east roughly paralleling Olive Highway until it merges with SR 162 just before Oakvale Ave. It breaks off from SR 162 at Wally B Lane running parallel to the highway for {{a mile or so}} before reconnecting at Kelly Ridge Road. The highway runs roughly north and crosses Lake Oroville over the Bidwell Bar Bridge. SR 162 ends near here at Foreman Creek Road, but the Oroville-Quincy Highway continues toward Berry Creek and Madrone Lake. Here it turns east again and runs 6½ miles to Brush Creek. From Brush Creek, the highway turns north for 12½ miles to Palmetto. Here the highway turns ENE 11 mi to Buck's Lodge and Bucks Lake. It then goes 16¼ east along Bucks Lake Road past Meadow Valley and Spanish Ranch before arriving at Quincy, a total distance of 62¾ miles.|$|R

Through a broad {{critical}} {{discussion of}} prejudices and incongruities embedded in mainstream ELT practice, this presentation documents {{the implementation of}} two reflective awareness-raising strategies concerning language use with mixed-ability English learners at a Japanese university. Framed against a departmental policy of ‘English-only’, the author introduced 43 learners to an <b>alternate</b> <b>temporary</b> guideline of ‘English-mainly’, motivated {{by a desire to}} focus on the promotion and maintenance of language rights and responsibilities, rather than language obligations or prohibitions. During the subsequent two-week period, the learners were presented with two different strategies for individual language choice reflection and exploration. The two strategies were primarily designed with the intention of assisting learners in identifying the optimal combination of L 1 and L 2 use within their daily language-learning environment. The strategies also sought to train learners {{to be able to make}} more autonomous language choices when working collaboratively, and to develop a humanistic understanding of why the use of the L 1 may at times, be necessary in the L 2 learning process. Learner reflections indicated that the strategies introduced were positively evaluated and were successful in terms of achieving the aforementioned aims. In addition, a number of important roles were identified for the L 1...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} paper that {{analyses}} the labour market assimilation of foreign (i. e. non-citizen) workers in Italy. It considers the daily wages and the days of employment of male workers in WHIP, a matched employer-employee panel dataset, from 1990 - 2003. The traditional human capital approach is augmented by a control for the probability of staying abroad, modelled by aggregate variables of the origin country. The human capital variables considered are age and experience, {{both in and out}} of employment. What emerges from the empirical analysis is discouraging. Foreigners who are able to get higher wages are the least likely to stay, but assimilation profiles do not change when return migration is taken into account. Foreigners employed in the private sector earn the same wages as natives upon entrance into employment, but the two wage profiles diverge with on-the-job experience. Neither do foreigners assimilate from an employment perspective: a differential in employment between foreign and native workers is found even upon entrance, which increases over time. In the construction sector the wage and employment differential is even larger, while manufacturing and services follow the aggregate trend. Africans immigrants have the fewest career prospects while Eastern European and Asian workers are less far behind. The general pattern for foreign workers appears to be a fragmented career either being confined to seasonal or <b>temporary</b> jobs or <b>alternating</b> between legal and illegal employment.

50|$|MSG is {{available}} on most cable providers in Upstate New York. Rangers, Devils and Islanders games are blacked out in the primary broadcast territory of the Buffalo Sabres - the Buffalo, Rochester and Albany Capital District television markets. However, Knicks games are broadcast on Spectrum Sports or a <b>temporary</b> <b>alternate</b> channel {{when there is a}} conflict with the Sabres - except in Chautauqua County, part of which is within 100 mi of Cleveland, in the market area of the Cleveland Cavaliers, which broadcast rights with Fox Sports Ohio (as per NBA rules, only games from that team are receivable in that area). The Knicks are also subject to blackout rules in the eastern-most areas of Connecticut, within 100 mi of Boston. However, Knicks games are not blacked out in favor of the Toronto Raptors in most of Erie (including Buffalo) and Niagara Counties, a territory located within the 100 mi radius of Toronto. This is most likely because the Raptors' exclusive territory ends at the U.S. border, although select games did air on the Empire Sports Network during its existence and CBC Sports programming is usually not blacked out by U.S. cable operators offering a CBC station.|$|E

5000|$|By 1947, present Interstate 70 across Pennsylvania was {{included}} in the planned Interstate Highway System. The route from West Virginia split at Washington, with one branch heading northeast to meet the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Pittsburgh and the other heading east, bypassing Pittsburgh to the south (via a planned bypass of Pennsylvania Route 71) to the New Stanton interchange. The piece south from the Breezewood interchange into Maryland was also in the network. The route between US 30 in Breezewood and US 522 in Warfordsburg was originally known as Pennsylvania Route 126. In 1957, preliminary numbers were assigned; the longer route via Pittsburgh (now Interstate 79 and Interstate 376) became the main line of I-70, while the southern bypass (now I-70) became Interstate 70S. The section of present-day I-70 between PA 519 near Washington and New Stanton was built as a four-lane divided highway known as the [...] "Express Highway"; this road was assigned the <b>temporary</b> PA 71 <b>Alternate</b> designation in 1957 and would be designated as I-70S following the completion of additional connecting roads in the Interstate Highway System. On July 15, 1960, I-70 was designated onto the Penn-Lincoln Parkway. A southern extension of Interstate 79 (which had previously only run from Erie south to Pittsburgh) to Charleston, West Virginia in 1963 resulted in changes to I-70. On February 26, 1964, as part of the formation of Interstate 76 (east of downtown Pittsburgh), AASHTO approved a rerouting of I-70 along I-70S. The former I-70 became I-79 from Washington to downtown Pittsburgh and I-76 to and along the Turnpike to New Stanton. This brought the routing of I-70 to its present form.|$|R
