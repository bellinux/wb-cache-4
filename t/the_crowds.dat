5|$|By midday, <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> {{returned}} around St. Philip Neri's Church. General George Cadwalader ordered <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> to disperse, {{but they}} did not. By the evening, the sheriff had arrived with a 150-strong posse. Throughout the evening, the military presence grew, and three cannons were stationed on the streets. The soldiers cleared the streets near the church, despite being pelted with rocks by the mob. In response to the rock throwers, General Cadwalader ordered a cannon to be fired at the crowd on Third Street. A man named Charles Naylor begged the general not to fire; he and several others were arrested and held within the church. By the morning of July 7, most of the soldiers had left, but <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> returned, being led by an alderman and the sheriff, and demanded that the remaining guard release Naylor. Everyone except Naylor was released. <b>The</b> <b>crowds</b> grew, and a cannon was brought from a nearby wharf and used to threaten the church. After further negotiations, Naylor was released and carried home to cheers on people's shoulders.|$|E

Soldiers arrive and demand <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> to disperse; when <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> hold their ground, the soldiers begin firing at them. Reza rushes to Ali, who has been shot, and bandages his wound. Babak and Bibi help move Ali away from the commotion and into an alley, where they find Hossein.

40|$|Exposure to {{crowding}} {{is said to}} be aversive, {{yet people}} also seek out and enjoy crowded situations. We surveyed participants at two crowd events to test the prediction of self-categorization theory that variable emotional responses to crowding are a function of social identification with <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> In data collected from participants who attended a crowded outdoor music event (n = 48), identification with <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> predicted feeling less crowded; and there was an indirect effect of identification with <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> on positive emotion through feeling less <b>crowded.</b> Identification with <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> also moderated <b>the</b> relation between feeling less crowded and positive emotion. In data collected at a demonstration march (n = 112), identification with <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> predicted central (most dense) location in the crowd; and there was an indirect effect of identification with <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> on positive emotion through central location in <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Positive emotion in <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> also increased over the duration of <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> event.

40|$|Abstract The {{problem of}} “approximating <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> ” {{is that of}} {{estimating}} <b>the</b> <b>crowd’s</b> majority opinion by querying only a subset of it. Algorithms that approximate <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> can intelligently stretch a limited budget for a crowd-sourcing task. We present an algorithm, “CrowdSense, ” that works in an online fashion where items come one at a time. CrowdSense dynamically samples sub-sets of <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> based on an exploration/exploitation criterion. The algorithm produces a weighted combination of the subset’s votes that approximates <b>the</b> <b>crowd’s</b> opinion. We then introduce two variations of CrowdSense that make various distributional approximations to handle distinct crowd characteristics. In particular, the first algorithm makes a statistical independence approxi-mation of the labelers for large <b>crowds,</b> whereas <b>the</b> second algorithm finds a lower bound on how often the current sub-crowd agrees with <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> major-ity vote. Our experiments on CrowdSense and several baselines demonstrate that we can reliably approximate <b>the</b> entire <b>crowd’s</b> vote by collecting opinions from a representative subset of <b>the</b> <b>crowd...</b>|$|R
5000|$|By 9, Mayor James Frink {{had made}} the {{decision}} to read the Riot Act to <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> which ignored him. The local police immediately requested backup {{in the form of a}} detachment of the Royal Canadian Dragoons, who charged <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> on horseback, beating <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> with their ceremonial swords. Again, <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> repulsed this attack, with injuries among <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and dragoons both, with the Globe later referring to the attack as [...] "vicious". Incensed, <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> overturned nearby trolley cars, then proceeded to the headquarters of the St. John Railway Company, smashing windows and shutting down the city's electrical generators. <b>The</b> emboldened <b>crowd</b> advanced to <b>the</b> car sheds to set fire to them, but were driven off by armed Pinkerton and Thiel strikebreakers, who fired on <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Meanwhile, <b>the</b> mayor called up five hundred militiamen who stood guard overnight, though by then <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> had dispersed. By evening, however, crowds had reappeared and hampered trolley services from operating again, with stones and other projectiles thrown and the non-union trolley crews abandoning their cars to be towed back to their car barns under militia protection.|$|R
5|$|Corder {{was taken}} back to Suffolk where he was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> that had gathered around the door.|$|E
5|$|Crowds {{gathered}} at four {{different points in}} the city, and along the route it was believed the soldiers would take in order to embark on their trains. Mayor Ferdinand Latrobe issued a proclamation, reciting the riot act and ordering <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> to disperse, but to no effect.

5|$|De Launay {{had limited}} options: if he allowed the Revolutionaries to destroy his main gate, {{he would have}} to turn the cannon {{directly}} inside the Bastille's courtyard on <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> causing great loss of life and preventing any peaceful resolution of the episode. De Launay could not withstand a long siege, and he was dissuaded by his officers from committing mass suicide by detonating his supplies of powder. Instead, de Launay attempted to negotiate a surrender, threatening to blow up the Bastille if his demands were not met. In the midst of this attempt, the Bastille's drawbridge suddenly came down and the revolutionary crowd stormed in. De Launay was dragged outside into the streets and killed by the crowd, and three officers and three soldiers were killed {{during the course of the}} afternoon by the crowd. The soldiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment, however, were not wearing their uniform coats and were mistaken for Bastille prisoners; they were left unharmed by <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> until they were escorted away by French Guards and other regular soldiers among the attackers. The valuable powder and guns were seized and a search begun for the other prisoners in the Bastille.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides a}} microscopic {{experimental study of}} pedestrian motion {{in front of the}} bottleneck. Identification of individual pedestrians in conducted experiments enables to explain the high variance of travel time by heterogeneity of <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Some pedestrians are able to push effectively through <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> some get trapped in <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> for significantly longer time. This ability to push through <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> is associated with the slope of individual linear model of the dependency of the travel time on the number of pedestrians in front of the bottleneck. Further detailed study of the origin of such ability is carried out by means of the route choice, i. e. strategy whether to bypass <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> or to walk directly through it. The study has revealed that the ability to push through <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> is a combination of aggressiveness in conflicts and willingness to overtake <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Comment: To appear in Transportmetrica A: [URL]...|$|R

Although the barristers on both sides were noted for their skill the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty.

Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington represented Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg.
