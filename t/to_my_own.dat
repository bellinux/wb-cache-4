5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
5|$|Some {{say that}} {{nothing could be more}} desperate than the measure, but I answer that the state of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E

25|$|In his {{references}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> work, Gould includes {{at least}} nine citations that involve {{more than just an}} expression of Gould's opinion; in these citations Gould purportedly paraphrases my views. Yet in eight of the nine cases, Gould's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured. Nonspecialists could {{have no way of knowing}} any of this without reading the cited sources. While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears Gould's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.|$|E

500|$|During her {{travels in}} China, Wong {{continued}} to be strongly criticized by the Nationalist government and the film community. She had difficulty communicating {{in many areas of}} China because she was raised with the Taishan dialect rather than Mandarin.

In an interview in 2014, Heinz Prüller recalled Rindt speaking about Indianapolis in 1967: [...] "In Indianapolis, I always feel like I am on my way <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> funeral."

500|$|Shackleton's February 1907 {{announcement}} {{that he intended}} to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. [...] "I feel I have a sort of right <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> field of work," [...] he wrote, adding: [...] "anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.|$|E

It's not like I'm trying to sing about their experiences. I was more learning from what I saw and applying it <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> life, lyrically. I'm not trying to tell other people's stories. We're just trying to allow an experience to change you." ...|$|E

500|$|Plath and Hughes {{traveled}} across Canada and the United States, {{staying at}} the Yaddo artist colony in Saratoga Springs, New York State in late 1959. Plath says that {{it was here that}} she learned [...] "to be true <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> weirdnesses", but she remained anxious about writing confessionally, from deeply personal and private material. The couple moved back to England in December 1959 and lived in London at 3 Chalcot Square, near the Primrose Hill area of Regent's Park, where an English Heritage plaque records Plath's residence. Their daughter Frieda was born on April 1, 1960, and in October, Plath published her first collection of poetry, The Colossus.|$|E
500|$|Ornstein's {{follow-up}} performance {{provoked a}} near-riot: [...] "At my second concert, devoted <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> compositions, I might have played anything. I couldn't hear the piano myself. The crowd whistled and howled and even threw handy missiles on the stage." [...] The reaction, however, {{was by no}} means universally negative—the Musical Standard called him [...] "one of the most remarkable composers of the day... that germ of realism and humanity which is indicative of genius." [...] By the next year, he was the talk of the American music scene for his performances of cutting-edge works by Schoenberg, Scriabin, Bartók, Debussy, Kodály, Ravel, and Stravinsky (many of them U.S. premieres), as well as his own, even more radical compositions.|$|E
500|$|Unlike his {{previous}} record that {{was intended to}} focus on R and pop genres, FutureSex/LoveSounds is less concentrated on one particular sound, thus representing a wider range. Timberlake explains, [...] "It's more broad {{as far as the}} styles I wanted to mix in <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> type of thing." [...] A musically [...] "complex" [...] album, FutureSex/LoveSounds is a fusion of rap, rock, funk, soul, gospel, new wave, opera, and world music. Entertainment Weekly noted that the album's sound is a [...] "sonic departure" [...] from both *NSYNC and Justified. Although [...] "What Goes Around" [...] sounds similar to Justified, Timberlake admitted that it is the only song in the new album to have such similarity.|$|E

The operation of General Bülow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded".|$|E
500|$|During the 1860s, Longfellow {{supported}} abolitionism {{and especially}} hoped for reconciliation between {{the northern and}} southern states after the American Civil War. His son was injured during the war, and he wrote the poem [...] "Christmas Bells", later the basis of the carol I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day. He wrote in his journal in 1878: [...] "I have only one desire; and that is for harmony, and a frank and honest understanding between North and South". Longfellow accepted an offer from Joshua Chamberlain to speak at his fiftieth reunion at Bowdoin College, despite his aversion to public speaking; he read the poem [...] "Morituri Salutamus" [...] so quietly that few could hear him. The next year, he declined an offer to be nominated for the Board of Overseers at Harvard [...] "for reasons very conclusive <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> mind".|$|E
500|$|In 1924, Ferdinand and Marie {{undertook}} a diplomatic tour of France, Switzerland, Belgium and the United Kingdom. In England, she was warmly welcomed by George V, who declared that [...] "apart {{from the common}} aims, which we pursue, there are other and dear ties between us. Her Majesty the Queen, my dear cousin, is British born." [...] Similarly, Marie wrote that {{the day of her}} arrival in England was [...] "a great day for me, one of emotions, sweet, happy and the same time glorious emotions to come back as Queen <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> country, to be received officially, in all honour and enthusiastically into the bargain – to feel your heart swell with pride and satisfaction, to feel your heart beat and tears start into your eyes, while something gave you a lump into your throat!" [...] These state visits were a symbolic recognition of the prestige Romania had gained after World War I. Whilst visiting Geneva, Marie and Ferdinand became the first royals to enter the newly established headquarters of the League of Nations.|$|E

500|$|During {{their time}} in Jacksonville, the McCains' {{marriage}} began to falter. [...] McCain had extramarital affairs; he was seen with other women in social settings and developed a reputation among his colleagues for womanizing. [...] Some of McCain's activity with other women occurred when he was off-duty after routine flights to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and Naval Air Facility El Centro. [...] McCain later said, [...] "My marriage's collapse was attributable <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> selfishness and immaturity more {{than it was to}} Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine." [...] His wife Carol later stated that the failure was not due to her accident or Vietnam and that [...] "I attribute [...] more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else." [...] John McCain's biographer, Robert Timberg, believes that [...] "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on." [...] According to John McCain, [...] "I had changed, she had changed. People who have been apart that much change." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1997, the Fugees {{performed}} in September 2004 at Dave Chappelle's Block Party in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The concert featured Hill's nearly a cappella rendition of [...] "Killing Me Softly". The event was recorded by director Michel Gondry and was released on March 3, 2006, to universal acclaim. The Fugees also appeared at BET Awards 2005 during June 2005, where they opened the show with a 12-minute set. One track, [...] "Take It Easy", was leaked online and thereafter was released as an Internet single in late September. It peaked at number forty on the Billboard R Chart. In 2005, she told USA Today, [...] "If I make music now, it will only be to provide information <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> children. If other people benefit from it, then so be it." [...] When asked how she now felt about the songs on 2.0, she stated [...] "a lot of the songs were transitional.

500|$|Frank {{has been}} outspoken on many civil rights issues, {{including}} lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. In 1987, he publicly {{came out as}} gay. In 1990, Frank was instrumental in crafting the 1990 Immigration Act, which restated the reasons for which a person could be denied entry into the country. [...] The act did not include [...] "sexual preference exclusion", reforming earlier immigration law which allowed persons to be excluded for a sexual deviance [...] "afflict". He said in a 1996 interview: [...] "I'm used to being in the minority. I'm a left-handed gay Jew. I've never felt, automatically, a member of any majority." [...] In 1995, then-Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey famously referred to Frank as [...] "Barney Fag" [...] in a press interview. Armey apologized {{and said it was}} [...] "a slip of the tongue". Frank did not accept Armey's explanation, saying [...] "I turned <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> expert, my mother, who reports that in 59 years of marriage, no one ever introduced her as Elsie Fag." [...] In 1998, Frank founded the National Stonewall Democrats, the national LGBT Democratic organization.|$|E
