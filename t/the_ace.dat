5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of how active a {{hurricane}} season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. It was not as strong as that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher ACE level.

For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. <b>The</b> <b>ACE</b> in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; <b>the</b> <b>ACE</b> in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.|$|E
