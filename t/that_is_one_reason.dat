25|$|At the Second Council of Ephesus in 449, Leo's representatives {{delivered}} his famous , {{a statement of}} {{the faith of the}} Roman Church {{in the form of a}} letter addressed to Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople, which repeats, in close adherence to Augustine of Hippo, the formulas of western Christology. The council did not read the letter nor did it pay any attention to the protests of Leo's legates but deposed Flavian and Eusebius of Dorylaeum, who appealed to Rome. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> that the council was never recognized as ecumenical and was later repudiated by the Council of Chalcedon.|$|E
500|$|Fischer {{wanted to}} play in the Capablanca Memorial Tournament, Havana in August and September 1965. Since the State Department refused to endorse Fischer's {{passport}} as valid for visiting Cuba, he proposed, and the tournament officials and players accepted, a unique arrangement: Fischer played his moves from a room at the Marshall Chess Club, which were then transmitted by teleprinter to Cuba. Luděk Pachman observed that Fischer [...] "was handicapped by the longer playing session resulting from the time wasted in transmitting the moves, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why he lost to three of his chief rivals." [...] The tournament was an [...] "ordeal" [...] for Fischer, who had to endure eight-hour and sometimes even twelve-hour playing sessions. Despite the handicap, Fischer tied for second through fourth places, with 15/21 (+12−3=6), behind former World Champion Vasily Smyslov, whom Fischer defeated in their individual game. The tournament received extensive media coverage.|$|E
2500|$|Asymmetrical gluteal folds and an {{apparent}} limb-length inequality can further indicate unilateral hip dysplasia. [...] Most vexingly, many newborn hips show a certain ligamentous laxity, {{on the other}} hand severely malformed joints can appear stable. [...] <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why follow-up exams and developmental monitoring are important. [...] Frequency and methods of routine screenings in children is still in debate however physical examination of newborns followed by appropriate use of hip ultrasound is widely accepted.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] {{returned}} Phil. [...] "Maybe he {{got scared}} {{when he found}} out that his cigarette had started the fire and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why he jumped overboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, then!" [...] I flung her Mark's letter. There wasn't {{anything}} in it <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> sacrilege to let another person see. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I had been crying.|$|R
50|$|Soon, Radio Yemen (an Egyptian-controlled organ) {{called for}} the {{assassination}} of the Al Saud including the Free Princes. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the Free Princes became increasingly embittered with Nasser.|$|R
2500|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, {{the name}} was written in various ways: Egipcian, Egypcian, [...] 'gypcian. The word gipsy/gypsy comes from the spellings which had lost the initial capital E, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> that it is often spelled with the initial g in lowercase. As time elapsed, the notion of 'the gipsy/gypsy' altered to include other {{associated}} stereotypes such as nomadism and exoticism. John Matthews in The World Atlas of Divination refer to gypsies as [...] "Wise Women." ...|$|E
6000|$|Brooke smiled curiously. [...] "Of course! <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I {{am pleased}} you sent for me. This, you see, brings {{it back to}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{was last}} here, I noted {{a change in}} your father's manner. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> though there are others. Then I must go {{in two or three}} minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why she {{received}} {{me as she}} did; but she had another, which she communicated {{to me in the}} plainest terms--the difference in our rank of life." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the acronym}} ECU is formed from English words, écu {{is also the}} name of an ancient French coin. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> a new name was devised for its {{successor}} currency, euro, which was felt not to favour any single language.|$|R
60|$|Father and Murray and I {{had always}} lived here together. Father's health broke down during his college course. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Uncle Abimelech was set against Murray going to college, {{although}} Murray is as chubby and sturdy a fellow {{as you could}} wish to see. Anybody with Foster in him would <b>be</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The joke {{of it is}} that I, too, {{am being}} watched whereever I go. That fellow Streuss has spies everywhere. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I believe that Von Behrling was serious.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you mean}} drink, she is; and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why he values her. His last cook, and his last but one--' Here Mrs. Gisborne narrated {{at some length}} the tragic {{histories}} of these artists.|$|E
6000|$|... "And me too. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why {{we should}} not desire to change it. Mad people forget. They think they are somewhere else. For {{us to believe that}} we were somewhere else would be in itself happiness." ...|$|E
5000|$|The first Arikara {{delegation}} {{left for}} the capital, Washington, DC, in April 1805, urged by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Chief Ankedoucharo became ill during his stay and died in Washington. The delegates blamed the whites for the chief's death. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why the Arikara for the next decades were [...] "notoriously hostile to white Americans".|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought not; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I {{selected}} you. What {{is wanted}} {{is a man}} of sharp intelligence and plain common sense, and one also who can write English; for it will fall to your lot to draw up the report on the matter. Mr. Neverbend, who is to be your colleague, cannot put two words together.' ...|$|R
60|$|When Johnny {{had first}} seen the stranger, {{he had thought}} right away <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> the old gray Chuck {{with whom he had}} had such a terrible fight the day before and whom he whipped. Perhaps <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for Johnny Chuck's terrible anger now, for the old gray Chuck had tried to drive Johnny Chuck off the Green Meadows.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} use to talk to Flora," [...] said Ethel; [...] "she {{would say}} it was high-flown and visionary. Oh! she wants it for the bazaar's own sake, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I hate it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes!" [...] said Valentine, with a {{wry smile}} in his eyes. [...] "I have tried them both, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I'm here. You haven't {{answered}} me; though, after all, I guess it's an unnecessary question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you can't {{say that}} I'm not honest. It is {{positively}} my only virtue. I adore the truth. I loathe a lie. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> I daresay, why I can only barely tolerate you. You are a shocking--a gross liar." ...|$|E
50|$|Although {{released}} {{after a little}} more than four months, Ziegenbalg still had a difficult relationship with Hassius and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for Ziegenbalg's return to Europe in 1714-1716. Ziegenbalg was also married in 1716. He was also active in cooperation with the Anglican Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, making his work one of the first ecumenical ventures in the history of Protestant missionary work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, {{that lesson}} has lasted all my life; and I am {{certainly}} {{not likely to}} forget it here, where the peasants {{are every bit as}} savage as the Spaniards. But as for the English, though I have fought with them half a dozen times since, and have been beaten by them too, I have always had a liking for them. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I took to you, youngster, from the first." ...|$|R
50|$|The other Ernestine duchies {{were never}} {{members of the}} Imperial Circle, {{and did not have}} the right to vote in the reichstag as the five duchies that the other duchies did (for example, the principalities of Meiningen and Hildburghausen <b>were</b> such; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen {{exchanged}} his patrimony to that of Altenburg). However, they were all autonomous and ultimately, with the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire on August 6, 1806, that issue became irrelevant.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I do {{not love}} him the less for that reason; I think I love him the more. I never, never, could have loved anyone else, mamma; never, never; and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I do {{not so much}} mind being ill now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> I don't want to {{give her}} up; it seems so sad to send Maurice's child away leaving such an impression. One thing I am. thankful for, {{that it will be}} all over before grandmamma and Bessie Merrifield come.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Above all things," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "I have always looked upon you as wicked. Most people do. I think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> {{why so many}} of the women find you attractive. I suppose it is why I have found you attractive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt a hankerin', anyway, {{after some}} of the old people of the Castor; for, after having had all that money divided among us, it made me feel as if we belonged to the same family. I suppose <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I felt a sort of drawing to you, you know. Anyway, I knew where you lived, and I came right here, and arrived this morning. After I'd taken a room at the hotel, I asked for your house and came {{straight}} here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it <b>was</b> {{something}} <b>that</b> had to <b>be</b> done. As {{long as she}} questioned {{me about}} him, I put her off the best way I could, {{and after a while}} she seemed to give up questioning me of her own accord. Perhaps she really began to understand it, or some of the cruel little things she played with said something. I was always afraid of the other children throwing it up to her, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> we went away for three or four years and let our place here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! hush! {{you must}} not say that. Come and shake hands, Jack, and make it up. I do feel irritable--I don't know what's the matter with me. Remember, Mr. Keller doesn't like your joining in the talk at dinner-time--he thinks it is taking a liberty. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I stopped you. And you might have said {{something}} to offend Madame Fontaine--that was another. It will not be long before {{we go back to}} our dear old London. Now, be a good boy, and leave me to my work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess my}} best days are done, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I wish {{to end up}} with a big success," [...] he said. [...] "I got a plain warning from the Vancouver doctor you brought me in that morning. You managed it smartly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you again, Peter," [...] cried Dotty, [...] "and {{please let}} me return the compliment. I like cold weather. I like winter when there isn't too much ice and bad weather. I always feel good in cold weather. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> I go north to nest." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{always seems}} to make Jack blue and grumpy when I talk like that. I suppose <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why he never asked me to settle down in life as a country doctor's wife. Another was, no doubt, that I always nipped his sentimental sproutings religiously in the bud.|$|E
40|$|Verification of a dynamically-dispatched method call, E. m(), {{seems to}} depend on E’s dynamic type. To avoid case {{analysis}} and allow incremental development, object-oriented program verification uses supertype abstraction. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>one</b> <b>reasons</b> about E. m() using m’s specification for E’s static type. Supertype abstraction is valid when each subtype in the program is a behavioral subtype. This paper formalizes supertype abstraction and behavioral subtyping for a Java-like sequential language with mutation, and proves <b>that</b> behavioral subtyping <b>is</b> both necessary and sufficient for the validity of supertype abstraction. Specification inheritance, as in JML, is also formalized and proved to entail behavioral subtyping...|$|R
