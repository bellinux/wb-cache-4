5|$|On 1 March 1985, Jim Sullivan {{began his}} career as NBN's news director, which has {{ultimately}} led him to become Australia's longest serving news director. The station's coverage of <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> events of the 1989 Newcastle earthquake was beamed throughout the world, with NBN's reporters also being interviewed by international news services.|$|E
5|$|While {{composing}} {{the opera}} Siegfried, {{the third part}} of the Ring cycle, Wagner interrupted work on it and between 1857 and 1864 wrote <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> love story Tristan und Isolde and his only mature comedy Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg), two works that {{are also part of}} the regular operatic canon.|$|E

5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> poets.|$|E
5|$|As the {{sectional}} conflict {{leading up}} to the Civil War escalated, Breckinridge was put in the unusual position of being a slaveholder who opposed slavery. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 put him at odds with his nephew, John C. Breckinridge. <b>The</b> <b>tragic</b> scenario of brother against brother literally played out in Breckinridge's family, with two of his sons joining each side during the war. Following the war, Breckinridge retired to his home in Danville, where he died on December 27, 1871.|$|E
5|$|Everything in Time (B-sides, Rarities, Remixes) is a {{compilation}} album comprising B-sides, remixes, and rare songs by the American third wave ska band No Doubt, first released on November 23, 2003 as disc three of No Doubt's box set, Boom Box, which also contained The Singles 1992–2003, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in <b>the</b> <b>Tragic</b> Kingdom.

Singh's acclaimed portrayal of Bajirao I in the historical romance Bajirao Mastani (2015), one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films and for which he won several accolades including his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor, established him as a leading actor in the Hindi film industry.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Poulenc {{embarked}} on a collaboration with his old friend Cocteau, in an operatic version of the latter's 1930 monodrama La Voix humaine. The work was produced in February 1959 at the Opéra-Comique, under Cocteau's direction, with Duval as <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> deserted woman speaking to her former lover by telephone. In May Poulenc's 60th birthday was marked, a few months late, by his last concert with Bernac before the latter's retirement from public performance.|$|E
25|$|Blom filmed two endings for the movie—one {{happy and}} one <b>tragic.</b> <b>The</b> {{alternate}} <b>tragic</b> ending, {{in which the}} Doctor dies at the end, was made in particular for the Russian market. It was believed that the Russians had a preference for sad endings.|$|R

5|$|The Singles 1992–2003 and The Videos 1992–2003 are {{compiled}} from the singles released from {{four of the}} band's five studio albums, No Doubt, Tragic Kingdom, Return of Saturn and Rock Steady, with tracks from the last three heavily represented. Everything in Time is an album of B-sides, rare songs and remixes, taken mainly from the recording sessions of Return of Saturn. Live in <b>the</b> <b>Tragic</b> Kingdom is a recording of a concert filmed during the band's tour for Tragic Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The opera {{is written}} in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers {{separated}} by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and {{tells the story of}} the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen's love to the glamorous matador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.|$|E
5|$|Back in Sweden, Smetana {{found among}} his new pupils a young housewife, Fröjda Benecke, who briefly became his muse and his mistress. In her honour Smetana {{transcribed}} two songs from Schubert's Die schöne Müllerin cycle, and transformed {{one of his}} own early piano pieces into a polka entitled Vision at the Ball. He also began composing on a more expansive scale. In 1858 he completed the symphonic poem Richard III, his first major orchestral composition since the Triumphal Symphony. He followed this with Wallenstein's Camp, inspired by Friedrich Schiller's Wallenstein drama trilogy, and began a third symphonic poem Hakon Jarl, based on <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> drama by Danish poet Adam Oehlenschläger. Smetana also wrote two large-scale piano works: Macbeth and the Witches, and an Étude in C in the style of Liszt.|$|E

5|$|During the 2005–06 season, Duncan {{suffered}} from plantar fasciitis {{for most of}} the season, which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances. The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA Playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense. But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{was born}} in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute. The date was 7 August 1877. He was the {{youngest}} child of five, born to William and Jeanie (née Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude for drawing when very young {{and when he was}} about thirteen, his mother arranged for him to have painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have been victims of an influenza pandemic. William, the father, and Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a home had been sold. Evidently, <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed for California via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While he was gone the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned {{it to the ground}} and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead. To make matters worse, his detractors used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. <b>The</b> <b>tragic</b> outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E
