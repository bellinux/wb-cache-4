50|$|At some levels where substitutions are unlimited, {{teams will}} {{make use of}} a Defensive Specialist in place of or in {{addition}} to a Libero. This position does not have unique rules like the libero position, instead, these players are used to substitute out a poor back row defender using regular substitution rules. A defensive specialist is often used if you have a particularly poor back court defender in right side or left side, but your team is already using a libero to <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>your</b> middles. Most often, the situation involves a team using a right side player with a big block who must be subbed out in the back row because they aren't able to effectively play back court defense. Similarly, teams might use a Serving Specialist to sub out a poor server situationally.|$|R
