40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{investigation}} into the design and performance of the piled raft foundation for the recently completed shops and offices building complex {{on the south side of}} Victoria Street, London. In particular, an attempt has been made to determine the proportion of the total load supported by the piles, using simple calculation techniques. The ability to predict accurately this share out of foundation loading between piles and raft could have a marked influence in saving costs in foundation design. An attempt has also been made to predict foundation settlement with a piled raft foundation, taking into account the non-linear soil strata and heave effects from the removal of the considerable depth of overburden, in the basements. Comprehensive site investigations were carried out; initially for Blocks B. and C, and later for Block D. The results from these site investigations were used for the initial design of the piled foundations, but were found to give very conservative results. Four <b>test</b> <b>piles</b> were constructed and tested to verify the initial pile design for Blocks B and C, The <b>test</b> <b>piles</b> were instrumented with vibrating wire strain gauges in an attempt to determine the distribution of load down the pile shafts and on the pile bases. The results from these <b>test</b> <b>piles</b> showed that much higher stresses could be applied to the ground than had been indicated in the soil investigation report. Three further <b>test</b> <b>piles</b> were <b>tested</b> for Block D and gave similar results to the <b>test</b> <b>piles</b> for Blocks B and C. The various considerations affecting the choice of foundation design are discussed and the validity of the initial assumptions are compared with the actual performance of the foundations as derived from the results recorded by the instrumentation of the foundations. In order to monitor the dispersion of loading through the foundation system, vibrating wire strain gauges were built into the working piles and vibrating wire soil cells were installed under the rafts and at the bottom of <b>piles.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>piles</b> were also instrumented to record the distribution of shear forces on the shaft and the end bearing forces.

40|$|In {{recent years}} jacked steel H-piles have been {{introduced}} into Hong Kong {{as an alternative to}} driven piles. In Hong Kong practice, termination of pile driving is often based on dynamic formula and pile tips are normally embedded in a stratum with SPT-N values exceeding 200. On the other hand, installation of jacked piles ceases when the rate of penetration is less than some prescribed termination criterion and jacked piles are normally embedded in layers with SPT-N values of less than 160. As such bearing stratum is less stiff, the load transfer mechanism and capacity of jacked piles could be very different from driven piles and experience from the latter may not be directly applicable. To investigate the behaviour of such piles, a comprehensive study was conducted. In the study, six piles were instrumented with strain gauges and load tested to failure so allowing their load transfer mechanism to be studied. During installation the development of pore pressure around three of the <b>test</b> <b>piles</b> was monitored by electronic piezometers. Different criteria were adopted for determining the termination of jacking. It was found that the <b>test</b> <b>piles</b> passed the same acceptance criteria specified in the building code for driven piles.

50|$|The only {{significant}} difference between the smaller and larger testing devices is the method of catching the reaction mass. The catching method for larger tests uses gravel. This is achieved by placing the Statnamic device on the <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> and lowering the reaction mass onto its hanger. A large containing container is then placed around the assembly and filled with gravel. As the Statnamic weights move upwards the gravel moves to fill the void left and support the weights once movement has ceased. Due to the time required to place and remove the gravel after testing this method is reserved for tests above 16MN. Smaller rigs utilise a hydraulic catching mechanism that allows the mass to be caught within the frame of the device. This allows up to ten individual piles to be tested in a day or multiple cycles on a single pile at 15 minute intervals. Further description of the hydraulic catching mechanism is given by Middendorp (2000). The most recent development is the mounting of a 1MN Statnamic device on a 360° tracked excavator which allows rapid deployment (1 hour) and increased production.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} studies were {{completed}} {{to characterize the}} geochemistry and microbiology of drainage emanating from low-S content waste-rock test piles at the Diavik Diamond Mine (Diavik) from 2007 through 2010. The potential use of small-scale laboratory humidity-cell experiments to predict the water quality from larger-scale field-based experiments also was examined. Waste rock at Diavik is segregated into three categories according to sulfide content: Type I (target concentration: 0. 08 wt. % S). Four high-density polyethylene tanks, 2 m in diameter by 2 m in height, were filled with and surrounded by waste rock (active zone lysimeters; AZLs) at the Diavik site to study the upper 2 m of the active zone within a waste-rock pile and to evaluate the quality of effluent released from waste rock with differing S contents (Type I AZLs: 0. 014 wt. % S and Type III AZLs: 0. 035 wt. % S). In addition, three waste-rock test piles also were constructed at Diavik, two uncovered test piles (Type I test pile: 0. 035 wt. % S and Type III test pile: 0. 053 wt. % S) and a third pile was constructed based on the mine-closure plan which consists of waste rock (Type III: 0. 082 wt. % S) capped with a 1. 5 m layer of till and a 3 m layer of Type I material (Covered <b>test</b> <b>pile).</b> Each <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> is underlain by a high-density polyethylene geomembrane that captures and directs water to outflow drains. Results show that the release and transport of blasting residuals {{could be used as}} a resident tracer, indicating the first flush of water through the AZLs and the test piles. Variations in concentrations of blasting residuals and the gradual rate of dissipation provide an indication of the heterogeneity of the distribution of blasting residuals and the relative contributions of water and solutes from different flow paths. As temperatures within the test piles increase in response to ambient air temperature increases, larger proportions of the <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> contributed to the outflow, and increased concentrations of blasting residuals were observed in waste-rock <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> effluent. Effluent from the Type I AZLs and <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> maintained near-neutral pH (ranged from 5. 8 to 8) with concentrations of SO₄²⁻ 1500 mg L⁻¹) suggesting sulfide oxidation was occurring. Maximum concentrations of SO₄²⁻, Al, Zn, Ni, Co, and Cu were observed in 2009 during the first flush of water through the Type III <b>test</b> <b>pile.</b> A sequence of acid-neutralization reactions was inferred based on the water chemistry of the effluent derived from the Type III AZLs and waste-rock <b>test</b> <b>pile.</b> This acid-neutralization sequence is similar to those observed at other AMD impacted sites. A series of mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions controlled pH and metal mobility; carbonate-mineral dissolution consumed H⁺ generated from sulfide-mineral oxidation at near neutral pH and the dissolution of Al and Fe (oxy) hydroxides consumed H⁺ at pH < 5. 0. The cover system on the Covered <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> dampened the effects of ambient air temperature on the internal temperatures within the core of the Covered <b>test</b> <b>pile.</b> As a result, the Covered <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> had a relatively steady change in flow rate, with decreased flow from June to August, which led to a slow but prolonged release of sulfide-mineral oxidation products, such as SO₄²⁻ and dissolved metals, including Ni, Co, Zn, Cd, and Cu, compared to the uncovered Type III <b>test</b> <b>pile.</b> The pH decreased in 2008 and remained low for the duration of the study, whereas the pH in the uncovered <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> was near-neutral at the beginning of each field season in May and decreased to < 4. 2 by the end of the field season in November. The microbiological-community profiles observed in the AZLs and waste-rock test piles suggest typical AMD-related species were present in acidic effluent with elevated concentrations of metals, whereas typical soil microbes were present in effluent with a near-neutral pH and lower concentrations of SO₄²⁻ and dissolved metals. The Type III AZLs, Type III <b>test</b> <b>pile,</b> and Covered <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> maintained populations of acidophilic Fe-oxidizers, whereas, the Type I AZLs and Type I <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> maintained populations of neutrophilic S-oxidizers. Laboratory humidity-cell (1 kg) results were scaled up to estimate the water quality from the Type III AZLs (6 t) using measured physical and chemical parameters. The results suggested over-prediction of SO₄²⁻ and metal concentrations when low mean annual precipitation occurred, limiting flushing of predicted oxidation products. In subsequent years with higher mean annual precipitation oxidation products from previous years were liberated and resulted in the under prediction of SO₄²⁻ and metal concentrations. Additionally, Fe and Al were over-predicted because Fe and Al concentrations in the AZL effluent may be controlled by the solubility and formation of secondary minerals, such as Fe oxyhydroxides, jarosite, and goethite, which were not included in the scaling procedure...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} make the Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) pile, {{developed}} in Phase I of the UHPC Pile Project at Iowa State University (ISU), a viable option in practice, laboratory testing, field testing and installation of a production pile in the field were undertaken during Phase II of this project. A detailed understanding of the section behavior and lateral loading behavior was determined and compared to that of a steal HP 10 x 57 pile through lateral load analyses of a UHPC pile section. The analysis found that UHPC piles were suitable for integral abutments of bridges. To make the field installation of UHPC piles possible, the overall performance of a common pile-to-abutment connection was verified in the laboratory by defining the UHPC pile-to-abutment connection, which is similar to the currently used connection for steel HP 10 x 57 piles. Both piles performances were verified by testing their connection when subjected to weak-axis bending. The test piles met performance criteria during the laboratory displacements of 0. 28 and 0. 42 inches which correspond to 1. 0 and 1. 55 inches in the field. Next, the field testing began to ensure that the production pile would achieve the desired behavior and capacities required by integral abutment bridges. A vertical load test on a 46 -ft UHPC <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> was completed one week after being driven into the ground at the same site where the UHPC production pile was implemented into a 223 -ft long integral bridge with a 24 ¢ª skew. Before failure, the <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> resisted 1. 5 times the predicted capacity based on the Iowa Bluebook method of design for concrete piles, verifying appropriateness of reducing the UHPC production pile by 16 % in length compared to the specified length of 65 -ft for the HP 10 x 57 piles on the integral bridge. Additionally, a lateral load test was conducted between the second <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> with a newly designed splice detail and the vertical load <b>test</b> <b>pile,</b> which confirmed the adequacy of the splice detail and the lateral load resistance of the pile.

40|$|Waste rock is a {{potential}} source of low quality drainage resulting from oxidation of naturally occurring sulfide minerals. Sulfide oxidation may result in the generation of effluent with elevated concentrations of SO 4 and dissolved metals and low pH. The sulfide content of waste rock is typically much {{lower than that of}} tailings; however, the large volumes of waste rock produced during mining may create a large environmental liability. Improving the understanding of the processes affecting the generation of acid mine drainage (AMD) from waste rock will facilitate improved prediction, mitigation, and remediation strategies. Three waste-rock test piles were constructed at the Diavik Diamond Mine, Northwest Territories to investigate the potential for AMD generation in a permafrost environment. The test piles were constructed in 2006 and consisted of low sulfide (0. 035 wt. % S), high sulfide (0. 53 wt. % S), and covered test piles. The covered <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> was constructed to model the mine closure plan and consisted of a high sulfide (0. 082 wt. %) core, covered by a low-permeability layer, and a low-sulfide thermal insulation layer. In 2014, the low-sulfide Type I <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> was systematically deconstructed to investigate the geochemical, hydrogeological, and geotechnical evolution of the waste rock. Samples were collected for microbial community analysis, mineralogical characterization, pore-water extraction, ice distribution, volumetric moisture content, and particle-size distribution. The geochemical evolution of the <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> was investigated using mineral saturation index calculations, neutralization potential ratios, aqueous geochemistry, most probable number enumeration, adsorption isotherm modeling within the <b>test</b> <b>pile,</b> and mass loading calculations at the basal drain. Regions of low pH with elevated dissolved metal and SO 4 concentration developed within the <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> {{as a result of the}} heterogeneity inherent in the waste rock. Sulfide oxidation rates were depressed in regions that remained frozen for a larger part of the year. Depression of sulfide oxidation rates allowed neutralization reactions within the waste rock to maintain circumneutral pH in these regions. Saturation index calculations indicate circumneutral pH regions were conducive to precipitation of Fe (oxy) hydroxides which have a large capacity to adsorb cations. Adsorption isotherm modeling indicates that adsorption of Cu, Zn, Co, and Ni on ferrihydrite can account for the observed attenuation of these metals with increasing pH. Attenuation reactions resulted in reduced mass loading of metals and SO 4 in effluent compared to the higher sulfide waste-rock pile...|$|E

Pile relaxation is known to occur in dilative sands and silts, and it has been hypothesized that this occurred at this site. However, no one has been able to quantify how relaxation caused such a significant reduction in capacity. There are very few studies on the effects of cyclic pile driving in dilative silts, none of which provide correlations to observed pile relaxation and cyclic loading. Because of this and the fact that dilative sands and silts exist at other potential bridge sites in Rhode Island, this is an important case study to document. ^ Site characterization, geotechnical properties, and load test data was compiled from a large quantity of construction reports and correspondence from the project. Static capacity analysis was performed for each <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> at design depth and at the depth in which the static load tests were actually conducted. The analyses indicated the design depths should have been of sufficient depth to provide enough resistance for the design capacities based upon provided boring logs and lab data; which was not the case.

40|$|Large {{diameter}} {{helical piles}} are being utilized increasingly to support large compressive and tensile loads. Both {{the magnitude of}} the required installation torque and the pile capacity can be directly attributed to the soil shearing resistance developed over the embedded area of the pile including the shaft and helical plates. Hence, the pile capacity can be correlated to the installation torque. Such correlations are widely used in helical pile industry as a means for quality control/quality assurance. However, the reliability of capacity-torque correlations for predicting the large diameter helical piles is adversely affected by the inaccurate measurement of the installation torque employing hydraulic pressure torque indicators. In the current study, a torque pin was fabricated using strain gauges methodology to facilitate accurate measurement of installation torque. A total of 17 piles, including seven fully instrumented, were installed while monitoring the installation torque continuously with depth using the fabricated device. The results of installation torque monitoring were demonstrated to be accurate and repeatable. In addition, six compressive and four tensile axial load tests were conducted on the <b>test</b> <b>piles.</b> The load <b>test</b> results were analyzed to determine the interpreted ultimate capacity of the <b>test</b> <b>piles.</b> The results demonstrated that the ultimate capacity of large diameter helical piles can be determined from the <b>pile</b> load <b>tests</b> data employing the interpreted failure criteria proposed by Elkasabgy and El Naggar (2015) and Fuller 2 ̆ 6 Hoy (1970).

40|$|Modern seismic {{design codes}} {{stipulate}} that the response analysis {{should be conducted}} by considering the complete structural system including superstructure, foundation, and ground. However, {{for the development of}} seismic response analysis method for a complete structural system, it is first imperative to clarify the behavior of the soil and piles during earthquakes. In this study, full-scale monotonic and reversed cyclic lateral loading tests were carried out on concrete piles embedded into the ground. The <b>test</b> <b>piles</b> were hollow, precast, prestressed concrete piles with an outer diameter of 300 mm and a thickness of 60 mm. The <b>test</b> <b>piles</b> were 26 m long. Three-dimensional (3 D) finite element analysis was then performed to study the behavior of the experimental specimens analytically. The study revealed that the lateral load-carrying capacity of the piles degrades when subjected to cyclic loading compared with monotonic loading. The effect of the use of an interface element between the soil and pile surface in the analysis was also investigated. With proper consideration of the constitutive models of soil and pile, an interface element between the pile surface and the soil, and the degradation of soil stiffness under cyclic loading, a 3 D analysis was found to simulate well the actual behavior of pile and soil...|$|R
40|$|A {{remote-controlled}} robotic manipulator {{provides a}} convenient way to perform in-flight simulations involving multiple activities or stages. In this study, an advanced 4 -axis robotic manipulator {{was employed to}} conduct laterally loaded and torsionally loaded single <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> in sand. In both types of <b>tests,</b> the model <b>piles</b> were <b>tested</b> consecutively without stopping the centrifuge, which accordingly maximized consistency of the soil sample among the tests. In the laterally loaded <b>pile</b> <b>test,</b> four model <b>piles,</b> instrumented externally along the shafts, were jacked into a sand bed and laterally loaded at different loading rates. In the torsionally loaded <b>pile</b> <b>tests,</b> an instrumented model pile was installed at six different locations and loaded at different torsional loading rates at each location. The whole process of pile jacking, torsional loading and pile pulling at the six locations was conducted consecutively without stopping the centrifuge. Tests in both loose and dense sands were carried out. Detailed information about the test devices and test procedures for the two types of tests is described in this paper. Horizontal force-displacement curves and torque-torsional angle curves are presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCentrifuge {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} learn about the factors that affect mobilised resistance during rapid load <b>testing</b> of <b>piles</b> in sand. We studied the influence of pore water pressure during rapid load tests and its effect on the widely used unloading point method to derive static pile capacity. This paper describes the testing programme and the test set-up. We present typical measurement results from a total of 36 rapid and 12 static load tests, as well as the effects of the loading rate and excess pore pressures on <b>pile</b> resistance. The <b>tests</b> confirm that a rapid load test can overestimate static capacity due to pore water pressure when <b>testing</b> <b>piles</b> in medium to fine sands. The results of the pore pressure measurements show a combination of positive and negative excess pore pressure in the zone around the pile base, which can be explained by compression, volumetric behaviour during shearing and pore fluid flow around the pile...|$|R
