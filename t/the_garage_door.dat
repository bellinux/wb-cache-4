500|$|Grohl's garage was {{equipped}} with microphones, sound baffles on <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> and behind the drums to prevent sound leakings, and a carpet under the drum kit {{to make it sound}} less [...] "loud and bright". To reduce the cymbal bleed, the microphones were rearranged and the crash cymbal was traded for a [...] "shorter-decay Zildjian cymbal with holes drilled in it". A room next to the study was turned into an isolation booth to record the vocals. For the recording itself a makeshift control room was built inside a tent on the backyard, and a system of two cameras and a television provided the communication between the garage and the control room. The equipment was the same the band employed to record the albums There Is Nothing Left to Lose and One by One at Grohl's former house in Alexandria, Virginia.|$|E
500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land off center maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a cable rig. After taking a week to get everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> via wires.|$|E
500|$|Of the ten tornadoes in Florida, {{three were}} spawned in the {{southern}} portions of the state. In The Acreage, an EF-1 tornado caused minor to moderate roof damage to several homes, mainly {{in the form of}} shingles and roof covering torn off. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped near the trunk, along with several branches falling; this resulted in broken windows in several homes. At one home, <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> was damaged, causing the door to blow in, which in turn led to the roof being damaged above the garage. An 85-year-old woman was injured after being struck by a falling branch of an oak tree, which broke through her bedroom window. A few vehicles were moved from their original locations, while a [...] boat was flipped on its side. Another tornado in Belle Glade damaged an awning and downed trees and several power lines. Further south, a tornado touched down in Broward County and entered Palm Beach County before lifting back up; it resulted in no damage.|$|E

5000|$|In 1966, {{a garage}} {{was built on}} the library's {{northeast}} face to house two bookmobiles. The building operated as a library until October 1990, when a new library assumed service for western Duluth. The building was bought by the Duluth Art Institute in November 1992. According to the institute, it was purchased to acquire more space and to [...] "reach under-served communities."

2500|$|A {{garage door}} {{is a large}} door on a garage that can either be opened {{manually}} or by a garage door opener. Garage doors are necessarily large to allow passage of automobiles and/or trucks. In 1921, C. G. Johnson of Detroit, Michigan invented the [...] "Overhead Door", the first upward-lifting garage door. To market <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> <b>door,</b> Johnson mounted a small prototype of his door {{on the back of}} his Model T Ford and drove around the United States signing up distributors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{northwest}} wing was {{angled to}} align with Dupont Circle, {{while the rest}} of the house (south wing, center, northeast wing) was on a north–south axis perpendicular to P Street NW. The vestibule behind the loggia was on a northeast–southwest axis, and flanked on both sides by toilets—one of which was accessible by the billiard room to the northwest and the other by the reception hall to the southeast. The entrance hall was floored with polished terrazzo bordered by white marble. The ceiling was white plaster, and the walls were white plaster with a [...] high wooden baseboard. The billiard room was access by a door in the west wall, and in the north-northwest corner was a door leading to a cloakroom. To the right of the cloakroom door is a fireplace framed by exquisite moldings and a mantelpiece in the 15th-century Italian style. In the south wall, a door gave entry to the reception hall. Two marble steps led to a small landing and then the main staircase in the east wall (northeast corner). [...] Adjacent to the main staircase to the right (south) was the elevator, and then a small door and corridor giving onto the servants' section in the rear of the mansion's first floor. Northwest of the billiard room was an automobile garage, with <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> giving onto Dupont Circle. Northeast of the garage, and connected to the garage and the cloakroom, was a bicycle storage room. [...] In the rear of the ground floor was the servants' area. Clockwise from the north, this consisted of the laundry and storage closets, servants' entrance, kitchen, pantry, serving room, butler's room, and servants' hall. A set of winder stairs behind the elevator serves as the servants' stairs.|$|E

The motor raced for the climb up into the garage and raced once more, explosively, before it was shut off. A final opening and {{slamming}} of the car door. Silence then, a horrible silence filled with waiting, till the leisurely Mr. Doppelbrau had examined the state of his tires and had at last shut <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> <b>door.</b> Instantly, for Babbitt, a blessed state of oblivion.|$|E
50|$|On October 1968, Richard Blass {{was injured}} by bullet shots {{to the head}} and back after being ambushed, {{alongside}} partner Claude Menard, inside a <b>garage.</b> <b>The</b> two were able to save their lives when Menard drove the car they were in through <b>the</b> <b>garage's</b> <b>door,</b> and Blass required hospitalization for his wounds. He refused to identify his attackers, a fact which may have led him to earn respect among Canadian mafia members.|$|R
50|$|The fire department's space {{included}} an equipment room with three <b>garage</b> <b>doors,</b> and a club room with lockers, showers, and recreational furnishings.

In 1920 an alarm bell {{at the top of}} the hose tower was replaced with an electric siren and <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> were modified because they were too short to accommodate some new firefighting equipment.|$|R

50|$|The typical {{electric}} {{garage door}} opener {{consists of a}} power unit that contains the electric motor. The power unit attaches to a track.
