5|$|<b>Tidal</b> heating occurs {{through the}} <b>tidal</b> {{friction}} and <b>tidal</b> flexing processes caused by <b>tidal</b> acceleration: orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as {{heat in the}} core of the moon, the internal ocean, and the ice crust.|$|E
5|$|The Rance <b>Tidal</b> Power Station (240 MW) is the world's first <b>tidal</b> power station. The {{facility}} {{is located on}} the estuary of the Rance River, in Brittany, France. Opened on 26 November 1966, it is currently operated by Électricité de France, and is the largest <b>tidal</b> power station in the world, in terms of installed capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary {{has one of}} {{the highest}} <b>tidal</b> ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its <b>tidal</b> range, and the {{underlying}} geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong <b>tidal</b> streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The <b>tidal</b> range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide and the landing stage at the end of the pier has several levels to allow boats to dock at all stages of the tide.|$|E
5|$|At an April 14, 2008, news conference, Governor David Paterson {{announced}} that the MTA will power {{a substantial portion of}} the station using <b>tidal</b> energy generated by turbines located in the East River, which are part of the Roosevelt Island <b>Tidal</b> Energy Project. This is part of a larger MTA initiative to use sustainable energy resources within the subway system.|$|E

5|$|Due to <b>tidal</b> locking, Metis rotates {{synchronously}} {{with its}} orbital period, with its longest axis aligned towards Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|First {{predicted}} {{shortly before}} the Voyager 1 flyby, the heat source for Io's volcanism comes from <b>tidal</b> heating produced by its forced orbital eccentricity. This differs from Earth's internal heating, which is derived primarily from radioactive isotope decay and primordial heat of accretion. Io's eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's gravitational pull on the satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying <b>tidal</b> bulge. This variation {{in the shape of}} Io causes frictional heating in its interior. Without this <b>tidal</b> heating, Io might have been similar to the Moon, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a {{study of}} how the orbits of Saturn's moons should have changed due to <b>tidal</b> effects {{suggested}} that all of Saturn's satellites inward of Titan, including Enceladus (whose geologic activity was used to derive the strength of <b>tidal</b> effects on Saturn's satellites), may have formed as little as 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Beyoncé {{became a}} co-owner, with other artists, {{of the music}} {{streaming}} service <b>Tidal.</b> The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z acquired {{the parent company of}} <b>Tidal,</b> Aspiro, {{in the first quarter of}} 2015. Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own <b>Tidal,</b> with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>tidal</b> heating, {{the interior of}} Europa could also be heated by the decay of radioactive material (radiogenic heating) within the rocky mantle. But the models and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic heating alone, thus implying that <b>tidal</b> heating has {{a leading role in}} Europa.|$|E
5|$|Many hillsides, {{such as at}} Cadbury Castle, Ham Hill and Maes Knoll, and {{sheltered}} valleys provided defensible {{locations for}} early human settlements. Trade was established early. The large <b>tidal</b> variation provided access inland, {{a key factor in}} distributing goods and produce, using rivers such as the Parrett and Avon. The <b>tidal</b> range of , is second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Minehead {{is located}} on the Bristol Channel coast of South West England, and thus {{experiences}} one of the highest <b>tidal</b> ranges in the world. The <b>tidal</b> rise and fall in the Bristol Channel can be as great as , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Models of the {{evolution}} of the planet's orbit over time suggest that heating resulting from this <b>tidal</b> locking may {{play a major role in}} the planet's geology. Models proposed by scientists predict that <b>tidal</b> heating could yield a surface heat flux about three times greater than the Jupiter's moon Io's, which could result in major geological activity such as volcanoes and plate tectonics.|$|E

5|$|Peculiar {{galaxies are}} galactic {{formations}} that develop unusual properties due to <b>tidal</b> interactions with other galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The Levels are at {{risk from}} both <b>tidal</b> and {{land-based}} flood waters.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary, which empties {{into the}} Bristol Channel, has {{traditionally}} been thought to have the second largest <b>tidal</b> range in the world– about , exceeded only by the Bay of Fundy in Canada. Some controversy exists {{as to whether the}} <b>tidal</b> range in Ungava Bay, also in Canada, is greater than the Bay of Fundy, relegating the Severn Estuary to third place.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction that masses {{have for}} one another decreases inversely with {{the square of the}} distance of those masses from each other. As a result, the slightly greater attraction that the Moon has for the side of Earth closest to the Moon, as compared to the part of the Earth opposite the Moon, results in <b>tidal</b> forces. <b>Tidal</b> forces affect both the Earth's crust and oceans.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from <b>tidal</b> heating alone, so {{the main source}} of heat remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus is not enough to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and <b>tidal</b> heating, or the heat is produced through another mechanism.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{moorings}} for yachts and small craft {{on the west}} of the <b>tidal</b> basin.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} small {{islands in the}} {{vicinity}} including Broad Shoal, Grass Holm and Skerry of Vasa. Helliar Holm is a <b>tidal</b> islet at the eastern entrance to the main harbour at Balfour; it has a small lighthouse and a ruined broch. The String, a stretch of water that lies between Helliar Holm and the mainland, has strong <b>tidal</b> currents.|$|E
5|$|To allow steamers {{to bring}} day {{trippers}} to Weston-super-Mare from ports {{on both the}} English and Welsh side of the Bristol Channel, a landing jetty was extended {{on the west side}} of the island. The Severn Estuary has the second highest <b>tidal</b> range in the world second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its <b>tidal</b> range, and the underlying geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong <b>tidal</b> streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The <b>tidal</b> range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{eccentric}} post-capture orbit {{would have}} {{also resulted in}} <b>tidal</b> heating of its interior, which could have kept Triton fluid for a billion years; this inference is supported by evidence of differentiation in Triton's interior. This source of internal heat disappeared following <b>tidal</b> locking and circularization of the orbit.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm tide is measured using a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm surge {{is defined as the}} rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is measured using <b>tidal</b> predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby <b>tidal</b> station. <b>Tidal</b> bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the <b>tidal</b> prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{wind and}} wave, <b>tidal</b> power is an {{inherently}} predictable source. However {{the technology is}} in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today {{it is known that}} a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to <b>tidal</b> power. Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine. <b>Tidal</b> stream power captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine. An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, which is the largest <b>tidal</b> stream turbine in the world. To date the only two installed <b>tidal</b> power plants of notable size are the Sihwa Lake <b>Tidal</b> Power Station in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea and the Rance <b>Tidal</b> Power Station in Brittany, France, rated at 254 MW and 240 MW respectively. There are also many small scale projects throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Various {{proposals}} {{have been put}} forward to construct a Severn Barrage for <b>tidal</b> electricity production from Brean Down to Lavernock Point in south Wales. The proposals, which go back over 100 years, have never been successful so far, however Peter Hain and others are still working on further proposals and trying to persuade the government to fund either the barrage or <b>tidal</b> lagoons.|$|E
5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as <b>tidal</b> effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. <b>Tidal</b> interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
5|$|A deeper analogy relates <b>tidal</b> {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of <b>tidal</b> forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} scenario {{occurs when}} the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the <b>tidal</b> bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so {{the rotation of the}} primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out). In both cases, <b>tidal</b> deceleration causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by <b>tidal</b> stresses, potentially creating a planetary ring system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30to50million years), Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years), Metis and Adrastea of Jupiter, and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons.|$|E
5|$|A planet or moon's {{interior}} heat {{is produced}} from the collisions {{that created the}} body, by the decay of radioactive materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or <b>tidal</b> heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without <b>tidal</b> heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact cratering.|$|E
5|$|Although {{globular}} clusters generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities can occur due to <b>tidal</b> interactions. Clusters within the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are typically oblate spheroids in shape, while {{those in the}} Large Magellanic Cloud are more elliptical.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is <b>tidal</b> heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with <b>tidal</b> heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by an ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a <b>tidal</b> shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These <b>tidal</b> {{interaction}} effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E
5|$|August 13–21, 1995- Swells and 10foot (3m) waves {{generated}} by Hurricane Felix restrict beaches along the coastline. In addition, the waves cause beach erosion and minor <b>tidal</b> flooding.|$|E
5|$|August 17, 1986– Hurricane Charley makes {{landfall}} {{along the}} state and causes one indirect death; damage is minor and is mostly from <b>tidal</b> flooding and downed trees.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Phobos is below {{synchronous}} altitude, the <b>tidal</b> forces from the planet Mars are gradually lowering its orbit. In about 50 million years, it could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.|$|E
