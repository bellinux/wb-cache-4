The catalysts were tested in benzene hydrogenation (HYD) in the presence of 1 -butanethiol (C 4 H 9 SH 5 ppm of S) and in the hydroconversion of pyrolysis gasoline (PyGas) and compared with zeolite NaY-supported ones. In addition, the catalysts were characterized by variety of techniques (XRD, N 2 adsorption-desorption, TPD-H 2, TPD-NH 3, CO chemisorption, TPR, XPS, FTIR of adsorbed pyridine, TGA-DTA). It was found that the monometallic Ni/ASA catalyst with 24 wt. % of Ni was the most active among the catalysts studied in both benzene hydrogenation (+S) and hydroconversion of PyGas. The data of catalyst characterization suggests that the concentration of both metal and acid sites govern catalytic activity in both activity tests being the catalyst ability for hydrogen adsorption {{one of the most important}} factors to be taken into account. In general, it was found that the S-poisoning of the catalysts increased with an increase of the catalyst reactivity and diminished when "refractory-type" coke deposited on the metal sites inhibited the S-compound adsorption.

Nevertheless, oxidation of cysteine-SH groups in p 53 protein can inactivate the protein under oxidative conditions. <b>The</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>p</b> 53 as a tumor suppressor and insufficient studies about redox regulation of p 53 gene lead us to study redox regulation of p 53 protein. Methods: In this study, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was used as an in vivo model. All potential thiol-dependent antioxidant genes in yeast were identified based on specific characters in their structure, via REDOXCysSearch bioinformatics tool. To study human p 53 gene activity in yeast cells, p 53 gene and p 53 RE Lac-Z reporter that is inducible by p 53, were transformed into yeast. Antioxidant gene mutants were analyzed for LacZ reporter gene activity. Results: We identified several yeast mutants (Î”sac 1, Î”hnt 3 and Î”map 1) with lower p 53 activity with respect to wild-type yeast. Conclusion: Due to conserved mechanisms of cell cycle regulation and oxidative stress tolerance between yeast and mammals, we believe that results from yeast studies may help us to understand the redox regulation of p 53 in human cells.

Agricultural P losses are increasingly important for the P concentration in most European rivers, lakes, and estuaries, even though the quantity of P lost from agricultural areas in European catchments varies at least one order of magnitude ( 2. 1 kg P ha(- 1)). We focus on <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>P</b> {{for the implementation of}} the EU Water Framework Directive and discuss the benefits, uncertainties, and side effects of the different targeted mitigation measures that can be adopted to combat P losses from agricultural areas in river basins.

Furthermore, we show how river basin managers can map and analyze the extent and importance of P risk areas, exemplified by four catchments differing in size in Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Finally, we discuss the factors and mechanisms that may delay and/or counteract the responses of mitigation measures for combating P losses from agricultural areas when monitored at the catchment scale...|$|E
