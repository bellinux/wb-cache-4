5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England (1066–1071), Norwich was radically redesigned. Norwich Cathedral was built {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Tombland and much of the old town to the southwest of Tombland was cleared for the motte of Norwich Castle. A new Norman town was built west of the Castle, in an area known as Mancroft. The new town at Mancroft included a market of its own to provide for the Norman settlers and merchants moving into the area, and possibly also to supply the castle's garrison. The exact date of the foundation of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>at</b> Mancroft is not recorded, but it is known to have been operational by the time the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086. Granting the right to trade in Norman England {{was a part of the}} Royal Prerogative and, as with most fairs and markets of the period, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>at</b> Mancroft was operated under licence from the King. The King's Clerk had jurisdiction over all trade conducted at the market, and tolls and rents were collected on behalf of the King.|$|E

50|$|The site of <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> <b>at</b> Flemington was {{originally}} a land grant of 200 acre to John Fleming in 1806.

5|$|Almost {{no records}} survive of the Norman {{market in the}} 11th to 13thcenturies. It is known that shortly after the market's establishment, a tollhouse was built nearby, which served as a {{collection}} point for taxes on trade. Although the precise location of the tollhouse is not recorded, it was immediately north of the market on part of the site now occupied by the Guildhall. At some point soon after its construction, the tollhouse also became the centre for the civil administration of the city. Although the Tombland market retained its charter to host an annual horse fair, over time <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>at</b> Mancroft supplanted that at Tombland as the principal market of the area. At {{the end of the}} 11thcentury, the Tombland market was removed during construction work on Norwich Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Eurotunnel was in discussions with the Intergovernment Commission, which oversees the tunnel, with the aim of amending elements of the safety code governing the tunnel's usage. Most saliently, the requirement that trains be able to split within the tunnel and each part of the train be driven out to opposite ends has been removed. However, the proposal to allow shorter trains was not passed. Eurotunnel Chairman & Chief Executive Jacques Gounon said that he hoped the liberalisation of rules would allow entry into the market of competitors such as Deutsche Bahn. Sources at Eurotunnel suggested that Deutsche Bahn could have entered <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>at</b> the timetable change in December 2012. This, however, did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} moissanite {{is found}} in only minute quantities in certain types of meteorite and in corundum deposits and kimberlite. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades that were already on <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>at</b> that time.|$|E

5|$|Wolfenstein 3D was {{the second}} major release by id Software, after the Commander Keen series of episodes. In mid-1991, {{programmer}} John Carmack experimented with making a fast 3D game engine by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single plane, producing Hovertank 3D and Catacomb 3-D as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly Keen to a more violent theme, programmer John Romero suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter Castle Wolfenstein as a fast-paced action game. He and designer Tom Hall designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>at</b> the time. Wolfenstein 3D features artwork by Adrian Carmack and sound effects and music by Bobby Prince. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the shareware model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest. An additional episode, Spear of Destiny, was released as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen.|$|E

25|$|The English {{government}} actively promoted gin {{production to}} utilize surplus grain {{and to raise}} revenue. Encouraged by public policy, very cheap spirits flooded <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>at</b> {{a time when there}} was little stigma attached to drunkenness and when the growing urban poor in London sought relief from the newfound insecurities and harsh realities of urban life.
