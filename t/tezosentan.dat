40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} short-term <b>tezosentan</b> treatment on cardiac function, pulmonary edema and long-term evolution of heart failure (HF) in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). BackgroundEndothelin (ET) may {{play a major role}} in the progression from MI to HF. <b>Tezosentan</b> is a new dual ETA/ETBreceptor antagonist. MethodsRats were subjected to coronary artery ligation and were treated with either vehicle or <b>tezosentan</b> (10 mg/kg IV bolus) at 1 h and 24 h after MI. Cardiac hemodynamics and lung weight were measured at 48 h after MI. Survival was assessed over a five-month period. ResultsAt 48 h after ligation, vehicle-treated rats developed HF, as evidenced by a marked increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), reduction in dP/dtmaxand mean arterial pressure (MAP), and development of pulmonary edema. <b>Tezosentan</b> treatment attenuated the increase in LVEDP and in lung weight and slightly reduced MAP without affecting dP/dtmax. Infarct size was not modified by <b>tezosentan.</b> Despite the fact that treatment with <b>tezosentan</b> was stopped after 24 h, the initial <b>tezosentan</b> administration significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy (22 %) and decreased mortality by 51 % at five months (50 % survival vs. 19 % survival in vehicle-treated rats, p < 0. 001). ConclusionsTezosentan administered during the first day after MI in rats, in addition to improving acutely hemodynamic conditions, markedly increases long-term survival. This increase is associated with a decrease of pulmonary edema and prevention of cardiac hypertrophy. <b>Tezosentan</b> could be a safe and useful therapeutic agent in the prevention and treatment of ischemic HF...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} the non-selective endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) receptor blocker <b>tezosentan</b> antagonizes ovine acute lung injury (ALI) following infusion of endotoxin or ET- 1 by reducing the enhanced lung microvascular pressure, although we could not exclude {{the possibility of a}} simultaneous decline in microvascular permeability. In the present study, our aim was to find out if <b>tezosentan</b> reverses the rise in microvascular filtration coefficient (Kfc) in rat lungs that have been isolated and perfused 12 h after cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) or infusion of ET- 1. Methods: Wistar rats (n = 42) were subjected to CLP. Postoperatively, rats were randomized to a CLP group (n = 7) and a CLP + <b>tezosentan</b> group (n = 7); the latter received <b>tezosentan</b> 30 mg/kg. A sham-operated group (n = 5) underwent laparotomy without CLP. Twelve hours postoperatively, the lungs were isolated and perfused with blood from similarly treated rats that also were used to assess plasma concentration of ET- 1 and protein kinase Cα (PKCα) in lung tissue. Additionally, isolated blood perfused lungs from healthy rats were randomized to a control group (n = 8), an ET- 1 group (n = 7) subjected to pulmonary arterial injection of ET- 1 10 nM, and an ET- 1 + <b>tezosentan</b> group (n = 7) that received <b>tezosentan</b> 30 mg/kg. All lung preparations received papaverine 0. 1 μg/kg added to the perfusate for vasoplegia. Pulmonary hemodynamic variables, Kfc and lung compliance (CL) were assessed. Results: After CLP, the plasma concentration of ET- 1 increased. Papaverine abolished the vasoconstrictor response to ET- 1 and the pulmonary vascular pressures remained close to baseline throughout the experiments. Both CLP and injection of ET- 1 caused significant changes in Kfc and CL that were prevented in tezosentan-treated rats. Compared to sham-operated animals, CLP increased the content of PKCα by 50 % and 70 % in the cytosolic and the membrane fractions of lung tissue homogenates, respectively. <b>Tezosentan</b> prevented the upregulation of PKCα in the membrane fraction.

40|$|Both {{phosphodiesterase}} 5 (PDE 5) inhibition and endothelin (ET) receptor blockade {{have been}} shown to induce pulmonary vasodilation. However, {{little is known about the}} effect of combined blockade of these two vasoconstrictor pathways. Since nitric oxide (NO) exerts its pulmonary vasodilator influence via production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as well as through inhibition of ET, we hypothesised that interaction between the respective signalling pathways precludes an additive vasodilator effect. We tested this hypothesis in chronically instrumented swine exercising on a treadmill by comparing the vasodilator effect of the PDE 5 -inhibitor EMD 360527, the ETA/ETB-antagonist <b>tezosentan,</b> and combined EMD 360527 and <b>tezosentan.</b> In the systemic circulation, vasodilation by <b>tezosentan</b> and EMD 360527 was additive, both at rest and during exercise, resulting in 17 ± 2 % drop in blood pressure. In the pulmonary circulation, both EMD 360527 and <b>tezosentan</b> produced vasodilation. However, <b>tezosentan</b> produced no additional pulmonary vasodilation in the presence of EMD 360527, either at rest or during exercise. Moreover, in isolated preconstricted porcine pulmonary small arteries (~ 300 μm) EMD 360527 (1 nM- 10 μM) induced dose-dependent vasodilation, while <b>tezosentan</b> (1 nM- 10 μM) failed to elicit vasodilation irrespective of the presence of EMD 360527. However, both PDE 5 -inhibition and 8 Br-cGMP, but not cAMP, blunted pulmonary small artery contraction to ET and its precursor Big ET in vitro. In conclusion, in healthy swine, either at rest or during exercise, PDE 5 -inhibition and the associated increase in cGMP produce pulmonary vasodilation that is mediated in part through inhibition of the ET-pathway, thereby precluding an additive vasodilator effect of ETA/ETB receptor blockade in the presence of PDE 5 -inhibition...|$|E

Changes in shear stress were brought about by varying local peripheral resistance and stroke volume using a distal infusion of acetylcholine and stimulation of the left ansa subclavia. An increase in Sm from 1. 81 ± 0. 3 to 7. 29 ± 0. 7 N m− 2 (means ± S. E.

40|$|Withdrawal of the endothelin (ET) -mediated {{vasoconstrictor}} influence {{contributes to}} metabolic coronary vasodilation during exercise. Because production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids increases with increasing shear stress and because NO and prostanoids {{are able to}} modify the release of ET, we hypothesized that the withdrawal of ET-mediated coronary vasoconstriction during exercise is mediated through NO and/or prostanoids. To test this hypothesis, 19 chronically instrumented swine were studied at rest and while running on a treadmill up to 85 - 90 % of maximal heart rate. Blockade of ETA/ET B receptors with <b>tezosentan</b> resulted {{in an increase in}} coronary venous O 2 levels (i. e., in coronary vasodilation) at rest, which waned at increasing levels of exercise intensity. Inhibition of either NO synthase [Nω-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) ] or cyclooxygenase (indomethacin) did not affect the response to <b>tezosentan</b> under resting conditions but unmasked a vasodilator response to <b>tezosentan</b> during exercise. The vasodilator response to <b>tezosentan</b> during exercise increased progressively after combined administration of L-NNA and indomethacin.

Methods: 14 anaesthetised, ventilated pigs, with a mean±SEM weight of 30, 5 ± 0, 6 kg, were studied, in normoxia (FiO(2) â 0, 21) and with <b>tezosentan</b> (5 mg·kg(- 1)) infusion during (n= 7) or before (n= 7) hypoxia (FiO(2) ∼ 0, 10). Results: Compared to normoxia, hypoxia, increased (p< 0, 05) pulmonary vascular resistance by 3, 4 ± 0, 7 WU, mean pulmonary artery pressure by 13, 7 ± 1, 3 mmHg, mean right atrial pressure by 1, 9 ± 0, 4 mmHg and decreased (p< 0, 02) systemic vascular resistance by 5, 2 ± 2, 1 WU. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean aortic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and blood-O(2) -consumption were unaltered (p=ns). <b>Tezosentan</b> infused during hypoxia, normalised pulmonary vascular resistance, decreased (p< 0, 05) maximally mean pulmonary artery pressure by 7, 5 ± 0, 8 mmHg, systemic vascular resistance by 5, 8 ± 0, 7 WU, mean aortic blood pressure by 10, 8 ± 3, 0 mmHg and increased (p< 0, 04) stroke volume by 8, 5 ± 1, 8 mL.

40|$|Acute lung injury {{remains a}} {{frequent}} and life threatening consequence of severe sepsis. This thesis has investigated {{the role of}} the endothelin (ET) system in sepsis-induced lung injury, with special reference to its effects on two hallmarks of this syndrome - formation of edema and pulmonary hypertension. This was explored in a porcine endotoxin model of sepsis in vivo, as well as in vitro using isolated porcine pulmonary vessels. In paper I we show that endotoxemia via ET-dependent mechanisms predominately increases pulmonary downstream resistance and subsequently augment pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. In addition, we demonstrate that ETB-receptor stimulation constricts pulmonary veins more than arteries in vitro. In paper II, we show that endotoxin-exposure induces differentiated effects in isolated pulmonary arteries and veins. In veins, endotoxin increases ET-receptor dependent constriction, whereas the response to α 1 -adrenergic stimulation, predominantly acting on arteries, is reduced. In addition, we demonstrate that the changes in response to ET receptor stimulation are not induced by alterations in expression or distribution of ET-receptors in the preparations. In paper III we find that inhalation of a dual ET-receptor antagonist, <b>tezosentan,</b> during porcine endotoxemia potently reduces pulmonary hypertension without causing systemic effects. In paper IV we show that endotoxemia induces a marked degranulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils with increased plasma levels of the highly permeability and edema promoting heparin-binding protein (HBP/CAP 37). Treatment with <b>tezosentan</b> distinctly counteracts this increase and simultaneously reduces pulmonary edema, improves respiratory system compliance and decreases hemoglobin concentration, all suggesting that <b>tezosentan</b> treatment reduces transcapillary fluid passage. In conclusion, our studies show that endotoxemia increases pulmonary capillary filtration pressure, raises levels of the powerful permeability promoting mediator HBP and induces pulmonary edema. Systemic treatment with a dual ET-receptor antagonist markedly counteracts these changes. In addition, inhaled <b>tezosentan</b> efficiently and selectively reduces pulmonary hypertension during endotoxemia. Taken together, these results show that the ET-system is extensively involved in the pathophysiology of endotoxin-induced lung injury. These findings need to be further elucidated, in other experimental conditions and in humans...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Studies {{in vitro}} reveal that endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) {{activates}} the α isoform of protein kinase C (PKC-α) in cultures of endothelial cells, thereby deranging cellular integrity. Sepsis and endotoxemia {{are associated with}} increased plasma concentrations of ET- 1 that induce acute lung injury (ALI). We recently reported that non-selective ET- 1 receptor blockade attenuates ALI in sheep by reducing the endotoxin-induced increase in extravascular lung water index (EVLWI). The {{aim of this study}} was to find out whether this attenuation is associated with reduced translocation of PKC-α from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction of lung tissue homogenate. Methods: Seventeen awake, instrumented sheep were randomly assigned to a sham-operated group (n = 3), a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group (n = 7) receiving an intravenous infusion of Escherichia coli 15 ng/kg per min for 24 hours, and a <b>tezosentan</b> group (n = 7) subjected to LPS and, from 4 hours, an intravenous injection of <b>tezosentan</b> 3 mg/kg followed by infusion at 1 mg/kg per hour for the reminder of the experiment. Pulmonary micro-occlusion pressure (Pmo), EVLWI, plasma concentrations of ET- 1, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) were determined every 4 hours. Western blotting was used to assess PKC-α. Results: In non-treated sheep a positive correlation was found between the plasma concentration of ET- 1 and Pmo in the late phase of endotoxemia (12 to 24 hours). A positive correlation was also noticed between Pmo and EVLWI in the LPS and the LPS plus <b>tezosentan</b> groups, although the latter was significantly reduced in comparison with LPS alone. In both endotoxemic groups, plasma concentrations of ET- 1, TNF-α, and IL- 8 increased.

The effects of intravenous <b>tezosentan</b> (a nonselective ETA and ETB receptor antagonist) (8 mg·kg(- 1) ·h(- 1)) on resting levels of CSNA, arterial pressure, and heart rate were determined in conscious normal sheep (n = 6) and sheep with pacing-induced HF (n = 7). HF was associated with a significant decrease in ejection fraction (from 74 ± 2 % to 38 ± 1 %, P < 0. 001) and a significant increase in resting levels of CSNA burst incidence (from 56 ± 11 to 87 ± 2 bursts/ 100 heartbeats, P < 0. 01). Infusion of <b>tezosentan</b> for 60 min significantly decreased resting mean aterial pressure (MAP) in both normal and HF sheep (- 8 ± 4 mmHg and - 4 ± 3 mmHg, respectively; P < 0. 05).

Hemodynamic data were measured before APTE and then at 30 -minute intervals. Pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) was calculated as (Ppa-Pw) /CI, where CI was cardiac index or Qt/W (body weight).

Both systolic and diastolic dysfunction is implicated, correlating with severity of illness and mortality The importance of the endothelin (ET) system in normal physiology has been extensively studied. ET is a powerful vasoconstrictive peptide, has cardio-regolatory effects and is released from the endothelium. In sepsis, ET levels are dramatically increased and correlate to severity of disease. Thus, ET has been proposed as a mediator of myocardial {{depression in}} sepsis. Another mechanism P, proposed for cardiac dysfunction is decreased myofilament sensitivity for calcium (Ca 2 +). Levosimendan, a Ca 2 + sensitizing agent, has been used successfully in patients with severe heart failure and decreased myocardial Ca 2 + sensitivity has been shown in septic conditions. The major aims of this thesis was to, in a porcine model in vivo, investigate cardiovascular effects of levosimendan in experimental sepsis, to characterize the influence of the ET system on cardiac performance in the normal and septic heart. Also, to assess myocardial function in endotoxemia and effects of intervention in the ET system by load-independent analysis of the left ventricular pressure-volume relation (LVPVR) by conductance volumetry. Endotoxin administration was associated with major cardiovascular effects, pulmonary hypertension and increased systemic oxygen extraction. Levosimendan attenuated all these effects and also evoked vasodilation which improved splanchnic blood flow. <b>Tezosentan,</b> a dual (ETA/ETB) ET receptor antagonist, was administered in established, highvolume resuscitated endotoxemia and resulted in increased cardiac index, stroke volume index and LV end-diastolic volume by counteracting pulmonary hypertension and improving LV compliance. However, these effects were dosedependent. When increasing the dose of <b>tezosentan</b> ten-fold, the initial beneficial response was not sustained. Exaggerated vasodilation and severely low coronary perfusion pressure is a possible mechanism for the increased mortality seen with the higher dose of <b>tezosentan.</b> Effects of ET receptor activation in the healthy heart were evaluated by LVPVR following intra-coronary infusion of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and sarafotoxin 6 c (S 6 c, ETB receptor agonist). ET- 1 caused dose-related increase and S 6 c a decrease in systolic function, possibly mediated via ETA receptors. Both ETA and S 6 c caused similar impairment in diastolic function, mediated via ETB receptors. By the same methodology, effects of <b>tezosentan</b> were studied in endotoxemia, where endotoxin caused marred relaxation but not systolic dysfunction. <b>Tezosentan</b> caused impairment in parameters of systolic performance but significantly improved diastolic relaxation. We conclude that, in endotoxemia, intervention with levosimendan is beneficial, markedly improving cardiovascular function and regional blood flow. Therefore, levosimendan is a promising drug in septic states and should be evaluated for specific cardiac effects and used in future clinical trials. Furthermore, the ET system contributes significantly to cardiac performance in both healthy and acute experimental septic conditions. Diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension are suitable targets for ET receptor antagonism. Bearing in mind the dose issue and the possible negative inotropic effects, antagonizing the much upregulated ET system in septic patients may well be meaningful to explore in the clinical settin...|$|E
40|$|Myocardial {{depression}} in sepsis is frequently encountered clinically {{and contributes to}} morbidity and mortality. Increased plasma levels of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) have been described in septic shock, and previous reports have shown beneficial effects on cardiovascular performance and survival in septic models using ET receptor antagonists. The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate specific cardiac effects of ET receptor antagonism in endotoxicosis. Sixteen domestic pigs were anesthetized and subjected to endotoxin for 5 h. Eight of these pigs were given <b>tezosentan</b> (dual ET receptor antagonist) after 3 h. Cardiac effects were evaluated using the left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume relationship. Endotoxin was not associated with any effects on parameters of LV contractile function [end-systolic elastance (Ees), preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW), power(max) /end-diastolic volume (PWR(max) /EDV) and dP/dt(max) /end-diastolic volume (dP/dt(max) /EDV) ] but with impairments in isovolumic relaxation (time constant for pressure decay, tau) and mechanical efficiency. <b>Tezosentan</b> administration decreased Ees, PWR(max) /EDV, and dP/dt(max) /EDV, while improving tau and LV stiffness. Thus, dual ET receptor antagonism was associated with a decline in contractile function but, in contrast, improved diastolic function. Positive hemodynamic effects from ET receptor antagonism in acute endotoxemia may be due to changes in cardiac load and enhanced diastolic function rather than improved contractile function...|$|E

AIMS: To {{determine the effect of}} ET- 1 on human and possum GB muscle strip contractility and evaluate whether ET- 1 is present in GB tissue. METHODS: GB muscle strips were mounted in organ baths to measure isometric tension. ET- 1 was added cumulatively with and without pretreatment with the neural blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) or the ET receptor antagonists BQ- 123, BQ- 788, and <b>tezosentan.</b> Immunohistochemical localization of ET was performed on freshly fixed and cultured GBs. RESULTS: ET- 1 induced concentration-dependent increases in tone in human and possum GB strips (p< 0. 05). This response was unaffected by BQ- 123, BQ- 788, and TTX but antagonized by BQ- 123 +BQ- 788 in the human tissue only. <b>Tezosentan</b> (10 (- 4) mol/l) blocked the ET- 1 -induced response in human and possum GB strips (p< 0. 001). Although ET immunoreactivity was absent in freshly fixed possum GB, immunoreactivity was observed in the GB epithelium of freshly fixed human tissue and in both possum and human tissue following 24 h of organ culture. CONCLUSION: ET- 1 acts directly on human and possum GB smooth muscle producing contractions, possibly via ET-B receptors. ET may be present under pathophysiological conditions altering GB function.

40|$|Sepsis is {{a common}} and serious {{condition}} among patients {{in the intensive care}} unit. It is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response, resulting in cardiovascular instability and impaired organ tissue oxygenation due to hypoperfusion and inflammatory changes. The supportive treatment includes fluid resuscitation and other measures to promote organ perfusion. Hypertonic saline/dextran (HSD) resuscitation has shown improved haemodynamics in haemorrhage. In addition, immuno-modulatory effects have been reported in experimental studies. These effects would in theory also be of benefit in septic shock. The vasoconstrictive peptide endothelin (ET) is involved in several of the sepsis manifestations. Experimental results of ET antagonism in endotoxemia have demonstrated beneficial effects on cardiac performance and regional perfusion. Hypotension due to vasodilation may however be of concern in septic conditions, requiring measures to secure perfusion pressure. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate two different interventions and their ability to affect vital organ perfusion through effects on systemic and regional haemodynamics in porcine endotoxin shock. Specifically, the cardiovascular effects of HSD resuscitation were further evaluated, with focus on regional perfusion. In addition, effects of the new parenteral ET antagonist, <b>tezosentan,</b> on systemic and regional haemodynamics were investigated. Furthermore, <b>tezosentan</b> was combined with HSD with the purpose of preventing ET antagonism-related hypotension, and possibly augment positive cardiovascular effects. In addition, early pro-inflammatory cytokine reponse was studied with both treatments to further evaluate their immunomodulating potential. A model of endotoxin shock in anaesthetized pigs was used in two series of experiments. Haemodynamic responses were assessed using a pulmonary artery catheter, invasive arterial blood pressure and ultrasonic flow probes positioned around the portal vein and the renal and carotid arteries. Plasma TNF-á and IL- 6 levels were monitored. Endotoxemia resulted in a hypodynamic shock including reduced regional blood flow and development of metabolic acidosis. An inflammatory response with increases in cytokine and endothelin- 1 levels was elicited. HSD resuscitation transiently improved cardiac index and mean arterial pressure. Regional blood flow increased in the renal and carotid, but not portal circulation. The progression of acidosis was delayed and the macro- and microcirculatory improvements resulted in improved survival rates. <b>Tezosentan</b> treatment resulted in vasodilation, which improved cardiac index, reversed pulmonary hypertension and increased portal and carotid, but not renal blood flow. Addition of HSD to <b>tezosentan</b> did not increase mean arterial pressure, but markedly increased portal and carotid perfusion. None of the interventions affected TNF-á and IL- 6 response. In conclusion, transient beneficial effects of HSD on systemic and renal haemodynamics were confirmed, and improved early survival indicated. From a clinical perspective, HSD resuscitation may gain time for other treatments to have their effects. The immunomodulatory potential of HSD in endotoxemia was not supported by the results from this study. However, ET antagonism as a means to promote organ perfusion was supported by the results. The improved regional flow demonstrated with combined tezosentan/HSD emphasizes the importance of additional measures to secure perfusion pressure during ET antagonism...|$|E
40|$|Background Endothelin 1 is {{a potent}} {{endogenous}} vasoconstrictor neurohormone, and endothelin 1 plasma concentrations predict adverse outcomes in patients with acute. heart failure (AHF). Tezosentan; an intravenous endothelin receptor antagonist, improved hemodynamics in patients with AHF; however, its effects on morbidity and mortality have not been evaluated. Methods The VERITAS program consists of 2 identical, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, concurrently conducted trials (VERITAS- 1 and VERITAS- 2), performed in 150 centers in Europe, Israel, Australia, and North America: The {{program is designed to}} enroll at least 1760 patients hospitalized with dyspnea at rest because of AHF requiring intravenous therapy. In addition to conventional therapy, patients are randomized to receive <b>tezosentan</b> (5 mg/h for 30 minutes, then 1 mg/h for 24 - 72 hours) or matching placebo. The 2 prespecified primary end points are the incidence of death or worsening heart failure at 7 days in the combined studies and the change from baseline in dyspnea over the first 24 hours of treatment; measured using a visual analog scale in VERITAS- 1 and VERITA 52, individually. Results Enrollment started in April 2003, and the program was discontinued in November 2005 because of the low probability,of achieving a significant treatment effect. Conclusions No currently available agents have been shown in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial to improve outcomes in patients with AHF. Thus, the VERITAS program will provide valuable insights into the effect of <b>tezosentan</b> on clinical outcomes in patients with AHF, as well as hemodynamics and clinical symptoms...|$|E

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) -induced {{coronary}} vasodilation {{is mediated}} through production of {{cyclic guanosine monophosphate}} (cGMP) and through inhibition of the endothelin- 1 (ET) system. We previously demonstrated that phosphodiesterase- 5 (PDE 5) -mediated cGMP breakdown and ET each exert a vasoconstrictor influence on coronary resistance vessels. However, {{little is known about}} the integrated control of coronary resistance vessel tone by these two vasoconstrictor mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of PDE 5 and ET to the regulation of coronary resistance vessel tone in swine both in vivo, at rest and during graded treadmill exercise, and in vitro. ETA/ETB receptor blockade with <b>tezosentan</b> (3 mg/kg iv) and PDE 5 inhibition with EMD 360527 (300 μg·min- 1 ·kg- 1 iv) each produced coronary vasodilation at rest and during exercise as well as in preconstricted isolated coronary small arteries. In contrast, <b>tezosentan</b> failed to produce further coronary vasodilation in the presence of EMD 360527, both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, EMD 360527 (3 μM) and cGMP analog 8 -Br-cGMP (100 μM) had no significant effects on ET-induced contractions of isolated porcine coronary small arteries, suggesting unperturbed ET receptor responsiveness. In contrast, PDE 5 inhibition and cGMP blunted the contractions produced by the ET precursor Big ET, but only in vessels with intact endothelium, suggesting that PDE 5 inhibition limited ET production in the endothelium of small coronary arteries.

40|$|AIMS: Changes in {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} (SBP) during an admission for acute heart failure (AHF), especially those leading to hypotension, have been suggested to increase the risk for adverse outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed associations of SBP decrease during the first 24 [*]h from randomization with serum creatinine changes at the last time-point available (72 [*]h), using linear regression, and with 30 - and 180 -day outcomes, using Cox regression, in 1257 patients in the VERITAS study. After multivariable adjustment for baseline SBP, greater SBP decrease at 24 [*]h from randomization was associated with greater creatinine increase at 72 [*]h and greater risk for 30 -day all-cause death, worsening heart failure (HF) or HF readmission. The hazard ratio (HR) for each 1 [*]mmHg decrease in SBP at 24 [*]h for 30 -day death, worsening HF or HF rehospitalization was 1. 01 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 00 - 1. 02; P[*]=[*] 0. 021].

40|$|BackgroundVascular leakage and oedema {{formation}} are key components in sepsis. In septic patients, plasma {{levels of the}} vasoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory peptide endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) correlate with mortality. During sepsis, neutrophils release heparin-binding protein (HBP) known to increase vascular permeability {{and to be a}} promising biomarker of human sepsis. As disruption of ET-signalling in endotoxemia attenuates formation of oedema, we hypothesized that this effect could be related to decreased levels of HBP. To investigate this, we studied the effects of ET-receptor antagonism on plasma HBP and {{oedema formation}} in a porcine model of sepsis. In addition, to further characterize a potential endothelin/HBP interaction, we investigated the effects of graded ET-receptor agonist infusions. MethodsSixteen anesthetized pigs were subjected to 5 h of endotoxemia and were randomized to receive either the ET-receptor antagonist <b>tezosentan</b> or vehicle after 2 h. Haemodynamics, gas-exchange and lung water were monitored. In separate experiments, plasma HBP was measured in eight non-endotoxemic animals exposed to graded infusion of ET- 1 or sarafotoxin 6 c. ResultsEndotoxemia increased plasma ET- 1, plasma HBP, and extravascular lung water. Tezosentan-treatment markedly attenuated plasma HBP and extravascular lung water, and these parameters correlated significantly. <b>Tezosentan</b> decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and increased respiratory compliance. In non-endotoxemic pigs graded ET- 1 and sarafotoxin 6 c infusions caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma HBP. ConclusionsET-receptor antagonism reduces porcine endotoxin-induced pulmonary oedema and plasma levels of the oedema-promoting protein HBP. Moreover, direct ET-receptor stimulation distinctively increases plasma HBP.

We tested the hypothesis that chronic voluntary wheel running (RUN) prevents impairments in insulin-stimulated vasodilation associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes independent of the effects of RUN on adiposity by randomizing Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of hyperphagia-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes, to 1) RUN, 2) caloric restriction (CR; diet adjusted to match body weights of RUN group), or 3) sedentary control (SED) groups (n = 8 /group) at 4 wk. At 40 wk, NO- and ET- 1 -mediated vasoreactivity to insulin (1 – 1, 000 μIU/ml) was assessed in the presence of a nonselective ET- 1 receptor blocker (<b>tezosentan)</b> or a NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor [NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) ], respectively, in second-order arterioles isolated from the white portion of the gastrocnemius muscle. Body weight, fasting plasma glucose, and hemoglobin A 1 c were lower in RUN and CR than SED (P < 0. 05); however, the glucose area under the curve (AUC) following the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was lower only in the RUN group (P < 0. 05). Vasodilator responses to all doses of insulin were greater in RUN than SED or CR in the presence of a <b>tezosentan</b> (P < 0. 05), but group differences in vasoreactivity to insulin with coadministration of l-NAME were not observed.

From the isthmic aortic and left pulmonary artery (PA) flows (Q) and isthmic aortic, PA, and left auricle pressures (P) on day 135 in 10 controls and 7 CDH fetuses (28 ewes), discrete-triggered P and Q waveforms were modelized as Pt and Qt functions to obtain basic hemodynamic profiles, pulsatile waves [P, Q, and entry impedance (Ze) ], and P and Q hysteresis loops. In the controls, blood propelling energy was accounted for by biventricular ejection flow waves (kinetic energy) with low Ze and by flow-driven pressure waves (potential energy) with low Ze. Weak fetal pulmonary perfusion was ensured by reflux (reverse flows) from PA branches to the ductus anteriosus and aortic isthmus as reverse flows. Endothelin-receptor antagonist blockade using <b>tezosentan</b> slightly increased the forward flow but largely increased diastolic backward flow with a diminished left auricle pre- and postloading. In CHD fetuses, the static component overrode phasic flows that were detrimental to reverse flows and the direction of the diastolic isthmic flow changed to forward during the diastole period. Decreased cardiac output, flattened pressure waves, and increased forward Ze promoted backward flow to the detriment of forward flow (especially during diastole). Additionally, the intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunting was ineffective. The slowing of cardiac output, the dampening of energetic pressure waves and pulsatility, and the heightening of phasic impedances contributed to the lowering of aortopulmonary blood flows. We speculate that reverse pulmonary flow is a physiological requirement to protect the fetal pulmonary circulation from the prominent right ventricular stream and to enhance blood flow to the fetal heart and brain...|$|E

Superior mesenteric artery from Wistar–Kyoto rats was occluded (90 [*]min) and reperfused (24 [*]h). The effect of <b>tezosentan,</b> a dual endothelin (ET) -receptor antagonist, was studied in ischemic (IO) and sham-operated (SO) animals. MRA structure and mechanics were assessed by pressure myography. Nuclei distribution, elastin content and organization, collagen I/III and ET- 1 expression, ET- 1 plasma levels, superoxide anion (O 2 ⋅−) production, and mRNA levels of NAD(P) H-oxidase subunits were measured. To assess ET- 1 effects on O 2 ⋅− production, MRA from non-operated rats were incubated in culture medium with ET- 1. Mesenteric I/R increased MRA wall thickness (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) and cross-sectional area (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) but decreased wall stiffness (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). Arterial remodeling was paralleled by enhancement of: (i) collagen I/III expression (P[*]<[*] 0. 01), ET- 1 expression (P[*]<[*] 0. 05), and O 2 ⋅− formation (P[*]<[*] 0. 01) in the vessel wall; (ii) number of internal elastic lamina (IEL) fenestrae (P[*]<[*] 0. 05); and (iii) plasma levels of ET- 1 (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). Moreover, ET- 1 increased O 2 ⋅− (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) production in cultured MRA. <b>Tezosentan</b> prevented hypertrophic remodeling and collagen I/III deposition, and enhanced O 2 ⋅− production, but it did not affect the decreased wall stiffness after mesenteric I/R. These results indicate that 90 [*]min occlusion/ 24 [*]h reperfusion induces hypertrophic remodeling of MRA linked to ET- 1 -mediated increase of collagen and O 2 ⋅−. Decreased stiffness may be associated with increased number of IEL fenestrae.

The renal effects were compared against a control group, where kidneys were perfused only with the modified Krebs-Henseleit solution. Myotoxins from Bothrops jararacussu and the lectin from Bothrops moojeni increased the perfusion pressure (C 120 = 110. 28 Â 3. 09, Bthtx I 120 = 171. 20 Â 6. 3 *,Bthtx II 120 = 175. 50 Â 7. 20 * and BmLec 120 = 152. 50 Â 2. 10 *), the renal vascular resistance (C 120 = 5. 46 Â 0. 54, Bthtx I 120 = 8. 62 Â 0. 37 *, Bthtx II 120 = 8. 90 Â 0. 36 * and BmLec 120 = 7. 77 Â 0. 30 *), the urinary flow (C 120 = 0. 143 Â 0. 008, Bthtx I 120 = 0. 326 Â 0. 048 *, and Bthtx II 120 = 0. 373 Â 0. 085 *), the glomerular filtration rate (C 120 = 0. 678 Â 0. 065, Bthtx I 120 = 0. 855 Â 0. 133 *, Bthtx II 120 = 1. 224 Â 0. 282 * and BmLec 120 = 1. 037 Â 0. 055 *) and the sodium, potassium and chloride excretion. On the other hand, the same substances decreased the percent of renal tubular transport of sodium (C 120 = 79. 76 Â 0. 56, Bthtx I 120 = 62. 23 Â 4. 12 *, Bthtx II 120 = 70. 96 Â 2. 93 * and BmLec 60 = 77. 25 Â 1. 36 *), potassium (C 60 = 66. 38 Â 3. 31, Bthtx I 60 = 55. 79 Â 5. 57 *, Bthtx II 60 = 50. 86 Â 6. 16 * and BmLec 60 = 59. 78 Â 3. 49 *). Indomethacin inhibited the renal effects induced by Bothrops jararacussu myotoxin I and Bothrops moojeni lectin, but partially blocked the effects promoted by myotoxin II and the lectin of Bothrops jararacussu, and the effects of myotoxin I of Bothrops moojeni. <b>Tezosentan</b> inhibited the renal effects induced by B. moojeni myotoxin I. In conclusion, prostaglandins are involved in the renal alterations induced by myotoxins and lectins purified from the snake venoms of Bothrops jararacussu and Bothrops moojeni. In addition, endothelin is the main mediator of the renal alterations promoted by Bothrops moojeni myotoxin...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{therapeutic}} trials {{regarding the}} management of acute heart failure (AHF) failed to demonstrate the efficacy of newer therapeutic modalities and agents. Low- versus high-dose and continuous administration of furosemide were shown not to matter. Ultrafiltration was {{not found to be}} more efficacious than sophisticated diuretic therapy including dose-adjusted intravenous furosemide and metolazone. Dopamine and nesiritide were not shown to be superior to current therapy. <b>Tezosentan</b> and tovalptan had no effect on mortality. The development of rolofylline was terminated due to adverse effect (seizures). Lastly, preliminary experience with serelaxin indicates a mortality improvement at six months that remains to be confirmed. The disappointing findings of these recent trials may reflect the lack of efficacy of newer therapeutic modalities and agents. Alternatively the disappointing findings of these recent trials may be in part due to methodological issues. The AHF syndrome is complex with many clinical phenotypes. Failure to match clinical phenotypes and therapeutic modalities is likely to be partly responsible for the disappointing findings of recent AHF trials...|$|E

Phasic {{hemodynamics}} {{and reverse}} blood flows in the aortic isthmus and pulmonary arteries of preterm lambs with pulmonary vascular dysfunction. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 295 : H 2231 -H 2241, 2008. First published September 26, 2008; doi: 10. 1152 /ajpheart. 00410. 2008. Time-domain {{representations of the}} fetal aortopulmonary circulation were carried out in lamb fetuses to study hemodynamic consequences of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) {{and the effects of}} endothelin-receptor antagonist <b>tezosentan</b> (3 mg/ 45 min). From the isthmic aortic and left pulmonary artery (PA) flows (Q) and isthmic aortic, PA, and left auricle pressures (P) on day 135 in 10 controls and 7 CDH fetuses (28 ewes), discrete-triggered P and Q waveforms were modelized as P(t) and Q(t) functions to obtain basic hemodynamic profiles, pulsatile waves [P, Q, and entry impedance (Z(e)) ], and P and Q hysteresis loops. In the controls, blood propelling energy was accounted for by biventricular ejection flow waves (kinetic energy) with low Z(e) and by flow-driven pressure waves (potential energy) with low Z(e). Weak fetal pulmonary perfusion was ensured by reflux (reverse flows) from PA branches to the ductus anteriosus and aortic isthmus as reverse flows. Endothelin-receptor antagonist blockade using <b>tezosentan</b> slightly increased the forward flow but largely increased diastolic backward flow with a diminished left auricle pre-and postloading. In CHD fetuses, the static component overrode phasic flows that were detrimental to reverse flows and the direction of the diastolic isthmic flow changed to forward during the diastole period. Decreased cardiac output, flattened pressure waves, and increased forward Z(e) promoted backward flow to the detriment of forward flow (especially during diastole). Additionally, the intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunting was ineffective. The slowing of cardiac output, the dampening of energetic pressure waves and pulsatility, and the heightening of phasic impedances contributed to the lowering of aortopulmonary blood flows. We speculate that reverse pulmonary flow is a physiological requirement to protect the fetal pulmonary circulation from the prominent right ventricular stream and to enhance blood flow to the fetal heart and brain...|$|E
