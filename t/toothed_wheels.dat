40|$|AbstractFluid coolant {{has been}} widely used for cooling, lubrication, {{and the removal of}} cutting chips in the {{grinding}} process; however, it can generate grinding marks due to the hydrodynamic force especially in case of a lack of the spindle stiffness. This leads to inflection patterns on the workpiece, with sub-micrometer level of waviness, which is quite critical in rotationally symmetric ultraprecision grinding. In this study, we propose the use of a <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel</b> which is remarkably efficient in suppressing the inflection pattern by minimizing the hydrodynamic pressure. A <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel</b> has a simple geometry with a peripheral surface similar to a saw. The teeth disturb the generation of the coolant flux layer and noticeably decrease the hydrodynamic force. Furthermore, the <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel</b> increases the net grinding force due to the tangential cutting edge. This study simulated the hydrodynamic pressure in the grinding process and validated the flat surface grinding results by varying the tooth geometry. A comparison showed that the hydrodynamic force was decreased by 20 – 35 % and that the inflection pattern of the ground surface was markedly decreased in rotational symmetric grinding...|$|R

40|$|<b>Toothed</b> <b>wheels</b> {{constitute}} {{essential part}} of the steel structural elements market. The most often hypereutectoid structural steels forcarburizing are used for <b>toothed</b> <b>wheels.</b> The final producers of <b>toothed</b> <b>wheels</b> are not demanding regarding a microstructure, providedthat the determined requirements will be fulfilled (e. g. metallurgical purity determined by ultrasounds). Therefore delivered forgings can be in an annealed or quenched state. This results from the situation that the final heat treatment or heat-chemical one is being done at one of the last stages of the toothed wheel production. An essential factor allowing to develop the proper heat treatment is the knowledge of the kinetics of phase transformations of undercooled austenite and its relating to technological conditions, being at the producer disposal, as well as to forging dimensions. Such investigations should be carried out on real melts used for forgings for <b>toothed</b> <b>wheels</b> production together with an analysis of microstructure changes on the forging cross-section. They should be based on calculation methods determining the distribution of cooling rates on its cross-section in dependence of an applied cooling medium.
