5000|$|On June 18 2003, {{near the}} Syrian border, AC-130 Spectre gunships guided in by TF 20 {{operators}} destroyed {{a convoy of}} Ba'ath Party members escaping to Syria, intelligence indicated that the convoy may included Saddam Hussein and/or his sons, other reports claim the convoy was composed of oil smugglers. Once the convoy was destroyed by the AC-130s, TF 20 conducted a heliborne assault into a nearby compound {{that proved to be}} a Ba'athist safehouse for ferrying FREs (Former Regime Elements) across the border, the operators then came under fire from Syrian border guards leading to a firefight that left several of the border guards dead with 17 more captured who were immediately released. On July 22, 2003, a former Ba'athist regime member used an informer to pass intelligence onto the 101st Airborne Division that Uday and Qusay Hussein (whom had $15 million bounty), along with Qusays' son and a bodyguard, were hiding in the informers home in Mosul; the 101st passed this information to their divisional special forces liaison, whom passed it onto TF 20. Platoons from the 101st Airborne set up an outer cordon around the target house, a Delta assault team prepared to breach and clear the building from the entrance, whilst a Delta interpreter called upon the occupants to surrender. The informer and his two sons left the building as previously agreed. Delta operators breached and entered, upon which they were immediately engaged by small arms fire, which wounded one Delta operator. As they withdrew from the house, the occupants threw grenades from the second floor on them, and several Delta operators were lightly wounded by the grenade fragments; the stairs had also been blocked to impede any rapid assault. Another group of assaulters fast roped from a MH-6 Little Bird onto the roof of the building to examine the possibility of entering the building through the roof, but this wasn't possible. The decision was taken to soften up the target with heavy weapons before another entry. After soldiers of the 101st Airborne engaged the building with [...]50cal HMGs and M136 anti tank rockets, a third entry attempt was made, but was again driven back by intense gunfire. The 101st fired 10 TOW missiles from HMMWV-mounted <b>TOW</b> II <b>antitank</b> <b>guided</b> missiles into the house, followed by repeated gun runs from OH-58 Kiowas firing 2.75 rockets and [...]50cal machine guns. Delta subsequently made a successful entry and moved up onto the second floor, finding Qusay and the bodyguard dead. Qusay's son was hiding under a bed and opened fired on the operators, leaving them no choice but to kill him. Uday was discovered wounded and armed, a Delta operator shot and killed him.|$|R
50|$|The French char de bataille Char B {{tank was}} a very {{formidable}} tank, with heavy cast and riveted armour, the same long 47 mm gun as in the S 35, and a hull-mounted 75 mm howitzer. All Char Bs were equipped with radio and the tank was nearly invulnerable to most tanks and <b>towed</b> <b>antitank</b> guns. They equipped the armoured divisions of the Infantry, which were specialised breakthrough units.|$|R

5000|$|The {{helicopters}} {{used were}} British Army Westland Lynx AH.7s. One is an AH.7(DAS) variant, noticeable for the distinctive [...] "disco ball" [...] infra-red jammer under the tail. The {{other is a}} [...] "stock" [...] AH.7, albeit with a <b>TOW</b> <b>antitank</b> missile sight mounted over the left-hand front seat. Although only two helicopters were used, post-production techniques such as split screen editing, camera angles and CGI produced the huge number of helicopters seen in the video.|$|R
50|$|The army {{retains a}} {{considerable}} supply of 122mm and 152mm towed artillery pieces and multiple rocket launchers. Twelve of its APCs are mounted with Soviet AT-3 (Sagger) <b>antitank</b> <b>guided</b> missiles. The army retains numerous antitank guns and a stock of Soviet shoulder-fired antiaircraft missile launchers.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of large HEAT warheads, {{with a long}} effective range relative to a tank gun, and with high accuracy meant that heavy tanks could no longer function in the stand-off, or overwatch role. Much cheaper <b>antitank</b> <b>guided</b> missiles could fill this role just as well.|$|R
50|$|The {{project was}} {{initiated}} by the Red Army's need to replace the aging five-turreted T-35 tank based on combat experience in the Spanish Civil War. One of the lessons the Red Army drew from this conflict was the need for heavy 'shell-proof' armor on medium and heavy tanks. Although the T-35 was never used in Spain, its thin armor was vulnerable to the small <b>towed</b> <b>antitank</b> guns and gun-armed tanks encountered there by Soviet T-26 and BT tanks.|$|R
25|$|BK 117 A-3M :Military version {{introduced}} in 1986. The A-3M is fitted with taller skids and can carry 11 troops. A Browning 12.7mm (0.5in) machine gun can be mounted under the fuselage in a Lucas turret with 450 rounds {{and controlled by}} a helmet-mounted sight. The A-3M also has outrigger pylons which can hold up to eight HOT II or <b>TOW</b> <b>antitank</b> missiles or a variety of air-to-air missiles, rocket-pods, or forward-firing cannons. Provisions for a doorway gunner's position with a 12.7mm (0.5in) gun can also be installed.|$|R

50|$|<b>Antitank</b> <b>guided</b> {{missiles}} (ATGMs) {{started to}} be deployed widely during this period, and would become an effective replacement for the heavy tanks' long-range firepower. The Soviets made use of them first on BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, and later on the T-64 and other MBTs. Eventually, light, sophisticated reactive armour was used to give the MBTs a further edge in protection without slowing them down.|$|R
50|$|The HOT entered limited {{production}} in 1976, with mass production of 800 missiles a month reached in 1978. The HOT became initially operational with the German and French armies fitted to specialized armored antitank vehicles. In addition, Euromissile {{was in the}} enviable position of having large export orders from Middle East nations {{at the start of}} mass production. This was likely due to the situation in the late 1970s where many nations did not want to rely solely on arms purchases from the USSR combined with the US Congress restrictions on the export sales of the <b>TOW</b> <b>antitank</b> missile.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{versatile}} small German military vehicles, the Kettenkrad, a blend of tractor and motorcycle, was powered with a 1.4 L Olympia four-cylinder engine. Produced by NSU, it had motorcycle-type front-wheel steering for gentle turns and negotiated tight corners with brakes on the propelling caterpillar tracks. The Kettenkrad <b>towed</b> <b>antitank</b> guns and transported troops and signal gear in several theaters of war. NSU continued to make it after the war for use in mines and forests. It {{was one of the}} few vehicles that could do jobs formerly performed by horses for which, owing to the shortage of oats, even less fuel was available than for motor vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The Panhard VCR (Véhicule de Combat à Roues, French for Wheeled Combat Vehicle) {{is a light}} armored {{personnel}} carrier (APC) designed by Panhard for the export market and later used by several countries.
