40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{contemporary}} cancer research is the development of new markers that facilitate earlier and non-invasive diagnosis. MicroRNAs are non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression; studies have shown that their expression levels are altered in cancer. Recently, extra-cellular microRNAs have been detected in biological fluids and studied as possible cancer markers that can be detected by noninvasive procedures. In this review, we analyze the current understanding of extracellular miRNAs based on clinical studies to establish their possible use for the prevention of the most common tumors. Despite discrepancies among different studies of the same cancers, panels of specific extracellular microRNAs are emerging as a new tool for the secondary (selection of high-risk individuals to undergo screening) and <b>tertiary</b> (relapse) <b>prevention</b> of cancer...|$|R
50|$|Finally, <b>tertiary</b> <b>prevention</b> {{attempts}} {{to reduce the}} damage caused by symptomatic disease by focusing on mental, physical, and social rehabilitation. Unlike secondary prevention, which aims to prevent disability, the objective of <b>tertiary</b> <b>prevention</b> is to maximize the remaining capabilities and functions of an already disabled patient. Goals of <b>tertiary</b> <b>prevention</b> include: preventing pain and damage, halting progression and complications from disease, and restoring the health and functions of the individuals affected by disease. For syphilitic patients, rehabilitation includes measures to prevent complete disability from the disease, such as implementing work-place adjustments for the blind and paralyzed or providing counseling to restore normal daily functions to the greatest extent possible.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, <b>tertiary</b> <b>prevention</b> is the {{treatment}} of an existing symptomatic disease process to ameliorate its effects or delay its progress. Such <b>tertiary</b> <b>prevention</b> includes the use of chemical peels, resurfacing techniques (e.g. micro-dermabrasion), ablative or non-ablative laser resurfacing, radio-frequency technology, soft tissue augmentation (also known as fillers), and botulinum toxins. Photorejuvenation procedures are performed by dermatologists to reduce the visible symptoms.|$|E

40|$|General {{practitioners}} are in prime position for promoting primary, secondary and <b>tertiary</b> HIV <b>prevention.</b> Counselling {{is an integral}} part of their work and a key step towards behavioural change of their patients. Particular attention must be given to counselling before and after the HIV antibody test. So far, the extraordinary potential of general practitioners to educate patients about HIV infection has been used insufficiently. The primary barriers to providing health education are lack of knowledge and discomfort with initiating discussions of sexuality or drugs use rather than lack of time or 'other health priorities', etc. These findings show the need to implement education programmes for physicians and other members of their medical practice. Additionally, patients should be encouraged to take the initiative in starting discussions about HIV. In Switzerland, an education programme for physicians is currently under way...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{conducted}} a {{content analysis of}} prevention definitions in the general prevention literature. The {{pros and cons of}} the traditional trilogy (primary, secondary, and <b>tertiary)</b> of <b>prevention</b> definitions are examined, along with a description of key concepts, such as end-states, timing, targets, and eligibility criteria. The authors propose a conceptual alternative to this prevention trilogy, in favor of one that distinguished among prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. Current social and environmental trends have increased concern about the provision of preventive services. Whether focusing on health, mental health, family support and preservation, or education, the case for prevention derives from mounting evidence that service programs that provide information, resources, and opportunities for skill and knowledge development early in the developmental sequence, and in an ongoing rather than a crisis-triggered manner, are both effective and cost-effective. Many of the innovations in social service delivery in health, mental health, and child welfare also can be characterized as efforts to organize an...|$|R

The {{article describes the}} real world experience of Mount Royal University’s Centre for Criminology and Justice Research researchers in conducting {{an evaluation of the}} Police and Crisis Team (PACT) in Grande Prairie, Alberta, including a Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis. PACT, which partners a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer with a mental health professional, represents a blend of secondary and <b>tertiary</b> crime <b>prevention</b> and attempts to diminish crime in the community by addressing the risk factors of individuals with mental health concerns (creating trust with individuals, increasing awareness of resources, and decreasing stigmatization in the community). PACT also specifically targets those individuals with mental health issues who are in contact with the law to try to decrease recidivism and increase community safety. Challenges were present in the evaluation due to the time frame, staff turnover, program start-up issues, and confidentiality and sensitivity of the program focus.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionGlobally, {{dementia}} is {{the most}} frequent form of degenerative condition in the older adult population and poses a major health burden with high socioeconomic costs. So far, attempts to find pharmacologic interventions that can change the onset or progression of dementia have been largely unsuccessful, prompting a shift to focus on interventions aimed at modifying risk factors that occur throughout the life course. MethodsThe Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies, funded by the Medical Research Council, UK, convened three multidisciplinary groups of experts, expert witnesses, and advocates to discuss the state of evidence on primary, secondary, and <b>tertiary</b> dementia <b>prevention</b> and recommend future direction for intervention studies. ResultsUsing the United Kingdom Parliamentary Select Committees' approach to gathering evidence, the primary prevention working group focused their deliberation on risk factors strongly associated with dementia.

50|$|Prevention can {{be broken}} up into three broad {{categories}} of primary, secondary, and <b>tertiary</b> <b>prevention.</b> Primary prevention involves the avoidance of injury. An example is ankle braces being worn as a team, even those with no history of previous ankle injuries. If primary prevention activities were effective, {{there would be a}} lesser chance of injuries occurring in the first place. Secondary prevention involves an early diagnosis and treatment should be acquired once an injury has occurred. The goal of obtaining early diagnosis is to ensure that the injury is receiving proper care and recovering correctly, therefore limiting the concern for other medical problems to stem from the initial traumatic event. Lastly, <b>tertiary</b> <b>prevention</b> is solely focused on the rehabilitation to reduce and correct an existing disability resulting from the traumatic event. An example {{in the case of an}} athlete who has obtained an ankle injury the rehabilitation would consist of balance exercises to acquire the strength and mobility back as well as wearing an ankle brace, while gradually returning to the sport.|$|E

40|$|Nearly 15 % of {{students}} are disciplined in a given year, with 60 % {{of students}} being disciplined at-least once between grades 7 through 12. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the impact of school discipline contact on students’ risk for grade retention and school dropout using a statewide sample of 7 th grade students tracked through their 12 th grade year. Results indicate that school discipline is associated with approximately 4, 700 grade retentions per year in the state of Texas. The delayed workforce entry related to grade retention has an effect of over $ 68 million for the state, including $ 5. 6 million in lost tax revenue. Given the higher discipline rate for minorities, these costs disproportionately affect them. Further, the additional year of instruction costs the state nearly $ 41 million dollars. For each year an individual student is retained the effect on the net social surplus exceeds $ 23, 000. Results also indicate that school discipline relates to a 29 % increase in high school dropout. These additional dropouts account for an economic effect of $ 711 million per year. It is recommended that educational agencies adopt evidenced-based programs that reduce school officials’ use of punitive and exclusionary measures to manage student behavior such as Positive Behavioral Intervention Supports. Further, these results underscore the need for school officials to employ secondary and <b>tertiary</b> dropout <b>prevention</b> programs that are targeted at the most academically and behaviorally at-risk students in schools in addition to primary prevention programs...|$|R
