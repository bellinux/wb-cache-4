5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> the destruction that had become so common on this night.|$|E

5|$|The {{taste of}} the riches of the East {{galvanized}} English interest in the region. Madre de Deus's rutter from Macau was a forerunner to voyages <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> up establishing the East India Company in 1600. By 1603 the newly formed company itself would {{end up with a}} trading factory at Bantam.|$|E

5|$|The {{capture of}} the Royal Irish patrol {{reinforced}} to the British government that its efforts so far—and those of the international community—would {{not be sufficient to}} bring the civil war to an end. In Westminster, meanwhile, opposition politicians renewed their objection to the continued presence of British forces in Sierra Leone. The government was seeking an exit strategy <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> a politically unpopular deployment without abandoning Sierra Leone.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, Washington Academy {{was officially}} chartered, and Thaddeus Dod {{was named the}} first {{principal}} on January 20, 1789, a position he held until July 1790. He was succeeded by David Johnson, who left for Canonsburg in July 1791. While the Washington Academy Board of Trustees still met {{during the period of}} unrest following the Whiskey Act and the subsequent Whiskey Rebellion, educational activities at the academy were essentially at a standstill. James Dobbins took control of the school between 1796 and 1801. Benjamin Mills followed, serving as principal from 1801 to 1805. In 1806, Matthew Brown began his term <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> later that year with the chartering of Washington College.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted a parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah {{was seen as the}} driving force behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E

5|$|While the Democrats {{were in the}} minority, Randall {{spent much}} of his time scrutinizing the Republicans' {{appropriations}} bills. During the Grant administration, he questioned thousands of items in the appropriation bills, often gaining the support of Republicans in excising expenditures that were in excess of the departments' needs. He proposed a bill <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> the practice, common at the time, of executive departments spending beyond what they had been appropriated, then petitioning Congress to retroactively approve the spending with a supplemental appropriation; the legislation passed and became law. The supplemental appropriations were typically rushed through {{at the end of a}} session with little debate. Reacting to the large grants of land given to railroads, he also sought unsuccessfully to ban all land grants to private corporations.|$|E
5|$|On 25 January 2010, Carrick {{scored the}} first-ever League Cup goal {{of his career}} in a 4–3 {{aggregate}} win over rivals Manchester City in the second leg of their semi-final tie. On 6 February, Carrick scored in a 5–0 home win over Portsmouth but it was credited as a Richard Hughes own goal following the game. However, the Dubious Goals Panel officially awarded Carrick the goal on 25 May following a review. On 16 February 2010, he was sent off {{for the first time in}} his career after seeing two yellow cards in United's 3–2 win over A.C. Milan at the San Siro. The midfielder was shown a second yellow card in injury-time after flicking the ball away following Patrice Evra's foul on Alexandre Pato. Carrick played the entire game of the 2010 League Cup Final against Aston Villa, which United won 2–1 resulting in his first League Cup medal. This was the first season of his United career <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> without winning the league title as Chelsea claimed the crown by a single point on the final day of the season.|$|E

25|$|Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano {{said that}} Japan's {{government}} will convene on 13 March {{to gauge the}} economic effects of the catastrophe.

Additional measures could also hurt Japan's public debt (which is already the highest in the world). This additional spending could hurt demand for government bonds.|$|E

At the time, the field goal was the third longest in Super Bowl history. While the rest of the quarter was scoreless, the Patriots were stifling the typically high powered Rams offense by playing physical man coverage with the Rams receivers, forcing them into long drives <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> in punts or field goal attempts.|$|E
25|$|In July 2006, Van Hollen {{urged the}} Bush {{administration}} {{to support a}} ceasefire supported by a peacekeeping force <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> the 2006 Lebanon War.

In follow-up comments, Van Hollen indicated that his original comments were meant as a critique of Bush administration policy but did not retract his position, {{and other members of the}} local Jewish and pro-Israel community defended him.|$|E

25|$|In the 1850s, the British {{showed their}} good will {{to settle the}} {{territorial}} differences with the Central American countries: they withdraw from the Mosquito Coast in Nicaragua and began talks <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> up in {{the restoration of the}} territory to Nicaragua in 1894: returned the Bay Islands to Honduras and even negotiated with the American filibuster William Walker in an effort to avoid the invasion of Honduras.

25|$|After hearing {{arguments}} from scientists and military officers over the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons against Japan (though some recommended using them as demonstrations in unpopulated areas, most recommended using them against built up targets, a euphemistic term for populated cities), Truman ordered the use of the weapons on Japanese cities, hoping it would send a strong message <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>end</b> in the capitulation of the Japanese leadership and avoid a lengthy invasion of the islands. On May 10–11, 1945, the Target Committee at Los Alamos, led by Oppenheimer, recommended Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, and Kokura as possible targets. Concerns about Kyoto's cultural heritage led to it being replaced by Nagasaki.|$|E
