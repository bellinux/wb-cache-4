5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>discharge,</b> bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the battle}} was a British victory, there was {{criticism}} of Bridport's rapid withdrawal.

The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline {{for the remainder of the}} year.
