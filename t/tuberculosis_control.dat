25|$|Early in 2003, the SARS {{epidemic}} brought China to {{a virtual}} standstill. Most <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> activities {{came to a}} stop. However, after the SARS epidemic had been successfully controlled, <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> activities picked up rapidly {{in the second half}} of the year. By the end of 2003, 43% of the estimated total new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis had been diagnosed and treated in the country's DOTS program. With further acceleration of <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> efforts, 64% and 80% of these cases were diagnosed and treated in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The acceleration of efforts to control tuberculosis after the SARS epidemic would not have been possible if the government had not laid the foundation to revitalize the <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> program before 2003. However, the gains in <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> after SARS also resulted from measures to improve the public health system.|$|E

25|$|<b>Tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> {{has been}} a part of China's public health program since the 1950s. China {{developed}} and implemented two 5-year national plans in the 1980s and one 10-year plan in the 1990s to control tuberculosis. On the basis of national surveys in 1979 and 1990, the prevalence of tuberculosis fell by an average of 3.3% every year during the 1980s. In the 1990s, the government implemented two major <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> projects as part of its 10-year plan to control tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|These {{measures}} {{contributed to}} acceleration {{in efforts to}} control tuberculosis. By 2005, the detection of cases of tuberculosis had increased to 80% of the estimated total new cases, permitting China to achieve the 2005 global <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> targets. At the same time, specific efforts to improve <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> also contributed to strengthening {{of the public health}} system. In this case, the strengthening of the disease control program and the public health system had worked together to achieve a desired health outcome.|$|E
25|$|Although a {{strengthened}} public-health {{system has}} accelerated the national <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> effort, progress in <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> has also strengthened the public-health system. In terms of policy, the national <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> program has clear targets and well-defined technical policies {{based on the}} DOTS strategy. National and international partners work in a cohesive manner toward the same targets, with the same implementation framework. Other public-health programs are learning from this successful model. In financial terms, funding from different partners is harmonized under one financing plan with clear funding needs and gaps—another model for other programs. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past—when tuberculosis services were not free—and the success in <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> {{over the past few}} years—when tuberculosis services have been free—have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS—e.g., directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs—are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programs. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them. In terms of information systems, the tuberculosis program's quarterly recording and reporting system has long been a model for other disease control programs. With the new internet-based reporting system for communicable diseases, the tuberculosis program leads the way in the use of information to improve public-health outcomes. Finally, the model of collaboration between hospitals and CDC facilities provided by the <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> program {{is one of the best}} examples to date of how hospitals should be involved in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has influenced the development of new policies that involve hospitals in the work of public health.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether {{laws and regulations}} in Botswana, South Africa and Zambia 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c three countries with a high tuberculosis and HIV infection burden 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c address elements of the World Health Organization (WHO) policy on <b>tuberculosis</b> infection <b>control.</b> MethodsAn online desk review of laws and regulations that address six selected elements of the WHO policy on <b>tuberculosis</b> infection <b>control</b> in the three countries was conducted in November 2015 using publicly available domestic legal databases. The six elements covered: (i) 20 national policy and legal framework; (ii) 20 health facility design, construction and use; (iii) 20 tuberculosis disease surveillance among health workers; (iv) 20 patients 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 and health workers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 rights; (v) 20 monitoring of infection control measures; and (vi) 20 relevant research.

25|$|China is {{developing}} tuberculosis-specific policies and interventions {{to address these}} challenges. The new 5-year implementation plan of the national <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> program (2006–10) has incorporated key elements of the new Stop TB Strategy and the second Global Plan to Stop TB. These include a programmatic approach to {{diagnosis and treatment of}} MDR tuberculosis, <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> in migrants, and tuberculosis/HIV collaborative activities. Additionally, the 5-year plan for implementation of the national HIV/AIDS program aims to stem the rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic by expanding prevention, treatment, and care activities. Implementation of these new policies and interventions will require a substantial increase in both domestic resources and international support, especially for poor areas in China's central-western provinces.|$|E
25|$|Against this backdrop, {{the central}} {{government}} began efforts to revitalise its <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> program in 2000. Most important was the increased political commitment to tackle tuberculosis. In March 2000, the Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang and Vice-Minister of Finance Gao Qiang attended the Ministerial Conference on Tuberculosis and Sustainable Development in Amsterdam, where they committed to strengthen the country's efforts to control tuberculosis. In December 2000, the State Council of China held a nationwide video-teleconference on tuberculosis. Vice-Premier Li Lanqing gave explicit instructions to strengthen the <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> effort. In October 2001, the government issued the second 10-year plan (2001–10) to control tuberculosis. In 2002, {{the central government}} increased its funding for tuberculosis from US$300 000 per year to $4·8 million per year.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} a sound {{financing}} mechanism to fully fund tuberculosis services is a further problem. Although funding for tuberculosis services is at its highest level ever, the Ministry of Health estimates that the national <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> program still had a 23% funding gap in 2005. Additionally, {{more than a quarter}} of current funding comes from external grants and loans, making sustainable funding a major challenge.|$|E

25|$|A further {{difficulty}} is {{presented by the}} shortage of trained health-care workers for <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control.</b> CDC facilities are being rebuilt across the country but many are staffed inadequately or by poorly trained and unmotivated health-care workers. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the challenge of sustaining and further increasing long-term governmental commitment to the control of tuberculosis, which is essential to tackle the other challenges.|$|E
25|$|Although China {{achieved}} the 2005 global targets for <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control,</b> {{these are only}} targets for implementation and monitoring in the national and international efforts to control tuberculosis. More important are the targets of halving the prevalence of, and mortality from, tuberculosis. Countries in the Western Pacific region committed to these targets in 1999, as did the wider international community {{as part of the}} MDGs.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis is a {{major public}} health problem in China. China has the world's third largest cases of {{tuberculosis}} (after India and Indonesia), but progress in <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> was slow during the 1990s. Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> {{can be linked to}} a malfunctioning health system. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public health system. After the government realized the impact that the SARS outbreak had on the country, they increased leadership in their health department. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public health problems and, among other efforts, increased public health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system to improve transparency, reach and speed, and started a program to rebuild local public health facilities and national infrastructure.|$|E

Iron has proven to be essential for pathogenesis of tuberculosis and retinoic acid is known to influence the iron metabolism pathway. Retenoic acid is also known to exhibit antitubercular effect in in vivo system. Therefore there is every possibility that retinoic acid by affecting the iron metabolism pathway exhibits its antimycobacterial effect. These aspects are reviewed in the present manuscript for understanding the antimycobacterial role of retinoic acid in the context of iron metabolism and other immunological aspects...|$|R
40|$|Although {{communication}} {{has recently}} gained increased recognition in <b>tuberculosis</b> (TB) <b>control</b> programs, current thinking and practice remains boxed within the epistemological {{boundaries of the}} "bio-medical" model. The latter posits that information about transmission and care is crucial to promote early diagnosis and treatment. However, when populations confront a series of socio-cultural and structural barriers to access TB care, medical knowledge and awareness alone cannot effectively promote ideal practices. The article suggests that communication programs need to adopt a "social rationality" perspective based on nuanced understanding of community experience of TB. Suggestions are offered about how communication contributes to addressing challenges in TB <b>control.</b> <b>Tuberculosis</b> (TB) Communication Social mobilization Social rationality...|$|R
25|$|A 1997 {{survey of}} 35 {{countries}} found rates above 2% {{in about a}} third of the countries surveyed. The highest rates were in the former USSR, the Baltic states, Argentina, India and China, and was associated with poor or failing national <b>Tuberculosis</b> <b>Control</b> programmes. Likewise, the appearance of high rates of MDR-TB in New York city the early 1990s was associated with the dismantling of public health programmes by the Reagan administration.|$|E
25|$|The project {{funded by}} the World Bank led to several {{important}} achievements. Nearly 1.5 million cases of smear-positive tuberculosis were diagnosed and cured. A large cadre of healthcare workers was trained in the fundamental elements of DOTS, firmly establishing these methods as the national strategy for <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control.</b> Most importantly, {{on the basis of}} results from the 2000 national tuberculosis survey, there was a 36% reduction in disease prevalence between 1990 and 2000 in the half of China that implemented the projects.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the central}} {{government}} revised the law on the control of infectious diseases in March 2004. The revision provides instructions to tackle infectious-disease outbreaks, improve the reporting of infectious diseases, implement interventions to control the spread of such diseases, provide clinical services, and fund the control of infectious diseases. This law directly benefited <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> by addressing the under-reporting of tuberculosis by health facilities. Tuberculosis now has to be reported to local public-health authorities within 24 hours. Because failure to report is now a crime, hospitals have begun to take the reporting of tuberculosis very seriously.|$|E
50|$|The {{overall goal}} of the project is to narrow the huge {{diagnostic}} gap in multi-drug-resistant <b>tuberculosis</b> (MDR-TB) <b>control</b> by expanding and accelerating access to new and rapid diagnostic technologies within appropriate laboratory services, accompanied by the necessary technology transfer, and ensuring these new technologies are properly integrated within TB control programmes.|$|R

25|$|With {{this new}} internet-based {{reporting}} system, individuals involved in <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> can rapidly identify cases of tuberculosis—both confirmed and suspected—in China's vast hospital {{system for the}} first time. This information {{is being used to}} trace patients with tuberculosis and ensure their proper diagnosis and treatment. In 2004, 447 777 suspected or confirmed cases of tuberculosis were reported from hospitals. This number increased to 686 742 in 2005 as more hospitals implemented this system; almost 64% of these patients were successfully followed up. On the basis of preliminary analysis by the China CDC, 25% of all cases of tuberculosis in 2005 were initially reported from hospitals via the internet.|$|E
25|$|Despite these achievements, {{there were}} signs of {{difficulties}} elsewhere in the country's <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> program. In the half of China that did not implement the project funded by the World Bank, the prevalence of tuberculosis did not fall during the 1990s. Thus, the fall in tuberculosis prevalence for the entire country slowed to 2.5% per year during the 1990s. The 2000 national tuberculosis survey revealed that one in ten patients with tuberculosis had multi-drug resistant (MDR) disease — i.e., resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin. Other studies confirmed a serious epidemic of MDR tuberculosis in several Chinese provinces, with rates of multidrug resistance in previously untreated cases that were five to ten times higher than the global mean.|$|E
25|$|For those {{patients}} with tuberculosis who eventually {{ended up in}} the public health system, the problems did not end there. Governmental funding for public health had also declined over the years. In 2002, only about 41% of funding for the country's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) institutions came from the government. To make ends meet, local CDCs concentrated on the generation of revenue. There was little incentive to undertake <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>control</b> activities, which are labor-intensive and create little income. Even in areas where government subsidies support free diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis, many CDCs continue to charge patients for ancillary tests and drugs, some of which are of questionable benefit.|$|E
