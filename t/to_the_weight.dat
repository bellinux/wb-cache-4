5|$|An {{incident}} in Žirmūnai's history {{that has been}} difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon bridge across the River Neris, that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E

5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth the weight of an object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of {{the force of gravity}} on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E
5|$|Experimental mercury vapor {{turbines}} {{were installed}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of fossil-fuel electrical power plants. The South Meadow power plant in Hartford, CT employed mercury as its working fluid, in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit, {{for a number of years}} starting in the late 1920s in a drive to improve plant efficiency. Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of supercritical steam plants in later years.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the eruption, {{scientists}} {{established a}} grid of benchmarks against which they measured the change {{in the shape of the}} island. In the 20years following {{the end of the}} eruption, measurements revealed that the island was steadily subsiding and had lost about one metre in height. The rate of subsidence was initially about 20cm (8in) per year but slowed to 1–2cm (0.4–0.8in) a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose tephra forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor sediments underlying the island, and downward warping of the lithosphere due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the volcano.|$|E

5|$|In 1863, a new {{railroad}} {{bridge was}} constructed {{adjacent to the}} Long Bridge {{as part of a}} plan to strengthen the logistics of the Army of the Potomac as it operated in northern Virginia. An extension of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, the bridge would be used until {{the turn of the century}} before being replaced. Owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the railroad and the weak strength of the bridge, no locomotives were allowed on the bridge. Prior to crossing the Potomac, the train would detach its locomotive and be pulled across the bridge by a team of horses.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the more}} seriously damaged homes were of simple construction, with walls made of mud, adobe, or brick packed 40–50cm (16–20in) thick. These {{materials}} are generally more vulnerable to {{the force of the}} earthquake, but some of the traditionally constructed homes sustained little or no damage. This was due to a range of factors, possibly including the height-to-width ratio, the lack of windows, {{and the quality of the}} materials used. In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able to withstand the earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.|$|E
5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> {{of the wing}} turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide {{with that of the}} average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{initially}} considered using {{a hydrogen}} bomb for the project, but the United States Air Force vetoed this idea due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> {{of such a}} device, {{as it would be}} too heavy to be propelled by the missile which would have been used. It was then decided to use a W25 warhead, a small, lightweight warhead with a relatively low 1.7 kiloton yield. By contrast, the Little Boy bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of some 13–18 kilotons. The W25 would be carried by a rocket toward the hidden side of the Moon, near the terminator, where it would detonate on impact. The dust cloud resulting from the explosion would be lit by the Sun and therefore visible from Earth. According to Reiffel, the Air Force's progress in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles would have made such a launch feasible by 1959.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{widening}} {{of the tower}} arches in 1270 and 1320 the tower of St.Mary's had been structurally weak. The subsequent addition of the bells and belfry and the lead-covered spire added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the tower, {{and the number of}} burials of local notables within the church and of parishioners immediately outside the church building weakened the structure further. By the 18th century the problems had become severe enough that the west arch of the south transept was blocked up in an effort the strengthen the structure, and a hollow pillar which housed the stairway to the rood loft was filled in. The tower continued to weaken, a situation made worse by the addition in 1812 of a new ring of six bells with a 17cwt(860kg) tenor bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Iron bands were wrapped around the tower to strengthen it but these soon snapped, and by the 19th century large cracks, which had appeared in the tower, were filled with broken bricks and rubble and covered over with roughcast as an interim solution.|$|E

Initially they succeeded in {{carrying}} the German positions with relatively small losses, however, once the Germans had recovered they directed an intense artillery barrage upon the town which resulted in heavy losses. By the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July, they had suffered 5,286 casualties. Two days after taking over the line, the 2nd Division was thrown into a hastily planned attack that resulted in further casualties when the Germans spotted the Australians forming up and once again subjected them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of their artillery and machine guns. Another attack was launched on 4 August which, although it met with success, resulted again in such heavy casualties—almost 7,000—that the division was relieved the next day.|$|E
