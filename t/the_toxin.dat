5|$|One {{possible}} source {{has been}} identified in the forests of New Guinea: beetles of the genus Choresine (family Melyridae), which contain <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> and {{have been found in}} the stomachs of hooded pitohui. An alternative explanation, that the birds and beetles both get <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> from a third source, is considered unlikely as the blue-capped ifrit is almost exclusively insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|Type I systems {{sometimes}} {{include a}} third component. In {{the case of}} the well-characterised hok/sok system, in addition to the hok toxin and sok antitoxin, there is a third gene, called mok. This open reading frame almost entirely overlaps that of <b>the</b> <b>toxin,</b> and the translation of <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> is dependent on the translation of this third component. Thus the binding of antitoxin to toxin is sometimes a simplification, and the antitoxin in fact binds a third RNA, which then affects toxin translation.|$|E

40|$|Among <b>the</b> marine <b>toxins</b> {{related to}} human intoxication, {{tetrodotoxin}} {{has been known}} as one of the most prejudicial. Two tetrodotoxins, namely PFT- 1 and PFT- 2 were isolated and purified from liver of puffer fish by thin layer chromatography. The structure of both <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> was elucidated by means of IR, 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR and mass spectroscopy. Sub acute toxicity study showed that both <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> had pronounced effects on total RBC, WBC, platelet and ESR. Further serum levels of SGPT, SGOT, SALP, bilirubin, creatinine and urea are also affected by <b>the</b> <b>toxins.</b> <b>The</b> histopathological examinations showed that all the tissues such as liver, lung, heart and kidney of rat were severely changed after treatment with <b>the</b> <b>toxins.</b> <b>The</b> toxicity of the purified compounds, PFT- 1 and PFT- 2 were also performed by brine shrimp lethality bioassay...|$|R
5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet. Phyllobates frogs kept in captivity do not develop <b>the</b> <b>toxins,</b> and <b>the</b> extent of the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across {{the range of the}} unrelated blue-capped ifrit, another New Guinean bird found with toxic skin and feathers. Both of these facts suggest that <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> are obtained from the diet. The presence of <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> in <b>the</b> internal organs as well as the skins and feathers rules out the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the {{aforementioned}} toxin-antitoxin systems, DarTG {{is a type}} II system where both <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> and the antitoxin have enzymatic activity. The DarG antitoxin does not inhibit the DarT toxin, which modifies DNA by ADP-ribosylating specific sequence motifs, but instead removes the toxic modification caused by <b>the</b> <b>toxin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{typically}} classified {{according to how}} the antitoxin neutralises <b>the</b> <b>toxin.</b> In a Type I toxin-antitoxin system, the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> is inhibited by the binding of a small non-coding RNA antitoxin to the mRNA. The protein toxin in a type II system is inhibited post-translationally by the binding of another protein antitoxin. A single example of Type III toxin-antitoxin system has been described whereby a protein toxin is bound directly by an RNA molecule. Toxin-antitoxin genes are often transferred through horizontal gene transfer and are associated with pathogenic bacteria, having been found on plasmids conferring antibiotic resistance and virulence.|$|E
5|$|Type II {{systems are}} {{organised}} in operons with the antitoxin protein typically being located upstream of <b>the</b> <b>toxin.</b> The antitoxin inhibits <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> by downregulating its expression. The proteins are typically around 100 amino acids in length, and exhibit toxicity {{in a number}} of ways: CcdB protein, for example, affects DNA gyrase by poisoning DNA topoisomerase II whereas MazF protein is a toxic endoribonuclease that cleaves cellular mRNAs at specific sequence motifs. The most common toxic activity is the protein acting as an endonuclease, also known as an interferase.|$|E
5000|$|Raw {{bamboo shoots}} contain cyanogenic glycosides, natural toxins also {{contained}} in cassava. [...] <b>The</b> <b>toxins</b> must be destroyed by thorough cooking {{and for this}} reason fresh bamboo shoots are often boiled before being used in other ways. <b>The</b> <b>toxins</b> are also destroyed in the canning process.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> cyanobacterial <b>toxins</b> {{of concern}} as {{potential}} human health hazards are those known to occur widely {{in drinking water}} sources, and therefore may be present in water for human use. <b>The</b> <b>toxins</b> include a diverse range of chemical compounds, with equally diverse toxic effects. These toxins {{are not limited to}} individual cyanobacterial species or genera, and all of <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> of concern to human health are produced by multiple cyanobacterial species. Ian R. Falcone...|$|R
5|$|A third protein can {{sometimes}} be involved in type II toxin-antitoxin systems. In {{the case of the}} aforementioned MazEF addiction module, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> and antitoxin there is a regulatory protein involved called MazG. MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same polycistronic mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). <b>The</b> <b>toxin</b> affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> out of the dog's system.|$|E
50|$|African Emperor {{scorpion}} venom contains <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> imperatoxin and pandinotoxin.|$|R
50|$|According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), {{less than}} one percent of algal blooms produce {{hazardous}} toxins, such as microcystins. Although blue-green or other algae do not usually pose a direct threat to health, <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> (poisons) which they produce are considered dangerous to humans, land animals, sea mammals, birds and fish when <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> are ingested. <b>The</b> <b>toxins</b> are neurotoxins which destroy nerve tissue which can affect the nervous system, brain, and liver, and can lead to death. Tests have shown some toxins near blooms can be in the air and thereby be inhaled, which could affect health.|$|R
50|$|Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) is a toxin {{generated}} by Clostridium difficile. It {{is similar to}} Clostridium difficile <b>Toxin</b> B. <b>The</b> <b>toxins</b> are <b>the</b> main virulence factors produced by the gram positive, anaerobic, Clostridium difficile bacteria. <b>The</b> <b>toxins</b> function by damaging the intestinal mucosa and cause the symptoms of C. difficile infection, including pseudomembranous colitis.|$|R
5|$|File shells such as Limaria fragilis {{can produce}} a noxious {{secretion}} when stressed. It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and protrude {{some distance from the}} shell when it is feeding. If attacked, it sheds tentacles in a process known as autotomy. <b>The</b> <b>toxin</b> released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators.|$|E
5|$|In {{a three-part}} series {{published}} between June and August 1997, the story continues with Venom {{as a government}} agent controlled by a bomb implanted in his chest. He is tasked with neutralizing biological-weapons expert Dr. Sergei Yesenofsky before he can release a deadly toxin. Yesenofsky's son Kostya sacrifices his life to divert a nuclear missile heading for Yesenofsky's base, and uses the explosion to destroy <b>the</b> <b>toxin.</b> Yesenofsky survives, swearing to avenge Kostya.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that chromosomal copies of plasmid toxin-antitoxin systems may serve as anti-addiction modules– a method of omitting a plasmid from progeny without suffering the effects of <b>the</b> <b>toxin.</b> An {{example of this is}} an antitoxin on the Erwinia chrysanthemi genome that counteracts the toxic activity of an F plasmid toxin counterpart.|$|E
50|$|N. kubaryana uses <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> in {{its prey}} ascidians {{to defend itself}} against predators. It stores <b>the</b> ascidian's <b>toxins</b> in its tissues and then {{releases}} them in a slimy defensive mucus when alarmed.|$|R
50|$|Humans can inhale aerosolized brevetoxins. Brevetoxins become aerosolized by bubble-mediated {{transport}} of extracellular toxins. Through this process, bubbles transport <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> to <b>the</b> water's surface, as the bubbles rupture they release <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> into <b>the</b> air. The wind can then sweep these toxins toward shore, onto the beaches {{and into the}} communities {{where they can be}} inhaled by humans.|$|R
25|$|Altertoxins – {{are those}} of Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol methyl ether (AME), Altenuene (ALT), Altertoxin-1 (ATX-1), Tenuazonic acid (TeA) and Radicinin (RAD), {{originated}} from Alternaria spp. Some of <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> can be present in sorghum, ragi, wheat and tomatoes. Some {{research has shown that}} <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> can be easily cross-contaminated between grain commodities, suggesting that manufacturing and storage of grain commodities is a critical practice.|$|R
5|$|Slow lorises {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, delivered in a bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> is mild and not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. <b>The</b> <b>toxin</b> is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
5|$|Type I toxin-antitoxin systems {{rely on the}} base-pairing of {{complementary}} antitoxin RNA {{with the}} toxin's mRNA. Translation of the mRNA is then inhibited either by degradation via RNase III or by occluding the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or ribosome binding site. Often <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> and antitoxin are encoded on opposite strands of DNA. The 5' or 3' overlapping region between the two genes is the area involved in complementary base-pairing, usually with between 19–23 contiguous base pairs.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 in New York, {{mother and}} {{environmentalist}} Lois Gibbs led her community in protest after discovering that their entire neighborhood, Love Canal, {{was built on}} top of a toxic dump site. <b>The</b> <b>toxins</b> in <b>the</b> ground were causing illness among children and reproductive issues among women, as well as birth defects in babies born to pregnant women exposed to <b>the</b> <b>toxins.</b> <b>The</b> Love Canal movement eventually led to the evacuation and relocation of nearly 800 families by the federal government.|$|R
40|$|Binding {{studies of}} various glycolipids, mainly {{belonging}} to the ganglio series, to <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> isolated from Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium tetani have been performed, using the microtiter well assay. By using the found binding preferences in conjunction with minimum-energy conformations obtained from molecular modeling of the various ligands, binding epitopes on the natural receptor glycolipids for <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> have been defined. The binding preferences for <b>the</b> cholera <b>toxin</b> and <b>the</b> heat-labile E. coli toxin are very similar, with the ganglioside GM 1 being the most efficient ligand. <b>The</b> tetanus <b>toxin</b> binds strongly to gangliosides of the G 1 b series, with GT 1 b as the most efficient ligand. It is found that the binding epitope on GM 1 for the cholera and heat-labile toxins {{to a large extent}} overlaps with the epitope on GQ 1 b for <b>the</b> tetanus <b>toxin...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> to <b>the</b> hooded pitohui {{has been the}} source of debate and research since its discovery. The initial suggestion was that <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> acted as a chemical deterrent to predators. Some researchers cautioned this suggestion was premature, and others noted that the levels of batrachotoxins were three orders of magnitude lower than in the poison dart frogs that do use it in this way.|$|R
5|$|Bond survives {{attacks by}} Jaws, Chang's replacement, during Rio Carnival {{and on the}} Sugarloaf Cable Car. After Jaws' cable car crashes, he is rescued from the rubble by Dolly, and the two fall in love. Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> comes from a rare orchid {{indigenous}} to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River while under attack from Drax's forces; he eventually finds Drax's base near Iguazu Falls. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole the loaned shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead escape and pose as pilots on Moonraker 6. The shuttles dock with Drax's space station, hidden from radar by a cloaking device.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{travels to}} the Amazon looking for Drax's {{research}} facility, where he is captured. He and Goodhead pose as pilots on one of six space shuttles being sent by Drax to a hidden space station. There Bond finds out that Drax plans to destroy all human life by launching fifty globes containing <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> into the Earth's atmosphere. Bond and Goodhead disable the radar jammer hiding the station from Earth and the US sends a platoon of Marines in a military space shuttle. During the battle, Bond kills Drax and his station is destroyed.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B, exfoliative toxins A and B, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 to activate macrophages. All of <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> tested had <b>the</b> potential to stimulate tumoricidal activity in peritoneal macrophages from lipopolysaccharide-responsive C 3 HeB/FeJ mice. In contrast, none of <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> activated cytotoxicity in lipopolysaccharide-unresponsive macrophages from C 3 H/HeJ mice. We also studied toxin stimulation of monokine secretion. Staphylococcal enterotoxin A, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, and both exfoliative toxins triggered C 3 HeB/FeJ macrophages to secrete tumor necrosis factor alpha, but enterotoxin B induced only marginal amounts of tumor necrosis factor. All of <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> used stimulated interleukin- 6 production by macrophages from both strains of mice. Nitric oxide is produced in response to <b>the</b> exfoliative <b>toxins</b> only by <b>the</b> lipopolysaccharide-responsive macrophages. These results suggest that macrophages respond differently to several staphylococcal exotoxins...|$|R
50|$|Due to its extreme lethality, {{as well as}} {{it being}} only commercially {{available}} at certain times and then at an extremely high cost, Amanita phalloides had to be retrieved from the wild in order to collect the β-amanitin protein. This was first achieved by collecting Amanita phalloides fruiting bodies in New Jersey in 1975. These mushrooms were then dried for 24 hours and then ground in a blender with water. The slurry created was homogenized further to break open any intact cells, and after this a brown syrup extract containing <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> was collected. This extract was then taken through various separation methods to isolate <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> themselves. <b>The</b> <b>toxins</b> were then desalted and taken through four different methods of sephadex and acidic protein purification.|$|R
