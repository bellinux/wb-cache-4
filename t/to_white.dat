In 1825, Indianapolis replaced Corydon as the seat of government. The government became established in the Marion County Courthouse as the second state capital building.|$|E

According <b>to</b> <b>White,</b> by 1953, even the public pretense of cooperation between Paramount and DuMont was gone.|$|E
