On average, 2.8 afternoons each summer will exceed 100 F and 57.6 afternoons reach 90 F. It is rare, though, that minima stay above 68 F, although thirteen mornings stayed this warm in 2015. The hottest minimum has been 78 F on July 22, 2003, and the hottest temperature 107 F on July 15, 2014. In the winter, afternoons are sunny and cool to cold with all but six topping freezing on average, although mornings typically range from freezing to frigid: 152 mornings fall below freezing in an average year and two fall to or below 0 F. The coldest temperature on record is &minus;26 F on January 21, 1937, and the coldest month January 1949 which averaged 12.4 F with a mean minimum of &minus;4.6 F.

30|$|Often, {{households}} have a timer-driven heating system which lets the <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> <b>to</b> a certain setback temperature {{at night in}} order to save energy. One could argue that for our analysis a baseline in which the temperature is decreased during the night makes more sense than the always-on baseline. However, if we used a baseline with a night-time setback temperature, we could also use this setback in the occupancy-based strategies, which then consequently would also use less energy (because at night a home is typically occupied). For the setting with a nightly setback the savings are even higher (6.64 MWh on average for the oracle strategy compared to 4.83 MWh over the 75 weeks period). This is due to the possibility of obtaining schedules with very long periods of absence, e.g. when the dwelling is unoccupied the whole day, it {{does not have to be}} heated above the setback temperature for the previous night and that day. This effect is naturally even stronger for reactive schedules (8.41 MWh instead of 5.48 MWh energy savings).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThermal {{evolution}} of telluric planets is mainly controlled by secular cooling and internal heating {{due to the}} decay of radioactive isotopes, two processes that are equivalent {{from the standpoint of}} convection dynamics. In a fluid cooled from above and volumetrically heated, convection is dominated by instabilities of the top boundary layer and the interior thermal structure is non-isentropic. Here we present innovative laboratory experiments where microwave radiation is used to generate uniform internal heat in fluids at high Prandtl number (> 300) and high Rayleigh–Roberts number (ranging from 104 to 107), appropriate for planetary mantle convection. Non-invasive techniques are employed to determine both temperature and velocity fields. We successfully validate the experimental results by conducting numerical simulations in three-dimensional Cartesian geometry that reproduce the experimental conditions. Scaling laws relating key characteristics of the thermal boundary layer, namely its thickness and <b>temperature</b> <b>drop,</b> <b>to</b> the Rayleigh–Roberts number have been established for both rigid and free-slip boundary conditions. A robust conclusion is that for rigid boundary conditions the internal temperature is significantly higher than for free-slip boundary conditions. Our scaling laws, coupled with plausible physical parameters entering the Rayleigh–Roberts number, enable us to calculate the mantle potential temperature for the Earth and Venus, two telluric planets with different mechanical boundary conditions at their surface...|$|E
40|$|Fluid {{injection}} in deep geological formations usually induces microseismicity. In particular, industrial-scale {{injection of}} CO 2 may induce {{a large number}} of microseismic events. Since CO 2 is likely to reach the storage formation at a lower temperature than that corresponding to the geothermal gradient, both overpressure and cooling decrease the effective stresses and may induce microseismicity. Here, we investigate the effect of the stress regime on the effective stress evolution and fracture stability when injecting cold CO 2 through a horizontal well in a deep saline formation. Simulation results show that when only overpressure occurs, the vertical total stress remains practically constant, but the horizontal total stresses increase proportionally to overpressure. These hydro-mechanical stress changes result in a slight improvement in fracture stability in normal faulting stress regimes because the decrease in deviatoric stress offsets the decrease in effective stresses produced by overpressure. However, fracture stability significantly decreases in reverse faulting stress regimes because the size of the Mohr circle increases in addition to being displaced towards failure conditions. Fracture stability also decreases in strike slip stress regimes because the Mohr circle maintains its size and is shifted towards the yield surface a magnitude equal to overpressure minus the increase in the horizontal total stresses. Additionally, cooling induces a thermal stress reduction in all directions, but larger in the out-of-plane direction. This stress anisotropy causes, apart from a displacement of the Mohr circle towards the yield surface, an increase {{in the size of the}} Mohr circle. These two effects decrease fracture stability, resulting in the strike slip being the least stable stress regime when cooling occurs, followed by the reverse faulting and the normal faulting stress regimes. Thus, characterizing the stress state is crucial to determine the maximum sustainable injection pressure and maximum <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> <b>to</b> safely inject CO 2. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons LtdV.

After dissolving PCL in a solution of supercritical CO 2 and 0. 1 vol. % chloroform, an extremely fast phase transfer from a supercritical to a gas-like state occurred during expansion into atmospheric conditions, leading to a temporary <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> <b>to</b> below − 50 °C at the silica surface where the crystals were deposited. Single crystals of a hitherto unreported rectangular lateral habit were observed. Six-sided crystals were also observed, but they were fewer than the rectangular crystals and in addition the angles between the lateral faces were different from the theoretical angles between adjacent { 110 } faces and { 110 } and { 100 } faces. X-ray scattering indicated a polymorphic structure also including the orthorhombic (110) and (200) diffraction peaks. Distinct low angle peaks essentially along the c-axis indicated a stacking on a very fine scale (3. 7 – 4. 7 nm) within the crystals. The equatorial diffraction peaks indicated a less dense packing of the PCL stems. Rectangular single crystals with a height according to AFM of 11 – 27 nm melted between 40 and 45 °C, which is lower than the melting points (55 °C) recorded for the distorted six-sided crystals. The unusual conditions for crystallisation used gave the polymer molecules a severe limitation to rearrange from the initial random coil state. The facetted crystals consisted of a stack of 4 nm thick blocks; these blocks most probably constituted a regular variation in molecular packing, i. e. molecular order. The pronounced changes in the angles between adjacent faces from those observed in mature PCL crystals and the wide-angle X-ray scattering data indicated the presence of conformational disorder in the crystals...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{implementation}} of autotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidation processes {{for the removal}} of nitrogen from municipal wastewater (known as “mainstream anammox”) bears the potential to bring wastewater treatment plants close to energy autarky. The aim of the present work was to assess the long-term stability of partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) processes operating at low temperatures and their reliability in meeting nitrogen concentrations in the range of typical discharge limits below 2  mgNH 4 -N·L− 1 and 10 mgNtot·L− 1. Two main 12 -L sequencing batch reactors were operated in parallel for PN/A on aerobically pre-treated municipal wastewater (21  ±  5 mgNH 4 -N·L− 1 and residual 69  ±  19 mgCODtot·L− 1) for more than one year, including over 5  months at 15  °C. The two systems consisted of a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and a hybrid MBBR (H-MBBR) with flocculent biomass. Operation at limiting oxygen concentrations (0. 15 – 0. 18 mgO 2 ·L− 1) allowed stable suppression of the activity of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria at 15  °C with a production of nitrate over ammonium consumed as low as 16 % in the MBBR. Promising nitrogen removal rates of 20 – 40 mgN·L− 1 ·d− 1 were maintained at hydraulic retention times of 14  h. Stable ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies over 90 % and 70 % respectively were achieved. Both reactors reached average concentrations of total nitrogen below 10 mgN·L− 1 in their effluents, even down to 6 mgN·L− 1 for the MBBR, with an ammonium concentration of 2 mgN·L− 1 (set as operational threshold to stop aeration). Furthermore, the two PN/A systems performed almost identically with respect to the biological removal of organic micropollutants and, importantly, to a similar extent as conventional treatments. A sudden <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> <b>to</b> 11  °C resulted in significant suppression of anammox activity, although this was rapidly recovered after the temperature was increased back to 15  °C. Analyses of 16 S rRNA gene-targeted amplicon sequencing revealed that the anammox guild of the bacterial communities of the two systems was composed of the genus “Candidatus Brocadia”. The potential of PN/A systems to compete with conventional treatments for biological nutrients removal both in terms of removal rates and overall effluent quality was proven...|$|E
40|$|Bats are warm-blooded true flying mammals. They {{are also}} long-lived, {{intelligent}} {{and have a}} complex social life. According to Mistry (1997) insectivorous bats prey on nocturnal insects not only in agricultural ecosystem but also within the towns and cities. But their importance as natural pest controlling agent has never been highlighted. Larger mines with single or multiple entrances are preferred by bats because they have varying temperature zones {{that are similar to}} their natural habitats (Altenbach, 1995; Devkar et al., 2011). Insectivore bats eat insects and other invertebrates such as spiders, which they catch in flight or pick off water, the ground or foliage. Some bats special in catching large insects such as beetles or moths but others eat large numbers of very small insects, midges and mosquitoes during night. Bats gather to feed wherever there are lots of insects, so the best places for them include traditional pasture, woodland, marshes, ponds and slow moving rivers (Kunz, 1988). Bats have evolved a number of unusual features, mainly connected with their ability to fly. Their wings are formed from a web of highly elastic skin stretched over greatly elongated finger bones, the legs and tail, though their thumbs remain free to help them cling on when roosting (Kunz, 1988). Bats have also developed a highly sophisticated echo-location system that allows them to avoid obstacles and catch tiny insects, even in complete darkness. When they're flying, bats produce a stream of high-pitched calls and listen to the echoes to produce a sound picture of their surroundings. Most of these echo-location calls are too high pitched for us to hear, but electronic bat-detectors that pick up these calls and turn them into sounds that we can hear are now widely used by specialists. During the winter, there are relatively few insects available, so bats hibernate. In September and October they put on weight and then, as the weather gets colder, they seek out appropriate sheltered roosts, let their body <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> <b>to</b> close to that of their surroundings and slow their heart rate to only a few beats per minute. This greatly reduces their energy requirements so that their food reserves last as long as possible. Bats have a unique way of fitting their breeding cycle in with hibernatio...|$|E
