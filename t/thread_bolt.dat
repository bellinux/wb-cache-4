40|$|Previously several {{methods were}} {{proposed}} {{to reduce the}} stress concentration through improving bolts and nuts profile. Among those methods, (1) Tapering <b>thread</b> <b>bolt</b> (CD bolt) were proposed for stress reduction and (2) Special nuts were designed to have slightly different pitches. In this paper, a kind of nut is designed with providing slightly different pitches between the CD bolt and nut, so that the prevailing torque is appearing {{in order to obtain}} the anti-loosening and stress reduction effects. It is found that the maximum static stress concentration can be decreased by 28. 6 %, and the maximum stress amplitude can be decreased by 23. 9 % compared with the cases of standard bolts and nuts...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted steel connections subjected to tension. Quasi-static conditions have been considered. By performing laboratory tests on single bolts and simple T-stub connections the failure modes of the bolts have been examined. Finite element models are created and validated to represent the behaviour observed in the laboratory. Different grip length configurations have been tested for a single bolt and nut assembly subjected to pure tension. Both partially and fully <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> have been considered. It was found that partially <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> with three <b>threads</b> between the unthreaded part of the shank and the bearing surface of the nut experienced thread stripping. This is inconsistent with the recommendations given in NS-EN 1090 - 2, which states that one full thread is sufficient to avoid thread stripping. Finite element models are able to recreate the behaviour of all configurations tested with acceptable accuracy. In addition to the grip length, the material properties and geometry of the threads are identified as the crucial factors for the failure modes of the bolts. Simple T-stub connections with one bolt in each flange have been tested to examine the behaviour of the bolts when they are subjected {{to a combination of}} tension and bending. The center distance between the bolts was varied to examine the behaviour when subjected to increased bending effects. Connections with partially <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> all failed due to thread stripping. The fully <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> experienced both <b>thread</b> stripping and <b>bolt</b> failure. The complexity of the stress distribution when large bending effects are present was difficult to recreate with a simplified finite element model. Acceptable accuracy up to maximum force was possible to achieve for the smallest bolt center distance. The response of the finite element model was very mesh sensitive, and difficult to recreate with limited computational capacity when applying an explicit solution algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} provide the joint {{versatility}} for pultruded fibre reinforced polymer (PFRP) in civil structures industry is crucial for its application demands. Bolted joint is extensively used in the industry due to low cost and ease of assembly. However, this jointing method can compromise the PFRP strength at the joint due to poor quality of drilling techniques, accuracy of hole size and <b>threaded</b> <b>bolt.</b> In this study, the main objective is to investigate the effect of <b>threaded</b> <b>bolt</b> {{on the strength of}} bolted joints in pultruded fibre reinforced polymer. Double lap joint configuration was used on both longitudinal and transverse laminates and tested to failure (in tension) in accordance with ASTM D 5961. The test specimens failed in shear-out (heavily crushed) mode and net-tension mode for longitudinal and transverse laminates, respectively. A significant joint capacity reduction was observed on the threaded samples due to unevenness of the contact surface. The load-displacement curve shows the slope with several knees after the first drop, which may indicate some damping effects and unstable development of internal damage. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposed}} {{a mathematical model}} to investigate the radial expansion induced loosening of rectangle <b>thread</b> <b>bolted</b> joints that were subjected to cyclic temperature variation, which could cause slippage between contact pairs of engaged <b>threads</b> and <b>bolt</b> bearing. Firstly, integral equations were derived for the shear stress components caused by expansion difference, {{as well as the}} bearing and thread friction torque components, which depended on the temperature variation. Secondly, the relationship of displacement components was developed based on quasi-static hypotheses. Then, treating the rotation of bolt as plastic elongation, the bolt tension's evolution was obtained by using a one-dimensional bolted joint model. Numerical results showed that the temperature variation decreased the bearing and thread friction torque components, which could lead bolted joint to loosen. Finally, the effects of some associated factors on the progress were discussed...|$|R
