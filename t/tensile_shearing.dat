40|$|Current {{methods of}} {{mechanical}} property evaluation of fabrics {{such as the}} KESF and FAST systems employ several testing devices for measuring <b>tensile,</b> <b>shearing</b> and bending char-acteristics separately. In this research a new facile and efficient extraction method for si-multaneous estimation of different mechanical properties using a funnel-shape nozzle is introduced. The <b>tensile,</b> <b>shearing</b> and bending properties of 84 woven fabric samples were measured using standard methods and subsequently circular specimens of these fabrics were extracted through the funnel shaped nozzle. Sixteen different parameters were graphi-cally selected from the force-displacement curves obtained, and the correlation between these parameters with the experimental mechanical properties was calculated. Finally stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was applied to acquire the best equation for predicting the mechanical properties of the fabrics. Our findings revealed that the shear stiffness and tensile strength can be objectively evaluated by measuring the initial slope (S 1) and maximum load (Pmax) on the load-displacement curve. The maximum load in the 4 th zone (Fmax) of the graph was introduced as an objective measure of the bending rigidit...|$|E
40|$|There {{are five}} low-stress {{mechanical}} properties (<b>tensile,</b> <b>shearing,</b> bending, surface, and compression) {{that affect the}} fabric handle. Dimethyloldihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU) is a conventional agent for imparting wrinkle-resistant properties to cotton fabric. DMDHEU-crosslinked fabrics provide excellent wrinkle recovery properties but may affect the fabric hand. In this study, fabrics treated for wrinkle resistance were assessed by the Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabric (KES-F), which objectively evaluates low-stress mechanical properties of textiles. Four curing temperatures, 110, 130, 150, and 170 ºC, {{were used in the}} wrinkle resistant finishing and effects of different concentrations of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) used as co-catalyst were also studied. It was found that changes in curing temperature (from 110 to 170 ºC) have an obvious effect on <b>tensile,</b> <b>shearing</b> and bending properties. Surface and compression properties, however, did not show a significant variation. Moreover, the use of TiO 2 particles in the treatment affected low-stress mechanical properties of fabrics to a certain extent, especially in compression properties, due to the increase in thickness.

40|$|Human and Systems EngineeringLaser welding is an {{emerging}} joining technique for automotive industry. Due {{to the complex}} process, the control of laser welding quality problem such as spatter, porosity, and undercut is not easy. Traditional mechanical testing of weld is time consuming, costly, and inefficient for on-line monitoring of laser welding quality. In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top weld seam of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> strength in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of weld seam and <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top weld seam and maximum <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> strength, and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top weld seam and maximum <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> strength. These correlations exist only when top weld seam having non uniform seam boundary. However, weld seam having uniform seam boundary do not have sufficient evidence of the correlation between the variation of weld seam and <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> strength.

Their pressure performances and medical functions depend largely upon the mechanical properties of stocking knitted fabrics. In the present study, the multiple fabric mechanical behaviors of GCSs with different pressure levels and medical functions were examined by using Kawabata standard evaluation system. On the basis of pressure ranges advised by the European Committee for Standardization, the definitive quantitative relationships between pressure performances and key mechanical properties of GCS fabrics were developed and evaluated. The results show that GCS fabrics with different pressure performances produced significant differences in <b>tensile,</b> <b>shearing,</b> and bending properties (P < 0. 001). GCS fabrics generating lighter pressure possessed higher values in tensile strain, tensile energy at a given force, and lower values in shearing stiffness and bending rigidity, while stronger pressure levels are produced by the GCS fabrics with higher resistance to the mechanical deformations. Pressure magnitude performances of GCSs are an integrative action performed by multiple fabric mechanical properties.

This tip rotates and plunges into the workpieces until {{the shoulder of}} the tool touches the plate surface. The rotating tool drills a hole through the workpieces and deforms into a rivet shape, so the two plates are joined without preprocessing such as drilling a rivet hole. Therefore, this method is considered to have a decreased number of processes. However, it is difficult to drill a pilot hole with a tool made of metal that is easy to deform, such as aluminum alloy. Therefore, in this study, a pilot hole was drilled into the workpieces before using the tool. This method was used to make lap joints, and the joint strength of the joined aluminum alloy plates was investigated using a tensile shear test. In all cases, the tool plunge rate was kept constant at 1. 2 mm/min, and the tool rotational speed was set to 766 r/min. A tool plunge depth of 7. 0 mm below the upper plate surface was used.
