The curved shape of the isogyre is characteristic of biaxial minerals - though the degree of curvature will change as the microscope stage is rotated, and at some orientations the pattern will resemble the [...] "maltese cross" [...] pattern of a uniaxial mineral. The left hand image illustrates the figure alone; the grey patch at the centre indicates the low first order (grey) birefringence colours seen here (the order of the colours seen would in reality increase away from the center, but these colours are not shown). The two right hand figures show {{the effect of adding}} a sensitive <b>tint</b> <b>plate</b> to the setup, replacing the grey at the centre with second order blue and first yellow birefringence colours. The polarity of the yellow and blue reveals whether the mineral being viewed is optically [...] "biaxial positive" [...] (top) or [...] "biaxial negative" [...] (bottom), which can be a key property in identifying the mineral (or investigating its composition).|$|E
5000|$|The maximum {{separation}} between isogyres {{occurs when the}} slide is rotated exactly 45 degrees {{from one of the}} orientations where the isogyres come together. The point where the isogyres is most tightly curved represents the position of each of the two optic axes present for a biaxial mineral, and thus the maximum {{separation between}} the two curves is diagnostic of the angle between the two optic axes for the mineral. This angle is called the optic angle and often notated as [...] "2V". In some cases, knowing the optic angle can be a useful diagnostic tool to discriminate between two minerals which otherwise look very similar. In other cases, 2V varies with chemical composition in a known way for a given mineral, and its measured value can be used to estimate ratios between elements in the crystal structure - for example, Fe/Mg in olivines. However, in these cases it becomes important to also be sure of the optic sign of the mineral (essentially, this tells you how the optic angle is orientated with respect to the whole optical indicatrix describing the refractive indices of the mineral in 3D). The optic sign and optic angle can be determined together by combining interference pattern microscopy with use of a sensitive <b>tint</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

50|$|Plastocast Relief is {{a painted}} low-relief design that was cast with resin. The idea started as an {{extension}} of the bronzed lino relief. The used plastograph plates (like used lino blocks) have sculptural low relief effects which make them unique as art works. An attempt to retain the original used plates, and at the same time give collectors a chance to possesses and share the beauty of the original, led Onobrakpeya to develop a method of creating other original plates from existing used plates through the use of plaster of Paris. Sometimes, small plates with the same or similar themes are arranged together and cast to form a larger picture. A further development in plastocast relief is carving directly on abandoned or congealed plaster of Paris then applying resin on the cast and pulling out a positive. However for a deep engraving on plaster of Paris to produce bold relief, depends on the nature of the plaster of Paris. This is known as plastocast plate. It is painted or <b>tinted</b> plastocast <b>plate</b> that becomes a plastocast relief.|$|R
2500|$|Atkinson {{published}} his journals of {{his involvement in}} the campaign in 1842 in The Expedition into Affghanistan, including a background to the conflict, his own journey across northern India to join the Army and his return, the hardship endured by the Army and its followers through the harsh terrain of Afghanistan beset by Beloochee tribesmen [...] and also of the time he spent in Kabul. He writes {{of the history of the}} land, its buildings and people, having met and painted many of the protagonists in the campaign, including both Shah Shoojah-ool-Moolk and Dost Mohammad Khan. He realised the impossibility of controlling a country like Afghanistan in his line “Like Sisyphus, we have rolled up the huge stone to the top of the mountain, and if we do not keep it there, our labour will be lost”. The same year Atkinson published Sketches in Afghaunistan, a folio of 25 <b>tinted</b> lithographed <b>plates</b> showing the topography and landscapes of Afghanistan and the Punjab creating an important record of “what was then an unexplored country”. Atkinson had planned a second volume but the 'worked up' paintings were lost at sea en route to his British publisher where they were to be engraved; the original sketches he had prepared on the spot however are in the British Library.|$|R
5000|$|Daniell's {{last great}} artistic work was {{produced}} between 1827 and 1830. Over {{this time he}} {{became interested in the}} scenery around Windsor. In 1827, 1828 and 1830, he exhibited a total of five oil paintings of Windsor Castle and its surroundings and two oil paintings of Virginia Water, at the Royal Academy Exhibitions. These were considered to be among his finest oil paintings, and according to Sutton, his view of the Long Walk at Windsor was generally acknowledged to be his masterpiece in oils. Daniell produced a set of 12 aquatints of the Windsor and Virginia water views. Sutton writes of this series:These twelve prints are the finest aquatints ever made, standing alone at the highest possible peak: aquatint could go no further, and although attempts have been made by others to excel them, none succeeded. The prints were made in Daniell's usual way, engraved by himself from his own drawings, and published by himself at 14, Russell Place, Fitzroy Square. By this time he was a comparatively wealthy man, and one can imagine him lovingly and carefully <b>tinting</b> the <b>plates,</b> leisurely savouring their subtle beauties, unhampered by time or financial worry. We feel, in looking at these aquatints, that perhaps Daniell, with the philosophy of a much-travelled man, realised that in the cool greys and greens with which he [...] "stained" [...] his prints was the charm of his own land, more enduring than the exotic mystery of the Orient or the strange architecture of Hindistan.|$|R
