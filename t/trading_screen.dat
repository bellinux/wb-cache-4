Trade takes place while interacting with certain friendly non-player characters, such as shopkeepers, and often uses a specialized <b>trading</b> <b>screen.</b> Purchased items {{go into the}} player's inventory. Some games turn inventory management into a logistical challenge by limiting {{the size of the}} player's inventory, thus forcing the player to decide what they must carry at the time. This can be done by limiting the maximum weight that a player can carry, by employing a system of arranging items in a virtual space, or by simply limiting the number of items that can be held.|$|E
40|$|Calculation {{has been}} {{recently}} discussed {{in relationship to}} market transactions as: (1) a set of operations, including classifications and computations, which support decision-making processes by economic actors; (2) action plans or strategies which can be evaluated against efficacy criteria; (3) broader social processes which induce behavioral modifications and transformations along (1) and (2). Calculations would appear as situated plans or strategies, bounded by institutional constraints, and anchored in classifications, computations, and evaluations, strategies which are implemented within trading interactions. Such plans make use of available resources and adapt to constraints, but are prior with respect to live trading interactions. Using a conceptual apparatus anchored {{in the work of}} Erving Goffman, I argue that calculation is situational action. Its features are shaped by the interaction order of trading, and it can be conceptualized as emerging from gaming encounters [...] i. e., competitive displays of the participants' socially relevant attributes. These arguments are supported with empirical data from online, anonymous financial trading. In these markets, gaming encounters make anonymous strangers present in the trader's situation, as a basis for assessing the relevance of displays on the <b>trading</b> <b>screen</b> and for reacting to these displays. At the same time, traders engage in repeated self-displays as a means for defining their own situation and for projecting subsequent action sequences. ...|$|E
40|$|Economists {{have learned}} a great deal about {{investor}} behavior {{over the last two decades}} with the availability of large discount brokerage data sets. While this has given economists a better understanding of the trading patterns that characterize individual investor behavior, less success has been achieved in understanding what drives these trading patterns. Part of the difficulty in this endeavor is that it is sometimes difficult to test alternative theories of investor behavior using only data from the field. In particular, the two trading patterns we investigate in this thesis, the disposition effect and the repurchase effect, are unlikely driven by standard rational models of trading, and alternative theories of their causes are difficult to test using only data from the field, or data from behavioral laboratory experiments. In order to better understand the causes of the disposition effect and the repurchase effect, we use neural data, data collected from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with trading data to construct empirical tests of different theories. Chapter 1 uses fMRI data to test a model of realization utility, which can readily predict a disposition effect. In our experiment, we find that subjects exhibit strong disposition effects, although they are suboptimal, and the neural data strongly supports the realization utility hypothesis. While Chapter 1 is concerned with the selling behavior, we focus on systematic violations of buying behavior in Chapter 2. We propose a model of regret to explain the repurchase effect in the buy-side trading data, for which we find strong support in the neural data. Chapters 3 and 4 study whether the suboptimal trading behavior we find in the first two chapters is stable, and we explore what the source of the heterogeneity is. Specifically, in Chapter 3 we find that exogenously manipulating the display of information on the <b>trading</b> <b>screen</b> can significantly reduce the size of the disposition effect. Chapter 4 uses an approach from behavioral genetics to identify candidate genes that can help explain the cross-sectional variation in choice behavior. ...|$|E

Market depth appears largely unaffected. Under <b>screen</b> <b>trading,</b> realized spreads widen as more limit orders are taken up rather than in relation to order size "per se".
