500|$|The film {{includes}} 33 {{minutes of}} animation. Its animators at the Nickelodeon Animation Studios at Burbank, California sketched {{the outlines of}} the story in a year. Paul Tibbitt, the show's supervising producer who also serves as the showrunner, explained [...] "We're one of the last shows that does it <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way,</b> like they used to do it back in the Warner Brothers days." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} season, the series used cel animation. A shift was made the {{following}} year to digital ink and paint animation. In 2009, executive producer Paul Tibbitt said [...] "The first season of SpongeBob was done <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way</b> on cells, and every cell had to be part-painted, left to dry, paint some other colours. It's still a time-consuming aspect of the process now, but the digital {{way of doing things}} means it doesn't take long to correct".|$|E
500|$|The {{animation}} {{was handled}} overseas in South Korea at Rough Draft Studios. Throughout the season's run, from 1999 to 2000, SpongeBob was animated using cel animation. The show shifted to digital ink and paint animation during its second season in 2000. Executive producer Paul Tibbitt, in 2009, said [...] " [...] The first season of SpongeBob was done <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way</b> on cells, and every cell {{had to be}} part-painted, left to dry, paint some other colors. It's still a time-consuming aspect of the process now, but the digital {{way of doing things}} means it doesn't take long to correct."

500|$|In this season, {{production}} {{switched from}} cel animation, {{used during the}} first season, to digital ink and paint.

500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way</b> next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
500|$|At {{the insistence}} of {{publishers}} Grosset & Dunlap, the Nancy Drew books were revised beginning in 1959, both to make the books more modern and to eliminate racist stereotypes. Although Harriet Adams felt that these changes were unnecessary, she oversaw a complete overhaul of the series, as well as writing new volumes {{in keeping with the}} new guidelines laid down by Grosset & Dunlap. The series did not so much eliminate racial stereotypes, however, as eliminate non-white characters altogether. For example, in the original version of The Hidden Window Mystery (1956), Nancy visits friends in the south whose African-American servant, [...] "lovable old Beulah... serves squabs, sweet potatoes, corn pudding, piping hot biscuits, and strawberry shortcake." [...] The mistress of the house waits until Beulah has left the room and then says to Nancy, [...] "I try to make things easier for Beulah but she insists on cooking and serving everything <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way.</b> I must confess, though, that I love it." [...] In the revised 1975 version, Beulah is changed to Anna, a [...] "plump, smiling housekeeper".|$|E

500|$|Zinta next {{starred in}} Samir Karnik's Heroes (2008), a road movie about two final-year film {{students}} who, {{as a part}} of their assignment, travel a thousand miles across North India to deliver three un-posted letters written by army personnel who lost their lives during the 1999 Kargil war to their families. The story unfolds the journey of these students in three chapters and follows how they meet and are inspired by the families of the soldiers. Zinta is featured in the first chapter as Salman Khan's war widow, Kuljeet Kaur, a woman who becomes the sole breadwinner of the family and single-handedly raises her son. In preparation for the role, Zinta attended Anupam Kher's acting school, [...] "Actor Prepares" [...] to learn the dialect and mannerisms of a Punjabi woman. The film was released to a mixed critical reaction, but her performance received rave reviews; Anand Singh of Hindustan Times wrote, [...] "Karnik is merely interested in wringing tears <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way,</b> and not in starting a debate. He succeeds—mainly because Preity Zinta brings to a role a gravitas and dignity that is seen on the faces of ordinary women—this may be her coming of age as an actress." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{am afraid}} the {{wholesome}} sweetness of Polly's nature {{was getting a}} little soured by these troubles; but before lasting harm was done, she received, from an unexpected source, some of the real help which teaches young people how to bear these small crosses, by showing them the heavier ones they have escaped, and by giving them {{an idea of the}} higher pleasures one may earn in <b>the</b> good, <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>ways</b> that keep hearts sweet, heads sane, hands busy.|$|R
2500|$|... don't think I'm {{going to}} make albums in <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way,</b> meaning 12–15 songs, etc. in one small package. My desire at this point would be to release one song at a time, {{over a period of}} 2–3 years, with it all adding up to a box set/album of sorts that would also include an art movie of the album... My {{thinking}} is that if I focus on one song at a time I would approach them as beautiful, distinct paintings that would each require the attention they deserve. This would also mean I would choose what I am recording quite carefully as there would be tremendous internal pressure to get it just right, and {{that is the kind of}} pressure I like, which is to make the most beautiful thing possible.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to a request from Arnold-Forster, French submitted a memorandum (7 March 1904) arguing that cavalry still needed to fight <b>the</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way</b> as a European War would begin with a [...] "great cavalry battle". [...] He also sent a copy to the King. [...] In {{response to}} Roberts’ claim {{that he wanted to}} give cavalry the ability to act independently, French wrote in the margin that the campaigns of early 1900 had seen cavalry acting independently, although he replied politely that their differences were not as great as Roberts seemed to think. [...] Roberts had the support of Kitchener (who thought cavalry should be able to seize and hold positions, but not to roam about the battlefield looking for enemy cavalry), but he was away as Commander-in-Chief, India. French was supported by Baden-Powell (Inspector-General of Cavalry), Sir Francis Grenfell (who commented that he had not spoken to any junior officer who agreed with Roberts) and Evelyn Wood. In February 1905, after Roberts' removal as Commander-in-Chief, the Army Council authorised the publication of Haig’s [...] "Cavalry Training" [...] but without Roberts’ preface, although the lance was declared abolished as a weapon of war—a decision ignored by French, who allowed his lancer regiments at Aldershot to carry the lance in field training.|$|E

Daniel Tack claimed that [...] "the cash shop option in this free-to-play game is completely unobtrusive and unnecessary".

60|$|This yearly festival {{was always}} kept at Plumfield in <b>the</b> good <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way,</b> {{and nothing was}} allowed to {{interfere}} with it.

50|$|Regionally, at least, the Spongebath brand itself became fairly {{synonymous with}} top quality music, {{ranging from the}} melodic indie pop of the Features, the Katies' radio-friendly brand of hard rock, or the genre-blurring hip-hop of Count Bass-D. All the Spongebath releases--largely {{recorded}} on minimal, scattershot budgets--tended to receive wonderful critical acclaim. Even the packaging for Spongebath releases was different: Brian Bottcher's artwork for albums like Self's Breakfast with Girls, Fluid Ounces' In <b>the</b> New <b>Old-Fashioned</b> <b>Way,</b> or Count Bass-D's Art for Sale all had an unmistakable, distinct, and sophisticated visual flair.|$|R

The album has a distinctive sound from other releases in the Ounces canon, and features mixing credits by Matt Mahaffey.

And when he brought his bunch of birds to market, his admirers pointed with pride to the marks of his wondrous skill.
