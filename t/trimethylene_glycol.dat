40|$|Of {{the various}} glycols studied thus far, {{propylene}} glycol {{is the only}} one which is relatively non-toxic, and therefore useful as a solvent and vehicle for medicinal and food agents (1, 2, 3). The isomer of propylene glycol has not been previously investigated and nothing is known about its actions or pos-sible toxicity. Since <b>trimethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is isomeric with propylene glycol it was thought desirable to determine similarities in, or differences between, these two compounds. This report presents the results of such a study and shows that <b>trimethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is entirely different pharmacologically from propylene glycol. PROPERTIES OF <b>TRIMETHYLENE</b> <b>GLYCOL</b> The chemical relationship between the propylene and trimethylene glycols is indicated by the following structural formulas...|$|E
40|$|Glycerol and diol {{dehydratases}} are inducible, coenzyme B 12 -dependent enzymes found {{together in}} Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 25955 during anaerobic growth on glycerol. Mutants of this strain isolated by a novel procedure were separately constitutive for either dehydratase, showing the structural genes {{for the two}} enzymes to be under independent control in vivo. Glycerol dehydratase and a <b>trimethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> dehydrogenase were implicated {{as members of a}} pleiotropic control system that includes glycerol dehydrogenase and dihydroxyacetone kinase for the anaerobic dissimilation of glycerol (the "dha system"). The dehydratase and dehydrogenases were induced by dihydroxyacetone and were jointly constitutive in mutants isolated as constitutive for either the dha system or glycerol dehydratase. These data and the stimulation of growth by Co 2 + suggested that glycerol dehydratase and <b>trimethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> dehydrogenase are obligatory enzymes for anaerobic growth on glycerol as the sole carbon source...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus reuteri is a {{prominent}} {{member of the}} Lactobacillus population in the gastrointestinal ecosystem of humans, poultry, swine, and other animals. Reuterin is a newly discovered, broad-spectrum antimicrobial substance produced by this species during fermentation of glycerol. In this report, we describe procedures for (i) producing reuterin in sufficient amounts to isolate from a fermentation mixture and (ii) isolating this substance by high-performance liquid chromatography. By using uniformly labeled [14 C]glycerol, reuterin {{was identified as a}} product of glycerol fermentation associated with the production of beta-hydroxypropionic acid and <b>trimethylene</b> <b>glycol...</b>|$|E
40|$|Meniscus {{tears are}} one of the most {{commonly}} occurring injuries of the knee joint. Current meniscus repair techniques are challenging and do not bring fully satisfactory results. Tissue adhesives are a promising alternative, since they are easy to apply and cause minimal tissue trauma. In this study, a series of amphiphilic copolymers based on polyethylene <b>glycol,</b> <b>trimethylene</b> carbonate and citric acid were synthesized and subsequently end-functionalized with hexamethylene diisocyanate to form reactive adhesive materials. The shear adhesive strength of the networks to bovine meniscus tissue measured in a lap-shear adhesion test ranged between 20 and 80 kPa, which was better than for fibrin glue (10 kPa). The elastic modulus of the networks depended on composition and was in the same range as that of human meniscus. Cell compatibility was assessed using Alamar Blue staining after incubation of the bovine meniscus cells with different concentrations of the glues for 7 days. Cell viability was not affected after adding up to 3 mg of the adhesive/mL of medium. The proposed materials are suitable candidates to be used as resorbable tissue adhesives for meniscus repair. They have excellent mechanical and adhesive properties that can be adjusted by varying the composition of the copolymers. Statement of Significance Meniscal tears often occur and current treatment strategies do not bring fully satisfactory results. Use of biodegradable tissue adhesives would be an interesting option, but currently available adhesives are not suited due to toxicity or poor mechanical properties. Here, we describe the development of novel biodegradable, hyper-branched, adhesive copolymers. These adhesives cure upon contact with water forming flexible networks. Their adhesion to bovine meniscus tissue was significantly better than that of clinically used fibrin glue. The tensile properties of the cured networks were in the same range of values of the human meniscus. When physiologically relevant amounts were added to cells in culture, not toxic effects were observed. Therefore, the proposed materials are interesting resorbable tissue adhesives for meniscus repair. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The {{magnetic}} Co nanoparticle {{was prepared}} by coprecipitation route {{in aqueous solution}} and Figlarz’s polyol method which consists of refluxing a solution of the metal precursor in polyol. As the former method, the Co nanoparticle was synthesized by reduction of cobalt chloride with sodium borohydride in aqueous solution. And the latter method, the polyol method {{can be applied to}} the production of Co nanoparticle by reducing cobalt chloride and cobalt acetate with polyol such as ethylene glycol, <b>trimethylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> The size of nanoparticle was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy images and scanning electron microscopy images, according to the different methods The crystal structure of nanoparticle according to reaction condition was characterized by X-ray diffraction data.

40|$|<b>Trimethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{dimethyl}} ether (triglyme), a Polyethylene glycol (PEG) -like hydrophilic polymer, was deposited by plasma polymerization to reduce RO membrane’s organic fouling tendency. This method has the great advantage of achieving modification in one single step. A series of plasma deposition experiments were undertaken. The successful coating of the polymer {{was confirmed by}} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Water contact angle measurements and permeation experiments using a protein solution were conducted to evaluate the change of hydrophilicity and anti-fouling properties. Salt rejection tests were performed to evaluate membrane performance. A reduction in contact angles from 32 o to 7 o was achieved for the treated membranes, indicating enhanced hydrophilicity. The permeation experiments revealed that the modified membranes achieved an excellent maintenance of flux compared to the untreated membranes. Specifically, after 210 minutes of filtration, no flux decline was found for the modified membranes, while a 27 % reduction of the initial flux was observed for the untreated membrane. Flux recovery after cleaning by water only was up to 99. 5 % for the modified membranes, while for the untreated it was only 91. 0 %. The surface hydrophilic modification of RO membranes by plasma polymerization has shown a clear improvement in membrane anti-fouling performance.

40|$|The {{critical}} supersaturations {{required for}} the homogeneous nucleation (rate of 1 drop[*]cm− 3 [*]s− 1) of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, <b>trimethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and glycerol vapors have been measured over wide temperature ranges (e. g., 280 – 400 K) using an upward thermal diffusion cloud chamber. At lower temperatures the experimental nucleation rates are {{much higher than the}} predictions of the classical nucleation theory. Glycerol shows the best agreement between experiment and theory in the temperature range of 340 – 370 K. An apparent increase in the critical supersaturation of glycerol is observed with increasing carrier gas (helium) pressure and this effect is more pronounced at lower temperatures. The results from corresponding states and scaled nucleation models indicate that the nucleation behavior of glycerol is quite different from other glycols. Glycerol requires higher critical supersaturations compared to the other glycols at the same reduced temperatures. This implies quite small critical clusters for glycerol (20 – 50 molecules) in the temperature range 300 – 380 K. The discrepancy between experiment and theory at lower temperatures may be explained by considering that the surface tension of the critical clusters is lower than the bulk surface tension. It is, however, surprising that a Tolman type correction for the curvature dependent surface tension could be applicable for such small critical clusters. Further theoretical work is required in order to fully understand the observed higher nucleation rates at lower temperatures of glycols and glycerol...|$|E
40|$|The melt {{crystallization}} {{behaviors and}} crystalline structures of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(trimethylene terephthalate), and poly(ethylene-co-trimethylene terephthalate) (PETT) were investigated with {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC), polarized optical microscopy (POM), and X-ray diffraction at various crystallization temperatures (T(c) s). The PETT copolymers were synthesized via the polycondensation of terephthalate with ethylene glycol and <b>trimethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (TG) in various compositions. The copolymers with 69. 0 mol % or more TG or 31. 0 mol % or less TG were crystallizable, but the other copolymers containing 34 - 56 mol % TG were amorphous. The DSC isothermal results revealed that {{the addition of a}} small amount of flexible TG (up to 21 mol %) to the PET structure slightly reduced the formation of three-dimensional spherulites. A greater TG concentration (91 - 100 %) in the copolyesters changed the crystal growth from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. The DSC heating scans after the completion of isothermal crystallization at various T(c) s showed three melting endotherms for PET, PETT- 88, PETT- 84, and PETT- 79 and four melting endotherms for PETT- 9 and PETT. The presence of an additional melting endotherm could be attributed to the melting of thinner and imperfect copolyester crystallites. Analyses of the Lauritzen-Hoffman equation demonstrated that PETT- 88 had the highest values of the product of the lateral and folding surface free energies, and this suggested that the addition of small amounts of flexible trimethylene terephthalate segments to PET disturbed chain regularity, thus increasing molecular chain mobility.
