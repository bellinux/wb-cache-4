5|$|Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> the General staff, christened {{the ship}} at her {{commissioning}} on 6 March 1908. Captain Franz von Hipper was the ship's first commanding officer; he took {{command of the}} ship {{the day she was}} commissioned. He was tasked with conducting the ship's shakedown cruise, which lasted from 26 March to the middle of July. She officially joined the fleet on 12 July. The ship then departed for Asia, though Hipper left the ship and went on to command the I Torpedo-boat Division in Kiel. Gneisenau was assigned to the Ostasiengeschwader (East Asia Squadron), where in 1910 she joined Scharnhorst, which had been assigned to the unit the previous year. The two ships formed the core of the squadron, with Scharnhorst serving as the flagship. The pair were crack gunnery ships; Gneisenau won the Kaiser's Cup four times during her career: twice while in German waters in 1908 and 1909 and twice in Asia in 1910 and 1911, and Scharnhorsts finished in second place in 1913 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Iranian {{students}} {{seized the}} American embassy in Tehran {{and held the}} embassy staff hostage; the first rescue operation, code-named Eagle Claw ended in failure due to equipment and coordination problems, culminating in the crash of a RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopter into a parked C-130 Hercules in the Iranian desert, killing eight servicemen. A second rescue attempt, Operation Credible Sport, was ordered, and Brown was involved in planning and preparation. The follow-up rescue included U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and Army assets. The Army units involved were the battalions {{that made up the}} 101st Aviation Group: the 158th Aviation Battalion, the 229th Aviation Battalion and the 159th Aviation Battalion. All three battalions formed Task Force 158. President Carter meanwhile appointed <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> Naval Operations, Admiral James L.

25|$|After the war, a {{vigorous}} debate among the civilian elites spawned {{the development of}} two new political parties. Silver mining entrepreneurs, who had {{become the most important}} economic group in the country, created the Conservative Party (Partido Conservador) led by Mariano Baptista, a vocal opponent of the War of the Pacific. Conservatives favored reaching a quick peace settlement with Chile that would include a financial indemnity for the lost territories and enable Bolivia to construct a railroad for continued mining exports. The Liberal Party (Partido Liberal) was founded in 1883 by <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> staff, General Eliodoro Camacho and was more hawkish, as it denounced the pacifism of the Conservatives and any peace treaty with Chile. Liberals also resented the dependence of the mining industry on Chilean and British capital and hoped to attract United States investments.|$|E
25|$|The new Haussmann boulevards created {{space for}} new stores, {{and it became}} easier for {{customers}} to cross the city to shop. In a short time, the commerce in novelties, fabrics and clothing began to be concentrated in a few very large department stores. Bon Marché was opened in 1852 by Aristide Boucicaut, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> the Petit Thomas variety store, in a modest building. His venture expanded rapidly, its income growing from 450,000 francs a year to 20 million. Boucicaut commissioned a new building with a glass and iron framework designed in part by Gustave Eiffel. It opened in 1869 and became {{the model for the}} modern department store. The Grand Magasin du Louvre opened in 1855 inside the vast luxury hotel built by the Péreire brothers next to the Louvre and the Place Royale. It was the first department store that concentrated on luxury goods, and tried both to provide bargains and be snobbish. Other department stores quickly appeared: Printemps in 1865, the Grand Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville (BHV) in 1869, and La Samaritaine in 1870. They were soon imitated around the world.|$|E

500|$|The French author Jean-Paul Picaper, {{who studied}} the Oradour {{massacre}} that was perpetrated by {{the men of the}} Das Reich, notes the tendentious nature of Weidinger's narrative: it provided a sanitized version of history without any references to massacres.
