There are various {{commercial}} varieties of tapering jigs, ranging for simple two hinged pieces of aluminum square tubing with a device to maintain angle settings, to more complex varieties that utilize clamps to affix the workpiece to a bed using <b>toggle</b> <b>clamps</b> or other clamping devices.|$|R
40|$|In {{machining}} fixtures, minimizing workpiece deformation due to clamping {{and cutting}} forces {{is essential to}} maintain the machining accuracy. The recent trends in industry are towards adopting the hydraulic techniques, because it save time generates accuracy and it is having some flexibility. Hydraulic Fixture is major application {{in the field of}} designing, where in several software’s are available for the purpose of design. Hydraulic lift housing is engine part of an agricultural tractor which {{plays an important role in}} application of lifting trolley of tractor and machining of hydraulic lift housing is a important task. Loading and unloading of workpiece in manual clamping is time consuming process, so reducing machining time, set up time etc is a main aim of process. The job having cylindrical shape, this is a challenging task for design engineer, hence hydraulic fixture design is incorporated in manufacturing industry. Except <b>toggle</b> <b>clamp,</b> no other option is available to hold cylindrical object, hence special type of fixture is design for this case, which can be used for machining of hydraulic lift housing, Fixture reduces operation time, increases productivity, and best quality of operation is possible. The project deals with the designing of different parts of fixture assembly, 3 D modeling by using Pro-E WILDFIRE 5. 0, finite element analysis of hydraulic lift housing by using ANSYS software...|$|E
40|$|Tribus b. v. is {{a company}} in Utrecht that {{converts}} minibuses for multifunctional public transportation. This means that with the same bus both ambulant people and wheelchair occupants can be transported. The multifunctionality lies in {{the combination of a}} flexible floor layout and (tip) seats. The floor system is based on separate aluminium profiles that are assembled to form any desired floor layout. Tribus' tip seat FlexusPRO meets the highest quality and safety requirements. Because of its integrated three point safety belt, the seat can be positioned anywhere in the vehicle. A common seat layout is the 4 x 4 tip seats, where four FlexusPRO seats are positioned {{on the right side of}} the vehicle and four on the left. By folding the seat pan to the backrest and subsequently rotating the seat package to the side, a wheelchair environment is created without removing or repositioning the seat. This transformation from passenger seat (mode 1) to wheelchair space (mode 2) is an easy and fast operation that enables the transporter to do a combined transportation of ambulant people and wheelchair occupants with the same vehicle. Besides the benefits of Tribus' FlexusPRO, the tip seat also has some main drawbacks with respect to the production costs, weight, the available wheelchair space after seat transformation and the hindered view outside for the wheelchair occupant as a result of the seat dimensions in mode 2. The goal is to overcome these drawbacks, in order for Tribus to be able to launch a new tip seat that exceeds seats of competitors on price, weight, operation and functionality. The goal of this graduation project focuses on the improvements of the seat position in mode 2. This means an improvement of the transformation device, where the overall goal is to reduce the production costs and weight by at least 30 % and increase the view outside for the wheelchair occupant by at least 20 % in combination with an increased lateral wheelchair space of at least 10 %. However, in order to obtain a good design, a complete concept of the new tip seat needs to be proposed, where every aspect of the seat is able to fulfil the design requirements. A morphological approach resulted in three tip seat concepts that are rated with respect to usage and manufacturing aspects. The final concept led to a tip seat with a rotation device and a tilting backrest, that increases the lateral wheelchair space in mode 2. The improvement of the lateral wheelchair space is however dependent on the entire seat design, where the base frame of the seat will be leading. Because the base frame of the seat is not part of this project, a specific percentage of the improvement is not yet known, but an improvement of at least 10 % can be realized. The separate headrest of the seat is moved down during the transformation to mode 2, which improves the view outside for the wheelchair passenger. The entire seat design is also not part of this project, but research on commercial vehicles showed that a vertical adjustment of the headrest of 210 mm is possible, which would improve the view outside by approximately 33 %. The new seat concept is used as a guideline for the design of the two mechanisms that are needed for the transformation from mode 1 to mode 2. The tilting motion of the backrest resulted in a mechanism that provides a simultaneous movement of both backrest and seat pan. The benefit is that the additional (tilting) functionality of the seat had no effect on the amount of operations needed for the transformation. The mechanism is based on the over-centre principle of a <b>toggle</b> <b>clamp.</b> The system uses four pivot points that connects the backrest to both seat pan and seat frame. This innovative solution resulted in the fact that no additional locking devices where necessary to prevent the angular movement of the backrest in mode 1. The loads on the three point belt in the backrest, as a result of a frontal impact, are transferred into the mechanism which is only locked by the geometry of the backrest and seat pan. This mechanism prevents additional costs and weight as a result of the additional tilting functionality. Finally a new rotation device is designed. The use of a morphological approach resulted in four concepts. The best concept is elaborated, resulting in a new steel swivel of 3 kg, which is a weight reduction of 38 %. Because of the minimal amount of components, no welding operations and an easy and fast assembly, the cost price of the swivel is reduced by 47 %. Both tilting mechanism and swivel have been prototyped and they underlined the benefits that are mentioned in this report. The swivel has even been tested by a physical pull test and passed this test successfully. The goal of reducing the production costs and weight by at least 30 % has been exceeded on both aspects. The view outside for the wheelchair occupant could be improved by 33 %, which also exceeds the required 20 %. The required improvement of the lateral wheelchair space by 10 % can still be realized and will exceed this 10 % especially around the arms of the wheelchair occupant. The project has been a success and Tribus decided to continue the development of both mechanisms for series production.

25|$|Wagon brakes {{provide a}} very fast means of locking and {{unlocking}} wagons, but the brakes and stage can be damaged if the running crew attempts to move a wagon while its brakes are engaged. Damage to the stage can be mitigated by using extension spindles with compliant (e.g., polyurethane) tips. <b>Toggle</b> <b>clamps,</b> which are functionally similar to wagon brakes, are sometimes used in lieu of theatrical wagon brakes due to their higher load ratings and more durable construction.|$|R
40|$|A new 6 -degree {{of freedom}} {{dynamometer}} is presented. Six load cells measure the normal forces at the contact points of a three groove kinematic coupling. Three <b>toggle</b> <b>clamps</b> {{are used to}} preload the machine, {{so that it does}} not come apart. The device was designed, analyzed, built and tested. The error will mainly depend on frictional forces, load cells error and the <b>toggle</b> <b>clamps.</b> Frictional forces affect hysteresis, absorption and settlement of the coupling. Different solutions have been designed and tested to reduce friction. First, we tried direct contact between three stainless-steel rods and the stainless-steel load cells. The results were fully distorted due to the high friction of hard steel. We also tried three stainless-steels rods with flexures to contact the steel button cells. The results were much better and more repeatable, but absorption was not good enough. Finally, we tried using Teflon. Teflon is stuck to a steel plate that touches the contact points, leaving Teflon free of high stresses and allowing it to reduce friction between the contacts. The outcome was acceptable. In this case, hysteresis will be reasonably low, absorption is moderate and settlement-based problems are small for small preloads. Fortunately, settlement ability will be improved thanks to vibrations. Future investigations shall look towards low friction solutions, since the sturdiest and most user-friendly design will be the one that minimizes friction during the settlement process. by Jaime Moreu Gamazo.

40|$|Abstract. Clamping unit is an {{important}} component of injection molding machine. The clamping force and the clamping speed of clamping unit not only effect on the quality of molding products, but also determine the cyclic number. The large force amplification and large stroke ratio can reduce energy consumption and improve the productive efficiency. In this article, force amplification ratio and stroke ratio were used as the optimization goals. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm was used as the optimization method. The optimization result was better than the original design. So this article provides a reference for the same or similar product’s optimization.

40|$|Abstract by Jason Katrina Abstract Statement: The {{purpose of}} this senior project {{is to create a}} jig that will enable a c-clamp to be locked in place while {{secondary}} machining processes can be performed. While it is held in place, a milling operation will be done to face the clamping surfaces. A separate bushing holder can be bolted onto the main mount so a hole can be drilled precisely on the threaded end of the c-clamp. To see this project through, it will require the use of engineering analysis techniques that have been learned in previous classes to find the forces applied to the c-clamp while it is held in place. The magnitude of the forces and dimensions of the C-clamp were used to develop the design of the fixture and drawn in Solidworks. After everything has been made to fit on the computer, raw material and hardware will be purchased to start the construction part of the project. The school has the necessary equipment to do all the machining operations needed for the project, so everything will be done on campus. The testing procedure involves putting the free end of the c-clamp under a pre-determined load in the x, y, and z-axes to test if the <b>toggle</b> <b>clamps</b> can hold it in place. The completed project meets all of the standards that were found in the analysis stage of the project and functions as originally envisioned. Keywords:,...|$|R
