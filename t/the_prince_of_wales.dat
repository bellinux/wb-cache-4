40|$|Most acute {{cases of}} {{infection}} with hepatitis E virus (HEV) in Hong Kong were autochthonous, sporadic, and occurred in older adults. All except 1 isolate belonged to genotype 4; most were phylogenetically related to swine isolates. The epidemiology {{is similar to}} that in industrialized countries, where zoonosis is the major source of HEV infection in humans. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of enterically transmitted acute hepatitis throughout Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Large outbreaks resulting from fecal contamination of drinking water are confined mainly to developing countries (1), whereas sporadic cases in industrialized countries are thought to be zoonotic, with swine being the most likely reservoir (2). Studies in Hong Kong reported a seroprevalence of 16 %– 19 % (3). No large outbreak has been recorded in Hong Kong, and the sporadic cases are believed to be imported (4). Our study examined the epidemiology and genotype distribution of HEV infections in Hong Kong in an effort to improve control of this disease.

5|$|By November, Victoria and Albert had {{returned}} to Windsor, and <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> {{had returned}} to Cambridge, {{where he was a}} student. Two of Albert's cousins, King Pedro V and Prince Ferdinand of Portugal, died of typhoid fever. On top of this news, Albert was informed that gossip was spreading in gentlemen's clubs and the foreign press that <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> was still involved with Nellie Clifden. Albert and Victoria were horrified by their son's indiscretion, and feared blackmail, scandal or pregnancy. Although Albert was ill and at a low ebb, he travelled to Cambridge to see <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> on 25 November to discuss his son's indiscreet affair. In his final weeks Albert suffered from pains in his back and legs.|$|E
5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, disliked <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> {{and took}} little {{interest}} in his grandchildren.

[...] The journal contained Hearne's accounts of his explorations of the northern reaches of North America, and Hearne pleaded with La Pérouse for its return. The request was granted on condition that the journal be published. [...] Whether Hearne had intended to publish it anyway is unclear, but by 1792, the year of Hearne's death, he had prepared a manuscript and submitted it for publication.

5|$|In March 1861, Victoria's {{mother and}} Albert's aunt, the Duchess of Kent, died and Victoria was grief-stricken; Albert took {{on most of}} the Queen's duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble.

In August, Victoria and Albert visited the Curragh Camp, Ireland, where <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> was doing army service. At the Curragh, <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> was introduced, by his fellow officers, to Nellie Clifden, an Irish actress.|$|E
5|$|In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled {{over the}} terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most {{reasonable}} for George III's eldest son and heir apparent, <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> to act as regent, to Pitt’s consternation Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered.|$|E

5|$|At Swansea, the Tennant Canal {{could be}} relinked to <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> Dock, and hence to the River Tawe, {{which has become}} a large marina since the {{construction}} of a tidal barrage.

Associated British Ports, who run Swansea Docks, rejected the idea of a canal link in 1997, but since then <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> Dock has become the subject of a regeneration scheme, and a route for the canal has been reserved in the planning document. The feasibility of this scheme and a possible route was investigated in a report by the engineers W. S. Atkins published in 2003. A report for Natural Resources Wales by Trilein Ltd. recommended a range of initiatives to better connect the urban areas of the city to the more rural east of the county, including Crymlyn Bog. The reconnection of the Tennant Canal to <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> Dock was again outlined in that report.|$|E
