5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine Tables {{and the related}} Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather {{as well as political}} events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.|$|E

5|$|The {{dynamics}} of the air war changed in June 1941. The German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, opened up the Eastern Front. The German bomber force was heavily committed to the theatre. <b>The</b> <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> the fighting in the Mediterranean and North African theatres also diverted German air strength. The operations of the Luftwaffe over Britain changed dramatically. Small numbers of bombers would make hit-and-run attacks on selected targets near the coast {{for the remainder of}} 1941, replacing the mass raids of the preceding autumn and winter. Cunningham used the decline in the pace of operations to train new crews.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{complexion}} of the American {{effort was}} altered on 8 March 1965, when 3,500 U.S. Marines came ashore at Da Nang, ostensibly {{to defend the}} southern airfields committed to prosecuting Rolling Thunder. The mission of the ground forces was expanded to combat operations and, from that point onward, the aerial campaign became a secondary operation, overwhelmed by troop deployments and <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> ground operations in South Vietnam. Until {{the third week of}} April, Rolling Thunder had enjoyed at least equal status with air missions conducted in the south. After that time, strikes that interfered with requirements for the southern battlefield were either cut back or cancelled.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> the Cold War was {{highlighted}} by Truman's approval of NSC-68, a secret statement of foreign policy.

The document {{was drafted by}} Paul Nitze, who consulted State and Defense officials; it was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and for building up the U.S. both militarily and economically.|$|E

5|$|In November 1940 Air Marshal Sholto Douglas became Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Fighter Command. On 8 December 1940 a {{directive}} from the Air Staff called for Sector Offensive Sweeps. It ordered hit-and-run operations over Belgium and France. The operations {{were to be}} conducted by three squadrons to harass German air defences. On 10 January 1941 Circus attacks were initiated by sending small bomber formations protected by large numbers of fighters. <b>The</b> <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> offensive operations throughout 1941 was designed to draw up the Luftwaffe as Douglas' Command took an increasingly offensive stance. These operations {{became known as the}} Circus offensive. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, AOC 11 Group, penned Operations Instruction No. 7, which he had written on 16 February. Leigh-Mallory outlined six distinct operations for day fighters: Ramrod (bomber escort with primary goal the destruction of the target); Fighter Ramrod (The same goal where fighters escorted ground-attack fighters); Roadstead (Bomber escort and anti-shipping operations); Fighter Roadstead (the same operation as Roadstead but without bombers) along with Rhubarb (poor weather ground attack operation) and Circus operations (see glossary).|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of the Confrontation is {{generally}} split into three distinct phases. In the first, Indonesia supported revolts against the Anglo-Malaysian rule in Northern Borneo, most notably the Brunei Revolt in December 1962. In the second, the guerrilla raids for which this conflict is most reputed for began in earnest, from April 1963 onwards. The fighting in this phase, while causing some damage and casualties, was relatively small in scale and the incursions were usually only made by small bands of no more than platoon size crossing the Kalimantan border into Sarawak and Sabah. These operations were the essence of the initial strategy to improve the Indonesian negotiating position and continued alongside said negotiations throughout the summer of 1963. However, 16 September, the negotiations concluded with the formation of the Malaysian Federation, which included Malaya, Singapore, and most importantly, the two Borneo states (Sarawak and Sabah). In response, the raids were intensified into larger groups working with or consisting of Indonesian regular troops. This was the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> the conflict into its third and most dangerous phase.|$|E

40|$|John Sutton's (1991) widely {{acclaimed}} book on {{sunk costs}} and market structure contains several robust predictions. The authors' empirical results across exogenous and endogenous sunk cost markets support most of Sutton's robust predictions.

Increasing market size reduces concentration's lower bound faster in exogenous sunk cost markets.

40|$|<b>Escalation</b> <b>of</b> {{construction}} costs constitute {{a substantial part}} of the total costs of many construction projects. Drastically changing escalation rates can have adverse effects on the success of such projects. The main objective of this thesis is to examines construction cost escalation and recommend suitable analytical techniques to quantify its impact. [...] <b>The</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> are examined. Many of these causes are found to be unpredictable by their very nature. As such <b>the</b> main effect <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> is to cause risk and uncertainty regarding a project's cost. [...] Methods of assessing the amounts allowed in construction contracts to cover escalation are reviewed. It is established that these amounts ran best be assessed using the concept of expected utility value. Based on this concept, financially stable contractors will include larger monetary sums to cover cost escalation risk than a large owner, like government, {{would be willing to pay}} for the same risk. [...] Forecasts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> are required for budgetary and bidding purposes. These forecasts may be obtained by forecasting cost indices that measure <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> rate and applying this rate to the estimated cash flow. Methods of forecasting construction cost indices using time series analysis are examined. The theories underlying these methods are outlined. The application of these methods using a computer software package is illustrated. [...] Methods of using the forecasted indices are reviewed. Parsimony is found to dictate use of cost flow models based on polynomial regression. The use of such cost flow models is demonstrated. [...] None of the available forecasting techniques are found to provide a panacea for obviating the effect <b>of</b> construction cost <b>escalation.</b> <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> can be minimized by carefully allocating <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> using escalation clauses. Guidelines for <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> clauses are stipulated. It is concluded that except for than in short construction projects to be built under stable conditions, <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> should be borne by the owner. [...] Various types <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> clauses are reviewed. Use <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> clauses incorporating a formula based on indices is recommended. It is also recommended that regularly published indices should be maintained to provide for construction cost escalation and for use in other estimating situations...|$|R
