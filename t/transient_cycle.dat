In this paper, a performance analysis of a rate-based flow control mechanism is presented. In our analytical model, the number of active sources is variable. A new source arrives when a connection is established, and an existing source departs when it has transmitted its data. Hence our model not only reflect the real scenes, but also correctly estimate the effect of the rate-based flow control. Due to this variation, the analysis of the steady state is not enough. Therefore the analysis of <b>transient</b> <b>cycles</b> is also developed. Using the results of both analyses, we derive the equations of cell loss probability and utilization.

All operated animals showed a response to the LD cycle in their locomotor rhythm, no matter which area of the eye was left intact: They either stably entrained to an LD cycle or showed a sign of weak entrainment. The capacity for stable entrainment was still retained when only 262 ommatidia were left. <b>Transient</b> <b>cycles</b> needed for re-entrainment, following a 6 -hr phase advance of the LD cycle, were measured in 20 reduced-eye animals showing clear stable entrainment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the tail asymptotics of queueing networks with subexponential service time distributions. Our objective is to investigate the tail characteristics of key performance measures such as cycle times and waiting times on a variety of queueing models which may arise in many applications such as communication and manufacturing systems. First, we focus on a general class of closed feedforward fork and join queueing networks under the assumption that the service time distribution of at least one station is subexponential. Our goal is to derive the tail asymptotics of <b>transient</b> <b>cycle</b> times and waiting times. Furthermore, we argue that under certain conditions the asymptotic tail distributions remain the same for stationary cycle times and waiting times. Finally, we provide numerical experiments in order to understand how fast the convergence of tail probabilities of cycle times and waiting times is to their asymptotic counter parts. Next, we consider closed tandem queues with finite buffers between stations. We assume that at least one station has a subexponential service time distribution. We analyze this system under communication blocking and manufacturing blocking rules. We are interested in the tail asymptotics of <b>transient</b> <b>cycle</b> times and waiting times. Furthermore, we study under which conditions on system parameters a stationary regime exists and the transient results can be generalized to stationary counter parts. Finally, we provide numerical examples to understand the convergence behavior of the tail asymptotics of <b>transient</b> <b>cycle</b> times and waiting times. Finally, we study open tandem queueing networks with subexponential service time distributions. We assume that number of customers in front of the first station is infinite and there is infinite room for finished customers after the last station but the size of the buffer between two consecutive stations is finite. Using (max,+) linear recursions, we investigate the tail asymptotics of transient response times and waiting times under both communication blocking and manufacturing blocking schemes. We also discuss under which conditions these results can be generalized to the tail asymptotics of stationary response times and waiting times. Finally, we provide numerical examples to investigate the convergence of the tail probabilities of transient response times and waiting times to their asymptotic counter parts. Ph. D.

40|$|Use of {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) to model the complex, 3 D disk cavity flow and heat transfer in conjunction with an industrial finite element analysis (FEA) of turbine disk thermomechanical response during a full <b>transient</b> <b>cycle</b> is demonstrated. The FEA and CFD solutions were coupled using a previously proposed efficient coupling procedure. This iterates between FEA and CFD calculations at each time step of the transient solution to ensure consistency of temperature and heat flux on the appropriate component surfaces. The FEA model is a 2 D representation of high pressure and intermediate pressure (IP) turbine disks with surrounding structures. The front IP disk cavity flow is calculated using 45 deg sector CFD models with up to 2. 8 million mesh cells. Three CFD models were initially defined for idle, maximum take-off, and cruise conditions, and these are updated by the automatic coupling procedure through the 13, 000 s full <b>transient</b> <b>cycle</b> from stand-still to idle, maximum take-off, and cruise conditions. The obtained disk temperatures and displacements are compared with an earlier standalone FEA model that used established methods for convective heat transfer modeling. It was demonstrated that the coupling could be completed using a computer cluster with 60 cores within about 2 weeks. This turn around time is considered fast enough to meet design phase requirements, and in validation, it also compares favorably to that required to hand-match a FEA model to engine test data, which is typically several months.

The test fuels used varied by sulfur concentration: “ 2 D ” diesel at a nominal 350 ppmS; NR-grade diesel at both 2500 and 3300 ppmS; and ultra-low sulfur diesel, nominally less than 10 ppmS.
