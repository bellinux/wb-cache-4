5|$|Employing the Sub Intelligent Numbers Selector {{theory that}} {{assigned}} non-descript unit names and randomized numerical designations to formations {{in order to}} disguise their role from the enemy, the company was designated the 8213th Army Unit.

This decision was unique to <b>the</b> <b>Eighth</b> Army Ranger Company, as subsequent companies assumed the lineage of Ranger units from World War II, and veterans later expressed resentment with the choice as it prevented the company from accruing its own campaign streamers or unit decorations.

50|$|In 1970, {{just before}} the book began its first {{print-run}} in the US, the publishers asked if Freeman would change its long title to something more succinct.

The book was an instant success and has been translated into several languages. While continuing his farming, Freeman followed {{it up with a}} series of titles under the same banner, including <b>The</b> Mighty <b>Eighth</b> War Diary, <b>The</b> Mighty <b>Eighth</b> War Manual and <b>the</b> Mighty <b>Eighth</b> in Colour. His overall output of some 60 books also included works about the wartime Royal Air Force, individual aircraft studies, airfield histories and profiles of USAAF units - including the Boxted-based 56th Fighter Group of Freeman’s youth.
