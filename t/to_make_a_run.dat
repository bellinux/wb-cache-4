In their 2007 season preview magazine, CBS Sportsline.com listed McCoy as one of twelve players on the “Heisman Watch”; saying “We were touting him for the Heisman midway through his freshman season until he was injured against Kansas State. Older and stronger, McCoy has an awesome receiving corps <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> at the hardware for real.” He {{is also one of the}} 35 quarterbacks placed on the 2007 Manning Award watch list. Further, the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award Watch List added McCoy on August 21, 2007.|$|E

25|$|As an {{unrestricted}} free agent {{prior to the}} 2003–04 season, Payton, along with Karl Malone, signed with the Los Angeles Lakers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> at their first NBA Championship. Payton started in all 82 games and averaged 14.6 points with 5.5 assists and 1.2 steals but struggled with Lakers coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense, which limited his ball-handling and post-up opportunities. Payton provided offense in games where superstar teammates Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant could not play due to injury, including a 30-point output in an overtime win against the Cleveland Cavaliers on February 4.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 {{season began}} on March 16 with {{the sudden death of}} Doug Hamilton, the team's 43-year-old general manager, who {{suffered}} a heart attack on board a plane carrying the team back from Costa Rica where they had played Saprissa in the CONCACAF Champions' Cup. The team finished fifth in the Western Conference, eliminating them from playoff contention {{for the first time since}} the league's inception. Midway through the season, Steve Sampson was sacked as Head Coach, replaced by Frank Yallop. The team managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> to the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup final, but lost 3–1 against the Chicago Fire.|$|E
25|$|The Spurs christened the SBC Center {{in style}} on November 1, 2002 by {{defeating}} the Toronto Raptors 91–72. The Spurs {{would not get}} off to a flying start as they had just a 19–13 record heading into January. In January the Spurs began to gel and seemed prepped <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run,</b> when they embarked on their annual Rodeo Road Trip, a nine-game road trip from January 25 to February 16. However, it would be hardly a bump in the road for the charging Spurs, who won eight of the nine and began to climb their way to first place. The Spurs went on to erase their seven-game deficit and finished the season in a tie with the Dallas Mavericks for {{the best record in the}} NBA (60–22). Thanks to a tiebreaker, the Spurs won their third straight Division title as Tim Duncan claimed his second straight NBA MVP.|$|E

25|$|The 2015–16 Ottawa Senators {{season was}} the 24th season (23rd season of play) of the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Senators {{failed to make}} the playoffs {{for the second time in}} three seasons. In {{addition}} to this, no Canadian teams make the playoffs. A major trade was made during the season to bring Dion Phaneuf to the Senator and improve the team defence, but the team was not able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> to secure a playoff spot. Two significant faults in the team were noted by the media. The club allowed 247 goals, third-highest in the league. Secondly, the team's penalty-killing unit ranked 29th in the league. One day after the regular season, general manager (GM) Bryan Murray stepped down and assistant GM Pierre Dorion became GM. Head coach Dave Cameron and the coaching staff was fired two days later.|$|E
25|$|University Chancellor Wesley Posvar {{took action}} {{to revive the}} {{football}} program and hired Johnny Majors from Iowa State to resurrect the program in 1973. Majors immediately upgraded the recruiting, most notably bringing in future Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett. Majors' impact was immediate: in Pitt's first game with Majors as coach, the Panthers travelled to the University of Georgia where they tied Vince Dooley's Bulldogs 7–7. The excitement in the city was palpable as the Panthers improved from one win in 1972 to a 6–5–1 record in 1973. Their success earned the Panthers their first bowl bid since 1956 when they were invited to play Arizona State in the 1973 Fiesta Bowl, where they lost 28–7. The next season saw further improvement with wins at Florida State and Georgia Tech to finish 7–4. In 1975, a Sun Bowl victory over Kansas capped an 8–4 record highlighted by wins at Georgia and Notre Dame. The stage was thus set for the 1976 edition of the Panthers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> for the National Championship.|$|E
25|$|Määttä {{joined a}} London team primed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> for the J. Ross Robertson Cup. The Knights won their first five games by a {{combined}} score of 31–10 and did not look back. London ended the regular season with {{the best record in}} the OHL (49–18–0–1) and the top defence in their conference. Along the way to posting a +25 plus-minus rating for the team, Määttä paced the team in defensive scoring with 32 points in 58 games, despite missing 6 games in the middle of the season to play for Finland at the 2012 World Junior Championships. Seeking to improve on Finland's sixth-place finish in 2011, Määttä was expected to be a key contributor for his team, but in the tournament opener he was concussed on a hit by Canada's Boone Jenner and missed the remainder of the tournament. Finland ultimately finished fourth without him. In the OHL playoffs, Määttä continued his strong play, only being held pointless in just five of London's 19 post-season games. As the Knights rolled through each series, losing only three games on their way to their first title since 2004–05, Määttä finished tied for the team lead in scoring with 23 points in 19 games.|$|E

25|$|In 2009–10 the Barrie Colts {{celebrated their}} 15th {{season in the}} OHL. The Colts {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> at the Memorial Cup by bringing in proven goal scorers like Bryan Cameron and Luke Pither. They also upgraded their defence by bringing in Nick Crawford, T. J. Brodie and St. Louis Blues draftpick Alex Pietrangelo. Role players like Zac Rinaldo, Matt Kennedy, and goalie Mavric Parks were also traded for before the deadline. All of these trades seemed to have paid dividends as the Colts had a 22-game win-streak, and finished the regular season with an unprecedented record of 57–9–0–2, {{for a total of}} 116 points. Bryan Cameron scored a franchise record 53 goals and the team captured their fourth Emms Trophy for finishing first in the Central Division, and also the franchises first Hamilton Spectator Trophy for finishing first overall in the OHL. Beginning the 2009–10 playoffs the Colts quickly defeated the Sudbury Wolves 4–0 in the Conference Quarter-Finals, before sweeping the Brampton Battalion in the Conference Semi-Finals. In the Conference Finals the Colts finally met some stiff competition but were still able to defeat the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors 4–1 and win the Bobby Orr Trophy. In the J. Ross Robertson Cup finals the Barrie Colts hosted the defending Memorial Cup Champions Windsor Spitfires who the Colts had defeated both times the two teams met in the regular season. The Colts never looked on top of their game, making uncharacteristic defensive mistakes. The Colts were defeated in four games bringing an end to one of the best OHL seasons in history.|$|E
25|$|The {{summer of}} 1998 brought {{an abrupt end}} to the {{championship}} era. Krause felt that the Bulls {{were on the verge}} of being too old and unable to compete. He decided that the team's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow decline. His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft picks while clearing salary cap space <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> at several promising free agents in two years' time. After having been vetoed in a previous attempt by owner Jerry Reinsdorf, Krause traded Scottie Pippen for Roy Rogers (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. He also decided not to re-sign Dennis Rodman, and traded Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for other draft picks. He hired a new coach, Tim Floyd, who had run a successful program at Iowa State University. Upon Phil Jackson's departure, Michael Jordan made his second retirement official. With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy Brown, shooting guard Ron Harper, newcomer Brent Barry at small forward, power forward Toni Kukoč, and center Bill Wennington, the team began the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. Kukoc led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists, but the team won only 13 of 50 games. The lowest point of the season came on April 10 in a game against the Miami Heat. In that game, the Bulls scored 49 points to set an NBA record for the fewest points in a game in the shot clock era.|$|E

500|$|At {{his high}} school reunion, Peter pretends to be a secret agent-astronaut-millionaire who wears a cowboy hat to impress his classmates, but the truth comes out when he meets Tom Brady. He {{subsequently}} gets drunk and has <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> for the bathroom, knocking over everyone {{between him and the}} bathroom. Brady is impressed and gets Peter a spot on the New England Patriots football team as the starting center. Peter is soon fired for showboating in a game versus the Dallas Cowboys, driving on to the field then performing a massively-choreographed version of the song [...] "Shipoopi" [...] after scoring one touchdown. He is traded to the London Silly Nannies, who apparently have no clue on how to play football. Peter decides to turn them around and challenges Brady to a game between the Silly Nannies and the Patriots. On the opening kickoff, Peter's teammates become terrified of the Patriots rushing toward them and run away, leaving Peter to face them alone. He tries and is immediately tackled. However, Brady compliments Peter on having the nerve to stand up to them.|$|E
500|$|Louisiana Tech {{knocked off}} N.C. State in their {{semifinal}} match, 84–65, making {{the national championship}} a match-up between the two teams that started the season ranked first and second. The game was not close. Seven {{and a half minutes}} through the first half, the Lady Vols were up by fifteen, and by halftime the score was 55–32. The 55 points was a record for most points in a half in a national championship game. Tech was not able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> until late in the second half, when they were able to cut the lead down to eighteen, only to see Kellie Jolly hit back-to-back three pointers. The final score was 93 to 75. Three different Lady Vols scored twenty or more points: Holdsclaw (25), Catchings (27), and Jolly (20). Holdsclaw, who was named the Final Four MVP, her second consecutive, also won her seventh straight title (3 NCAA, 4 State). After the game, Louisiana Tech head coach Leon Balmore proclaimed this Lady Vols squad to be the [...] "best ever", something Old Dominion Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman has stated back in February. However, not everyone was positive, as ESPN analyst Mimi Griffin stated that Tennessee's dominance was becoming a detriment to the women's game.|$|E
500|$|The stadium {{observed}} {{a period of}} silence {{in memory of the}} victims of the July bombings in London, and a mark of respect to Arsenal fan Anthony Walker, killed on Merseyside the previous week. Arsenal in their away strip of yellow kicked off the match; they won a corner after four minutes, but their threat was averted by Chelsea. In the eighth minute Del Horno hit a long pass to the edge of Arsenal’s right area. Drogba controlled the ball with his chest and went beyond his marker Philippe Senderos. He shot the ball past goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the Arsenal goal to give Chelsea a 1–0 lead. Arsenal began to dominate proceedings, but struggled to make use of their advantage. A slip by Senderos in the 20th minute invited Robben <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> down {{the right side of the}} pitch, but the chance for Chelsea was brief as Senderos won the ball back. Four minutes later Fàbregas and Claude Makélélé were each shown a yellow card for clashing with one another. Arsenal in the 36th minute fashioned their best chance of the game through Kolo Touré, whose shot forced goalkeeper Petr Čech to save in an acrobatic manner. Six minutes before the interval Drogba was ruled offside, but continued to run in the direction of Arsenal’s goal. He went down on a challenge from Lauren and proceeded to roll around Arsenal’s penalty area once Lehmann got involved – the [...] "farce" [...] was brought to a close after words from the referee.|$|E
