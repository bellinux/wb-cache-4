5|$|After delays, {{the voyage}} began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin {{spent most of}} <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> land {{investigating}} geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including {{a copy of his}} journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected in a calm spell.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>on,</b> vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} {{campaign}} against shipping, around each full moon from late January 1945 XXBomber Command conducted minelaying missions. On the night of 25/26January, 41 B-29s from the 444th and 468th Bombardment Groups laid six minefields in the approaches to Singapore. On the same night other B-29s laid mines off Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay {{as part of the}} largest single aerial minelaying effort in the Pacific up to <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>On</b> the night of 27/28February, twelve B-29s were dispatched to lay mines in the Straits of Johor near Singapore. Ten of these aircraft successfully deployed 55 mines in the target area, and another aircraft mined Penang. During the next full moon period on the night of 28/29March, 22 B-29s laid mines near Singapore. No aircraft were lost during these missions.|$|E

From <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|Atlético versus América {{was known}} as the Clássico das Multidões ("Derby of the Masses") before the {{construction}} of the Mineirão, as they were the most popular clubs in the state. In their first years, América {{was known as}} an elitist club, while Atlético had popular appeal; the former dominated {{the early years of the}} encounter, winning ten consecutive Campeonato Mineiro titles from 1916 to 1925. In the 1930s, Atlético pioneered professionalization of football in Minas Gerais, whereas América resisted against it. From <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>on,</b> Galo became the major force between the two, with América suffering a setback as a result of its internal disagreements regarding professionalism.|$|E
5|$|Between {{this action}} and February 19, 1945, Davis flew another 47 missions, most escorting bombers or ships, in {{addition}} to a few ground-attack missions, but saw little or no aerial combat in <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>On</b> February 19, he was withdrawn from the front to begin certification on the P-51 Mustang, logging 45 hours of training time on the aircraft through the end of March. He returned to combat duty only briefly in April, flying in three combat missions as a copilot aboard a B-25 Mitchell bomber. On May 3, 1945, he was reassigned to Goodfellow Field at San Angelo, Texas, helping to train new pilots and serving as an operations officer for the base {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|During the 1900 campaign, Harvey {{had visited}} Northwest Arkansas, an area {{known for its}} unique {{pristine}} natural beauty. In October 1900 he purchased 320acres (130ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare {{the house for the}} rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.|$|E

After the match, Teddy Long fired Ziggler, and Guerrero followed the next week after losing a tag team match with Drew McIntyre against Edge and Kelly Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Falun Gong, a qigong {{practice}} that combines meditation with the moral philosophy articulated by founder Li Hongzhi, first began spreading widely in China in 1992.

From <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>on,</b> Li gave lectures in other major cities in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North America. He has resided permanently in the United States since 1998. Falun Gong is now practiced in some 70 countries worldwide, and the teachings have been translated to over 40 languages.

5|$|Godley's II ANZAC Corps {{consisted}} of the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions along with the ANZAC Mounted Division, and it took over the defensive duties of the I ANZAC Corps. The two Australian divisions were still relatively raw and Godley oversaw the intensive training of both formations. By the end of May 1916, he considered the divisions to be the equal of the 1st and 2nd Australian divisions, which were by <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the Western Front. The following month, the divisions of II ANZAC Corps began departing for France. Godley went on leave {{for a short time}} during this period of transition for his corps. In July, he returned to duty and II ANZAC Corps took over the section of the front line previously occupied by the I ANZAC Corps, near Armentieres. Later that same month, the 5th Division participated in the Battle of Fromelles in support of the neighbouring British XI Corps. It, together with the 4th Division, would later be transferred to the Somme.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Youngblood was a Second-team All-pro {{selection}} {{and went to}} the first of his seven Pro Bowls and led the Rams with 16½ sacks.

Beginning in the 1973 season, the Rams added the unrelated Jim Youngblood to its roster, so from <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>on,</b> both Youngbloods had the unique distinction of having their entire name on the back of their jerseys, the given name appearing above the family name. The following year, 1974, the Rams again led the NFL in rushing defense and Youngblood led the Rams with 15 sacks while being voted a consensus First-team All-Pro.
