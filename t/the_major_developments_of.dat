25|$|<b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> {{the early}} 20th century were the Arab Revolt during World War I and the {{subsequent}} collapse and partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The Arab Revolt (1916–1918) was initiated by the Sherif Hussein ibn Ali {{with the aim of}} securing independence from the ruling Ottoman Empire and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.|$|E

After this <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> MPM have continued both in the national labs {{as well as the}} University of New Mexico, Oregon State University, University of Utah and more across the US and the world. Recently the number of institutions researching MPM has been growing with added popularity and awareness coming from various sources such as MPM's use in the Disney film Frozen.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> {{weapons in}} <b>the</b> early modern and modern periods {{occurred}} with firearms, which became progressively more efficient. Gunpowder settled into its standard ratio in the 17th century, and general ballistic technology improved.

50|$|The strut-braced {{wings of}} the Decathlon are, like the {{fuselage}} and tail surfaces, fabric covered, using aluminum ribs. The wings of Champion and Bellanca Decathlons were built with wooden spars. American Champion has been using aluminum spars in the aircraft it has produced and has made the aluminum-spar wings available for retrofit installation on older aircraft. Compared to the Citabria’s wingspan of 33.5 ft, the Decathlon’s wingspan is shorter, at 32 ft. One of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the 8KCAB Decathlon over the 7KCAB Citabria is the Decathlon’s wing, which employs a semi-symmetrical airfoil, {{as opposed to the}} Citabria’s flat-bottomed airfoil. This change gives the Decathlon better inverted flight and negative-g maneuver capabilities.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 Ghosh {{moved to}} the USA and joined the Mathematics Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. There he worked until he retired in 2005, first as an Assistant and as an Associate Professor, from 1968 on as a Full Professor of Mathematics. Although he {{published}} a series of interesting papers on distribution theory, density estimators etc. he was {{best known for his}} work on sequential analysis: International recognition found his monograph “Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses”. In 1982 he founded, jointly with Pranab Kumar Sen (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), the journal “Sequential Analysis” and served as Co-Editor until 1995. Also jointly with P.K.

5000|$|American comedy {{films are}} comedy films {{produced}} in the United States. The genre {{is one of the}} oldest in American cinema; some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. With the advent of sound in the late 1920s and 1930s, comedic dialogue rose in prominence in the work of film comedians such as W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers. By the 1950s, the television industry had become serious competition for the movie industry. The 1960s saw an increasing number of broad, star-packed comedies. In the 1970s, black comedies were popular. Leading figures in the 1970s were Woody Allen and Mel Brooks. One of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the 1990s was the re-emergence of the romantic comedy film. Another development was the increasing use of [...] "gross-out humour".|$|E
50|$|Back in Peru, {{the station}} {{came under the}} {{management}} of military government entities such as OCI and later Telecentro, which also operated competitor América Televisión on channel 4. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Telecentro era was a new newscast: 24 Horas (Peru), which launched in 1973, soon supplanting El Panamericano as the station's flagship news program and becoming Peru's most watched newscast.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tredwell Farm {{property}} {{took place}} from 1868-76, and was {{primarily in the}} form of Italianate row houses, with echoes of the French Second Empire style. The Presbyterian Church of the Redeemer, now the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Peace, was built in 1886-87, and six-story apartment buildings at 245 and 247 East 62nd Street were built in 1899-1900.|$|R
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> distinctions of <b>the</b> Town of Shenandoah is its flood prone nature due to {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the Shenandoah River. Time and time again, the town has been ravaged with floods.

5000|$|The {{development}} of the garden was continued by Henry and Agnes Pochin’s daughter Laura McLaren, Baroness Aberconway, who married Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway. Laura, like her mother, [...] was a campaigner for women’s suffrage and founded the Liberal Women’s Suffrage Union. She was also a passionate gardener and inspired her son Henry McLaren, 2nd Baron Aberconway, to whom she entrusted {{the care of the}} garden in 1901. Together they created the Skating Pond at the Far End and began work on the Italianate Terraces. Henry McLaren oversaw <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the garden. He sponsored plant hunting expeditions of the day by explorers such as Ernest Wilson, George Forrest and Frank Kingdon-Ward who brought back plants from the China and the Himalayas including magnolias, camellias and rhododendrons. He also invested in a plant breeding programme producing Bodnant hybrid rhododendrons.|$|E
5000|$|Drucker's {{books and}} {{scholarly}} and popular articles explored how humans are organized across the business, government, and nonprofit sectors of society. He {{is one of}} the best-known and most widely influential thinkers and writers on the subject of management theory and practice. His writings have predicted many of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the late twentieth century, including privatization and decentralization; the rise of Japan to economic world power; the decisive importance of marketing; and the emergence of the information society with its necessity of lifelong learning. In 1959, Drucker coined the term “knowledge worker," [...] and later in his life considered knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management. Peter Drucker gave his name to three institutions: the Drucker Institute and the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management, both at Claremont Graduate University, and the Peter F. Drucker Academy. [...] The annual Global Peter Drucker Forum in his hometown of Vienna, honors his legacy.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{piece of}} federal {{legislation}} governing the airborne release of mercury in the United States is the Clean Air Act. Unlike the criteria air pollutants, mercury is classified under the Act as a hazardous air pollutant {{and is thus}} subject to control under the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP's) rather than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The key distinction is that the former is controlled by establishing performance standards under a program known as maximum achievable control technology standards (MACT), designed to reduce hazardous air pollutant emissions to a maximum achievable degree, by setting a standard at least as stringent as the emission reductions achieved by {{the average of the}} top 12% best controlled in the same pollution sources. However, as of early 2011, no federal limits of mercury from coal and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units (EGU's) were on the books. The development of a regulatory policy framework to guide the emissions of mercury from power plants is on-going, <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> which have occurred largely within the last decade.|$|E
50|$|Seven {{buildings}} {{were built in}} 1869 and 1870, representing <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex. The primary focus of this expansion was the Main Mill, which is 165 ft long, and the Long Mill, which is 196 ft. The Main Mill was originally built with three stories and a mansard-roofed fourth, which was raised to a full fourth story c. 1900. The Long Mill was originally 2.5 stories, and was raised to a full three stories in 1880.|$|R
50|$|Although it {{was already}} a {{significant}} route to <b>the</b> interior, <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river as a trade route was by Alexander Hatrick, who started the first regular steam-boat service in 1892.

5000|$|The scholastics of {{the high}} medieval period, such as Ockham and John Duns Scotus, {{considered}} logic to be a scientia sermocinalis (science of language). The result of their studies was the elaboration of linguistic-philosophical notions whose complexity and subtlety has only recently come to be appreciated. Many {{of the most interesting}} problems of modern philosophy of language were anticipated by medieval thinkers. The phenomena of vagueness and ambiguity were analyzed intensely, and this led to an increasing interest in problems related to the use of syncategorematic words such as and, or, not, if, and every. The study of categorematic words (or terms) and their properties was also developed greatly. One of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the scholastics in this area was the doctrine of the suppositio. The suppositio of a term is the interpretation that is given of it in a specific context. It can be proper or improper (as when it is used in metaphor, metonyms and other figures of speech). A proper suppositio, in turn, can be either formal or material accordingly when it refers to its usual non-linguistic referent (as in [...] "Charles is a man"), or to itself as a linguistic entity (as in [...] "Charles has seven letters"). Such a classification scheme is the precursor of modern distinctions between use and mention, and between language and metalanguage.|$|E
5000|$|Current {{evidence}} does suggest possible evolutionary lineages for {{the origins of}} the anatomical features of the eye. One likely chain of development is that the eyes originated as simple patches of photoreceptor cells that could detect {{the presence or absence of}} light, but not its direction. When, via random mutation across the population, the photosensitive cells happened to have developed on a small depression, it endowed the organism with a better sense of the light's source. This small change gave the organism an advantage over those without the mutation. This genetic trait would then be [...] "selected for" [...] as those with the trait would have an increased chance of survival, and therefore progeny, over those without the trait. Individuals with deeper depressions would be able to discern changes in light over a wider field than those individuals with shallower depressions. As ever deeper depressions were advantageous to the organism, gradually, this depression would become a pit into which light would strike certain cells depending on its angle. The organism slowly gained increasingly precise visual information. And again, this gradual process continued as individuals having a slightly shrunken aperture of the eye had an advantage over those without the mutation as an aperture increases how collimated the light is at any one specific group of photoreceptors. As this trait developed, the eye became effectively a pinhole camera which allowed the organism to dimly make out shapes—the nautilus is a modern example of an animal with such an eye. Finally, via this same selection process, a protective layer of transparent cells over the aperture was differentiated into a crude lens, and the interior of the eye was filled with humours to assist in focusing images. In this way, eyes are recognized by modern biologists as actually a relatively unambiguous and simple structure to evolve, and many of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the eye's evolution are believed to have taken place over only a few million years, during the Cambrian explosion. Behe asserts that this is only an explanation of the gross anatomical steps, however, and not an explanation of the changes in discrete biochemical systems that would have needed to take place.|$|E
