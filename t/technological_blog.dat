40|$|The {{quest for}} {{identifying}} ‘significant properties’ {{is a common}} challenge for the digital preservation community. While the methodological frameworks for selecting these properties provide a good foundation, a continued discussion is necessary for further clarifying and improving the available methods. This paper advances earlier work by building on the existing InSPECT framework and improving its capabilities of working with complex/compound objects like blogs. The modifications enable a more thorough analysis of object structures, accentuate the differences and similarities between the framework’s two streams of analysis (i. e. Object and Stakeholder analysis) and, subsequently, improve the final reformulation of the properties. To demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} modified framework, the paper presents a use case of a blog preservation initiative that is informed by stakeholder interviews and evaluation of structural and <b>technological</b> foundations of <b>blogs.</b> It concludes by discussing the limitations of the approach and suggesting directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|This article {{documents}} {{the emergence of}} social media, and specifically social network sites (SNS) {{and their impact on}} health information–seeking and health-related behaviors. We review surveys of user behavior on SNS to document how health information is being transformed into a social health experience rather than an individual or clinical endeavor. We then turn to the research evidence for how SNS may influence health behaviors. Although there is a substantial literature that provides support for the role of social variables in the genesis and management of health and disease, there is little scientific grounding for how to leverage these variables to improve health in either online or offline milieus. We conclude with recommendations for prac-tice to optimize the use of social media and its contribution to improved health outcomes, and pose a series of questions that may guide the development of a research agenda in this area. The <b>technological</b> innovations of <b>blogs,</b> podcasts, interac...|$|R
40|$|Decision-making is {{no longer}} based on human {{preferences}} and expertise alone. The era of big data brings up new challenges with business analytics for organizations that want a competitive advantage. Previous research shows {{that a lot of}} studies have been made on why this era is now crucial to organizations but not how they can adapt it. In this case study there is a glimpse of how a traditional organization with an old mindset can catch up on the new technological advantages. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand how a traditional company in Sweden is affected by analytics and if it is valuable to them. For us to be able to create our theoretical framework, we based our on peer-reviewed material but also <b>technological</b> and science <b>blogs</b> from key experts in the field. The material examines the most essential and crucial elements within the area of business analytics and data management. The theoretical framework has guided our work when formulating and refining the research question and the interview questions. The results of the study clearly show that our case is on the right track with new development and projects, but there are still a lot of milestones to achieve before these are fulfilled. Issues within the company have to be solved and there is a need to modify and change the culture in the organization to a more data-driven decisive culture. The study gives a clear insight into the challenges that organizations have to face and overcome before making radical changes...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} {{undertaken}} {{on the premise}} that the <b>technological</b> advancement of <b>blogs</b> has not only accorded a novel platform for communication, but has also democratised the right to exercise political expression in Malaysia. Blogs have on numerous occasions outpaced restrictive laws that were enacted to curtail the exercise of this fundamental right and have caused great challenges in applying the existing specific media laws to online content in the blogosphere. The main purpose of the study is to resolve the legal uncertainties faced by bloggers in disseminating political speech under the existing laws of the country and to analyse the legal position in the United Kingdom as a comparative model or reference to the issue. In so doing, the study examines the general principles and restrictive laws to freedom of expression and the application of these rules to political blogs, scrutinises the statutory rules and regulations that are currently being employed to govern the traditional media and the Internet as well as other relevant general legislation, in particular the law of defamation, that has been commonly employed to regulate blog entries and comments by readers in both countries. The study concludes that although offline and online content should not be treated differently and certain regulatory controls are undoubtedly necessary to prevent misuse of political blogs by unscrupulous persons, any legal measures to be adopted by the Malaysian government to govern political blogs should take into account the rapid development of various forms of Internet based communications and be proportionate in light of current needs and the local circumstances of the society...|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{the factor}} of peer review context, {{there are several}} {{interesting}} findings generated from our comparison of the contexts of peer review in the 37 studies. First, {{most of the studies}} reviewed in this paper (N[*]=[*] 26) have been conducted among ESL learners (Stanley, 1992; Beason, 1993; Mendonca & Johnson, 1994; Lockhart & Ng, 1995; Zhu, 1995; Mendonca & Johnson, 1994; Sullivan & Pratt, 1996; Villamil & De Guerrero, 1996; McGroarty & Zhu, 1997; De Guerrero & Villamil, 2000; Di Giovanni & Nagaswami, 2001; Zhu, 2001; Liu & Sadler, 2003; Tuzi, 2004; Hewett, 2006; Jones et al., 2006; Guardado & Shi, 2007; Ho & Usaha, 2009; Anderson et al., 2010; Ho, 2010; Cho & Cho, 2011; Ho & Usaha, 2013; Lina & Samuel, 2013; Vorobel & Kim, 2014; Bradley, 2014; Pham & Usaha, 2015). On the other hand, the remaining number of reviewed studies (N[*]=[*] 11) focused on EFL learners (Min, 2005; Liang, 2008, 2010; Liou & Peng, 2009; Song & Usaha, 2009; Cha & Park, 2010; Chang, 2012; Hanjani & Li, 2014; Razak & Saeed, 2014; Ho, 2015; Saeed & Ghazali, 2016). From this finding, it seems that whereas studies on peer review in the ESL context are dated back to the early decade, studies on peer review in the EFL context are dated to the last few years. This indicates that recently, EFL instructors and researchers have started giving attention to peer review in writing. Such studies in the EFL context have even extended peer review research in the ESL context and contributed to previous knowledge by adding further insights into the role of technological tools in facilitating learners’ peer review since all of them integrated <b>technological</b> tools, including <b>blogs,</b> designed systems and social networks, such as Facebook into peer review.|$|R
40|$|Web 2. 0 was {{a phrase}} coined in 2004 to {{describe}} the characteristics of web sites which survived the original Dot-com crash. Despite the discussion of this phenomenon {{in a wide variety}} of both academic and mass media sources, itʼs exact definition remains unclear. The relative contributions of technology and social participation to this phenomenon are particularly confused. The primary aim of this research report is to provide a clear and comprehensive definition of Web 2. 0. This definition is determined through a combined social and <b>technological</b> analysis of <b>blogs,</b> wikis and social network sites, through their particular manifestations in Boing Boing, Wikipedia and Facebook respectively. It is the finding of this research that Web 2. 0 is primarily the result of a natural evolution from Web 1. 0 technologies and attitudes, and that Web 2. 0 is essentially a social phenomenon. This research provides separate definitions for Web 2. 0 technologies and Web 2. 0 platforms. A Web 2. 0 technology is any technology that aids and encourages simple intuitive user interaction through an architecture of participation. These technologies enable user feedback, and are thus constantly improved and exist within the ethos of a perpetual beta. Web 2. 0 technologies embrace re-mix and mash-up philosophies. A Web 2. 0 platform is a read-write Web platform designed to enable and encourage User Generated Content and interaction. These platforms can be built with any set of technologies, and their primary characteristics are social in nature, but the platforms must allow users to interact with the technology at either an open-source, network or appropriation level. These platforms become more powerful and richer the greater the number of people using the platform, and ultimately result in the formation of Web 2. 0 communities...|$|R
40|$|Although tourism {{researchers}} view travel blogs as a rich resource {{on consumer}} beha­ viour and discuss their potential as marketing tools, such studies generally examine blogs hosted on travel­specific advertising­sponsored {{websites such as}} TravelPod and TravelBlog {{and focus on the}} content in entries alone. However, it is increasingly recognized that blogs have BEYOND THE BLOG: THE NETWORKED SELF OF TRAVEL BLOGGERS ON TWITTER a “distributed nature”, often linking to content created by their au­ thors on other social media platforms. Also, the self­presentation that takes place in blogs is dispersed across various social media. This phe­ nomenon is often seen in travel blogs hosted on independent websites that link to social networking sites, bookmarking tools, and microblogging services. Any analysis of how these authors present themselves as travel bloggers and describe their narratives as travel blogs must, therefore, move beyond the borders of the blog and take into account content created using other social media. This paper discusses how this takes place on Twitter, a microblogging service used by many independent travel bloggers. The presentation of a networked self is a concept useful for interpreting how authors extend the positions and themes expressed in their blog to platforms such as Twitter. An individual mainly articulates the networked self by connecting to other people online. Describing self­ presentation on social networking sites as implicit rather than explicit, Zizi Papacharissi has observed that “individuals use the tools at hand to present themselves in ‘show not tell’ mode by pointing and connecting to individuals, groups, or points of reference”. This implies that there are two dimensions to the networked self. Not only is it situ­ ated in a network of social media surrounding the <b>blog</b> (<b>technological),</b> but also displayed via networking between individuals (social) ...|$|R
