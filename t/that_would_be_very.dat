25|$|The {{stump-jump plough}} was an Australian {{invention}} of the 1870s, designed {{to cope with the}} breaking up of new farming land, that contains many tree stumps and rocks <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> expensive to remove. The plough uses a moveable weight to hold the ploughshare in position. When a tree stump or other obstruction such as a rock is encountered, the ploughshare is thrown upwards, clear of the obstacle, to avoid breaking the plough's harness or linkage; ploughing can be continued when the weight is returned to the earth after the obstacle is passed.|$|E
25|$|In Mafra, on {{the morning}} of 5 October, the king was {{looking for a way to}} reach Porto, an action <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> {{difficult}} to carry out due to the almost non-existence of an escort and the innumerable revolutionary hubs spread throughout the country. At around midday the President of the Municipal Chamber of Mafra received a message from the new civil governor ordering the switching to a republican flag. Soon afterwards the commander of the Practical School of Infantry also received a telegram from his new commander informing him of the current political situation. The position of the royal family was becoming unsustainable.|$|E
500|$|While commenting {{in regards}} to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, Rove, Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her [...] "disco stick" [...] metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics {{constituted}} off. [...] "If anything, I happen to think people are frivolously hard on me", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate [...] "lot of youth-oriented pop music" [...] as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. [...] "It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way I move and the way I articulate the lyrics. But if I wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> boring," [...] she concluded.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{creators of}} Angel Beats!, Jun Maeda and Na-Ga of Key, were interviewed in the July 2009 issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine. Around the time Key completed the first release of their sixth visual novel Little Busters!, Hironori Toba of Aniplex (himself {{a fan of}} Key's works) approached Maeda around October 2007 about collaborating to produce an original anime series. Maeda began meeting with Toba and Aniplex {{on a monthly basis}} and the story started to gradually progress. Aniplex wanted Maeda to write a screenplay <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> [...] "Key-like, with touching moments of laughter and tears," [...] but initially Maeda found himself at a loss to write a story more amusing than Little Busters!, because he thought that he had reached a limit with Little Busters! in regards to a [...] "Key-like story". However, one day Maeda was struck by inspiration, where he thought up the initial idea of a story set in the afterlife. Furthermore, with everyone already dead, Maeda conceived of flashy battles where the combatants go all out without fear of death. According to Maeda, the theme of the series is [...] "life", which in Angel Beats! is depicted as a precious and wonderful thing, despite the characters in Angel Beats! who fight against their fate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for Tron occurred in 1976 when Steven Lisberger, then an animator of drawings {{with his own}} studio, looked at a sample reel from a computer firm called MAGI and saw Pong for the first time.

According to Lisberger, [...] "I realized that there were these techniques <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> suitable for bringing video games and computer visuals to the screen.

2500|$|The {{inclusion}} of {{place of origin}} on manufactured goods has an ancient history. In antiquity, informal branding which included details such as the name of manufacturer and place of origin were used by consumers as important clues as to product quality. David Wengrow has found archaeological evidence of brands, which often included origin of manufacture, dating to around 4,000 years ago. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus providing information about the product and its quality. For instance, an object found in a royal burial tomb in Abydos (southern Egypt) and dating to around 3,000 B.C.E., carries brand elements <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> familiar to modern consumers. Inscriptions on the [...] surface denote a specific place of manufacture, [...] "finest oil of Tjehenu," [...] a region in modern-day Libya.|$|E
2500|$|As the EU's fifth largest economy, Spain {{remains a}} large concern. In 2011 Mariano Rajoy {{took over the}} {{government}} with his conservative views, pushing out José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and his left-wing views. [...] Trying to get Spain out of the highest unemployment rate in the European Union was proven to be harder than expected. The bailout for Spain has been estimated to {{not be enough to}} restore the economy. [...] There is a serious debt in the country, and substantial cuts would have to be put in place to restore the economy at this point. The recession has been a concern for a while and shows no sign of lifting any time soon as Spain has yet to meet budget cuts and shows no sign of changing. [...] Many youths are trying to find jobs abroad, creating a problem for the future domestic economy and job market. [...] Rajoy recently proposed a new budget for 2013 <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different and would cut government spending by 8.9%. By April 2013, unemployment had risen to 27%.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Hitchens {{considered}} Shahak a [...] "dear {{friend and}} comrade... a brilliant and devoted {{student of the}} archaeology of Jerusalem and Palestine", who, [...] "during his chairmanship of the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights, set a personal example <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult to emulate." [...] Alexander Cockburn described Shahak the intellectual, the [...] "tireless translator and erudite foot-noter... a singular man, an original." [...] Allan C. Brownfeld, of the American Council for Judaism, recalled a humanist who actively opposed [...] "racism and oppression in any form and in any country"; that Shahak possessed a [...] "genuinely prophetic Jewish voice, one which ardently advocated democracy and human rights." [...] In an obituary, the journalist Elfi Pallis called Shahak essentially [...] "an old-fashioned liberal" [...] in principle, thought, and action. Moreover, Michel Warschawski said that Israel Shahak was [...] "the last Israeli liberal", who was [...] "above all, {{one of the last}} philosophers of the eighteenth-century school of enlightenment, rationalism, and liberalism, in the American meaning of the concept." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2011, the {{president}} and CEO of Diamond Aircraft Canada, Peter Maurer, indicated that his company's future was in doubt and relied on getting the D-Jet to market, as piston sales remained slow {{since the start of}} the Great Recession in 2007. To get the D-Jet into production the company found $20M in private investment, plus the commitment of an additional $35M from the Government of Ontario. The Ontario government investment was contingent on Diamond also securing an additional $35M from the Government of Canada. If both federal and provincial loans were provided then, combined with funds already provided, the total provincial and federal government investment would have been $100M. Maurer indicated [...] "If we don’t get the funding from the federal government, it puts us in a difficult situation. If the D-JET, for example, in a worse case scenario, were not to continue it would have a negative impact on the rest of the company’s operations. [...] at a level <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult to satisfy out of piston sales,” he said. “I’ll let you do the extrapolation." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of {{pancreatic}} cancer, involving both the endocrine and exocrine tissue. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which affects the exocrine part of the pancreas, {{is by far the}} most common form. [...] The many types of pancreatic endocrine tumors are all uncommon or rare, and have varied outlooks. [...] However the incidence of these cancers has been rising sharply; it is not clear to what extent this reflects increased detection, especially through medical imaging, of tumors <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> slow to develop. Insulinomas (largely benign) and gastrinomas are the most common types. In the United States pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of deaths due to cancer. The disease occurs more often in the developed world, which had 68% of new cases in 2012. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has poor outcomes with the average percentage alive for at least one and five years after diagnosis being 25% and 5% respectively. In localized disease where the cancer is small (< 2nbsp&cm) the number alive at five years is approximately 20%. For those with neuroendocrine cancers the number alive after five years is much better at 65%, varying considerably with type.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{considerable}} negative {{reaction to the}} characters Mudflap and Skids, who some perceived as embodying racist stereotypes. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that [...] "the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas". Critic Scott Mendelson said [...] "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement." [...] Harry Knowles, founder of Ain't It Cool News, went further, asking his readers [...] "not to support this film" [...] because [...] "you'll be taking [...] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around." [...] Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as [...] "good clean fun" [...] and insisted that [...] "We're just putting more personality in." [...] Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with [...] "It's really {{hard for us to}} sit here and try to justify it. I think <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> foolish, and if someone wants to be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised when we saw it, too, and it's a choice that was made. If anything, it just shows you that we don't control every aspect of the movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Strobe units {{can often}} be {{calibrated}} for many tunings and preset temperaments and allow for custom temperament programming, stretched tuning, [...] "sweetened" [...] temperament tunings and Buzz Feiten tuning modifications. [...] Due to their accuracy and ability to display partials even on instruments with a very short [...] "voice" [...] (e.g., notes of short duration), strobe tuners can perform tuning tasks <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult, if not impossible, for needle-type tuners. For instance, needle/LED display type tuners cannot track the signal to identify a tone of the Caribbean steelpan (often nicknamed the [...] "steeldrum") due to its very short [...] "voice". A tuner {{needs to be able}} to detect the first few partials for tuning such an instrument, which means that only a strobe tuner can be used for steelpan tuning. This is also true of the comb teeth used in mechanical musical instruments like Music Boxes and the like. In such cases a technician has to physically remove metal from the [...] tooth to reach the desired note. The metal teeth only resonates briefly when plucked. Great accuracy is required as once the metal is cut or filed away, the lost material cannot be replaced. As such, the strobe-type tuners are the unit of choice for such tasks. Tuners with an accuracy of better than 0.2 cent are required for guitar intonation tuning.|$|E
