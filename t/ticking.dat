5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the <b>ticking</b> gene. A number of breeds show <b>ticking,</b> which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the <b>ticking.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{opened the}} regular season with a win at home against the Los Angeles Dons. The Dons had beaten the Chicago Rockets in their season opener the week before, but they {{struggled}} against the Browns. Cleveland built a 19–0 lead after {{the first three quarters}} on touchdowns by Ara Parseghian and Bill Boedeker, a Lou Groza field goal and a safety. The Dons, however, almost pulled off a comeback with just 30 seconds remaining in the game. Los Angeles fullback John Kimbrough scored a touchdown on a short run with time <b>ticking</b> down, and the Dons recovered an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff. Dons quarterback Glenn Dobbs then threw a long pass to end Joe Aguirre. It fell incomplete, but Cleveland was called for pass interference, and the ball was placed on the Browns' nine-yard line. Dobbs then threw a completion to Aguirre for a second touchdown with five seconds left to play. Time expired on the ensuing kickoff, however, and Cleveland won 19–14. Groza's 51-yard field goal matched a professional football record he set two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{climax of}} most Bond films {{is the final}} {{confrontation}} with the villain and his henchmen, sometimes an entire army of cohorts, often in his hard-to-reach lair. The villain's retreat can be a private island (Dr. No, The Man with the Golden Gun), underwater (The Spy Who Loved Me), mountaintop retreat (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, For Your Eyes Only) volcano (You Only Live Twice), or underground base (Live and Let Die), a ship (Thunderball, Tomorrow Never Dies), an oil rig (Diamonds Are Forever) or even a space station (Moonraker)—among other variations. Bond usually sabotages the lair and, with time <b>ticking</b> down, dispatches the supervillain, rescues the principal Bond girl and they escape as the place blows up. In some cases, the villain or his primary henchman escapes to launch a final attack on Bond and his lover in the final scene.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 24s run, the series {{attracted}} significant criticism for its depictions of torture, {{as well as its}} negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of <b>ticking</b> time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation, with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly {{as a result of these}} discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to tone down the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting to overwhelm the storytelling.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{recovered}} {{in the end}} zone for a touchback, and the Volunteers started at their 20-yard line.

After not gaining a first down, Tennessee punted to the Hokies with less than two minutes remaining in the game. Tech wide receiver Antonio Freeman returned the kick to the Tech 42-yard line, and on the first play of the Hokie drive, Druckenmiller completed a 17-yard pass to the Tennessee 41-yard line. That completion was followed by a nine-yard pass to Jermaine Holmes. After an incomplete pass that almost was intercepted, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass before Oxendine failed to gain enough yards for a first down and Tech turned the ball over on downs. With less than a minute remaining, Tennessee's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and secured a 4523 victory.|$|E

40|$|The southeastern {{lone star}} <b>tick,</b> Amblyomma americanum, has {{recently}} appeared in our field sweeps. This new <b>tick</b> {{in our area}} brings the potential for diseases, such as ehrlichiosis, tularemia, and Southern rash illness borreliosis. Favorable habitats are indicated by excreta of <b>ticks</b> that are already established, with the excreta acting as an assembly pheromone that retains <b>ticks</b> in areas with proper temperature, moisture, and suitable hosts. Our hypothesis is that excreta from different <b>tick</b> species may function as an assembly pheromone for lone star <b>ticks,</b> which may have contributed toward lone star <b>ticks</b> establishing here. Clustering responses by lone star <b>ticks</b> on excreta of <b>ticks</b> from different <b>tick</b> species was tested using six-sector Petri dish attraction bioassays with an added relative humidity component. Dry 33 % RH conditions elicited greater clustering (higher speed, more <b>ticks</b> involved) than under humid 93 % RH, mostly by female adults and nymphs {{and only a few}} larvae.

5|$|Late in the fourth, Mark Ingram lost {{a fumble}} {{for the first}} time in his collegiate career, giving Tennessee {{possession}} at the Alabama 43 with 3:29 remaining in the game. The Vols drove the ball 43 yards in 2:10, culminating with an 11-yard Crompton touchdown pass to Gerald Jones to cut the gap to 12–10. The Vols followed with a successful onside kick attempt and regained possession of the ball at their own 41-yard line. After Tennessee was penalized five yards for a false start, Crompton completed a pass to Luke Stocker for 23 yards, to the Bama 27-yard line. With the clock <b>ticking</b> off the final seconds and Tennessee out of time outs, Crompton spiked the ball to stop the clock with four seconds left. This set up Lincoln for a 45-yard field goal attempt to win the game. However, Terrence Cody knocked his blocker over and broke through the line.

5|$|Tech's offense {{took the}} field at their 20-yard line with 1:53 {{remaining}} in the game, two timeouts left (used to stop the clock as necessary), and needing at least a field goal to win the game. Tech picked up one first down via a pass, then another as the Hokies drove to their 44-yard line. Stopped short of midfield {{with less than a}} minute to play, Tech called its second timeout in order to stop the game clock from <b>ticking</b> down. In college football, the clock stops after a team earns a first down, and because Virginia Tech had not earned a first down on the short run, Tech was forced to call the timeout. Following the timeout, the Hokies ran for a first down, penetrating to the NC State 44-yard line. With 53seconds remaining, Chapman scrambled out of bounds on a short run. Another short run brought the Hokies to the State 36-yard line, and the Hokies called their final timeout to stop the clock. A few plays later, Tech ran a short running play that kept the clock running down. With just 33seconds remaining and no other way to stop the clock, Tech's Maurice Williams questionably stayed down with a leg cramp and the referees stopped the clock to allow the injured player to receive assistance from athletic trainers before the next play. Facing fourth down and needing three yards for drive-continuing first down, Chapman passed for a first down at the State 29-yard line with 15seconds remaining in the game. On the game's next play, Tech committed a holding penalty, which pushed the Hokies 10yards further away from the end zone, out of field goal range, with 11seconds remaining.|$|E

5|$|With {{less than}} half a quarter {{remaining}} and down by three scores, Virginia Tech had a nearly insurmountable deficit to overcome. The Hokies fielded the kickoff for a touchback, and the Tech offense began at its 20-yard line. On the Hokies' first and second plays of the drive, Vick was sacked for losses. The third play was an incomplete pass, and the Hokies were forced to punt. After fielding the kick at their 38-yard line, Florida State began running out the clock by running the ball. After failing to gain a first down on two consecutive rushes and an incomplete pass, Florida State punted. The ball rolled into the end zone, and Tech's offense began again at its 20-yard line. Vick threw for short yardage, then Kendrick ran for a first down at the Tech 37-yard line. Vick completed a 23-yard first down pass to Emmet Johnson, and the Hokies entered Florida State territory with the clock <b>ticking</b> steadily down. On the first play in Seminoles' territory, Vick completed another 23-yard pass, this time to Davis, who picked up a first down at the Florida State 23-yard line. Thanks to a holding penalty against the Seminoles, Tech was granted a first down at the State eight-yard line. Vick threw an incomplete pass, ran for three yards, and then threw another pass to a player who was stopped short of the goal line. Facing fourth down and needing just two yards for a touchdown, Tech attempted to pass for the touchdown, but Vick was sacked and turned the ball over on downs with 1:12 remaining.
