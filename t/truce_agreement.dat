In early November, most were released in exchange for 25 militants held by the Pakistan Army.|$|R
25|$|India sought {{resolution}} of the issue at the UN Security Council, despite Sheikh Abdullah's opposition to it. Following the set-up of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), the UN Security Council passed Resolution 47 on 21 April 1948. The measure called for an immediate cease-fire and called on the Government of Pakistan 'to secure the withdrawal {{from the state of}} Jammu and Kashmir of tribesmen and Pakistani nationals not normally resident therein who have entered the state for the purpose of fighting.' It also asked Government of India to reduce its forces to minimum strength, after which the circumstances for holding a plebiscite should be put into effect 'on the question of Accession of the state to India or Pakistan.' However, it was not until 1 January 1949 that the ceasefire could be put into effect, signed by General Douglas Gracey on behalf of Pakistan and General Roy Bucher on behalf of India. However, both India and Pakistan failed to arrive at a <b>truce</b> <b>agreement</b> due to differences over interpretation of the procedure for and the extent of demilitarisation. One sticking point was whether the Azad Kashmiri army was to be disbanded during the truce stage or at the plebiscite stage.|$|E
500|$|Al-Birwa was {{mentioned}} in 1047 CE, during Fatimid rule, {{when it was}} visited by the Persian geographer, Nasir Khusraw. He describes it as lying [...] "between Acre and Damun", and reports having visited {{what he described as}} the tombs of Simeon and Esau there. The Crusaders wrested control of Palestine from the Fatimids in 1099. They referred to al-Birwa as [...] "Broet". In 1253, John Aleman, the Crusader lord of Caesarea, sold al-Birwa, along with several other villages, to the Knights Hospitaller. Al-Birwa {{was mentioned}} as part of the Acre-based Crusaders' domain in the 1283 hudna (<b>truce</b> <b>agreement)</b> with the Mamluks under Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun. In the late 13th century, the Mamluks defeated and conquered the last Crusader outposts along Palestine's northern coastline.|$|E
500|$|Under Frederick II, a Sixth Crusade was launched, {{capitalizing on}} the ongoing {{internal}} strife between al-Kamil of Egypt and al-Mu'azzam of Syria. Subsequently, al-Kamil offered Jerusalem to Frederick to avoid a Syrian invasion of Egypt, but the latter refused. Al-Kamil's position was strengthened when al-Mu'azzam died in 1227 and was succeeded by his son an-Nasir Dawud. Al-Kamil continued negotiations with Frederick II in Acre in 1228, leading to a <b>truce</b> <b>agreement</b> signed in February 1229. The agreement gave the Crusaders control over an unfortified Jerusalem for over ten years, but also guaranteed Muslims control over Islamic holy places in the city. Although the treaty was virtually meaningless in military terms, an-Nasir Dawud used it to provoke the sentiments of Syria's inhabitants and a Friday sermon by a popular preacher at the Umayyad Mosque [...] "reduced the crowd to violent sobbing and tears".|$|E

It was composed of United Nations Military Observers and {{was part of the}} United Nations Truce Supervision Organization peacekeeping force in the Middle East. The MAC comprised on four sections to monitor each of the four <b>truce</b> <b>agreements,</b> the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel MAC, the Israel/Syrian MAC, the Israel/Lebanon MAC and the Egypt/Israel MAC. The various MACs were located on the cease fire lines and, through close liaison with headquarters in Jerusalem, were charged with supervising the truce, investigating border incidents, and taking remedial action to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.|$|R
5000|$|Receiving Shikano {{castle in}} Inaba {{province}} {{as a reward}} for his notable service in 1578, Korenori ascended to higher rank as he assisted in Hideyoshi's 1587 invasion of Kyūshū. Interested in earning further fortunes in foreign trade, he requested to obtain lands in the coastal domains of Izumo province, which possessed high quality harbors, in recognition of his past service against the Mōri and other clans of Kyūshū. However, his request was denied, as Izumo had already been given to the Mōri {{as a part of the}} <b>truce</b> <b>agreements</b> between the Mōri and Hideyoshi. Korenori then asked for the Ryukyu Islands instead; a paper fan inscribed with the date, Hideyoshi's signature, and the title [...] "Kamei, Lord of Ryukyu" [...] (亀井琉球の守, Kamei Ryūkyū no kami), found by Korean forces on a ship captured during Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea serves as evidence that Hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post to Korenori. However, Hideyoshi had no rightful claim to the islands, which were at the time the independent Ryūkyū Kingdom. Korenori sent a small force to take control of the islands, but was blocked by the Shimazu clan of Satsuma province, who jealously guarded a special relationship, including exclusive trading rights, with the kingdom.|$|R

2500|$|As {{part of the}} <b>truce</b> <b>agreement,</b> Mavia {{sent her}} forces to Thrace to help the Romans fight the Goths. Her forces proved less {{effective}} outside of their native territory and the Goths pushed the Romans back to Constantinople, even killing Valens, the emperor, in the process. Mavia's forces returned home, badly bruised and depleted in number. The new emperor, Theodosius I, favored the Goths, giving them many positions within the Roman establishment, {{at the expense of}} the Arabs. After having demonstrated their loyalty to Rome, the Arabs felt increasingly betrayed and mounted another revolt in 383 CE. This revolt was quickly put down and the Tanukh-Roman alliance ended for good, as Rome courted another Arab tribe, the Salih.|$|E
2500|$|Lugard never {{returned}} to Nyasaland but his activities {{put pressure on the}} British government to intervene and, in November 1888, it appointed Harry Johnston as Consul in Mozambique, with an area of consular authority covering Central Africa as well as the Portuguese controlled coast. Johnston arrived in Blantyre in March 1889: at that time he had no significant military forces, and agreed a truce with Mlozi in October 1889 to avoid confrontation with him and other slave traders in the north. However, despite the provisions in the <b>truce</b> <b>agreement</b> to allow the Ngonde to return to their villages unmolested and {{to reduce the number of}} Swahili stockades, Buchanan, who visited Karonga in March 1891 and met Mlozi, reported to Johnston that, rather than Ngonde being allowed to return, more were being driven out and the Swahili traders were building more fortified villages and restricting the African Lakes Company’s trading activities.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 July 1993 Israel {{launched}} Operation Accountability, {{known in}} Lebanon as the Seven-Day War. The given reason was to retaliate {{for the death}} of IDF soldiers in the [...] "security zone" [...] which Israel had created in 1982 in southern Lebanon to protect its northern borders from both Hezbollah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command. On 10 July Hezbollah undertook an operation in which 5 Israeli soldiers were killed; a further attack on 19 July caused several further casualties to the IDF, and on the 23rd. another Israeli soldier was killed. Cross-border raids were frequent from both sides, and Operation Accountability arose from the escalation in hostilities. Thousands of buildings were bombed, resulting in 120 dead and 500,000 displaced civilians. Israeli forces also destroyed infrastructure such as power stations and bridges. According to Michael Brecher, the aim of Operation Accountability was to precipitate a large flight of Lebanese refugees from the south towards Beirut and thereby put the Lebanese government under pressure to rein in Hezbollah. Hezbollah retaliated with rocket attacks on Israeli villages, though inflicting significantly fewer casualties. After Lebanon complained to the UN, the Security Council called on Israel to withdraw its occupying forces from Lebanese territory. A <b>truce</b> <b>agreement</b> brokered by the US secured an Israeli undertaking to stop attacks north of its security zone in Lebanon, and a Hezbollah agreement to desist from firing rockets into Israel.|$|E

Darkseid demanded only one spoil of war: Raker Qarrigat. The Guardians agree and abandon Raker on Apokolips. Before the Green Lanterns leave, the Green Lantern Ash-Pak-Glif secretly passes a Power Ring and Power Battery to Qarrigat. Raker Qarrigat and the attack on Apokolips are expunged from the records on Oa.|$|R
2500|$|Five days later, on July 29, 1946, {{a routine}} motor patrol (made up from B Battery, 11th Marines and a mortar squad from the 5th Marine regiment)– {{consisting}} of one lieutenant and forty enlisted men - was escorting six supply trucks from Tientsin to Peking {{when it was}} ambushed {{near the village of}} Anping by a strong force of uniformed Communists, who were armed with automatic weapons, rifles, and hand grenades. The ensuing battle lasted four hours. A relief column with air support from Tientsin attempted to trap and destroy the Communists, but it failed to arrive in time. Three Marines, Lt. Douglas Cowin, Cpl Gilbert Tate, and PFC Larry Punch were killed and twelve others were wounded during what was, up to that point, the most serious clash between American and Chinese forces. One other Marine, PFC John Lopez, later died of wounds received in the battle, and two more were injured when they crashed their Jeep while returning to Tientsin for aid. According to Shaw, [...] "the deliberate Communist ambush was additional proof that the chances for peace in China were nonexistent. Without regard to their <b>truce</b> <b>agreements,</b> both sides initiated hostilities wherever the military situation seemed to favor them, and 'each side took the stand with General Marshall that the other was provoking the fighting and could not be trusted to go through with an agreement.'" ...|$|R

50|$|The Dutch, {{initially}} {{backed by}} the British, tried to re-establish their rule, and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when {{in the face of}} international pressure, the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence.Dutch efforts to re-establish complete control met resistance. At the end of World War II, a power vacuum arose, and the nationalists often succeeded in seizing the arms of the demoralised Japanese. A period of unrest with city guerrilla warfare called the Bersiap period ensued. Groups of Indonesian nationalists armed with improvised weapons (like bamboo spears) and firearms attacked returning Allied troops. 3,500 Europeans were killed and 20,000 were missing, meaning there were more European deaths in Indonesia after the war than during the war. After returning to Java, Dutch forces quickly re-occupied the colonial capital of Batavia (now Jakarta), so the city of Yogyakarta in central Java became the capital of the nationalist forces. Negotiations with the nationalists led to two major <b>truce</b> <b>agreements,</b> but disputes about their implementation, and much mutual provocation, led each time to renewed conflict. Within four years the Dutch had recaptured almost the whole of Indonesia, but guerrilla resistance persisted, led on Java by commander Nasution. On 27 December 1949, after four years of sporadic warfare and fierce criticism of the Dutch by the UN, the Netherlands officially recognised Indonesian sovereignty under the federal structure of the United States of Indonesia (RUSI). On 17 August 1950, exactly five years after the proclamation of independence, the last of the federal states were dissolved and Sukarno proclaimed a single unitary Republic of Indonesia.|$|R

500|$|Although {{the popular}} {{tendency}} {{has been to}} see the December 1914 Christmas Truces as unique and therefore of romantic rather than political significance, they have also been interpreted {{as part of the}} widespread non-co-operation with the war spirit and conduct by serving soldiers. In his book on trench warfare, historian Tony Ashworth describes what he calls the 'live and let live system.' Complicated local <b>truces</b> and <b>agreements</b> not to fire at each other were developed by men along the front throughout the war. These often began with agreement not to attack each other at tea, meal or washing times, and in some places became so developed that whole sections of the front would see few casualties for extended periods of time. This system, Ashworth argues, 'gave soldiers some control over the conditions of their existence.'

The French king however preferred an Ottoman offensive against Naples in Italy, through the Albanian port of Valona, and wished to obtain financial help to the level of 2 millions ducats from the Ottomans. In May, Suleiman communicated that he would send an armada, which left Istanbul in April 1558. In June, the armada sacked Sorrento and took 3,000 captives, but otherwise did little, and was delayed from joining a French fleet in Corsica, possibly due to the failure of the commander Dragut to honour Suleiman's orders. Suleiman apologized in a letter to Henry {{at the end of the}} year 1558. As the Ottoman refused to lend the 2 million ducats to France, and Henry failed in the Battle of Saint-Quentin and Battle of Gravelines, the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis was finally signed.|$|R
