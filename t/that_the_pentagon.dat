This suspicion had already been a concern during the global protests against the war on Iraq. An audit found that Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) may have overcharged the U.S. government $61million, on contracts worth billions, for bringing oil products for the U.S. army into Iraq via a Kuwaiti subcontractor, Altanmia Commercial Marketing Co.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, General Schwartz said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> should abandon {{plans to}} outfit the F-35 {{with nuclear weapons}} {{in favor of the}} LRS-B.

The Congressional Budget Office determined that upgrading the F-35 for nuclear deployment would cost $350 million over the next decade. Schwartz said that without financial support from NATO, where some nuclear-capable F-35s would be deployed, those funds should be transferred to the LRS-B. At the same time, Congress cut funding for the B61 nuclear bomb, stripping $10 million from F-35 integration and $34.8 million for life extension; Schwartz stated that B61's life extension must proceed.|$|E

25|$|As USSTRATCOM neared its tenth anniversary, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld revived an {{idea that}} had been {{considered}} several times before, a merger of U.S. Space Command and USSTRATCOM. America's military had begun operating in space in the late 1950s, {{with many of the}} early systems developed to meet SAC's needs for surveillance, warning, meteorology, and communications. By September 1985, space activities had grown to the point <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> created a new unified command, USSPACECOM, to oversee them. Space systems gave the coalition in Operation Desert Storm a decisive edge, while later operations in the Balkans, Southwest Asia, Afghanistan and Iraq relied heavily on space-based command and control, communications, surveillance and intelligence, navigation, and weather systems. Secretary Rumsfeld's initiative to merge the two commands {{led to the creation of}} the current USSTRATCOM in 2002.|$|E
25|$|In October 1959, the East German {{government}} {{declared its}} intention to fly its new hammer-and-compass flag over the 78 elevated railway stations in the Western sector, since the railway was operated by the East German state railroad system. On November 2, {{as chairman of the}} three-power Allied Kommandatura for that month, Hamlett informed his Soviet counterpart that should the East Germans attempt to fly the flags in the Western sector, then West German police would remove them, and that should the police be prevented from removing the flags, then Allied troops would complete the job and hold the Russians responsible for any resulting disorder. The East Germans backed down on November 5. Five days later, the Army announced that Hamlett had been reassigned to Washington, D.C., stressing that the move was a long-scheduled rotation since the crisis had already extended his tour six months beyond the normal two years. His transfer was interpreted as an indication <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> believed the immediate danger to West Berlin had passed.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{learning}} of the hijacking {{and that there were}} Americans on board, members of the Reagan administration in Washington D.C. (in a time zone seven hours earlier than Egypt) moved to take decisive action. The Terrorist Incident Working Group (which included National Security Council staff member Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North) met in accord with predetermined counter-terrorist procedures. They recommended that a State Department Emergency Support Team be sent to Rome to assist the embassy there as the vessel was Italian. The Group also recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> dispatch a team of special operations forces to Europe in case the ship needed to be seized to rescue the hostages. These recommendations were approved by the Operational Sub-Group chaired by John Poindexter and orders were sent to the State and Defense Departments. U.S. Army Major General Carl Stiner put two platoons, drawn from the Navy's counter-terrorism unit, SEAL Team Six and Army commandos from Delta Force, en route to Europe to be operating with NATO ally permission from a British base at Akrotiri, Cyprus. The U.S. State Department asked countries along the Mediterranean to deny Achille Lauro access to their ports in order to keep it in International Waters. They also sought to keep the press away from the ship to prevent giving the terrorists a worldwide stage.|$|E

The United States had pressured Pakistan for a military operation in North Waziristan for years, and the US Congress linked military assistance to Pakistan for the next fiscal year with military operations in North Waziristan in June 2014. Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> was unaware of Pakistan's decision to launch a new offensive in North Waziristan: [...] "The Pakistan military and the government understand the threat, and they continue to go after that threat." [...] On 5 November 2014, Lt. Gen.

[...] "They are fractured. They are fractured like the Taliban is. That's based pretty much on the Pakistan's operations in North Waziristan this entire summer-fall," [...] he said, acknowledging the effectiveness of Pakistan's military offensive.

[...] "The math is compelling: if we do not make reductions approximating 25 percent of the military budget starting fairly soon, it will be impossible to continue to fund an adequate level of domestic activity...," [...] wrote Frank.

[...] "If," [...] he said, [...] "beginning one year from now, we were to cut military spending by 25 percent from its projected levels, we would still be immeasurably stronger than any combination of nations with whom we might be engaged."
