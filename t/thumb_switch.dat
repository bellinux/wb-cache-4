50|$|<b>Thumb</b> <b>switch</b> release {{aids are}} the most complicated, with the most moving parts of the three most common releases. They work on the {{depression}} of a <b>thumb</b> <b>switch</b> that is mounted to a T-handle's style of release. The attraction to these release aids are {{that they are a}} good midpoint between a caliper and back tension style of release aids, making the transition {{from one to the other}} a little smoother over a longer period of time.|$|E
50|$|In May 1933, the LNER had a {{miniature}} <b>thumb</b> <b>switch</b> controlled signalling frame {{installed at the}} bridge by Westinghouse, {{at the same time}} the line from Staddlethorpe to Goole had colour light signalling installed; both were early examples of either technology in use. At the same time, two signal boxes at either end of the bridge were closed.|$|E
50|$|The rider could pedal unaided by the motors, {{or could}} {{activate}} {{them with a}} <b>thumb</b> <b>switch</b> on the handle bar. That smoothly, quietly and quickly takes the bike to 20 mph if the rider pedals, or to 15 mph with no pedaling before it needed a charge. Among the special features were high-tech turn signals and brake lights on the two rear-view mirrors.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Gibson {{issued a}} Melody Maker with a single-cutaway body. It had one humbucking pickup, Grover tuners, a Tune-O-Matic bridge, and a stop tailpiece.Two humbucking pickup models with two <b>thumb</b> <b>switches</b> were also made but {{are hard to}} find.|$|R
40|$|An {{operator}} can {{rapidly and}} automatically produce coded electrical signals by manipulating mechanical <b>thumb</b> wheel <b>switches</b> {{so as to}} instruct a service center to connect any number of telephone lines to the console thus enabling the operator to listen and/or talk over several lines simultaneously. The system includes an on-site console having several mechanically operated <b>thumb</b> wheel <b>switches</b> to which the desired lines to be connected can be dialed in. Electrical coded signals are fed {{to a number of}} banks of line AND gates representing units, tens and hundreds, a group of channel gates, and a command gate. These signals are gated out in a controlled manner to an encoder which generates tones that are transmitted over a single line to a communication service center...|$|R
60|$|He leveled the {{revolver}} directly at Billy, whose <b>thumb</b> on the <b>switch</b> did not waver, {{and they could}} see the gleaming bullet-tips in the chambers of the cylinder.|$|R
50|$|T-handled {{releases}} are hand-held releases {{that rely}} {{on the strength of}} one's fingers. The release is held in the fist, with the mechanism usually poking out between index and middle finger. A handled release uses one of two different styles of a mechanism either by using a back tension or a <b>thumb</b> <b>switch.</b> These styles of releases are most popular with tournament archers and sometimes in tree stands.|$|E
50|$|For {{analogue}} video, {{resolution and}} refresh rate {{are the primary}} factors in determining the amount of bandwidth needed for the signal. The method of converting these factors into bandwidth requirements {{is a point of}} ambiguity, in part because it is dependent on the analogue nature and state of the hardware. The same piece of equipment may require more bandwidth as it ages due to increased degradation of the source signal. Most conversion formulas attempt to approximate the amount of bandwidth needed, including a margin of safety. As a rule of <b>thumb,</b> <b>switch</b> circuitry should provide up to three times the bandwidth required by the original signal specification, as this allows most instances of signal loss to be contained outside the range of the signal that is pertinent to picture quality.|$|E
5000|$|Deluxe Talkboy, {{released}} {{after the original}} consumer model Talkboy, the Deluxe Talkboy is nearly identical in appearance and function to the original model. The Deluxe Talkboy added a [...] "Slow Playback" [...] feature, which enabled users to manipulate the recording and playback speed, and in turn the pitch of the recorded sound, acting as a simple voice changer. This feature emulated Kevin McCallister's use of the Talkboy in the film, such as the scene where Kevin places reservations at the Plaza Hotel over the phone by using the Talkboy to modulate his voice to sound deeper and more convincing as an adult. The user could toggle between normal and slow playback speed using the red <b>thumb</b> <b>switch</b> which also operated the Power On/Off. The [...] "Slow" [...] feature used a slowed-down recording/playback speed of 76% and a sped-up speed of 130%. Deluxe Talkboy also added the word [...] "Deluxe" [...] above the [...] "Talkboy" [...] logotype to differentiate between models, and placement of the headphone jack was marginally relocated. The Deluxe Talkboy came packaged with a cassette tape, {{one side of the}} tape is initially blank for the user to record with, and the other side is write-protected and featured various lines and sound effects from Home Alone 2.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935 the {{decision}} was made to resignal the station and approaches, replacing the 1904 electro-pneutmatic power signalling system with an electrically operated system. [...] "Park Street" [...] and [...] "Paragon station" [...] signal boxes were to be replaced with a single box; the running lines out of the station, including those controlled by the West Parade signal box, were to be track circuited. The system was an early British example of electrical interlocking. 48 points were controlled, using <b>thumb</b> <b>switches</b> in the signal box. Power supply was from the Hull Corporation at 400V 50 Hz three phase, with a backup generator powered by a [...] Petter oil-engine. The main external system was electrified at 110V AC, with shunt signals at 100 or 55V AC; the point motors, previously electro-pneumatically operated were retained, with a [...] per hour [...] max. pressure compressor system, duplicated for redundancy. Signalling was electric lamp backlit. The Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd was the main supplier of the equipment. A new signal box was installed, a LNER type 13, resembling in architectural design the Southern Railway's Streamline Moderne signal boxes, but with square corners.|$|R
40|$|An {{inexpensive}} {{controlled drug}} infusion system based around 80 C 85 microprocessor with RAM, EPROM and peripheral interface devices is developed. In this system, the drop rate selection {{is done by}} BCD <b>thumb</b> wheel <b>switches</b> from 1 to 99 drops/min, LCD display is used for displaying the parameters settings, number of drops infused and various alarms messages for patient safety and unique drop sensing assembly is incorporated for accurate detection of falling drops in drip chamber. The prototype has been tested successfully on neonates...|$|R

40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted comparing three different input methods for interfacing to a large screen, multiwindow, whole flight deck display for management of transport aircraft systems. The thumball concept utilized a miniature trackball embedded in a conventional side arm controller. The multifunction control throttle and stick (MCTAS) concept employed a <b>thumb</b> <b>switch</b> located in the throttle handle. The touch screen concept provided data entry through a capacitive touch screen installed on the display surface. The objective and subjective results obtained indicate that, with present implementations, the thumball concept was the most appropriate for interfacing with aircraft systems/subsystems presented on a large screen display. Not unexpectedly, the completion time differences between the three concepts varied with the task being performed, although the thumball implementation consistently outperformed the other two concepts. However, pilot suggestions for improved implementations of the MCTAS and touch screen concepts could reduce some of these differences...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} how an approach or avoidance tendency to information influences {{the perception of}} related behaviours. The sexual attitudes of 104 male and female subjects were assessed prior to viewing either a birth control, conservative social values, or educational issues lecture. Subjects indicated the number of meaningful actions in the sequence by pressing a <b>thumb</b> <b>switch.</b> It was hypothesized that more units would be indicated when the topic {{was consistent with the}} subject's sexual attitudes, due to an attempt to gain more informational content. As expected, sexual attitudes interacted with lecture topic. Subjects with positive sexual attitudes (erotophiles) indicated more units in the birth control condition, whereas subjects with negative sexual attitudes (erotophobes) indicated more units in the social values condition. No differences were found in the educational issues (control) condition. These results suggest that there are chronic differences in the segmentation patterns of individuals, reflecting affective orientations towards social information...|$|E
40|$|The human opposable thumb {{enables the}} hand to perform {{dexterous}} manipulation of objects, which requires well-coordinated digit force vectors. This {{study investigated the}} directional coordination of force vectors generated by the {{thumb and index finger}} during precision pinch. Fourteen right-handed, healthy subjects were instructed to exert pinch force on an externally stabilized apparatus with the pulps of the thumb and index finger. Subjects applied forces to follow a force-ramp profile that linearly increased from 0 to 12 N and then decreased to 0 N, at a rate of ± 3 N/s. Directional relationships between the thumb and index finger force vectors were quantified using the coordination angle (CA) between the force vectors. Individual force vectors were further analyzed according to their projection angles (PAs) with respect to the pinch surface planes and the shear angles (SAs) within those planes. Results demonstrated that fingertip force directions were dependent on pinch force magnitude, especially at forces below 2 N. Hysteresis was observed in the force-CA relationship for increasing and decreasing forces and fitted with exponential models. The fitted asymptotic values were 156. 0 ± 6. 6 ° and 150. 8 ± 9. 3 ° for increasing and decreasing force ramps, respectively. The PA of the thumb force vector deviated further from the direction perpendicular to the pinching surface planes than that of the index finger. The SA showed that the index finger force vector deviated in the ulnar-proximal direction, whereas the <b>thumb</b> <b>switched</b> its force between the ulnar-proximal and radial-proximal directions. The findings shed light on the effects of anatomical composition, biomechanical function, and neuromuscular control in coordinating digit forces during precision pinch, and provided insight into the magnitude-dependent force directional control which potentially affects a range of dexterous manipulations...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{experts are}} {{concerned}} over the awkward {{position of the}} safety lever {{near the end of}} the rifle away from the shooter's hand. This position makes it difficult to quickly select [...] "fire" [...] when it is in [...] "safe" [...] mode. This is resolved on the [...] "G" [...] ("Gai", 改; literally: [...] "modified") variant (QBZ-95-1) where the fire selector switch is repositioned above the pistol grip, giving it a <b>thumb</b> fire selector <b>switch</b> for easy firing mode transition.|$|R
30|$|During {{the first}} day of the study (session 1) and on the last day of the study (session 2), {{participants}} wore a head-mounted Detection Response Task (DRT) device that consisted of an LED light mounted to a flexible arm that was connected to a headband, a micro-switch attached to the participant’s left or right <b>thumb</b> (the <b>switch</b> was attached to the hand opposite that of the vehicle’s steering wheel voice-activation button), and a dedicated microprocessor to handle all stimulus timing and response data. The light was positioned in the periphery of the participant’s left eye (approximately 15 ° to the left and 7.5 ° above the participant’s left eye) so that it could be seen while looking at the forward roadway but did not obstruct the view of the driving environment. The stimulus presentation configuration adhered to the International Standards Organization (ISO) standard 17488 with red LED stimuli configured to flash every 3 – 5  s. Data were collected using an Asus Transformer Book T 100 s with quad-core Intel® Atom™ processors running at 1.33  GHz.|$|R
2500|$|Although he {{was often}} dubbed a perfectionist, Wilson was an inexperienced musician, and his {{understanding}} of music theory was self-taught. The first instrument he learned to play was a toy accordion before quickly moving to piano and then bass guitar. From an early age, Brian demonstrated an extraordinary skill for learning music by ear on keyboard. By age 10, Brian could play [...] "great boogie-woogie piano", according to brother Carl Wilson. Carl taught Brian how to play bass guitar. Initially, he stroked the strings using only his <b>thumb,</b> but <b>switched</b> to using a pick about a year later. Brian's experiments with his Wollensak tape recorder provide early examples of his flair for exotica and unusual percussive patterns and arranging ideas that he would recycle in later prominent work. At some point in 1961 he wrote his first all-original melody, loosely based on a Dion and the Belmonts version of [...] "When You Wish Upon a Star". The song was eventually known as [...] "Surfer Girl". Though an early demo of the song was recorded in February 1962 at World Pacific Studios, it was not re-recorded and released until 1963, when it became a top-ten hit.|$|R
5000|$|QBZ-95 variant titled [...] "1" [...] fires {{the heavier}} 5.8×42mm DBP10 round, {{and has a}} heavier, longer barrel and a {{redesigned}} muzzle brake to use it. The [...] "1" [...] variant has an altered butt stock, trigger guard, and a repositioned <b>thumb</b> fire selector <b>switch</b> above the pistol grip. The carrying handle has retained the Chinese quick release mount rail. There {{is no evidence of}} a Picatinny Rail being added; however, two inch long Weaver rail looking connecting mounts are {{on both sides of the}} gas regulator. In addition, bullet casings eject to the front (1 o'clock position from the barrel) of the weapon, allowing left handed firing. Also, there is a bolt release button located behind the magazine latch. It has been seen in service in small numbers for testing and evaluation in first quarter of 2010. It has been speculated that this variant will enter full service in late 2010, replacing the original QBZ-95 assault rifle introduced into service in 1995. The original QBZ-95 rifles will be handed down to second line and reserve troops, while front line troops receive this variant. The QBZ 95-1 is already in use by the Hong Kong Garrison. In addition, it has been spotted in use with the Lanzhou garrison and other units.|$|R
