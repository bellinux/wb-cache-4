Analysis of the mechanism of the anti-herpes action of IFN indicated that no gross inhibition of viral protein synthesis took place and late proteins appeared, although the synthesis of some of them was partially inhibited. No differences were apparent between the glycoproteins or phosphoproteins synthesized in control and IFN-treated HSV-l-infected HeLa cells. No inhibition {{of the formation of}} new virus particles from IFN-treated cells was evident as assessed by electron microscopy and biochemical analyses, although their infectivity was drastically reduced. These virions exhibited some differences in their content of a few proteins as determined by PAGE. Studies on the second infection cycle with virions obtained from IFN-treated cells suggested that they attached and penetrated HeLa cells but that their development was impaired, since no viral protein synthesis was observed during the second infection. Altogether these results do not support the idea that the molecular mechanism of action of human IFN against HSV- 1 is mediated via the 2 '- 5 'A system, or by the inactivation of initiation factors.

Almost without exception, the stock of housing loans is yielding heavily subsidized rates, and its market value is significantly below its book value. Hungary makes an interesting case study. The mortgage portfolio inherited from past regimes makes especially clear the perverse implications of housing finance systems based on across-the-board subsidized interest rates. The authors propose a general approach to finding options to reduce the fiscal burden implicit in the subsidized housing loan portfolio. They identify mechanisms to reduce the interest subsidy embodied in that portfolio as well as mechanisms to spread the associated losses among those benefiting from the subsidies as well as among other parties. Clearly any residual subsidy must be absorbed by the government and ultimately by the population in the form of increased taxation or decreased availability of public services. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> is complex and no obvious, easily implementable solutions emerge.

"May 2013 "Recent curriculum recommendation call for mathematical argumentation to play a significantly greater role in U. S. mathematics instruction at all grade levels, including the elementary grades. To better understand how preservice elementary teachers (PTs) enrolled in a one-semester course emphasizing mathematical argumentation might become better prepared to implement this change, I interviewed five such PTs at two points in time, near the beginning of the course and shortly after they completed it. Both interviews focused on a problem set in which fictional elementary school students present arguments for their solutions to mathematical <b>problems.</b> Interviewees compared <b>the</b> arguments, decided which were convincing, and gave reasons for their choices. I found that they initially preferred arguments in which they perceived the arguer as knowing what to do, getting the correct answer, using a quick way to get it, and showing how with numbers. In contrast, after completing <b>the</b> course, <b>they</b> <b>focused</b> on understanding <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> finding answers that made sense, and explaining why with diagrams. These and other findings suggest that current research on PTs' approaches to mathematical justification may: (a) overemphasize the formal aspects of mathematical arguments and undervalue their substance, (b) overemphasize the role of verification and undervalue explanation, (c) be too far removed from PTs' perspectives, and (d) therefore fail to accurately reflect significant progress in PTs' understandings...|$|R

Adaptive {{transmission}} {{policy for}} short-term throughput maximization [25]: <b>They</b> <b>focus</b> on considering <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of maximizing <b>the</b> transferred data in an energy harvesting node under a deadline constraint, i.e., the short-term throughput. To {{reflect on the}} adaptive transmission policy to the [25], we refer {{the concept of the}} adaptive scheme [31]. It is online energy management schemes for energy harvesting systems operating in fading channels, with finite capacity rechargeable batteries. They determined the throughput policy for deadline constrained setting under online knowledge of the events using stochastic dynamic programming in continuous time. However, the deadline constrained is a heuristic value. As a result, the optimal policy based on the deadline value is limited to maximize the throughput. Different from this work, in practice our proposed scheme considers the unsaturated scenario with the fading model in the network-coding-capable harvesting networks. Therefore, the optimal and dynamic deadline with the network coding is considered with the optimal policy in the harvest networks, i.e. the long-term throughput. 2. Time-energy adaptive scheme [6]: Our proposed policy uses the fading distribution and reacts only to the new energy arrivals and fading level changes. Therefore, it requires less feedback and less computation since they react only to the changes in the fading level. On the other hand, the time-energy adaptive scheme harvests energy with the fixed slot periodically regards less the environment status. <b>They</b> rather <b>focus</b> on <b>the</b> the probability of successful data exchange for the benefits of energy harvesting in bidirectional network coded cooperative communications. 3. Constant water level scheme [30]: Our proposed scheme makes online decisions for transmit, waiting and harvesting power whenever a change in the fading level under the unsaturated scenario is observed through the average CSI in the idle slot. However, in case of the constant water level policy, it did not consider the average CSI of the previous epoch and assume that the relay node can charge the energy from the environment. 4. Energy adaptive scheme [31]: Our proposed scheme basically assumes the initial energy with the practical capacitor of the sensor nodes. And it tries to get the optimal policy in the relay node only when the residual energy is larger than the time constant threshold, τ. Therefore, the exhausted energy cases rarely happen in the relay node in the proposed scheme. However, the energy adaptive scheme did not consider the importance of the relay node in the harvesting network. Therefore, bottleneck sensor nodes with no residual energy prevent the other sensor nodes from communicating.|$|R

40|$|Computer based {{planning}} {{tool for}} adaptation {{of living and}} working environments of physically disabled persons. When adapting living and working environments according {{to the needs of}} physically disabled users it is important to optimize design solutions already during the planning process. Therefore it is quite advantageous if the end-user can be involved in the design process to present her or his personal knowledge and ideas. In Scandinavia, and many other countries, the planning process in cases of adapting living or working environments for disabled, normally is managed by an ergotherapeut. To achieve an optimal result, in addition to the ergotherapeut and the handicapped person himself, a planning team should be formed, consisting of family members, work-colleagues, nursing staff plus architect and civil engineers, etc. Earlier case studies by Eriksson & Johansson (1996) indicated that the use of computer based planning tools could facilitate the involvement of the different groups and their mutual understanding and communication. However, the commercially available softwares, which were used, were not sufficiently adapted to this kind of planning process from a user’s perspective. Therefore the development of a software prototype (‘Magrathea’) adapted for the needs of and the interaction between all the different participants in such planning processes, became part of the present project. The usability aspect has been in <b>focus</b> because of <b>the</b> heterogenous user group and since many potential users have little experience in using computers. As a base for further development of the prototyped software a test and evaluation of ‘Magrathea’ was performed. The software prototype uses a 3 -D-modelled environment where interaction occurs in real time (direct visual response). The prototype is based on QuickDraw 3 D application interface running on Power Macintosh, however a PC-version is being developed in parallel. The user can move in the 3 D-environment by the use of ‘walkthroughs’ and manipulate different objects. Visual angle and perspective can be changed by moving a ‘camera’. Objects can be manipulated by mouse or numerical keys. Rotation of objects is obtained by +/-keys. Parts of objects can be manipulated by keys. The size of objects can be changed by feeding of numerical data in an object information window. Objects are stored in an ’Object library’, divided in subject categories to facilitate search. The library contains 3 D-models of people, movement aids, furniture and equipment for living and working environments. Distances can be displayed in figures when measured by a mouse-controlled ‘measuring tape’. 2 D-prints of the simulated 3 D-environment can be obtained by saving a ‘photograph’ of any chosen perspective. To test the software prototype the REAL-model (Löwgren 1993) was used. According to this the usability of a system is defined by its Relevance (fulfilment of user needs); Efficiency (time and task performance by user); Attitude (user’s subjective assessment); and Learnability (ease of initial learning and remembering over time). The test was performed on two potential user groups; 5 ergotherapeut students (AT-group) and 4 physically disabled persons(RT-group). Each test-person (having similarly limited computer use experience) performed two tests and an interview. The first test had a duration of two hours, including a 45 min standardized introduction by the test manager, during which the test-person was allowed to ask questions and to practice using the software. After a brief pause 12 standardised tasks had to be solved using the software. Basic functions tested were; moving an object horizontally; rotating an object and part of an object; measure distance; take ‘photograph; change visual angle and perspective; using and searching the Object library. The last task was a ‘think-loud-task’ while the test-person was furbishing a bathroom for a wheel-chair bound person. The second test was performed three weeks later. 9 tasks similar to test on-tasks were performed. Results were compared with test I in order to check remembering over time. Finally, an interview concerning usability aspects was performed. Results show that the AT group performed equally well in both tests (96 %). The RH-group scored 81 % I test I and 77 % in test II. Both groups needed more time to solve the tasks in test II, and were using the manual more frequently. These findings might indicate a remembering-over-time <b>problem.</b> <b>The</b> most problematic tasks were finding correct rotation tools for objects and parts of objects. In addition to this, especially in test II, by mistake the camera was rotated instead of the object. In the RH-group there were also some visual conspicuity difficulties due to similar colouring of object and background. In the think-loud task, comments for both test groups showed that <b>they</b> were <b>focusing</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of <b>the</b> wheel-chair bound person in connection with the environment instead of describing how they were using the software, which was what they were expected to comment upon.
