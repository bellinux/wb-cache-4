5000|$|Deaf Hill is {{a village}} in County Durham, England. It is {{situated}} a short distance {{to the east of}} Trimdon Colliery. The origin of the name is not known. The alternative name for the village is Trimdon Station. Locally Deaf Hill is thought to have been called Death Hill. People believed if children were passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> of a sycamore tree they would be cured of diphtheria, inevitably they died and the spot was called Death Hill. The name was changed as more people settled there. This was something told to me as a child, I'm not sure how factual it is. [...] "No one seems to know how this pit got its name of Deaf Hill, but the nearest guess is that in days of long ago, if land was very poor, the old farmers would say it was ‘deed’ or ‘dead’ land, which perhaps has grown into the word deaf. The rising land behind the pit is called Sleepy Hill, which does not sound very productive." ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. We {{described}} {{the first case}} of oversensing due to electric shock in Serbia, in a 54 -year-old man who had implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Case Outline. In July 2002, the patient had acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction and ventricular fibrillation (VF) which was terminated with six defibrillation shocks of 360 J. Coronary angiography revealed 30 % stenosis of circumflex artery, the left anterior descending coronary artery was recanalized and the right coronary artery was without stenosis. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 20 %. In December 2003, an electrophysiology study was performed and ventricular tachycardia (VT) was induced and terminated with 200 J defibrillation shock. Single chamber ICD Medtronic Gem III VR was implanted in January 2004 and defibrillation threshold was 12 J. The patient was followed up during three years every three months {{and there were no}} VT/VF episodes and VT/VF therapies. In December 2007, the patient experienced electric shock <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> while he was making barbecue on the electric grill. ICD recognized this event in VF zone (oversensing) and delivered defibrillation shock of 18 J. The electrogram of the episode showed ventricular sensing - intrinsic sinus rhythm with electric shock potentials which were misidentified as VF. After charge time of 3. 16 seconds, ICD delivered defibrillation shock and sinus rhythm was still present. Conclusion. Oversensing of ICD has different aetiology and the most common cause is supraventricular tachyarrhythmia...|$|E

50|$|With a <b>fork</b> <b>the</b> {{braking forces}} are put <b>through</b> <b>the</b> suspension, a {{situation}} {{that leads to the}} suspension being compressed, using up a large amount of suspension travel which makes dealing with bumps and other road irregularities extremely difficult. As <b>the</b> <b>forks</b> dive <b>the</b> steering geometry of the bike also changes making the bike more nervous, and inversely on acceleration becomes more lazy. Also, having <b>the</b> steering working <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>forks</b> causes problems with stiction, decreasing the effectiveness of the suspension. The length of <b>the</b> typical motorcycle <b>fork</b> means that they act as large levers about the headstock requiring <b>the</b> <b>forks,</b> <b>the</b> headstock, and the frame to be very robust adding to the bike's weight.|$|R
50|$|Applying {{the brakes}} of a moving {{motorcycle}} increases the load {{borne by the}} front wheel and decrease the load borne by the rear wheel due to a phenomenon called load transfer. For a detailed explanation and a sample calculation, see the braking section of the Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics article.If the motorcycle is equipped with telescopic <b>forks,</b> <b>the</b> added load on the front wheel is transmitted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>forks,</b> which compress. This shortening of <b>the</b> <b>forks</b> causes <b>the</b> {{front end of the}} bike to move lower, and this is called brake dive. telescopic forks are particularly prone to this, unlike leading link designs.|$|R

50|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 19th century anchors were of imperfect manufacture, the means of effecting good and efficient welding being absent and the iron poor, whilst the arms, being straight, generally parted at the crown, when weighing from good holding-ground. A clerk in Plymouth Yard, named Pering, {{in the early part of}} that century (1813) introduced curved arms; and after 1852 the British admiralty anchor, under the direction of the Board, was supplied to H.M. ships, followed by Lieutenant (afterwards Captain) Rodger's anchor. Rodger's anchor marked a great departure from the form of previous anchors. The arms were formed in one piece, and were pivoted at the crown on a bolt passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>forked</b> shank. <b>The</b> points or pees to the palms were blunt. This anchor had an excellent reputation amongst nautical men of that period, and by the committee on anchors, appointed by the British admiralty in 1852, it was placed second only to the anchor of Trotman.|$|R

50|$|The chemoreception {{system is}} heavily used by lizard and snake species because they produce {{chemical}} secretions {{that are often}} deposited in urine, feces or substrate scents {{in order to attract}} mates (Martín & López, 2012). The chemicals in the scent or trailing marks of lizards and snakes may give information on sex, body size, or age, which can then be used by females to detect areas that are scent marked by preferred potential males (Martín & López, 2012). Many snakes, just as many bird species, rely on their chemosensory abilities to detect mates (Shine & Mason, 2012). Scents are detected in two ways, through olfaction or airborne cues <b>through</b> <b>the</b> nostril or vomerolfaction where substrates are accessed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>forked</b> tongue and vomeronasal system (Mason & Parker, 2010). The vomeronasal system is the driving force in sexual behavior of snakes and olfaction is used to develop underlying information about their prey (Shine & Mason, 2012). Chemical cues of snakes are often incapable of diffusing through air as they are large epidermal lipids therefore they must use tongue-flicking techniques to determine characteristics of potential mates (Shine & Mason, 2012). In both, lizards and snakes, substrate-borne cues are preferred over airborne cues however, if molecules are small enough to diffuse through air, then olfaction is preferred (Shine & Mason, 2012).|$|R
