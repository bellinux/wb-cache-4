[...] "It isn't as if you wished to be nasty about him, is it?--because I know you like him yourself. You're so wonderful to your friends"--oh she could let him see that she knew!--"and in such different and exquisite ways. There are those like HIM"--she signified her other visitor--"who get everything out of you and whom you really appear fond of, or at least to put up with, just FOR that. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> who ask nothing--and whom you're fond of in spite of it." ...|$|E

There is one side for 10 a.m. yesterday, and one side for 10 a.m. to-day; but you can’t always get there {{as early as}} ten, you know. It rises or falls for rain and fine, with much or less wind, and one end is “Nly” and the other “Ely” (what’s Ely {{got to do with}} it?), and if you tap it, it doesn’t tell you anything. And you’ve got to correct it to sea-level, and reduce it to Fahrenheit, and even then I don’t know the answer.|$|E

60|$|Gertrude {{could not}} say. She knew that £10,000 had been abstracted. Mrs. Woodward groaned as {{she heard the}} sum named. But <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> shares, which had not long since been worth much more than half that sum, which must still be worth {{a large part of}} it.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> freshly {{brought to}} Rome from overseas, whose merits or demerits {{had not yet}} been appraised--they wore no tablet round the neck, but their feet were whitened all over with chalk; and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> whose heads <b>were</b> surmounted by an ugly felt hat in token that the State {{treasury}} tendered no guarantee for them. Their period of servitude had been so short that nothing was known about them, about their health, their skill, or their condition.|$|R
60|$|On the Appian Way, a short {{distance}} out of Rome, the traveller is shown a picturesque ancient building, of enormous strength, called the Mole of Cæcilia Metella. It is a castle in size, but {{is believed to have}} been the tomb erected to the memory of Cæcilia, the daughter of Metellus Creticus, and the wife of Crassus the rich. History knows of her nothing more, and authentic history hardly knows so much of the stupendous monument. There it stands, however, and is supposed to be proof of what might be done for a Roman lady in the way of perpetuating her memory. She was, at any rate, older than Tullia, having been the wife of a man older than Tullia's father. If it be the case that this monument be of the date named, it proves to us, at least, that the notion of erecting such monuments was then prevalent. Some idea of a similar kind--of a monument equally stupendous, and that should last as long--seems to have taken a firm hold of Cicero's mind. He has read all the authors he could find on the subject, and they agree that it shall be done in the fashion he points out. He does not, he says, consult Atticus on that matter, nor on the architecture, for he has already settled on the design of one Cluatius. What he wants Atticus to do for him now is to assist him in buying the spot on which it shall be built. Many gardens near Rome are named. If Drusus makes a difficulty, Atticus must see Damasippus. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> which belong to Sica and to Silius! But at last the matter dies away, and even the gardens are not bought. We are led to imagine that Atticus has been opposed to the monument from first to last, and that the immense cost of constructing such a temple as Cicero had contemplated is proved to him to be injudicious. There is a charming letter written to him at this time by his friend Sulpicius, showing the great feeling entertained for him. But, as I have said before, I doubt whether that or any other phrases of consolation were of service to him. It was necessary for him to wait and bear it, and the more work that he did when he was bearing it, the easier it was borne. Lucceius and Torquatus wrote to him on the same subject, and we have his answers.|$|E
50|$|One debate {{coming out}} of the rise of biohistorical {{research}} centers on whether or not these studies should be conducted based on cultural and societal beliefs. There are those that say “cranial dimensions” and other scientific measurements “should trump notions of cultural affiliation.” <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> that ask if this kind of study should be paramount because of certain significances that some societies hold true that can be eliminated with scientific discovery.|$|E
50|$|The oldest, {{and also}} the most {{appreciated}} for the beauty of their stained glass, {{are those of the}} Rose Window of the transept (over the Portal of the Clock) and some of those of the ambulatory, even though these have a softer color. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> of the main chapel and those of the north aisle of the transept on the east side that display enormous figures of saints and apostles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> {{who took}} to boats. One commandeered a {{whaleboat}} after slinging the guard into the water.

Still others tried {{to break into the}} prison boathouse. Some prisoners perished in their attempt. The aborigine, Burketown Peter, clinging desperately to a wooden target-frame used by the warders during rifle practice, vanished beneath the waters of Moreton Bay as his makeshift raft headed out to sea on an outgoing tide.|$|R
25|$|It {{must also}} be {{mentioned}} that {{quite a few of}} these men were not just enthusiastic amateurs but had been ‘professionals’ in their field before the war; <b>there</b> <b>were</b> quite a few sportsmen who had represented their country for instance, even at Olympic level. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> like Raoul Bailleux, a theatre director in Brussels before the war, who during his time in the Colony wrote, produced and directed a number of ‘entertainments’ for the delectation of the Colony.

Shortly after midnight however, the gale subsided. Huge clouds rolled in over the fields and streets and houses, obscuring the stars and bringing the first snow of the season. Silently and steadily it fell, as window-panes and street lamps became fuzzy with the clinging white flakes. Trees and buildings exchanged sharp outlines for blurred shadows, and the snow-covered bushes faded into the snow-covered ground, neither discernible from the other. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who watched the first snow fall.... ...|$|R
3000|$|From {{its early}} days, human capital {{research}} faced significant resistance. Initially, the problems concerned mostly the label [...] "human capital" [...] for sounding like exploitation, making the concept a problematic one not immediately well accepted either within or beyond the disciplinary boundaries. The criticism of human capital research echoed earlier {{debates about the}} best approach to labour economics, notably {{the applicability of the}} market metaphor to labour issues and the potential for measurement and quantification. It was also the role of education and its economic effects, with many authors believing that education was primarily a socialising force that instilled values of discipline, obedience, and motivation that were rewarded by the labour market. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> emphasising the family background effect on earnings, suggesting that students with better opportunities would have much better possibilities of achieving and benefiting from higher levels of education.|$|R

5000|$|Its {{challenge}} is to successfully market their apparel that, with the increased wages, {{is now at the}} price point of Nike and Adidas clothing. An industry analyst, Andrew Jassin, stated in the New York Times article, [...] "Factory Defies Sweatshop Label, but Can It Thrive?" [...] that “There are consumers who really care and will buy this apparel at a premium price, and <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> who say they care, but then just want value."

5000|$|Johnson {{talks about}} the many forms idleness can take. There are idlers who are proud to call {{themselves}} idle,and there are idlers who disguise their idleness with pointless bustling. There are those who occupy themselves by making plans that will never come about. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> who prefer [...] "to fill the day with petty business, to have always something in hand which may raise curiosity, but not solicitude, and keep the mind {{in a state of}} action, but not of labour."

And <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> {{designed}} to be overheard, where the dialogue is meant to engage and enlighten anyone who is listening in {{as well as the}} speakers themselves. With a musical relationship dating back nearly three decades, pianist Kenny Barron and bassist Dave Holland could certainly engage in the former, but The Art of Conversation is a vivid example of the latter. These 10 tracks all showcase the profound mastery of two artists who share an easy rapport and elegantly restrained expressiveness".|$|E
25|$|Printing in Northern China {{was further}} {{advanced}} by the 11th century, {{as it was}} written by the Song Dynasty scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) that the common artisan Bi Sheng (990-1051) invented ceramic movable type printing. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> such as Wang Zhen (fl. 1290-1333) who invented respectively wooden type setting, which later influenced developing metal moveable type printing in Korea (1372-1377). Movable type printing was a tedious process if one were to assemble thousands of individual characters for the printing of simply one or a few books, but if used for printing thousands of books, the process was efficient and rapid enough to be successful and highly employed. Indeed, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> many cities in China where movable type printing, in wooden and metal form, was adopted by the enterprises of wealthy local families or large private industries. The Qing Dynasty court sponsored enormous printing projects using woodblock movable type printing during the 18th century. Although superseded by western printing techniques, woodblock movable type printing remains in use in isolated communities in China.|$|R

Pressure was also coming from the band's management and the record company, who continued to fund the band's sessions. Raine commented, “I think we were at, like, 35 songs, and we all sat in a room and said, ‘Yeah, but there’s only eight that we all like.’ Everyone’s really frustrated.... And I think Bob had even lost perspective at this point. We’re sitting there in this shitty little studio in Malibu, and it just got a little aggressive and agitated in the room." ...|$|R
5000|$|There are the Fulani proper, also {{referred}} to as the Fulɓe, including the Pullo (also called the Rimɓe (singular)) and the Dimo, meaning [...] "noble".

50|$|In 1936, Gabriello Cecchi {{moved to}} Turin. He was {{originally}} from Ponte Buggianese, in Tuscany, but he hailed from France, {{where he learned}} the art of making gelato from Italian immigrants. Assisted by {{his wife and his}} brother, Tancredi, he opened an gelato parlour in Corso Palestro with a seating capacity of 200 and a workshop attached. The business grew quickly, thanks also to his famous crema gialla custard flavour, considered the best in Turin at the time. This particular type of vanilla, a flavour that no one ever managed to reproduce, was Gabriello's jewel in the crown. The glass sign featuring golden italics on an aquamarine background, which dominated the Corso Palestro parlour's shop window - Cecchi Gelati Naturali - revealed only part of the secret. Gabriello did use top quality ingredients, but it was the formula he used to mix those ingredients that made his gelati so unforgettable. It was a time when gelato was booming; it became a mass consumer good in the postwar years. Gelato recipes were perfected and new ways of eating it were invented. The usual steel cups used for serving it at tables were joined by wafer cones for eating it while strolling along. The three most important brands in Turin were Cecchi, Fiorio and Pepino. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who didn’t have a shop yet and toured the city on a bicycle cart, such as Teofilo Sanson, who sold the gelato his close friend Gabriello provided him with.|$|R
