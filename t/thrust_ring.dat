50|$|North Coast Rocketry was {{subsequently}} purchased by Estes Industries' around 1995-1996 {{and served as}} Estes' mid/high power model rocketry division. The NCR motor technology was changed by Estes to the more industry-standard ammonium-perchlorate-based composite propellant. All Estes versions of the NCR models used DarkStar motors, which emitted a dark black smoke trail. These motors were made specifically for NCR rockets and were slightly smaller in diameter than their competitor's motors. The motor was unique in {{that it had a}} molded aft <b>thrust</b> <b>ring</b> on the motor.|$|E
5000|$|Titan I {{also was}} the first true {{multi-stage}} (two or more stages) design. The Atlas missile had all three of its main rocket engines ignited at launch (two were jettisoned during flight) due to concerns about igniting rocket engines at high altitude and maintaining combustion stability. Martin, in part, {{was selected as the}} contractor because it had [...] "recognized the 'magnitude of the altitude of the altitude start problem' for the second stage and had a good suggestion for solving it." [...] Titan I's second-stage engines were reliable enough to be ignited at altitude, after separation from the first stage booster. The first stage, besides including heavy fuel tanks and engines, also had launch interface equipment and the launch pad <b>thrust</b> <b>ring</b> with it. When the first stage had finished consuming its propellant, it dropped away, thereby decreasing the mass of the vehicle. Titan I’s ability to jettison this mass prior to the ignition of the second stage meant that Titan I had a much greater total range (and a greater range per pound of second-stage fuel) than Atlas, even if the total fuel load of Atlas had been greater.|$|E
40|$|The Baccalaureate Thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} tool for fixing of thrust rings in flanges of high {{pressure}} fuel injection pumps. The theoretical part of the final project summarizes both theory-based and cold metal and alloy working-based knowledge. Three options of fixing the <b>thrust</b> <b>ring</b> in the flange of a high pressure fuel injection pump have been developed. Based on tests carried out, the option II has been chosen for repairs of fuel injection pumps flanges since {{it seems to be the}} most advantageous one. The high pressure fuel injection pump flange is made of AlSilMgMn aluminium alloy. The <b>thrust</b> <b>ring</b> is made by C 75 sheet steel stamping according to DIN 17222 (ČSN 12081). The tool drawing was made on the basis of the best-fit technology repair option. Stamping tools are made of 19 452 steel and hardened to HRC 60 - 4. The assumed yearly output amounts to 7000 pieces. A special purpose machine is used for repairing fuel injection pump flanges...|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{cryogenic}} pumps {{used for}} propellant loading at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and other NASA Centers have a bellows mechanical seal and oil bath ball bearings, {{both of which}} can be problematic and require high maintenance. Because of the extremely low temperatures, the mechanical seals are made of special materials and design, have wearing surfaces, are subject to improper installation, and commonly are a potential leak path. The ball bearings are non-precision bearings [ABEC- 1 (Annular Bearing Engineering Council) ] and are lubricated using LOX compatible oil. This oil is compatible with the propellant to prevent explosions, but does not have good lubricating properties. Due to the poor lubricity, it has been a goal of the KSC cryogenics community for the last 15 years to develop a magnetically coupled pump, which would eliminate these two potential issues. A number of projects have been attempted, but none of the pumps was a success. An off-the-shelf magnetically coupled pump (typically used with corrosive fluids) was procured that has been used for hypergolic service at KSC. The KSC Cryogenics Test Lab (CTL) operated the pump in cryogenic LN 2 as received to determine a baseline for modifications required. The pump bushing, bearings, and <b>thrust</b> <b>rings</b> failed, and the pump would not flow liquid (this is a typical failure mode that was experienced in the previous attempts). Using the knowledge gained over the years designing and building cryogenic pumps, the CTL determined alternative materials that would be suitable for use under the pump design conditions. The CTL procured alternative materials for the bearings (bronze, aluminum bronze, and glass filled PTFE) and machined new bearing bushings, sleeves, and <b>thrust</b> <b>rings.</b> The designed clearances among the bushings, sleeves, <b>thrust</b> <b>rings,</b> case, and case cover were altered once again using experience gained from previous cryogenic pump rebuilds and designs. The alternative material parts were assembled into the pump, and the pump was successfully operated meeting all expected operating parameters. Unique pump sub-assembly parts were designed and manufactured by the CTL using specialized materials determined to be superior for cryogenic thermal applications under the pump design conditions. This work is a proof-of-concept/proof-of-operation of the pump only. Other known internal design modifications to the pump should be accomplished for the long-term use of the pump. An upscaled version of this pump, which is under development and testing at the CTL, can be used either for current or future vehicle loading or for vehicle replenishment. Scaling of this pump can be easily accomplished...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{enhanced}} and cost-effective performance of engineering components, Surface Engineering embraces traditional and innovative surface technologies which modify the surface properties of metallic and non-metallic engineering components for specific and sometime unique engineering purposes. The surface roughness of an engineered surface may be classified as: the random surface roughness which {{is a product of}} surface finishing and the deterministic surface roughness which is engineered to increase the lubrication characteristics of the hydro dynamically lubricated <b>thrust</b> <b>ring.</b> The effect of stochastic/random roughness can not be ignored when the roughness is of the same amplitude as that of fluid film thickness. Average flow model derived in terms of flow factors which are functions of the roughness characteristics is used to study the random surface roughness effects on hydrodynamic lubrication of deterministic asperity. In addition, the effect of boundary conditions on flow factors is studied by calculating the pressure and shear flow factor using two different new boundary conditions. The results are obtained for random surface roughness having a Gaussian distribution of roughness heights...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{explored}} simple geologic {{strength and}} material response models {{to determine which}} {{have the capability to}} simulate impact-induced faulting, complicated ejecta patterns and complex crater shapes. This led us to develop models for material damage, dilatancy, and inhomogeneous materials (mixtures). We found that a strength degradation (damage) model was necessary to produce faulting in homogeneous materials. Both normal and <b>thrust</b> <b>ring</b> faults may occur and extend relatively deeply into the planet during the transient cavity radial expansion. The maximum depth of fault development is about the depth of maximum penetration by the projectile. Dilatancy in geologic materials may reduce the final bulk density compared to the pristine state because of irreversible fracturing. When we include the effects of dilatancy, the radial position of faulting is displaced because of greater upward motions. In addition, the late time crater profile is shallower and the expression of features such as central peaks and rings may be more pronounced. Both damage and rock-ice mixtures effect the distribution of ejecta. The excavation flow field within the heavily damaged region is similar to flow fields in Mohr-Coulomb materials with no zero-pressure strength. In the outer, less damaged zone within the excavation cavity, the material trajectories collapse back into the crater. This effect creates a zone of reduced ejecta emplacement {{near the edge of the}} final crater. In the case of rock-ice mixtures, energy is preferentially deposited in the more compressible volatile component and the ejecta pattern is dependent upon the location of shock-induced phase changes in the volatile material...|$|E

40|$|Fan-in-fin {{system can}} be used as {{single-rotor}} helicopter fenestrons propulsion system of low-speed airplanes and dirigibles as well as vehicles with remote control. The article suggests way to continue the author’s research in the field of fan-in-fin system aerodynamics. It also offers a method of aerodynamic characteristics of “fan-in-fin” (fenestron) system with cylindrical diffuser of limited length in flow regime under zero angle of attack calculation. The article gives some formula to calculate the flow velocity through the disk area which decrease with the increase of the defusser and air speed. Correlation between fan <b>thrust</b> power and <b>ring</b> <b>thrust</b> on these regimes and momentum drag are found. Momentum drag is high enough, this fact leads to back deviation of total aerodynamic force system. This angle increases with increase of the diffuser length and at medium speed it can reach 30 °.

A crowbar was <b>thrust</b> through the <b>ring,</b> and all of them, taking hold of the ends, lifted with all their strength.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{thruster}} technology offers promising low speed maneuvering capabilities for underwater vehicles. Similar to the natural locomotion of squid and jellyfish the thruster successively forces fluid jets {{in and out of}} a small internal cavity. We investigate several properties of squid and jellyfish locomotion to drive the thruster design including actuation of nozzle geometry and vortex <b>ring</b> <b>thrust</b> augmentation. The thrusters are compact with no extruding components to negatively impact the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s drag. These devices have thrust rise-times orders of magnitude faster than those reported for typical propeller thrusters, making them an attractive option for high accuracy underwater vehicle maneuvering. The dynamics of starting jet circulation, impulse, and kinetic energy are derived in terms of kinematics at the entrance boundary of a semi-infinite domain, specifically identifying the effect of a non-parallel incoming flow. A model for pressure at the nozzle is derived without the typical reliance on a predetermined potential function, making it a powerful tool for modeling any jet flow. Jets are created from multiple nozzle configurations to validate these models, and velocity and vorticity fields are determined using DPIV techniques. A converging starting jet resulted in circulation 90 - 100...|$|R
