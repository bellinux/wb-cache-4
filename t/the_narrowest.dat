5|$|The ferry, and {{subsequently}} the bridge, {{is located at}} <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> section of Skarnsundet, between the villages of Kjerringvik and Vangshylla. In addition to Mosvik, the bridge also caters for the larger municipality Leksvik, further out along the fjord. The bridge {{is the only one}} to cross the Trondheimsfjord.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Narrows</b> in Zion National Park, (near Springdale, Utah) is {{a section}} of canyon on the North Fork of the Virgin River. The hike of <b>The</b> <b>Narrows</b> {{is one of the}} premier hikes on the Colorado Plateau. <b>The</b> term <b>The</b> <b>Narrows</b> refers to both the through-hike of <b>The</b> <b>Narrows,</b> and to <b>The</b> <b>Narrows</b> themselves, {{especially}} <b>the</b> 3.6 mi long section of canyon between the end of the Riverside Walk Trail and Big Spring. <b>The</b> <b>Narrows</b> lies north of, and upstream of, the main Zion Canyon.

5|$|Bristol's {{boundaries}} are defined in several ways, {{depending on whether}} they {{are those of the}} city, the developed area, or Greater Bristol. <b>The</b> <b>narrowest</b> definition of the city is the city council boundary, which includes a large section of the western Severn Estuary up to (but not including) the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.|$|E
5|$|In 1879 {{the bridge}} was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 {{demolished}} and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and built by John Mowlem & Co. <b>The</b> <b>narrowest</b> surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, {{it is one of}} London's least busy Thames bridges. The location on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions.|$|E
5|$|Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, after helium. It glows reddish-orange in {{a vacuum}} {{discharge}} tube. Also, neon has <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> liquid range of any element: from 24.55 K to 27.05 K (−248.45°C to −245.95°C, or −415.21°F to −410.71°F). It has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen (on a per unit volume basis). In most applications it is a less expensive refrigerant than helium.|$|E

5|$|The Vangshylla–Kjerringvik Ferry {{connected}} {{the municipalities of}} Inderøy and Mosvik across the sound Skarnsund, at <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> point of the Trondheimsfjord. The route operated from 1 June 1964 to 19 December 1991, when it {{was replaced by the}} Skarnsund Bridge. It was part of Norwegian National Road 755. The ferry had hourly services in each direction through most of the day, and the crossing took seven minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{west coast}} of Newfoundland borders on the Gulf of St. Lawrence while all other coasts face the Atlantic Ocean. Labrador's coast borders the Labrador Sea, {{a part of the}} Atlantic Ocean. The Strait of Belle Isle connects the Gulf of St. Lawrence with the Labrador Sea and is <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> channel {{separating}} Newfoundland from mainland Canada. The Cabot Strait separates Newfoundland from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg traces {{its history}} back over a {{thousand}} years. It was originally settled as a trading post because of its position on the Limfjord. The sites of what were two settlements and a burial ground {{can be seen on}} Lindholm Høje, a hill overlooking the city. These large settlements, one from the 6th-century Germanic Iron Age, the other from the Viking Age in the 9th to 11th centuries, evolved at <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> point on Limfjord {{as a result of the}} traffic between Himmerland to the south and Vendsyssel to the north.|$|E
50|$|The town of Petersburg is at {{the north}} end of <b>the</b> <b>Narrows.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Narrows</b> are created by Mitkof Island to the east and southeast, and the islands of Kuprenof and Woewodski to the north and west. <b>The</b> <b>Narrows</b> opens up to Frederick Sound to the north and Sumner Strait to the south.|$|R
50|$|The four-in-hand knot is tied {{by placing}} the tie around the neck and {{crossing}} the broad end of the tie in front of <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> end. <b>The</b> broad end is folded behind <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> end and brought forward on the opposite side, passed across the front horizontally, folded behind <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> end again, brought {{over the top of}} the knot from behind, tucked behind the horizontal pass, and the knot pulled snug.

5|$|All but six of Senna's 41 {{victories}} {{were for}} McLaren, and 32 of his wins were in cars with a Honda engine. Of his remaining nine victories, five were achieved with Ford powered cars, and four with Renault. He was most successful at Monaco, where he won six times during his career, including a record five consecutive times between 1989 and 1993. His largest {{margin of victory}} was 1:23.199 at the 1993 European Grand Prix, while <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> margin was at the 1986 Spanish Grand Prix, when he beat Nigel Mansell by 0.014 seconds, one of the closest finishes in Formula One.|$|E
5|$|In a 1649 treaty the Dutch had {{pledged to}} defend Denmark against unprovoked aggression, {{and from a}} Swedish point of view it was {{essential}} to establish naval supremacy in Øresund to keep the Dutch out should they decide {{to intervene in the}} conflict. Kronborg Castle sat near <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> part of Øresund, a sound only four kilometres wide, which gave the castle a supreme strategic importance. Frederick III had appointed the colonel Poul Beenfeldt commander of the castle and ordered him to defend it at all costs. Should he fail in that, Kronborg was to be blown up to prevent the Swedes from using it.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} zygomatic plate, a bony plate at the side of the skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
40|$|We report {{results from}} high {{resolution}} optical spectroscopy of three non-radiative galactic supernova remnants, RCW 86, Kepler's supernova remnant and SN 1006. We have measured <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> component H-alpha line widths in Balmer-dominated filaments in RCW 86 and SN 1006, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> component width in a Balmer-dominated knot in Kepler's SNR. <b>The</b> <b>narrow</b> component line widths measured in RCW 86 and Kepler's SNR show FWHM of 30 - 40 km/s, similar {{to what has been}} seen in other Balmer-dominated remnants. Of the remnants in our sample, SN 1006 is the fastest shock (~ 3000 km/s). <b>The</b> <b>narrow</b> component H-alpha and H-beta lines in this remnant have a FWHM of merely 21 km/s. Comparing <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> component widths measured in our sample with those measured in other remnants shows that the width of <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> component does not correlate in a simple way with the shock velocity. The implications for the pre-heating mechanism responsible for the observed line widths are discussed. Comment: Accepted by A&...|$|R

5|$|Most {{historical}} {{buildings are}} concentrated in the Old Town. Bratislava's Town Hall is a complex of three buildings erected in the 14th–15th centuries and now hosts the Bratislava City Museum. Michael's Gate is the only gate that has been preserved from the medieval fortifications, and it ranks among {{the oldest of the}} town's buildings; <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> house in Europe is nearby. The University Library building, erected in 1756, was used by the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1802 to 1848. Much of the significant legislation of the Hungarian Reform Era (such as the abolition of serfdom and the foundation of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences) was enacted there.|$|E
5|$|With {{new players}} and using Chapman's system, Huddersfield were transformed. They {{finished}} third in 1922–23 {{and went on to}} win their first League title in 1923–24. This success was by <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> of margins – equal on points with Cardiff City, Huddersfield won by a difference of 0.024 (1.818 to 1.794) in goal average. The final goal by Brown in a 3–0 win over Nottingham Forest {{on the final day of}} the season proved crucial, although ultimately it was Huddersfield's superior defensive record which had given them the advantage.|$|E
5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
50|$|From when Zion {{became a}} National Park (1919), {{tourists}} were guided up <b>the</b> <b>Narrows</b> on horseback {{well into the}} 1960s. The through-hike of <b>The</b> <b>Narrows</b> became popular starting in the late 1960s.|$|R

5|$|In {{the centre}} of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; {{although}} it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from each other. Since the 18th century they have been linked by successive bridges over <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> part of the harbour. The present Town Bridge, built in 1930, is a lifting bascule bridge allowing boats to access the inner harbour. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Weymouth {{for the first time on}} 26 January 1869. A boathouse was built with a slipway by the harbour and is still in use, although the lifeboat is now moored at a pontoon.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. <b>The</b> <b>narrowest</b> part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|E
5|$|NY430, {{once more}} a surface road, becomes county-maintained again as it heads {{southwest}} on Lakeside Drive to Bemus Point, a village located at <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> point of Chautauqua Lake between Mayville and Jamestown. Due {{to the narrow}} width of the lake at Bemus Point, a ferry once ran {{from the end of}} Lakeside Drive to the North Harmony hamlet of Stow; however, it has since been replaced with the Chautauqua Lake Bridge on the Southern Tier Expressway farther south. NY430, however, turns southeast at Main Street and connects to the aforementioned expressway at the eastern end of the Chautauqua Lake Bridge by way of an interchange near the southern edge of Bemus Point.|$|E
