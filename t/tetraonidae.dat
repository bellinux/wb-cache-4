A powerful raptor, apparently an eagle with black-barred wings, hung high in air amongst the swallows winging their way northwards, and the Madeiran sparrow-hawk was never out of sight; ravens, unscared by stone-throwing boys, flew over us unconcernedly, while the bushes sheltered many blackbirds, the Canary-bird (Fringilla canaria) showed its green belly and grey back and wings, singing a note unknown to us; and an indigenous linnet (F. teydensis), small and green-robed, hopped over the ground tame as a wren. We saw nothing of the red-legged partridge or the <b>Tetraonidae,</b> reported to be common.|$|E

50|$|Diseases and parasites {{have been}} {{proposed}} as factors associated with the decline of populations of other species within the same family of birds as the capercaillie (<b>Tetraonidae).</b> In an attempt to determine if parasites were contributing to {{the decline of the}} Cantabrian capercaillie, researchers collected and analyzed fecal samples in 1998 from various localities across the range of this subspecies. The prevalence of common parasites (Eimeria sp. and Capillaria sp.) was present in 58 percent and 25 percent of the samples collected, respectively. However, both the intensity and average intensity of these parasites were very low compared to other populations of species of birds in the <b>Tetraonidae</b> family. Other parasites were found infrequently. The researchers concluded that it was unlikely that intestinal parasites were causing the decline of the Cantabrian capercaillie.|$|E
5000|$|Grouse [...] are a {{group of}} birds from the order Galliformes, in the family Phasianidae. Grouse are {{frequently}} assigned to the subfamily Tetraoninae (sometimes <b>Tetraonidae),</b> a classification supported by mitochondrial DNA sequence studies, and applied by the American Ornithologists' Union, ITIS, and others. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, from pine forests to moorland and mountainside, from 83°N (rock ptarmigan in northern Greenland) to 28°N (Attwater's prairie chicken in Texas).|$|E
5000|$|The Phasianidae [...] are {{a family}} of heavy, groundliving birds which {{includes}} pheasants, partridges, junglefowl, chickens, Old World quail, and peafowl. The family includes {{many of the most}} popular gamebirds. The family is a large one, and is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies, the Phasianinae, and the Perdicinae. Sometimes, additional families and birds are treated as part of this family. For example, the American Ornithologists' Union includes <b>Tetraonidae</b> (grouse), Numididae (guineafowl), and Meleagrididae (turkeys) as subfamilies in Phasianidae.|$|E
50|$|The living Galliformes {{were once}} divided into seven or more families. Despite their {{distinctive}} appearance, grouse and turkeys probably do not warrant separation as families {{due to their}} recent origin from partridge- or pheasant-like birds. The turkeys became larger after their ancestors colonized temperate and subtropical North America, where pheasant-sized competitors were absent. The ancestors of grouse, though, adapted to harsh climates and could thereby colonize subarctic regions. Consequently, the Phasianidae are expanded in current taxonomy to include the former <b>Tetraonidae</b> and Meleagrididae as subfamilies.|$|E
50|$|Grouse, ptarmigans, and prairie {{chickens}} are all chicken-like {{birds with}} short, curved, strong bills, {{part of the}} family <b>Tetraonidae.</b> This group includes 25 species residing mostly in North America. They are mainly ground-dwellers and have short, rounded wings for brief flights. They are well adapted to winter by growing feather “snowshoes” on their feet and roosting beneath the snow. They range in size from the 13-inch white-tailed ptarmigan to the 28-inch sage grouse. Their plumage is dense and soft and is most commonly found in shades of red, brown, and gray to camouflage to the ground. They are polygamous and male courtship behavior includes strutting and dancing and aggressive fighting for possession of females. The typical clutch size is between seven and 12 eggs.|$|E

Closely related to the sharptail, the greater prairie chicken occupies similar habitat. Although in different genera, the two species hybridize where their ranges overlap Oohnsgard 1968).

40|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{is thought to}} be a powerful diversifying force, based on large ornamental differences between sexually dimorphic species. This assumes that unornamented phenotypes represent evolution without sexual selection. If sexual {{selection is}} more powerful than other forms of selection, then two effects would be: rapid divergence of sexually selected traits and a correlation between these divergence rates and variance in mating success in the ornamented sex. I tested for these effects in grouse (<b>Tetraonidae).</b> For three species pairs, within and among polygynous clades, male courtship characters had significantly greater divergence than other characters. This was most pronounced for two species in Tympanuchus. In the Eurasian polygynous clade, relative courtship divergence gradually increased with nucleotide divergence, suggesting a less dramatic acceleration. Increase in relative courtship divergence was associated with mating systems having higher variance in male mating success. These results suggest that sexual selection has accelerated courtship evolution among grouse, although the microevolutionary details appear to vary among clades...|$|E
40|$|Populations of wildfowl {{have been}} {{categorised}} taxonomically into five families: Phasianidae, <b>Tetraonidae,</b> Scolopacidae, Otidae and Anatidae. They {{are of particular}} importance for agriculture, forestry and the game economy, and certain species also {{have an important role}} in the epizootiology of parasitic infections in domestic fowl and fish. That is why it is extremely important for the process of promoting the system of animal health protection to have knowledge regarding the etiology and epizootiology of parasitic infections in wildfowl. Diseases in wildfowl caused by protozoa are histomoniasis, trichomoniasis, malaria, coccidiosis, cryptosporidiosis, sarcocystosis, toxoplasmosis, and giardiasis. The most represented helminthiases in wildfowl are singamosis, capillariasis, trichostrongyliasis, ascaridiosis, heteraciosis, nematodosis of the glandular stomach, cestodoses and trematodoses. The most significant ectoparasites in wildfowl are mites, ticks, and fleas. The reduction of populations of certain widlfowl species in nature could present a major problem, having in mind the important role of these birds in ecosystems and biocenosis. The incidence, maintaining and spreading of parasitic infections among widlfowl are just some of the factors that affect the numbers of their populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{sheep tick}} Ixodes ricinus (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) is an {{ectoparasite}} of major economic and pathogenic importance in Scotland. Its {{distribution in the}} Scottish uplands {{is assumed to be}} governed by the abundance and distribution of its definitive hosts (deer and sheep) and climatic variables such as temperature and rainfall. As the numbers of its major host in Scotland, red deer, have increased dramatically and climatic conditions have become more favourable, the level of parasitism could have been expected to rise. We use data gathered from tick counts on over 4000 red grouse chicks Lagopus lagopus scoticus Latham (Galliformes: <b>Tetraonidae)</b> in various experiments over the past 19 years to ascertain whether the intensity and prevalence of parasitism has been increasing. From 1985 to 2003 the average tick burden of a parasitized red grouse chick has grown from 2. 60 1. 12 ticks per chick to 12. 71 1. 44. Over this period the percentage of chicks of a given brood parasitized has also increased from 4 3 %.

40|$|Abstract Background The Galliformes is a {{well-known}} and widely distributed Order in Aves. The phylogenetic relationships of galliform birds, especially the turkeys, grouse, chickens, quails, and pheasants, have been studied intensively, likely because of their close association with humans. Despite extensive studies, convergent morphological evolution and rapid radiation have resulted in conflicting hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships. Many internal nodes have remained ambiguous. Results We analyzed the complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes from 34 galliform species, including 14 new mt genomes and 20 published mt genomes, and obtained a single, robust tree. Most of the internal branches were relatively short and the terminal branches long suggesting an ancient, rapid radiation. The Megapodiidae formed the sister group to all other galliforms, followed in sequence by the Cracidae, Odontophoridae and Numididae. The remaining clade included the Phasianidae, <b>Tetraonidae</b> and Meleagrididae. The genus Arborophila was the sister group of the remaining taxa followed by Polyplectron. This was followed by two major clades: ((((Gallus, Bambusicola) Francolinus) (Coturnix, Alectoris)) Pavo) and (((((((Chrysolophus, Phasianus) Lophura) Syrmaticus) Perdix) Pucrasia) (Meleagris, Bonasa)) ((Lophophorus, Tetraophasis) Tragopan))). Conclusions The traditional hypothesis of monophyletic lineages of pheasants, partridges, peafowls and tragopans was not supported in this study. Mitogenomic analyses recovered robust phylogenetic relationships and suggested that the Galliformes formed a model group {{for the study of}} morphological and behavioral evolution. </p...|$|E
40|$|A main {{challenge}} in harvest management {{is to set}} policies that maximize the probability that management goals are met. While the management cycle includes multiple sources of uncertainty, only some of these has received considerable attention. Currently, {{there is a large}} gap in our knowledge about implemention of harvest regulations, and to which extent indirect control methods such as harvest regulations are actually able to regulate harvest in accordance with intended management objectives. In this perspective article, we first summarize and discuss hunting regulations currently used in management of grouse species (<b>Tetraonidae)</b> in Europe and North America. Management models suggested for grouse are most often based on proportional harvest or threshold harvest principles. These models are all built on theoretical principles for sustainable harvesting, and provide in the end an estimate on a total allowable catch. However, implementation uncertainty is rarely examined in empirical or theoretical harvest studies, and few general findings have been reported. Nevertheless, circumstantial evidence suggest that many of the most popular regulations are acting depensatory so that harvest bag sizes is more limited in years (or areas) where game density is high, contrary to general recommendations. A better understanding of the implementation uncertainty related to harvest regulations is crucial in order to establish sustainable management systems. We suggest that scenario tools like Management System Evaluation (MSE) should be more frequently used to examine robustness of currently applied harvest regulations to such implementation uncertainty until more empirical evidence is available...|$|E
40|$|Of the basal clades of extant birds (Neornithes) the ‘landfowl’ or galliforms (Aves, Galliformes) are {{the most}} speciose. Cladistic {{analysis}} of more than 100 morphological characters coded at the generic level for most putative galliform genera confirms that the megapodes (‘mound builders’; Megapodiidae) {{are the most}} basal clade within the order. They are followed successively by the curassows, guans and chachalacas (Cracidae), which comprise the sister-group to all other extant Galliformes (i. e. Phasianoidea). Within this large ‘phasianoid’ clade, analyses suggest that the guineafowl (Numididae) are the most basal taxon, although monophyly of this ‘family’ is not strictly supported {{on the basis of}} the morphological characters employed. An additional major clade within the phasianoid Galliformes is recovered by this analysis, comprising the traditional groupings of New World quails (Odontophoridae) and Old World quails (‘Perdicini’), yet only monophyly of the former is supported unambiguously by morphological characters. Relationships within the remainder of the phasianoid taxa, including the grouse (<b>Tetraonidae),</b> turkeys (i. e. Meleagris/Agriocharus spp.) as well as other ‘pavonine’ galliforms (i. e. peafowl; Pavo, Afropavo, Rheinardia, Argusianus and Polyplectron spp.) remain largely unresolved on the basis of morphological characters, yet monophyly of the major subdivisions is supported here. Although there are a number of important differences, especially with regard to relationships within the nonquail phasianoids, the results of this morphological phylogenetic (cladistic) analysis are broadly congruent both with traditional classifications and existing molecular hypotheses of galliform phylogenetic relationship...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the most}} {{familiar}} sexual signals are red, yellow, and orange sexual traits pigmented by carotenoids. Many birds can detect near-ultraviolet (UV) light, and UV signals can play key roles in mate choice. Grouse (<b>Tetraonidae)</b> exhibit bright carotenoid-dependent sexual ornaments, their supra-orbital combs, which to humans appear orange-red. Combs also reflect in the UV, which is not visible to humans but {{is likely to be}} visible to grouse. In male red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, we show that comb UV reflectance decreases with increasing comb size and redness. By removing the epidermis of combs, where carotenoid pigments are, we show that the UV reflectance is a property of the dermis, underneath the red pigmented epidermis. Carotenoid pigmentation of combs acted as a mask to reduce reflectance by the dermis in the range 400 – 550 nm and in the UV, 300 – 400 nm. Patagium skin (non-ornamental skin under the wing) also reflects in the UV, but epidermis removal on this bare part tended to reduce UV reflectance, whereas removal of the red epidermis of combs increased UV reflectance. Males in better condition (greater body mass relative to size) had bigger and redder combs, but with less UV. Thus, carotenoid pigments of grouse combs are deposited on a white background with significant UV reflectance, which can influence how the signal is perceived by conspecifics. Carotenoid-based traits exhibit UV reflectance in a number of species, but how UV reflectance and carotenoid pigmentation influence colour remains little known for integumentary ornaments compared to plumage traits. UV vision is not uncommon in birds and other animals, so future studies should investigate how UV reflectance influences the perception of carotenoid-based signals of quality. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} {{analysis of the}} multi-year (1984 – 2005) dynamics of reproductive parameters in the population of Tree Sparrow Passer montanus {{was carried out in}} the vicinity of Lake Chany (Baraba forest-steppe). In this species the inter-annual dynamics cycling of the average size of clutches and eggs was revealed. The dominant clutch size cycle of the Tree Sparrow is 11 years. This species may adapt to the cycles of the air temperature dynamics similar in time during the second and third decades of May, when the most pairs begin to reproduce. Since the sparrows fledge mostly with insects, an abundance of which depends on thermal environment, such adjustment provides a higher productivity of individuals and populations in general. Less expressed 3 – 4 -year cycles of clutch size, most likely, are caused by the intra-population reasons. The average seasonal fecundity of the Tree Sparrow depends on the ratio {{between the first and second}} clutches. The proportion of second clutches varies with the periodicity of three-year and 12 -year (multiple of three). Perhaps this is due to the three-year dynamics of the age structure, as the majority of Tree Sparrow yearling are monocyclic. Rhythm spectra of long-term changes in the linear dimensions and volume of eggs of the Tree Sparrow are very similar. The most powerful cycle lasts approximately 7 -year, but there are 3 -and 2 -year periodic components less expressed on power. Probably the of egg dimensions cycling is determined by a variety of external and intra-population factors (food supply, age distribution of the population, timing and duration of their breeding season).
