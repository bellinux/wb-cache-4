With this I avoided the delay of striking matches, but for all that the steady process of extinction went on, and the shadows I feared and fought against returned, and crept in upon me, first a step gained on this side of me, then on that.

60|$|Deep was the {{fountain}} of pity {{in the good old}} man's heart! He often ate his dinner stintingly, oppressed by the thought that there were men, women, and children, with no dinner to sit down to, and would relieve his mind by going out in the afternoon to look for some need that he could supply, some honest struggle in which he could lend a helping hand. That any living being should want, was his chief sorrow; that any rational being should waste, was the next. Sally, indeed, having been scolded by master for a too lavish use of sticks in lighting the kitchen fire, and various instances of recklessness with regard <b>to</b> <b>candle</b> ends, considered him 'as mean as aenythink;' but he had as kindly a warmth as the morning sunlight, and, like the sunlight, his goodness shone on all that came in his way, from the saucy rosy-cheeked lad whom he delighted to make happy with a Christmas box, to the pallid sufferers up dim entries, languishing under the tardy death of want and misery.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Moth and the Star" [...] is a fable by James Thurber, {{printed in}} the story {{collection}} Fables for Our Time in 1940. In the fable, a young moth aspires to fly up to a star, and keeps trying to reach that impossible goal. The other moths laugh at him. They tell him he should have a realistic goal, such as flying <b>to</b> a <b>candle.</b> Indeed, they all fly <b>to</b> <b>candles</b> and are burnt to ashes. The dreamy, unrealistic young moth keeps focused on flying to a star. He lives a long and happy life.|$|R
50|$|The {{originally}} contemptuous name, Dopper, {{may come}} from the Dutch domp (wick-snuffers) for their opposition <b>to</b> <b>candles</b> and other innovations in worship, perhaps representing their contempt for the Enlightenment; or, Dopper may originate from Dutch dop (and thus drinkers), perhaps on account of their strong opposition to small, individual communion cups.|$|R

50|$|Theatres were {{switching}} over to {{gas lighting}} {{not just because}} it was more economical than using candles but also required less labor to operate. With gas lighting, theatres would no longer need to have people tending <b>to</b> <b>candles</b> during a performance, or having <b>to</b> light each <b>candle</b> individually. “It was easier to light a row of gas jets than a greater quantity of candles high in the air.” Theatres also no longer needed to worry about wax dripping on the actors during a show.|$|R

50|$|To {{be in the}} race, {{participants}} were required to register by November. Each team had anywhere from 10 to 20 dogs. The race started in Nome and followed telegraphic lines <b>to</b> <b>Candle,</b> Alaska, before retracing the route to Nome. The telegraphic lines enabled the mushers to communicate their checkpoint times and ranks to the media. The stop numbers and places were uncontrolled, so stewards were placed at each stop along the journey to resupply teams.|$|E

50|$|A spill vase {{was usually}} {{kept on the}} mantelpiece and was filled with spills used to {{transfer}} fire from the fireplace <b>to</b> <b>candles,</b> lamps, a pipe or a cigar.

50|$|In 2001 renovators {{working for}} the {{government}} observed that the black hands and face of La Moreneta had over the centuries undergone a change in colour. They attribute the change—from a lighter tone to black—either to prolonged exposure <b>to</b> <b>candle</b> smoke or a chemical reaction caused by a varnish used as a paint sealant. The statue was repainted black by successive generations of restorers. A series of tests, including X-rays, revealed the statue's original colour and also showed that the last repainting {{took place at the}} turn of the 18th century.|$|E
5000|$|Dogs {{from the}} Anadyr River and {{surrounding}} regions were imported into Alaska from 1908 (and {{for the next}} two decades) during the gold rush for use as sled dogs, especially in the [...] "All-Alaska Sweepstakes," [...] a 408-mile (657-km) distance dog sled race from Nome, <b>to</b> <b>Candle,</b> and back. Smaller, faster and more enduring than the 100- to 120-pound (45- to 54-kg) freighting dogs then in general use, they immediately dominated the Nome Sweepstakes. Leonhard Seppala, the foremost breeder of Siberian Huskies of the time, participated in competitions from 1909 to the mid-1920s.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the people}} who {{attempted}} the test explored other creative, but less efficient, methods to achieve the goal. For example, some tried <b>to</b> tack the <b>candle</b> <b>to</b> the wall without using the thumbtack box, and others attempted to melt some of the candle’s wax and use it as an adhesive <b>to</b> stick the <b>candle</b> <b>to</b> the wall. Neither method works. However, if the task is presented with the tacks piled next to the box (rather than inside it), virtually all of the participants were shown to achieve the optimal solution, which is self defined.|$|R

50|$|The {{category}} that CANDLE syndrome {{is a part}} of, along with related disorders, falls {{under the banner of}} proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes (PRAAS). The first one to be described was by Nakajo at Tohoku University in 1939, where he collected symptoms including skin lesions, clubbing of the fingers, and various thickening of heart walls. He termed the collective symptoms Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome (NKJO). Further symptoms were added onto the overall condition from work by Nishimura, with the overall symptoms being similar <b>to</b> <b>CANDLE</b> syndrome. A related syndrome was described by Garg et al. in 2010 and titled Joint contractures, Muscular Atrophy, Microcytic anemia, and Panniculitis-induced Lipodystrophy (JMP) syndrome.|$|E

With Baldy as his lead dog, Allan reached the podium eight times in the Sweepstakes, including three victories in 1911, 1912 and 1914.
