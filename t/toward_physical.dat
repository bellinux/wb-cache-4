2500|$|Obesity: Obesity is a {{paramount}} problem, {{especially among}} the poor and socially disadvantaged, in cities worldwide, according to the WHO (Hawkes et al., 2007; Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007). The increased amount of obesity can be contributed to the nutrition transition that describes how people are now increasingly turning to high-fat, sugar, and salt food sources because of their availability and price. [...] This food transition has fueled the obesity epidemic. This nutrition transition tends to start in cities because of [...] "greater availability, accessibility, and acceptability of bulk purchases, convenience foods, and 'supersized' portions" [...] (Dixon et al., 2007). [...] Physical activity and exercise is strongly determined by the design of cities, including density of homes, heterogeneous land uses, {{the extent to which}} streets and sidewalks connect, the walkability, and the provision of and access to local public accommodations and parks for recreation and play. [...] These factors, along with increasing reliance on cars, results in the shift of the population <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> inactivity, which damages health (Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007).|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine the {{influence}} of additional content from areas of mainstreaming and adapted physical education on preservice elementary educators attitudes toward teaching nonhandicapped and handicapped children in elementary physical education. To achieve this goal (a) an instrument was constructed to assess the attitudes of preservice elementary educators <b>toward</b> teaching <b>physical</b> education to handicapped and nonhandicapped children, and (b) an experiment was devised to influence the attitudes of the treatment groups. The Elementary Major's Attitude Toward Handicapped Scale (EMATH) was validated utilizing a jury panel and the method of equal-appearing intervals (Edwards, 1957). Twenty items were matched for cell placement to provide a. 74 split-half reliability coefficient adjusted by the Spearman-Brown Prophecy Formula (Gay, 1981). Sixty-four randomly selected elementary majors involved in student teaching, participated in the treatments. The main effects of school, group, and treatment were statistically analyzed using a three way analysis of covariance in a pretest-posttest design. As a result of the empirical findings of this study, the following conclusions were stated regarding development of positive attitudes in preservice elementary educators <b>toward</b> teaching <b>physical</b> education with handicapped and nonhandicapped children. 1. The application of cooperative learning rationale and models across curriculum lines help preservice elementary educators hold more favorable attitudes <b>toward</b> teaching <b>physical</b> education to handicapped and nonhandicapped children. 2.

50|$|An addiction, by definition, {{includes}} repeated compulsive {{behaviors that}} negatively affect daily living. There {{are two ways}} to classify addictive behaviors: substance addiction and process addiction. An exercise addiction is a type of process addiction, in which an individual's mood toward a certain event becomes dependent on addictive behaviors. Many educational, occupational, and social activities are stopped due to excessive exercising. Depression may develop if exercise is neglected or may result from reoccurring physical injuries that limit exercise. Exercise addiction is often related to obsessive-compulsive disorder as exercise addicts may have obsessions or compulsions <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> activity. Exercise addiction is also commonly associated with eating disorders as a secondary symptom of bulimia or anorexia nervosa. Approximately 39-48% of people that have an eating disorder are also addicted to exercise. When diagnosing bulimia, exercise addiction is referred to as a compensatory behavior and indicator of the underlying disorder. Research also shows exercise addiction influences not only the development of eating disorders but also their maintenance.|$|E
