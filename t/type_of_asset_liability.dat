40|$|Standard {{valuation}} methods do not {{lend themselves to}} bank holding companies. Banks create value through the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> they create (e. g., lending and deposit taking relationships). Bank income streams reflect heterogeneous sources of income which differ in their margins of profitability and persistence. Our approach to valuation permits potential differences in the composition <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>liabilities,</b> income and expenses, and in the profitability and persistence of different sources of income, to reflect themselves in estimated relationships that relate {{the composition of the}} balance sheet and income statement to bank value. Our approach explains substantial cross-sectional variation in observed market-to-book values, and residuals from cross-sectional regressions of market-to-book values are useful for predicting future stock returns. Predictable future variation in returns does not reflect priced risk factors, but is related to trading costs. ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) {{implemented}} SFAS 157 {{in order}} to expand disclosures about fair value measurements in financial statements. Fair-value accounting or [...] "Mark-to-Market" [...] is defined by FAS 157 as [...] "a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date". The definition {{is accompanied by a}} framework which categorize different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> into 3 levels, and their measurement varied accordingly. The hierarchy of fair value is:(1) <b>Assets</b> or <b>liabilities</b> whose values could be observed on an active market <b>of</b> identical <b>assets</b> or liabilities.(2) <b>Assets</b> or <b>liabilities</b> whose value could be quoted from an inactive market, or based on internal-developed models, with input data from observable markets of similar items.(3) Financial <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> whose values couldn't be quoted from an observable market but instead based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. This requires management estimation that may lead to manipulation.|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a new currency has often occurred {{as part of a}} program to fight hyperinflation. In this context, non-uniform conversion rates for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> have been used as a means of reducing an initial “excess” stock of liquidity. The paper examines the anticipatory dynamics associated with such reforms. The analysis suggests that monetary reforms <b>of</b> this <b>type</b> have a deflationary effect upon announcement as well as during the transition period. Under uncertainty about the reform date, the direction of the initial jump in prices upon announcement is a priori ambiguous. Upon implementation, a monetary reform leads to a downward jump in prices.

40|$|Problems of {{accounting}} {{and control over}} state property are considered in the article. The author examines the state as user of account information {{from the perspective of}} a typical large owner. Standardization {{of accounting}} and control are very important for the state as the owner like any large owner to providing adequate quality feedback. Paid attention t o the issues of standardization of accounting policies, the formation and synthesis of accounting information, the problem of mandatory accounting standard forms. The impact of these factors on the information provision of state property management is revealed. The author notes that the accounting policies in the public sector should ensure the unity of the procedures, the accuracy and consistency of information about the same <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities.</b> To do this, their availability, use and flow should be considered in the same forms of accounting documents. These forms must be defined, standardized in accounting policy. Subsystems of state property management at state enterprises, institutions, organizations level should enable the compliance with t he relevant standards ? accounting and control should be based on uniform principles. Nationwide registry of state property should be formed and its maintenance should be ensured authorized to exercise control in the sphere of state ownership central executive authority. And it should not be the registry of real estate. It should be real and full register, based on a result of the provision of accounting and monitoring the availability and condition of state property and on the base of common methodological principles. ??????????????? ???????? ??????????? ????? ? ???????? ??? ????????, ?????????????? ? ???????????? ????????? ??????????????? ?????????????. ????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????????. ??????? ???????? ???????? ??????????????, ??????? ????????, ???????????? ? ????????? ??????? ??????????, ???????? ?????????????? ??????? ???? ?????. ???????????? ??????? ??????????????? ???????? ?? ?????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ??????????????...|$|R
40|$|We examine {{changes in}} the market {{valuation}} of banking activities over the last decade, focusing {{on the effects of}} the financial crisis. Our valuation model recognizes that banks create value through the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> that they create and the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> risk they undertake (including their leverage, their lending risk, and their interest rate risk). The model also allows for heterogeneous bank income streams, dividend signaling effects, and changes in capitalization rates for income streams over time depending on changing market conditions. This approach explains substantial cross-sectional variation in observed market-to-book values, allowing us to identify the market pricing of various banking activities and changes in market pricing over time. We find that the declines in bank stock values since 2007 reflect declining values of various categories of banking activity and changes in market conditions. Dividend payments matter for market values increasingly over time. “Carry-trade” effects from taking on interest rate risk are also apparent. The effects of leverage on bank valuation changed sign during the crisis; while the market rewarded high leverage with higher market values prior to the crisis, leverage become associated with lower values during and after the crisis. Contrary to the view that the declines in market-to-book values for U. S. banks from 2006 - 2011 mainly reflect unrecognized losses, we find that other factors explain most of the decline in market-to-book ratios. Although model parameters do change over time, more than three-quarters of the change in market-to-book values that occurred from 2006 to the end of 2008 were predictable based on changes in fundamental determinants of value using the model coefficients estimated in 2006. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{financial}} integration on economic growth using an international panel data of 83 countries from 1974 - 2007. The effects of financial integration on economic growth differ considerably, depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> external <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> {{as well as on}} the characteristics of countries that experience financial integration. In particular, when we break down external liabilities into FDI and equity liabilities and debt liabilities, the former has a positive impact on economic growth, while the latter, especially public debt, has a negative impact. We also find in general that countries with good institutions and developed financial markets benefit morefromfinancial integration, and countries in Western Europe and North America as well as those in East Asia are more likely to meet these conditions. This paper then considers whether {{the effects of}} financial integration have changed over time. Finally, we provide some evidence that financial integration has an additional, indirect effect on economic growth through its impact on other determinants of growth such as the volume of international trade and the development of domestic financial markets...|$|R
