40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the recruitment and food composition of <b>thin-lipped</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet,</b> Liza ramada (Risso, 1826) juveniles in the estuary of the Neretva River {{in the southeastern}} Adriatic. Thin-lipped mullet appeared in the Port of Ploče in February. The relationships between total length, standard length, and weight showed a remarkably good fit to the expected allometric model, with b= 3 for total length. Twelve different animal food categories were identified. The greatest diversity was recorded in April at the Port of Ploče when 10 categories were present. In addition, six diatom taxa were noted. Harpacticoid copepods were the most common prey (39 %) in these samples, followed by insects (32 %) and cladocerans (12 %). All other prey accounted for less than 4 %. Insects represented 99 % of prey in the stomachs of specimens sampled from the freshwater Crna Rijeka River. Thin-lipped mullet juveniles were not found on sandy beaches or natural bays around the port. It thus appears that juveniles find the port area to be a habitat with the favorable characteristics of a brackish water nursery: of predators, lower salinity, and high food availability. These all promote better survival and recruitment {{in this area of}} the Croatian Adriatic...|$|E
40|$|The stomach {{contents}} of thin-lipped grey mullets Liza ramado were analysed {{in terms of}} granulometric composition and compared to the sediment of potential feeding areas in the Tagus estuary. Total organic matter (TOM) content and heavy metal content were determined in the surface sediment of three areas and eight trace elements were quantified: Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn. The three sampled areas {{did not differ in}} TOM; and the heavy metal content was below Effects Range-Low level for most elements. The mean observed concentrations were present in the following sequence: Zn > Pb > Cr > Cuz Ni> Co > Cd > Hg. Stomach contents granulometric composition provided information about the feeding selectivity of the mullets. Sediment fractions with particle size between 20 and 50 mm are preferred, independently of the fishes’ length. Smaller standard length (SL) fishes have a higher positive selection of fine grained sediments than those with a larger SL. Finer fractions usually have higher concentration of heavy metals, which makes younger specimens of the <b>thin-lipped</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> potentially more exposed to heavy metal load in the estuary. Metal concentration was not independent from the sampling point, presenting higher values near the margins and the estuary tidal drainage system. This means that during the first period of each tidal cycle, the mullets will feed first on the most contaminated areas, as a consequence of their movement following the rising tide to feed on previously exposed areas...|$|E
40|$|Fish were {{collected}} from the intake screens of the Oldbury Power Station in the Severn Estuary in each week between early July 1972 and late June 1977 and at least twice monthly between early January 1996 and late June 1999. The annual catches, after adjustment to a common sampling effort, demonstrate that the abundance of fish at Oldbury was far greater in the 1990 s than 1970 s, mainly due to marked increases {{in the numbers of}} certain marine species, such as sand goby, whiting, bass, <b>thin-lipped</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet,</b> herring, sprat and Norway pout. These increases may reflect the great improvement that occurred in the water quality of the Severn Estuary between these decades. The only species that declined markedly in abundance was poor cod. Modest declines in flounder and River lamprey paralleled those occurring elsewhere in the UK. The species composition in the two decades also differed, reflecting changes not only in the relative abundances of the various marine estuarine-opportunistic species, which dominated the ichthyofauna, but also in those of the suite of less abundant species in the estuary. The cyclical changes undergone each year by the species composition of the fish fauna of the Severn Estuary reflect sequential intra-annual changes in the relative abundances of species representing each of the marine, diadromous and freshwater categories. New approaches have been developed to test whether or not large sets of correlations between patterns of recruitment amongst abundant marine species (internal correlations), and between those patterns and salinity and water temperature within the estuary (cross-correlations), were significant. The correlation profile analyses found no evidence that the annual recruitment strengths of these species were either intercorrelated, or correlated with either one or a combination of both of the above environmental variables. Yet, the timings of the recruitment of these species into the estuary were intercorrelated, i. e. a slightly earlier or later than normal immigration by one species in a given year was paralleled by the same trend in other species. However, this association in recruitment times could be linked neither to salinity nor water temperature within the estuary, nor to a combination of these two variables. These results indicate that, while the factors that influence the annual recruitment strengths of the juveniles of different marine species vary, inter-annual differences in the phasing of events that regulate spawning times and/or larval dispersal influence, in the same direction, the times when marine species are recruited into the estuary...|$|E

Although belonged to {{euryhaline}} species, but information regarding their stress response on low temperature.

Therefore, the purpose of study was to investigate the effects of low water temperature on the stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> Mugil cephalus acclimated in freshwater. The blood samples of experimental fish (TL: 28. 2 ± 1. 1 cm, BW: 198. 6 ± 25. 9 g) were collected during winter season when the water temperature of controlled rearing system was stable at 25 °C and uncontrolled rearing system slowly dropped until 12 °C. Their stress response on both rearing systems was observed. The results showed that low temperature affected to lower the behavior activity and increase the stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets.</b> The breath frequency of <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> regarding their opercular movement at 12 °C was 74 - 97 breath/min., while at 25 °C it was 95 - 114 breath/min. Hematocrit (Ht) and hemoglobin (Hb) were shown higher values of 43. 5 % and 9. 5 g/dL, respectively at 25 °C than 12 °C (28. 0 % and 7. 1 g/dL, respectively). The tendencies of cortisol and glucose level increased with the lowering temperature, showing higher value of 264. 8 ng/mL and 35. 5 mg/dL in 12 °C than 5. 5 ng/mL and 32. 7 mg/dL in 25 °C. The chemical properties of blood in <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> showed same tendency comparing between 12 °C and 25 °C, there was no significant different between each temperature, except for chloride (P< 0. 05). Chloride value was higher at 25 °C, while other blood components such as osmolality, sodium, potassium, and magnesium were showing no significant differences. However, the results showed lower values at 12 °C in every blood components, except for chloride.

In four sites in Korea (Ansan, Yeosu, Tongyeong, and Busan) and two sites in Japan (Nagasaki and Fukuoka), serum VTG in immature and male <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> was detected at levels greater than 1. 0 μg/ml, which {{is considered to be}} an abnormal level.

Although individuals with testis-ova were found in Omuta, these fish expressed normal levels of serum VTG.
