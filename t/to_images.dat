Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared <b>to</b> <b>images</b> by Voyager 2. In particular, {{it seems that the}} Liberté arc might disappear in as little as one century.|$|E
5|$|It rained. The {{procession}} of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky. Yet the youth smiled, for {{he saw that}} the world was a world for him, though many discovered it to be made of oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst <b>to</b> <b>images</b> of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Christ in pictorial form was highly controversial {{in the early}} church. From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became popular in the Eastern Church. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted {{as a barrier to}} developments in the East, but by the ninth century, art was permitted again. The Protestant Reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections <b>to</b> <b>images</b> have tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans and Catholics and is a key element of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.|$|E

40|$|This review {{describes}} some of {{the recent}} developments in imaging aspects of pain in the periphery. It is now possible <b>to</b> <b>image</b> nerves in the cornea non-invasively, <b>to</b> <b>image</b> receptor level expression and inflammatory processes in injured tissue, <b>to</b> <b>image</b> nerves and alterations in nerve properties, <b>to</b> <b>image</b> astrocyte and glial roles in neuroinflammatory processes, and <b>to</b> <b>image</b> pain conduction functionally in the trigeminal ganglion. These advances will ultimately allow us to describe the pain pathway, from injury site to behavioral consequence, in a quantitative manner. Such a development could lead to diagnostics determining the source of pain (peripheral or central), objective monitoring of treatment progression, and, hopefully, objective biomarkers of pain...|$|R
40|$|Everyone {{knows that}} {{thousand}} of words {{are represented by}} a single image. As a result image search has become a very popular mechanism for the Web searchers. Image search means, the search results are produced by the search engine should be a set of images along with their Web page Unified Resource Locator. Now Web searcher can perform two types of image search, they are Text <b>to</b> <b>Image</b> and <b>Image</b> <b>to</b> <b>Image</b> search. In Text <b>to</b> <b>Image</b> search, search query should be a text. Based on the input text data system will generate a set of images along with their Web page URL as an output. On the other hand, in <b>Image</b> <b>to</b> <b>Image</b> search, search query should be an image and based on this image system will generate a set of images along with their Web page URL as an output. According to the current scenarios, Text <b>to</b> <b>Image</b> search mechanism always not returns perfect result. It matches the text data and then displays the corresponding images as an output, which is not always perfect. To resolve this problem, Web researchers have introduced the <b>Image</b> <b>to</b> <b>Image</b> search mechanism. In this paper, we have also proposed an alternate approach of <b>Image</b> <b>to</b> <b>Image</b> search mechanism using Histogram. Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures, 4 table...|$|R
5|$|Development on Gotcha {{began in}} July 1973, as Atari's fourth game after Pong, Space Race, and Pong Doubles. The company was {{interested}} in producing a very different game from their previous success of Pong, as they felt that innovative design was what would separate them from their competitors, which they saw as flooding the market with Pong clones rather than making new video games. After the release of Space Race, development immediately moved on to Gotcha. The design of the game was done by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong and developer for Space Race. Alcorn had {{the idea for the}} game from a defect he sometimes saw when testing Pong machines: if part of the circuit that converted scores <b>to</b> <b>images</b> on the screens was broken, then parts of the numbers would be scattered across the screen. Alcorn thought that combining that defect intentionally with a motion circuit could create dynamically changing mazes. A prototype design was developed by Steve Mayer of Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs often pledged various {{items of}} state regalia as {{collateral}} for loans throughout the Middle Ages. At {{some point in}} the 14thcentury, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London due to a series of successful and attempted thefts in a part of Westminster Abbey that housed state regalia. The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey. Arches topped with a monde and cross were added <b>to</b> <b>images</b> of StEdward's Crown by the time of HenryIV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor HenryV. Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Two researchers, Chris Bennett (1996) and David Peters (2000), {{have found}} pterosaurs to be protorosaurs or {{closely related to}} them. Peters used a {{technique}} called DGS, which involves applying the digital tracing features of photo editing software <b>to</b> <b>images</b> of pterosaur fossils. Bennett only recovered pterosaurs as close relatives of the protorosaurs after removing characteristics of the hind limb from his analysis, {{in an attempt to}} test the idea that these characters are the result of convergent evolution between pterosaurs and dinosaurs. However, subsequent analysis by Dave Hone and Michael Benton (2007) could not reproduce this result. Hone and Benton found pterosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs even without hind limb characters. They also criticized previous studies by David Peters, raising questions about whether conclusions reached without access to the primary evidence, that is, pterosaur fossils, can be held to have the same weight as conclusions based strictly on first-hand interpretation. Hone and Benton concluded that, although more primitive pterosauromorphs are needed to clarify their relationships, pterosaurs are best considered archosaurs, and specifically ornithodirans, given current evidence. In Hone and Benton's analysis, pterosaurs are either the sister group of Scleromochlus or fall between it and Lagosuchus on the ornithodiran family tree. Sterling Nesbitt (2011) found strong support for a clade composed of Scleromochlus and pterosaurs.|$|E

40|$|We {{determined}} the spatial {{resolution of the}} new very low energy transmission electron microscopy technique called eV-TEM [1] and used it <b>to</b> <b>image</b> gold nanoparticles deposited on graphene {{in order to determine}} whether it is possible <b>to</b> <b>image</b> for example DNA and proteins with low energy electrons. By transferring graphene to a flat grid with small circular holes in it we created new samples with flatter, less wrinkled graphene that make performing eV-TEM easurements on graphene easier and increase their quality. We improved the alignment of the imaging system of the microscope and {{determined the}} resolution of eV-TEM using the new samples <b>to</b> <b>image</b> graphene. We found a method to deposit 10 nm gold nanoparticles on graphene suitable for eV-TEM measurements and a method to deposit ferritin on graphene that we should be able <b>to</b> <b>image</b> as well. We conclude that the spatial resolution of the current set-up of eV-TEM is 10 nm and that it is possible <b>to</b> <b>image</b> gold nanoparticles deposited on graphene with eV-TEM. The cathode lens microscope called ESCHER was used <b>to</b> <b>image</b> gold nanoparticles on freestanding graphene with low energy electrons {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of imaging nanoparticles on graphene...|$|R
