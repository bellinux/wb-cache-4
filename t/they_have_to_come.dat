500|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the UFC planned five days of festivities (known as International Fight Week) leading up to UFC 148. International Fight Week {{is expected to be}} an annual July occurrence, coinciding with a Las Vegas UFC event. UFC President Dana White stated, [...] "The first annual International Fight Week will be awesome, the fans {{are going to have a}} fight week experience better than anything they've ever had before, and each year we are going to build this thing to the point where every fan on the planet knows <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to Vegas for this July fight week at least once in their lives." [...] The UFC Fan Expo (two days of fighter meet-and-greets, training seminars, a Grapplers Quest tournament, autograph sessions and other events) also occurred on July 6 and 7.|$|E

The marked for elimination penalty was discontinued in Season 12 of the U.S. version and was replaced by Speed Bump ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2002 {{season was}} the first in which Coulthard was the more {{experienced}} driver in his team. He was optimistic for the new season, saying: [...] "If they need an opinion then <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to me this year. In the past they didn't. But that said, it's important for me not to get bogged down in the history of what happened in the past. We just have to go forward." [...] He endured a torrid start: Coulthard's car suffered from gearbox issues and retired after 35 laps; and in the following race in Malaysia, both cars retired from engine failure after 24 laps. Two weeks later in the Brazilian Grand Prix, Coulthard secured his first podium of the season with a third-place finish. The start managed to get better as Coulthard took four consecutive finishes inside of the points; this included his only victory of the season in Monaco.|$|E

2500|$|UCI {{director}} Pat McQuaid urged team {{directors and}} the riders to take responsibility: [...] "The teams {{need to have}} {{more control over their}} riders.."They are the ones who need to clean out the riders who are iffy, they need to ensure they can guarantee that everyone of their riders is riding clean and riding fairly. The evidence {{is that most of the}} time these riders are dealing with individuals from outside their team and the sport whether it be pseudo doctors and chemists who are promising them things. That has got to stop. More and more riders...are speaking out and it's the younger generation of riders coming in that are going to be the future of the sport. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into a system that is completely ethically correct. But at the end of the day, the rider is the one who makes the decisions..We are in the process of changing that culture and it will change in time. We need to weed out the bad apples. I hope next year we have a Tour de France with no positive tests. We've had two bad Tour de Frances, we cannot afford a third." ...|$|E
2500|$|JR and Babe (now {{portrayed by}} Baker) become closer and reunite romantically. JR teams {{up with his}} father, Adam, just like old times. Their goal is to take down Fusion Cosmetics. JR tries to enlist Babe into their scheme. What JR does not know, though, is that Adam is {{secretly}} planning to ruin him in the process. JR and Babe bond, as Adam plans the ultimate takeover. Fusion Cosmetics is at a height of excellence and things are working wonderfully. Babe and JR decide to use [...] "Bella" [...] (a new perfume designed by Babe) to launch her career. They begin to plan their next wedding and decide {{to have a second}} child. Adam has a plan of his own with the assistance of Pete Cortlandt (Daniel Kennedy), who taints the Bella perfume at the launch party. Colby (Brianne Moncrief), JR's sister, gets sick, but no one notices that it is due to the perfume. Greenlee later gets sick, but calls it the flu. When a wedding party arrives at P.V. Hospital, Angie Hubbard says that it is a toxin in Bella that is causing the sickness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then shuts Fusion Cosmetics temporarily down. While Adam is encouraging lawsuits against Fusion, Babe resigns and tells the company to blame the Bella scandal on her. She also admits that she and JR were planning to take over. She has an ulterior motive, as her and JR are planning to move to San Diego anyway. However, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back when Adam has them subpoenaed to the Bella trial. JR and Babe do not make it to the trial, as they are caught up in a series of tornadoes that strike Pine Valley. Babe sacrifices herself to keep Little Adam from dying, making her internal and external bleeding worse. While in the hospital, she asks JR to marry her. They cannot find a minister as Babe is running out of time before she loses her life, but they exchange vows, regardless, alone in the hospital's chapel. They kiss, declare that they made each other better people and that they love each other from the deepest part of their souls; that their love will never stop, no matter what. After a light hug, Babe dies in JR's arms.|$|E
2500|$|After Richie's death, Fusion is at {{a height}} of excellence. During this time, Babe and Amanda, who have renewed their friendship, develop a [...] "secret project" [...] which they think Kendall and Greenlee will approve, since Fusion is doing so well. The project {{turns out to be}} a {{fragrance}} designed for working women. Kendall refuses to support it, but Amanda offers to use part of her fortune to finance the fragrance. Kendall insults Babe for the working girl perfume being modeled after her, and this is when Amanda decides to call the perfume [...] "Bella." [...] Kendall and Greenlee let Amanda and Babe do the project on their own, and the perfume has high buzz. Amanda and Babe get into a little argument about which woman should be the promotional figure for Bella, in which Babe and Amanda want themselves on it. They ask Kendall, who could not care less, who then chooses Amanda. Amanda takes it as a compliment before Kendall says how the [...] "slutty" [...] look should appeal. Amanda organizes a launch party which goes well, except for Taylor Thompson killing Randi Morgan's pimp in the bathroom hallway. Things are working wonderfully, and JR and Babe decide to use Bella to launch her career, and they decide they should take over the company. They also begin to plan their next wedding and decide to have a second child. However, Adam has a plan of his own with the assistance of Pete Cortlandt who taints the Bella perfume at the launch party. Colby gets sick, but no one notices that it is due to the perfume.

60|$|Here however, in {{reference}} to much that there is in Mahomet and his success, we are to remember what an umpire Nature is; what a greatness, composure of depth and tolerance there is in her. You take wheat to cast into the Earth's bosom; your wheat may be mixed with chaff, chopped straw, barn-sweepings, dust and all imaginable rubbish; no matter: you cast it into the kind just Earth; she grows the wheat,--the whole rubbish she silently absorbs, shrouds it in, says nothing of the rubbish. The yellow wheat is growing there; the good Earth is silent about all the rest,--has silently turned all the rest to some benefit too, and makes no complaint about it! So everywhere in Nature! She is true and not a lie; and yet so great, and just, and motherly in her truth. She requires of a thing only that it be genuine of heart; she will protect it if so; will not, if not so. There is a soul of truth in {{all the things she}} ever gave harbor to. Alas, is not this the history of all highest Truth that comes or ever came into the world? The body of them all is imperfection, an element of light in darkness: to us <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> embodied in mere Logic, in some merely scientific Theorem of the Universe; which cannot be complete; which cannot but be found, one day, incomplete, erroneous, and so die and disappear. The body of all Truth dies; and yet in all, I say, there is a soul which never dies; which in new and ever-nobler embodiment lives immortal as man himself! It is the way with Nature. The genuine essence of Truth never dies. That it be genuine, a voice from the great Deep of Nature, there is the point at Nature's judgment-seat. What we call pure or impure, is not with her the final question. Not how much chaff is in you; but whether you have any wheat. Pure? I might say to many a man: Yes, you are pure; pure enough; but you are chaff,--insincere hypothesis, hearsay, formality; you never were in contact with the great heart of the Universe at all; you are properly neither pure nor impure; you are nothing, Nature has no business with you.|$|E
