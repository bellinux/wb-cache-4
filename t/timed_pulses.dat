Some researchers have even tried using 1-bit precision (i.e. putting the emphasis entirely on spatial information in vision tasks).

The eruption, which {{attracted the attention of}} hundreds of thousands of stranded flight passengers in Europe, consisted of multiple closely <b>timed</b> <b>pulses</b> (e.g., Langmann et al. 2011; Dellino et al. 2012; Gudmundsson et al. 2012) that merged at a higher altitude in a continuous eruption column. We perform an analysis of images from videos of 502 pulses that were recorded during the period 8 to 10 May (see also Figure  1). Both the position of the video camera (at the summit caldera rim, 850 m to the northwest of the vent) and good visibility conditions facilitated near-field analyses of the early expansion phase as well as the identification of individual ejecta trajectories.|$|E

This sequence generator has additional features that make it ideal for use in acquiring the waveforms when a storage oscilloscope is used as the recording device. For avoiding the clutter caused by many waveforms being recorded at the same place on an oscilloscope screen such features as displacements of waveforms in the X and Y directions and trace blanking at places where the waveform is not required, have been incorporated. This sequence generator has been employed to acquire a sequence of Raman scattered radiation signals from an adiabatically expanding saturated vapour probed by a flashlamp-pumped dye laser...|$|E
40|$|Modification of {{essential}} bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) containing cell walls {{can lead to}} antibiotic resistance, for example β-lactam resistance by L,D-transpeptidase activities. Predatory Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus are naturally antibacterial and combat infections by traversing, modifying and finally destroying walls of Gram-negative prey bacteria, modifying their own PG as they grow inside prey. Historically, these multi-enzymatic processes on two similar PG walls have proved challenging to elucidate. Here, with a PG labelling approach utilizing <b>timed</b> <b>pulses</b> of multiple fluorescent D-amino acids (FDAAs), we illuminate dynamic changes that predator and prey walls go through during the different phases of bacteria:bacteria invasion. We show formation of a reinforced circular port-hole in the prey wall; L,D-transpeptidaseBd mediated D-amino acid modifications strengthening prey PG during Bdellovibrio invasion and a zonal mode of predator-elongation. This process is followed by unconventional, multi-point and synchronous septation of the intracellular Bdellovibrio, accommodating odd- and even-numbered progeny formation by non-binary division...|$|E

40|$|On February 11, 2000, {{the space}} shuttle {{endeavour}} lifted off to tackle an ambitious mission: make the most comprehensive map ever of planet Earth. The successful 11 -day Shuttle Radar Topography Mission produced the most complete terrain map of the world. Radar inteferometry was used to derive surface elevation by calculating the differences between measurements taken from slightly different locations. The payload consisted of a main antenna and an electronics package in the shuttle 2 ̆ 7 s payload bay with an outboard antenna {{at the end of}} a 200 f mast extended once the shuttle is in orbit. Maintaining the planned orbital profile was crucial to guarantee complete coverage of the entire land coverage with no gaps between radar swaths. Orbital maintenance was accomplished during trim maneuvers executed approximately once per day. Maneuver design was constrained significantly by the presence of the delicate 200 f mast. During the flight, seven trim burns were performed using a ?fly-cast? maneuver which required a set of precisely <b>timed</b> <b>pulses</b> to minimize loading on the mast. All maneuvers were successful and kept the orbit within required limits.

40|$|Stem {{cells and}} their {{relationship}} with mature tissues are of increasing interest in the biomedical sciences, but the dynamics of stem cell/tissue interactions are not well understood. We give a generic stem cell/tissue model and examine the dynamics of a specific case of this, namely, a fourcompartment model of blood cell production and regulation. We apply the findings to cyclical neutropenia and periodic chronic myelogenous leukemia, two diseases of the blood production system. We track {{the position of the}} Hopf bifurcation believed to give rise to blood cell oscillations in these diseases. Results account for the variable success of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, a common treatment for cyclical neutropenia, in reducing oscillations. The model displays bistability of periodic solutions, presenting the opportunity to stabilize the system through a temporary perturbation that induces switching between locally stable solutions. It is found that oscillations can be suppressed by properly <b>timed</b> <b>pulses</b> of increased amplification in the platelet line. The medical interpretation of this result is that temporary administration of thrombopoietin may suppress the oscillations. Though it is neutrophil oscillations that characterize both diseases clinically, and though it is probably a destabilization in the neutrophil line that initiates the oscillations, pulses in the neutrophil amplification do not effectively suppress oscillations...|$|E
40|$|Changes in intrathoracic {{pressure}} (ITP) {{can influence}} cardiac performance by affecting ventricular loading conditions. Because both systemic venous return and factors determining left ventricular (LV) ejection may vary over the cardiac cycle, phasic increases in ITP may differentially affect preload or afterload if delivered at specific points within the cardiac cycle. We studied the hemodynamic effects of cardiac cycle-specific increases in ITP (pulses) delivered by a high-frequency jet ventilator in an acute closed-chested canine model (n = 11), using electromagnetic flow probes to measure biventricular stroke volume. Measurements were taken during a control condition after the induction of acute ventricular failure (AVF) by propranolol hydrochloride and volume infusion. ITP was independently varied without changing lung volume by the inflation of thoracoabdominal binders. Although synchronous pulses had minimal hemodynamic effects in unbound controls, binding pulses timed {{to occur in}} early diastole resulted in decreases in LV filling pressure and left ventricular stroke volume (SVlv) (P less than 0. 05). In the AVF condition, pulses increased LV performance, evidenced by increases in SVlv (P less than 0. 01), despite decreases in LV filling pressure (P less than 0. 05). This effect is maximized by binding and by timing the pulses to occur in systole. We conclude that cardiac cycle-specific increases in ITP can significantly affect cardiac performance. These effects appear {{to be related to}} the ability of such <b>timed</b> <b>pulses</b> to selectively affect LV preload and afterload...|$|E
