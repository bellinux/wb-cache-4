The view that the literary interventions of late nineteenth-century female writers - particularly writers of scholarly interpretation - were often positioned outside the established public sphere of letters and ideas, characterised as inconsequential (Robinson, xi), or in terms of 'threatening otherness' (Schwab, xi-xv) is also explored.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the neurological effects of residual ground-water levels of thiacloprid on the non-target organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Nematodes treated with thiacloprid showed a dose-dependent and significantly increased twitch response at concentrations above 50 ng mL- 1 that disabled their forward locomotion in liquid culture. In comparision with untreated controls, 10 ng mL- 1 thiacloprid perturbed the chemosensory ability of C. elegans such that the nematodes no longer demonstrated positive chemotaxis towards a NaCl chemo-attractant, reducing their chemotaxis index from + 0. 48 to near to zero. Nematodes also exhibited a locomotion characteristic of those devoid of chemo-attraction, making significantly more pirouetting turns of ≥ 90 ° than the untreated controls. Compared to the untreated controls, expression of the endocytosis-associated gene, Rab- 10, was also increased in C. elegans that had developed to adulthood {{in the presence of}} 10 ng mL- 1 thiacloprid, suggesting <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> increased recycling of affected cellular components, such as their nAChRs.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the contemporary role of critical academic accountants. Arguably, academics {{have been to}} some extent {{cut off from the}} "real world" writing fairly inaccessible papers for each other. Critical accounting academics are certainly concerned with theory but too often they try to develop <b>their</b> theory without <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> the outside world. This could have had the effect of making them rather pessimistic about their own agency and the potential for social reform. The paper draws upon the academic and political work of Pierre Bourdieu 1 as an illustration of an academic who has managed to fuse theory and practice in a more optimistic manner. Critical accounting in Scotland is considered from this perspective. The case of the Clydebank asbestos sufferers is highlighted as an example of where critical accounting researchers might like to test their theoretical skills. The paper also discusses the campaign to end tuition fees in Scotland and the Centre for Social and Environmental Research which is based in Glasgow...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim of this}} open-label {{trial was}} to assess the outcomes, {{acceptability}} and helpful aspects of a pluralistic therapeutic intervention for depression. Design: The study adopted a multisite, non-randomised, pre-/post-intervention design. Methods: Participants experiencing moderate or more severe levels of depression (as assessed by a score of 10 or greater on the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, PHQ- 9) were offered up to 24 weeks of pluralistic therapy for depression. This is a collaborative integrative practice oriented around shared decision making on the goals and methods of therapy. Of the 42 participants assessed, 39 (92. 9 %) completed two or more sessions. Participants were predominantly female (n = 28, 71. 8 %) and white (n = 30, 76. 9 %), {{with a mean age of}} 30. 9. The principal outcome indicator was improvement and recovery on the PHQ- 9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 -item (GAD- 7) scale. Results: Of the completer sample, 71. 8 % of clients (n = 28) showed reliable improvement and 43. 6 % (n = 17) showed reliable recovery. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) from baseline to endpoint were 1. 83 for the PHQ- 9 and 1. 16 for the GAD- 7. On average, the clients found the PfD sessions helpful and experienced their therapists as flexible and practising in a collaborative manner. Clients felt that change had been brought about by <b>their</b> own <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> therapy and through the therapist’s relational qualities, as well as their use of techniques. Conclusions: Initial indications suggest that pluralistic therapy for depression has adequate outcomes, retention rates, and levels of acceptability.

BibliographyStudent {{teachers}} {{are faced with}} the challenge of adapting their teaching so as to accommodate active learning through self-assessment, peer assessment and reflection. The objectives of the study were therefore to explore how active learning may be enhanced through self-assessment, peer assessment and reflection. The participants in the study were second- and third-year students at Rundu Campus of the University of Namibia. The research employed a case study design with qualitative data and using a descriptive, contextual approach. Semi-structured interviews, focus-group interviews and observations were utilised to obtain data. Once consent was obtained from the relevant authorities, second- and third-year student teachers were interviewed. Ethical requirements were adhered to throughout the research process. The findings indicated that students had both positive and negative perceptions in respect of self-assessment, peer assessment and reflection in promoting <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> learning. Overall, the findings of the study revealed positive signs that active learning can be enhanced by student teachers through the use of strategies such as self-assessment, peer assessment and reflection.

Well-defined gold and silver nanoparticles ranging within the 2 – 100  nm size and coated with antibodies have been reported to regulate the process of membrane receptor internalization leading to down regulate cellular expression level. This in turn alters the signalling processes and subsequently cellular responses, which are essential for basic cell functions. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that nanoparticles of 40 and 50  nm size have greater effects not only due to their passive interaction with biological entities or cells but also due to <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> mediating the molecular processes that are essential for regulating cellular activities [67]. In another study, ferromagnetic nanomaterials of three different sizes (300, 150 and 30  nm) were investigated for their intrinsic peroxidase-like catalytic activity. Interestingly, these nanomaterials displayed different levels of activity towards studied substrate, wherein smaller sized ferromagnetic nanomaterial revealed higher catalytic activity in the order of 30  >  150  >  300 nm; since smaller particles have greater surface-to-volume ratio to interact with substrates [68].|$|E
40|$|Dominant {{transactional}} sex literature attribute Nigerian female university students’ <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> transactional sex to mostly their structures. In contrast, {{this thesis}} argues that both structure and agency are instantaneously implicated in transactional sex. To corroborate this stance, Giddens’ structural duality construct {{is adapted to}} Stones’ reconstruction of structuration theory for empirical research and used to interrogate, synthesize and re-orientate Nigerian transactional sex literature. Based on the analytical device of the students’ context and conduct analysis, findings strongly indicate that components of the students’ analytical external structure, such as gender structure, patterns their internal structure or habitus, such as their sexual scripts, which suggests that women depend on men for financial and material security in exchange for sex. The students’ own knowledgeability about, and orientation toward transactional sex in turn, informs <b>their</b> agencies or <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> transactional sex, which produces intended outcomes, such as the students’ acquisition of luxury goods, which enhances their social status on campus, and/or unintended outcomes, such as poor grades. These outcomes filter back into society through socialisation, peer ideologies and adaptation, which (un) intentionally renews the transactional sex structuration cycle. Essentially, findings corroborate this thesis claim that structure and agency are simultaneously implicated in female Nigerian university students’ transactional sex – {{in a manner that}} grants neither structure nor agency instigative primacy...|$|R

The international students make up 17. 3 percent (OECD 2007) of all the university enrolment, and some {{universities have}} much more international student enrolments than the average. From a truly internationalisation perspective, however, there is far more demand of integration with Australian students and international students, the internationalising learning content and context. There have not been much discussion and effort of understanding and practicing of internationalising the learning context from international students’ cultural background and internationalised learning environment. There are many factors which interfere with internationalisation in the learning context such as English proficiency, culture difference and academic staff unawareness. This paper argues the concepts of cultural dimensions and the characteristics of CMC (Computer-Mediated Communication) in a multicultural learning context of Australian higher education.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} inform practitioners and other professionals working with couples in an educative or therapeutic context. Key messages 	Recent increases in the availability of longitudinal data, combined with developments in analytical techniques and an upturn in interest in learning from longer-lasting couple relationships, have enabled researchers to gain a deeper understanding into the complexities of couple relationships. 	Factors underlying the complexity of couple relationships as they evolve over extended periods of time are likely to respond to prevention and early intervention strategies targeted at couples in the early stages of <b>their</b> relationships. 	An <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> behaviours that are supportive of the relationship is needed to maintain relationship stability - simply wanting the relationship to continue is not enough. 	Similarities between partners, and viewing partners through rose-coloured glasses, appears to support marital satisfaction, although there are some differences in this between men and women. 	Relationship quality has an impact on health in later life therefore investing in the quality of the couple relationship can be of benefit to health promotion and intervention strategies.

40|$|Street {{names in}} city maps may be {{interpreted}} as traces of memory practices and politics, and can clearly be identified as the products of hegemonic norms and values of a given time and place. In the following article we describe a project-oriented teaching unit for secondary school students. In {{the course of the}} project, students are instructed to research either their school or residential neighborhoods, looking at the persons and events commemorated and written into the city. These toponymic inscriptions can be analyzed by studying the naming practice of streets and squares. Which people and events are remembered and which are forgotten? Do these events and people indicate processes of social inclusion, exclusion, marginalization, and discrimination? Investigating naming practices will be the starting point for the students to develop their own naming suggestions, as well as encouraging <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> further negotiation processes regarding naming practices in their towns and villages.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{educational}} programs in sustainability science has paralleled {{the rise of the}} field itself. The educational approach of these programs follows the problem-driven, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary nature of the field itself. However, its effectiveness has yet to be systematically evaluated. Similarly, while ad-hoc evaluation schemes have attempted to monitor the quality of the educational programs, there is no standard method that accounts for the particularities of sustainability science programs. This study thus addresses the need for an assessment of the problem-driven approach of educational programs in sustainability science. We have conducted student self-assessments of field courses in the Graduate Program in Sustainability Science (GPSS-GLI) at The University of Tokyo, which positions its field courses at the center of its curriculum. The self-assessments were based on five key competencies identified as particularly important for sustainability professionals. Workshops and questionnaires engaged students in a reflection of the six field courses and of their own personal development through the activities offered. Our questionnaire results indicate that the majority of participants were satisfied with how the courses furthered their personal development. While some participants expressed frustration at being unable to sufficiently address the respective field's sustainability challenges due to time constraints, students generally recognized the five key competencies as important for addressing sustainability issues after participating in the courses. Moreover, participants attributed much of their learning to <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> planned field research activities, rather than to passive learning. Variations in results across different course units provide material for further analysis and development of the curriculum. This study is an initial attempt at assessment, with room for ongoing improvement and further research to address additional requirements for fostering the next generation of sustainability professionals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{continuing}} {{gap between}} the number of people requiring treatment for substance use disorders and those receiving treatment suggests the need to develop new approaches to service delivery. Meanwhile, the use of technology to provide counseling and support in the substance abuse field is exploding. Despite the increase in the use of technology in treatment, {{little is known about the}} impact of technology-supported interventions on access to services for substance use disorders. The E-TREAT intervention brings together the evidence-based practice of Motivational Interviewing and theories of Persuasive Technology to sustain clients' motivation to change substance use behaviors, provide support for change, and facilitate continuity across treatment settings. Methods This study used descriptive statistics, tests of statistical significance, and logistic regression to explore the characteristics and perceptions of the first 157 people who agreed to participate in E-TREAT and the predictors of <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> E-TREAT services. In addition, responses to open-ended questions about the participants' experiences with the intervention were analyzed. Results The data reveal that clients who engaged in E-TREAT were more likely than those who did not engage to be female, have children and report a positive relationship with their recovery coach, and were less likely to have completed treatment for a substance use disorder in the past. A majority of people engaging in E-TREAT reported that it was helpful to talk with others with similar problems and that the program assisted them in developing a sense of community. Conclusions The authors conclude that technology-assisted interventions hold promise in expanding access to treatment for substance use disorders especially for women and parents. Further, the characteristics of the relationship with a coach or helper may be critical to engagement in technology-supported interventions. Additional investigation into ways technology may be useful to enhance treatment access for certain subgroups is needed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This {{article focuses}} on {{identity}} as a parent in relation to parenting and psychological functioning in middle age. Design. Drawn from the Jyväskylä Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development, 162 participants (53 % females) with children (age 36), represented the Finnish age-cohort born in 1959. Parental identity was assessed at ages 36, 42, and 50. Results. In both women and men, parental identity achievement increased from age 36 to 42 and remained stable to 50. The level of parental identity achievement was higher in women than in men. Achievement was typical for women and foreclosure for men. Participants’ education, occupational status, and number of offspring were not related to parental identity status. As expected, parental identity achievement was associated with authoritative (indicated by higher nurturance and parental knowledge about the child’s activities) parenting style. No significant associations emerged between parental identity foreclosure and restrictiveness {{as an indicator of}} authoritarian parenting style. The diffused men outscored others in parental stress. Achieved parental identity was related to generativity in both genders and to higher psychological and social well-being in men. Conclusions. At present, many parenting programs are targeted to young parents. This study highlighted the importance of a later parenting phase at around age 40, when for many, the children are approaching puberty. Therefore, parenting programs and support should also be designed for middle-aged parents. Specifically men may need additional support for <b>their</b> <b>active</b> consideration and <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> the fathering role...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} {{international}} development interventions influence {{the way women}} perceive empowerment. It does so by looking at aid relationships and the relevance of development interventions. It involves {{a case study of}} Oxfam’s Restoring Coastal Livelihoods Project (2010 - 2015) in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Efforts to empower women have been channeled through various approaches. However, little has been said about the practice of aid relations within projects and how aid relations work through the ‘aid chain’ and influence women’s perceptions of empowerment. Also, there has not been much said about how, in the intersectionality of aid relationships, women make ‘empowerment’ their own, appropriate it, transform it, adapt it to their stories and needs through <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> projects. The qualitative research which involved a five-month period of ethnographic research found that women beneficiaries perceived empowerment mostly based on their experiences in the project. However, the degree of empowerment is relative to the types of women’s engagement, the nature of activities, and their general understanding of gender relations. The project has brought economic-driven gender awareness by facilitating women’s practical and strategic needs through economic groups. It has also brought empowerment consequences which went beyond the economic dimension. The research highlights the importance of personal, relational, and multidimensional aspects of empowerment in women’s perceptions of empowerment. Efforts to empower women seem to still rely on external intervention to facilitate the process and to deal with existing dynamics of power relations. The findings reassert that women’s empowerment requires enabling internal and external environments to promote women’s awareness of, and capacity for, empowerment. Finally, the thesis underlines that empowerment depends highly on women’s personal experiences, awareness, agency, resources, choice, willingness, and commitment. This research contributes to our understanding of women, aid, and development as it highlights the multidimensional and multi-layered aspects of aid relations and women’s empowerment...|$|E
40|$|Ethiopian rural {{women make}} {{significant}} contribution to agriculture and are the mainstay of the farm labor. They work {{in all aspects of}} agriculture. In addition to <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> agriculture, women are responsible for all household chores. Despite their immense contribution to the agriculture, rural women often face difficulties than men in gaining access to agricultural information. The Ethiopian agricultural extension system suffers from a number of weaknesses in its services for rural women. There is, therefore, an alarming need to improve agricultural extension work with the rural women. Therefore, this study is intended to analyze the agricultural information network of farm women; to identify factors influencing farm women’s information network output and to identify the constraints and opportunities of extension services in reaching out to women in Dale Woreda, Sidama Zone, SNNPR. Three stages sampling were used in which both non-random sampling and random sampling procedures was followed to select four Peasant Associations and 160 respondents. Structured interview schedule was used for collecting the essential quantitative data from the sampled respondents. To generate qualitative data, field observations; informal interview with key informants; discussion with separate focus groups of women and men farmers were conducted. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistical tools and also χ 2 = test, Cramer’s V, Pearson’s Correlation coefficient & Multiple Linear Regression were employed. The result of the study shows that, neighbors or friends are the major and the most important source of information for the farm women. The major output of the study indicates that knowledge of dairy farming practice of women farmers was significantly influenced by communication skill, interpersonal trust, social participation, total annual income, extension participation, empathy of respondents and access to credit. The major constraints identified in agricultural information network of farm women were low participation of women in extension programs; poor access to credit; absence of market information and alternative market for products; extension methods contribute less as source of information. Therefore, it is recommended that, the extension system operating in the area, need to be strengthened further to increase the flow of information to women for rural transformation.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Predicting export performance remains an important issue {{at the heart of}} export research and management. This is because of the primary role of exporting to ensuring the profitability, growth and survival of firms. Given these and other benefits that firms stand to gain (and the challenges that firms face) for <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> exporting, scholars have exerted efforts into explaining the causes of export success. Export marketing strategy, firm characteristics, capabilities and firms’ orientations towards export markets are some the variables studied. Firms’ entrepreneurial orientation towards export markets has been one important variable that has captured the attention of researchers. This study is an attempt to introduce an export context-specific entrepreneurial-oriented behaviour (or export EOB) to the study of antecedents of export performance. A theoretical model involving the relationship between export EOB (and its dimensions) and export performance is, therefore, developed and empirically tested using data from 212 exporting organisations. Findings suggest that firms’ overall level of export EOB is a major driver of export success. The study further establishes that a high level of market-oriented behaviour in exporting organisations can help firms to derive stronger benefits from their entrepreneurial activities. At the specific level of the export EOB components, results suggest that development of novel product innovations, high export risk-taking, and strong proactive and competitively aggressive behaviours can help exporting organisations to improve their performance. However, product innovation intensity and autonomy are negatively related to export performance, suggesting that high levels of these two behaviours might lead to poor export performance. Nevertheless, further analysis shows that the negative association between product innovation intensity and export performance becomes positive when moderated by product innovation novelty. In addition, the study shows that autonomy has indirect positive association with export performance through interaction with proactiveness and competitive aggressiveness. In other words, autonomy facilitates the effectiveness of proactive and competitive aggressive behaviours. Further analyses of moderating effect relationships reveal mixed results. Specifically, the study finds that export market orientation positively moderates the link between production innovation intensity and export performance. In addition, export customer dynamism positively moderates the association of product innovation novelty and risk-taking with export performance. On the contrary, export customer dynamism negatively moderates the link between product innovation intensity and export performance. Theoretical, export managerial and policy implications of these findings are discussed and useful areas for future research are proposed...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this thesis is a {{regulatory}} innovation termed co-regulation: a mode of regulation that includes formal involvement of both state and non-state actors. Its emergence and development {{is the result of}} two broad and significant changes {{in the nature of the}} statehood: the emergence of the regulatory state and the shift from government to governance. In the regulatory state, the dominant mode of intervention in economy and society is regulation, thus forms such as co-regulation are used to ‘govern’ or ‘steer’ the society. In addition, with the shift to governance, there is a greater reliance on non-state actors to perform this ‘steering’. Since co-regulation is used to implement public policy objectives, which has traditionally been the role of government departments, but it implies formalized and substantive role of non-state actors, it is a qualitatively new regulatory development that justifies research interest into its nature. Consequently, it should be evaluated as any other form of governance: to what extent it can be described as democratic, and precisely this is the basis for the normative framework developed for this thesis that has been used as a tool to evaluate the nature and quality of co-regulation. One of the basic premises of this research is that any form of governance should have as its ultimate goal the achievement of public interest objectives. It has been further argued that public interest objectives can be achieved only if institutional structures of regulatory bodies enable transparency, deliberative participation by the citizens, and enable citizens to hold the regulators to account. Only by providing such structures, co-regulatory bodies would empower the citizens to be the ultimate authority and could thus be considered a democratic form of governance. The case studies chosen to evaluate whether this normative ideal has been achieved in practice comprise three different bodies: Ofcom, ASA and ATVOD. What has in particular been looked at is the way Ofcom handled the delegation of regulatory functions to ASA and ATVOD, and the way these bodies dealt with the regulation of 3 alcohol ads and product placement. These studies involve an element of controversy and conflicting interests and as such represent the most suitable test in order to determine whether the possibilities offered by co-regulation to be a truly democratic form of governance have been achieved. The main conclusion reached is that, mainly due to NPM reforms, citizens are confined to the role of the consumers, where <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> is seen <b>in</b> terms of complaints and regulators are held accountable for the level of service they provide in handling these complaints. However, this does not empower the citizens. Therefore, it appears that Ofcom, ASA and ATVOD are not characterized by institutional structures that would enable democratic governance: there are no transparent institutional structures that would enable the public to perform the role of the citizens and deliberate regarding regulatory decisions and hold Ofcom, ASA and ATVOD to account. The institutional structures modelled on the premises of corporate governance are not empowering citizens, but are instead creating consumers...|$|R
40|$|User-generated videogaming: Little Big Planet and {{participatory}} cultures Background Digital technology {{users are}} growingly {{involved in what}} has been described as convergence culture (Jenkins, 2006) or participatory cultures. Following Jenkins et al (2009), a participatory culture is a culture with strong support for creating and sharing one’s creations (…). A participatory culture is also one in which members believe their contributions matter, and feel some degree of social connection with one another (p. 3). In this context, a major role is played by user-generated content, a cultural and social phenomenon that has been studied by a number of scholars (among others, Baldwin et al, 2006; Shirky, 2008; Burgess, Green, 2009). Social Network Sites, as firstly defined by boyd and Ellison (2007), are powerful environments for socially negotiated content sharing, where consumer-participatory practices have to be related to user's identity performances and self presentation strategies. Games scholars have underlined the social dimensions related to gaming practices. According to Yee (2007), social aspects {{play a major role in}} explaining gaming motivations, ranging from socializing, to relationship and teamwork (Yee, 2007, p. 6). Few scholars have hitherto analysed consumer co-creation and consumer-participatory cultures related to gaming practices, mainly focusing on MUD/MMORPG “modding” strategies. Moreover, empirical research on this topic is rare (Banks, Pott, 2010). Key purposes, method and research questions The aim of our proposal is to contribute filling this gap by analysing the participatory practices related to Little Big Planet 1 (LBP), a PlayStation platform videogame which enables players to create and share user-generated gaming levels. The PlayStation Network plays a major role in sharing user's creations, while hundreds of videos showing user-generated levels are to be found on YouTube. More specifically, the key purposes of this contribution are: (RQ 1) understanding the characteristics of the phenomenon (to what extent are users likely to actively engage in productive practices? Are socio-demographic characteristics influencing their inclination towards participatory practices?); (RQ 2) understanding whether user's cultural consumptions are related to <b>their</b> <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> content co-creation; (RQ 3) understanding to what extent digital literacy (as defined, among others, by Livingstone 2003; Jenkins et al, 2009; Van Deursen, van Dijk, 2010) is related to user's active engagement in LBP; (RQ 4) understanding if a more socially oriented attitude to digital technology is related to user's active engagement in LBP. For these purposes, specific indexes have been created in order to operationalise the following concepts: “active LBP engagement”; user's “digital literacy”; user's “cultural consumption levels”; user's “socially oriented attitude to digital technology”. Our contribution refers to the empirical findings of a broader research project aiming at studying the relations between gaming and Social Network Sites, conducted by Sapienza University of Rome in partnership with Sony Computer Entertainment Italy. We both used quantitative and qualitative methods, sending to all italian PlayStation Network user an invitation to respond to a 39 -question survey and organizing four focus group, both in-presence and online. A total of 8829 respondents completed the questionnaire (only completed questionnaires have been taken into account for the present analysis). Some quick highlights from our findings Out of the 8829 respondents, 3054 are LBP users (34, 6 %). Younger people (15 - 19; 20 - 24) are more likely to show higher levels of “active LBP engagement”. Higher levels of cultural consumption are related to higher levels of “active LBP engagement”. Digital literacy and a socially-oriented attitude to digital technology also appear to be neatly related to “active LBP engagement”. Moreover, 651 out of 3054 LBP users (21 %) have created and shared at least a game level. Compared to the total of the respondents (both LBP users and non-users), 7, 4 % of PlayStation Network users are active content creators: a percentage that appears to be higher than what generally reported in recent literature regarding user-generated content...|$|E

Distress and neuroticism were assessed at three months after diagnosis while protective buffering and <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> were assessed at three, nine and 15 months after diagnosis. Results indicate small but significant decreases in protective buffering and <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> over time. Moreover, initial distress and neuroticism {{were found to be}} strongly and positively related to protective buffering at all three measurements. In addition, less distress was associated with more <b>active</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>in</b> especially individuals scoring relatively low on neuroticism, but only at 3 months after diagnosis.
