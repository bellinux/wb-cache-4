40|$|ABSTRACT. Energy use and {{efficiency}} of a commercial, cross-flow dryer were measured when drying rough rice {{across a range of}} ambient conditions and drying air temperatures. Four tests were conducted during the 2011 harvest season using rice with initial moisture contents ranging from 19. 0 % to 21. 7 % wet basis and three tests were conducted during the 2012 harvest using rice with initial moisture contents from 15. 4 % to 18. 3 %. To obtain <b>thermal</b> energy <b>requirements</b> in terms of energy per unit mass water removed, the energy consumed by the burner was divided by the total amount of water removed. In addition, electrical energy requirements were determined by multiplying the average power draw of the fan motor by the fan operating duration. Thermal energy efficiency was calculated by dividing theoretical energy requirements by the measured <b>thermal</b> energy <b>requirements.</b> <b>Thermal</b> energy <b>requirements</b> to dry rice ranged from 6, 900 to 9, 670 kJ/kg water removed in 2011 and from 8, 810 to 9, 620 in 2012. Electrical energy use, which ranged from 300 to 400 kJ/kg water removed in 2011 and from 410 to 630 in 2012, accounted for ~ 4 % to 5 % of the total energy used to dry rice. <b>Thermal</b> energy <b>requirements</b> were linearly correlated to the difference between drying air temperature and ambient temperature and linearly and inversely correlated to the amount of water removed per mass dry matter.

40|$|Abstract. Thin-film {{coatings}} {{have the}} capability of obtaining {{a wide range of}} thermal radiative properties, but the development of thin-film coatings can sometimes be difficult and costly when trying to achieve highly specular surfaces.

The utilization of thin-film coatings is one process of choice for meeting challenging <b>thermal</b> control <b>requirements</b> because of its ability to provide a wide variety of s= " ratios. The radiative properties of thin-film coatings can be tailored to meet specific <b>thermal</b> control <b>requirements</b> through the use of different metals and the variation of dielectric layer thickness.

This study had the objective to evaluate phenology and thermal demand of the grape cultivars Bordô, Concord, and BRS Carmem on rootstocks Paulsen 1103, IAC 766, and VR 043 - 43. The experiment was conducted in a family owned vineyard in Campo Largo, Paraná State, Brazil. The vineyard was carried out on ridges with semi-trellis in ‘T’ systems conducting (Geneva Double Curtain trellis). The evaluations were assessed during the production cycles of 2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013. The phenology was evaluated with a scale of 13 phenological stages. The thermal demand was defined by calculating the degree-days accumulation (DD) from bud swelling until harvest stage. The cultivar BRS Carmem had the longest cycle, being influenced by the rootstock, IAC 766 e Paulsen 1103 showed opposite results for cycle time. The cultivar Concord was more stable; there was no influence of rootstock on the cycle or of the thermal demand on the two harvests.

More than 25 fossil localities have yielded Late Pleistocene beetle assemblages, comprising more than 300 species, of which about 147 are predators and scavengers, groups which are suitable for paleoclimatic reconstruction.

40|$|Impacts {{of climate}} change on European {{agricultural}} production, land use and the environment depend on its impact on crop yields. However, many impact studies assume that crop management remains unchanged in future scenarios, while farmers may adapt their sowing dates and cultivar <b>thermal</b> time <b>requirements</b> to minimize yield losses or realize yield gains. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the sensitivity {{of climate change}} impacts on European crop yields, land use, production and environmental variables to adaptations in crops sowing dates and varieties' <b>thermal</b> time <b>requirements.</b> A crop, economic and environmental model were coupled in an integrated assessment modelling approach for six important crops, for 27 countries of the European Union (EU 27) to assess results of three SRES climate change scenarios to 2050. Crop yields under climate change were simulated considering three different management cases; (i) no change in crop management from baseline conditions (NoAd), (ii) adaptation of sowing date and <b>thermal</b> time <b>requirements</b> to give highest yields to 2050 (Opt) and (iii) a more conservative adaptation of sowing date and <b>thermal</b> time <b>requirements</b> (Act). Averaged across EU 27, relative changes in water-limited crop yields due to climate change and increased CO 2 varied between − 6 and + 21 % considering NoAd management, whereas impacts with Opt management varied between + 12 and + 53 %, and those under Act management between − 2 and + 27 %. However, relative yield increases under climate change increased to + 17 and + 51 % when technology progress was also considered. Importantly, the sensitivity to crop management assumptions of land use, production and environmental impacts were less pronounced than for crop yields due to the influence of corresponding market, farm resource and land allocation adjustments along the model chain acting via economic optimization of yields. We conclude that assumptions about crop sowing dates and <b>thermal</b> time <b>requirements</b> affect impact variables but to a different extent and generally decreasing for variables affected by economic drivers...|$|R
