To destroy the Church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics {{that resulted in the}} deaths of thousands, including several priests who were also knights of Columbus. Known as the Mexican martyrs, <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> been canonized.|$|E

25|$|Many athletes that {{compete in}} this event also compete {{individually}} in the Olympic 200 metres {{and with their}} national teams in the Olympic 4×100 metres relay. Nine men have achieved the 100 metres and 200 metres 'Double' at the same Olympic Games - Archie Hahn (1904), Ralph Craig (1912), Percy Williams (1928), Eddie Tolan (1932), Jesse Owens (1936), Bobby Morrow (1956), Valeriy Borzov (1972), Carl Lewis (1984), and Usain Bolt (2008, 2012, 2016). Four of these men were also members of the winning team in the 4x100 meters relay at the same games - Jesse Owens (1936), Bobby Morrow (1956), Carl Lewis (1984), and Usain Bolt (2008, 2012, 2016).

25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

25|$|As the war intensified, the {{situation}} grew worse, and some prisoners remained in chains {{for months at}} a time, receiving little food or medical attention. Complaints about the conditions in the prison prompted an investigation by Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, who wrote President Abraham Lincoln in April 1864 that Lt. Col. John F. Marsh found the prison conditions to be unacceptable. The report detailed Marsh's first hand account of the prison, stating: The prison which is used for the detention of citizens, prisoners of war {{on their way to the}} North, and the United States soldiers awaiting trial and which is located in a large block of stores is represented as the filthiest place the inspector ever saw occupied by human beings. The whole management and government of the prison could not be worse! Discipline and order are unknown. Food sufficient but badly served. In a dark wet cellar I found twenty-eight prisoners chained to a wet floor, where they had been constantly confined, many of them for several months, one since November 16, 1863, and are not for a moment released even to relieve the calls of nature. With a single exception <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> had no trial.In April 1864, an officer reported to War Secretary Edwin Stanton of the shockingly inhuman conditions that the prisoners were kept in, leading to Stanton dismissing Captain Williams from his post. However, General Grant intervened on Williams' behalf, and Williams was reinstated as prison commandant. After Williams returned to the prison, and after the removal of Hurlbut from command, Williams dissolved the extortion ring and resolved to clean up the prison. In July 1864, the prison was officially designated a U.S. Military Prison.|$|E

One signalman in particular had his rate taken away from him for an act against a senior petty officer, the whole of which, it is believed, arose from the irritability and mental fatigue from their long tour of duty.|$|E

But Balaam replied: [...] "Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, big or little, contrary to the command of the Lord my God." [...] Nonetheless, Balaam invited the dignitaries to stay overnight to let Balaam find out what else God might say to him, and that night God told Balaam: [...] "If <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> come to invite you, you may go with them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} Rundstedt's efforts {{was shown in}} October 1946, when the IMT handed down its verdicts. Keitel and Jodl were to hang, but the Army high command {{as a whole was}} acquitted. The verdict read: [...] "According to the indictment, this group {{consists}} of about 130 officers who held certain positions in the military hierarchy between 1938 and 1945... The Tribunal does not find that they were an organisation... They were only an aggregation of those who happened to hold high rank in a certain period... <b>These</b> <b>men</b> <b>have,</b> however, been a disgrace to the profession of arms, and they have made a mockery of obedience to orders. They were a ruthless military caste, and where guilty of crimes should be brought to trial as individuals." [...] Thus the possibility was left open that Rundstedt could still face individual prosecution for his actions.|$|E

He was replaced just days after his death by W.J. Moore, a chemist who had worked under him at the plant. Following his death, McClung was memorialized by several of his former teammates and officials. When [...] "Big Bill" [...] Edwards wrote and published his book Football Days, he included McClung in his tribute to deceased college football players. He wrote that: [...] "Richard Harding Davis and [...] were two Lehigh men whose position in the football world was most prominent. The esteem in which they are held by their Alma Mater is enduring". Edwards also praised McClung and Dashiell's refereeing, stating that [...] "Officials come and go. <b>These</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> had their day, but no two ever contributed better work. The game of Football was safe in their hands". Paul Dashiell, when interviewed by Edwards' for Football Days, spoke about his relationship with McClung. He said that: ...|$|E
