500|$|Included in the Australian squad to tour England in 1888, Trott was {{selected}} in the team for the First Test at Lord's. He had an inauspicious Test debut: he made a duck in the first innings and three runs in the second, and did not bowl. [...] The Australians won the game by 62runs, only their second Test match victory in England. [...] However, England retained The Ashes by winning the remaining two Tests and Trott's influence on the series was negligible: he did not pass 20 in an innings, and he failed to take a wicket. [...] Nevertheless, his performances in the other matches of the season prompted Wisden Cricketers' Almanack to write that he, [...] "...fully justif his selection by scoring the highly creditable total of 1,212runs, {{with an average of}} over 19 per innings", and that his fielding was [...] "excellent at point". [...] Wisden was less complimentary about his bowling: [...] "We have no great opinion of Trott's leg break bowling, and <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> too slow to be effectual against good batsmen." [...] Trott's opportunities were limited as his teammates Charles Turner and John Ferris, [...] "monopolised the bowling".|$|E
2500|$|Although workers {{compensation}} laws deny workers {{the right}} to sue their employer, it is possible for them to sue a related third party. Within a week of the explosion Williams Bailey, a law firm based in Houston, Texas, placed half-page advertisements in a local newspaper. The adverts read [...] "Were you seriously injured in last week's explosion?", and directed potential clients to the company website. The advert also claims that the firm has extensive experience in explosion-related cases. Fran Deisinger, director of the Milwaukee Bar Association, said of the ad [...] "It's a little disconcerting because it's such a terrible situation here that I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> rubs everybody a little wrong,", adding that although he believed the ad to be in poor taste, it didn't breach any rules for lawyer advertising. Although it is unclear whether any workers contacted Williams Bailey, it is known that at least one injured man, and the families of the deceased, have hired personal injury lawyer Bob Habush to represent them, who once before worked on a high-profile industrial case when three people {{died as a result of}} a crane collapse in 1991.

60|$|In {{the same}} mail with your letter, arrived the {{enclosed}} from Orme the motor man. You will observe {{that he has}} an office. I will explain {{that this is a}} law office and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> does him as much good to have a law office without anything to do in it, as it would another man to have one with an active business attached. You see he is on the electric light lay now. Going to light the city and allow me to take all the stock if I want to. And he will manage it free of charge. It never would occur to this simple soul how much less costly it would be to me, to hire him on a good salary not to manage it. Do you observe the same old eagerness, the same old hurry, springing from the fear that if he does not move with the utmost swiftness, that colossal opportunity will escape him? Now just fancy this same frantic plunging after vast opportunities, going on week after week with this same man, during fifty entire years, and he has not yet learned, in the slightest degree, that there isn't any occasion to hurry; that his vast opportunity will always wait; and that whether it waits or flies, he certainly will never catch it. This immortal hopefulness, fortified by its immortal and unteachable misjudgment, is the immortal feature of this character, for a play; and we will write that play. We should be fools else. That staccato postscript reads as if some new and mighty business were imminent, for it is slung on the paper telegraphically, all the small words left out. I am afraid something newer and bigger than the electric light is swinging across his orbit. Save this letter for an inspiration. I have got a hundred more.|$|E

50|$|Its {{appearance}} is not known, {{because of the}} fragmentary nature of its fossil remains. It possibly resembled modern gorillas, because of its supposedly similar lifestyle. Some scientists, however, <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> looked more like its closest modern relative, the orangutan. Based on the upper estimates, Gigantopithecus possibly had few or no enemies when fully grown. However, younger, weak, or injured individuals may have been vulnerable to predation by tigers, pythons, crocodiles, machairodonts, hyenas, bears, and Homo erectus. Based on the lower estimates, however, even fully grown individuals may have been vulnerable to predation by the animals mentioned above other than pythons and hyenas.|$|E

50|$|At {{a minimum}} mass of 1.7 Earth masses, {{it is one}} of the least massive extrasolar planets {{discovered}} around a normal star, and relatively close in mass to Earth. At an orbital distance of just 0.03 AU km from its parent star, however, it orbits further in than the habitable zone. It is unlikely to possess an atmosphere due to its high temperature and strong radiation from the star. Although scientists <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> has a rocky surface similar to Earth, it is also likely to experience intense tidal heating similar to (and likely more intense than) that affecting Jupiter's moon Io.

He replied, Look, I can understand why the tent embassy was established all those years ago. I think {{a lot has changed}} for the better since then. We had the historic apology just a few years ago, one of the genuine achievements of Kevin Rudd as prime minister. We had the proposal which is currently for national consideration to recognise indigenous people in the Constitution.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we have taken}} {{a good look at}} the concept of fraud, using theory and {{examining}} frauds that have happened in two large companies. The main purpose of this paper was to gain insight on the concept of fraud, to see why fraud is committed and who has responsibility to prevent fraud. We have seriously considered the auditor’s job, to see what part he plays in preventing fraud. We have found that fraud is somewhat common in the business world and <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> will continue to be a serious problem. In the beginning of this century several major accounting scandals were revealed. This publicity has prompted increased focus on the problem of business fraud. In response, a new regulatory framework is developed, we think that this framework is good, but it will likely not be sufficient to prevent fraud entirely. In this paper we have looked at fraud that involves management, thinking this kind of fraud is more difficult to prevent than fraud committed by employees. When management commits fraud, it is often committed by strong personalities. These persons are often very hard to stop with rules. If they have the desire to commit fraud, they can often find ways to break rules. The auditor has a certain responsibility to prevent fraud, but we have come to think that he can not be held responsible if he is doing his job properly. There are always many other people in position to detect fraud, employees and the Board of Directors. They can be good resources in the fight against fraud. We think that these parties can find support for their effort to prevent fraud, not only through formal structures of regulations but also from increased awareness of how to recognize circumstances that give opportunity for fraudulent actions...|$|E

Just before one or other slid under the alehouse table, Burbage looked at Shakespeare and said, 'I can play anything you write - anything at all'. And Shakespeare said, 'Right, I'll fix you, boy', and wrote Othello for him. I'm sure something like that must have happened.|$|R
