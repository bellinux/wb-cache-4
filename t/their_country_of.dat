5|$|A {{small number}} of Australian volunteers fought {{on both sides of}} the Spanish Civil War, {{although}} they predominantly supported the Spanish Republic through the International Brigades.

5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{adopted a}} system of {{economic}} liberalism in Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to obtain}} the trust and confidence of foreign investors, most notably the French. The advantages granted by the investment laws he established in 1959 allowed foreign business to repatriate up to 90% of their profits in <b>their</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin (the remaining 10% was reinvested in Côte d'Ivoire). He also developed an agenda for modernising the country's infrastructure, for example, building an American-style business district in Abidjan where five-star hotels and resorts welcomed tourists and businessmen. Côte d'Ivoire experienced economic growth of 11–12% from 1960 to 1965. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew twelvefold between 1960 and 1978, from 145 to 1,750billion CFA francs, while the trade balance continued to record a surplus.|$|E

40|$|Jagdish Bhagwati's {{proposal}} for a ‘brains tax’ to be levied on the incomes of the diaspora from developing countries residing {{in the developed countries}} and the proceeds to be remitted to the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin of the diaspora is well known. In recent years the voluntary contributions or remittances from the diaspora to <b>their</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin have often been higher than the aid monies given to these countries. It is now increasingly recognised that the diaspora may have an active role to play in the development process <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin. They are not only a source of funds; they are also a rich source of skills and know-how. This paper analyses the potential of the diaspora as agents <b>of</b> change in <b>their</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin and argues that the social rate of return to a unit of diaspora investments may be higher than that for a unit of foreign direct investment from non-diaspora sources...|$|R
