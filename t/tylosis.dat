50|$|Leukoplakia {{could be}} {{classified}} as mucosal disease, and also as a premalignant condition. Although the white color in leukoplakia is a result of hyperkeratosis (or acanthosis), similarly appearing white lesions that are caused by reactive keratosis (smoker's keratosis or frictional keratoses e.g. morsicatio buccarum) are not considered to be leukoplakias. Leukoplakia could also be considered according to the affected site, e.g. oral leukoplakia, leukoplakia of the urinary tract, including bladder leukoplakia or leukoplakia of the penis, vulvae, cervix or vagina. Leukoplakia may also occur in the larynx, possibly in association with gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Oropharyngeal leukoplakia is linked to the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and sometimes this is associated with <b>tylosis,</b> which is thickening of the skin on the palms and soles of the feet (see: Leukoplakia with <b>tylosis</b> and esophageal carcinoma).

40|$|ELKRATOSIS palmaris et plantaris (<b>tylosis)</b> {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be an inherited disability of a comparatively trivial kind. That it sometimes may have a sinister significance is shown by this study of two Liverpool familiea with <b>tylosis,</b> in which 18 members have developed carcinoma of the oesophagus. A preliminary letter on the subject has already appeared in the British Medical Journal (Clarke, Howel-Evans, and McConnell, 1957). Tyloais 1. General features. <b>Tylosis</b> is one of many forms of dyskeratosis which have been well classified by Cockayne (1933). Its most conspicuous feature is great thickening of the skin of the palms and soles, and hyperhidrosisis also commonly present. Rarely the condition is confined to the soles. Microscopically there is general hypertrophy of all the layers of the skin, the epidermis being chiefly affected; in addition there is hypertrophy of the sweat glands and their ducts (Cockayne, 1933). In many patients with the abnormality the horny epidermis is shed at intervals in large flakes, or as a complete cast of the palm or sole, and this takes place as a rule every autumn; it leaves a red, tender surface, which soon becomes overgrown again with thick epidermis (Cockayne, 1933). 2. Associated abnormalities are rare. Cockayne (1933) quoted Hanhart, who described a Swiss family, the affected members of which developed <b>tylosis</b> at the age of 15 years and multiple lipomata at the age of 22. Cockayne com-mented that the late age at which the <b>tylosis</b> appeared made it doubtful whether it was the ordinary form of the disease. Many other abnormalities have been described in association with <b>tylosis</b> in isolated patients, but genetic linkage was not demonstrated in any of these cases. We have found no reports in the literature of an association between <b>tylosis</b> and mn. lignA. nt disease of other parts of the body, although Sequeira, Ingram, and Brain (1947) mentioned a case in which epitheliomatous change occurred in the skin of a tylotic patient's hand. ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), {{along with}} some other members of Fagaceae, are {{susceptible}} to sudden oak death caused by the oomycete Phytophthora ramorum. Symptoms of the disease include dying crowns, bleeding cankers, and eventually death of infected trees. The cause of mortality is not well understood, but recent research indicates that stem water transport is reduced in infected trees as compared to healthy trees. Possible mechanisms for reduced hydraulic conductivity include the presence of fungal structures in xylem vessels or tyloses. In this study, the spatial and temporal development of tyloses was studied in relation to water conductivity of P. ramorum-infected sapwood. A log inoculation experiment and a field inoculation experiment using live tanoak trees were conducted. In the log experiment, <b>tylosis</b> development in xylem was compared at several sites in non-inoculated and P. ramorum- inoculated logs at two, four, and seven weeks. Inoculated logs showed {{no significant difference in}} <b>tylosis</b> frequency at two weeks, but had a significantly higher frequency of tyloses than the non-inoculated logs after four weeks. At seven weeks, the frequency of tyloses was lower than non-inoculated logs. In the field inoculation experiment, trees inoculated with P. ramorum and non-inoculated trees were harvested after five and 14 months. Sapwood tissue was excised from specific sections of each harvested tree and specific conductivity and <b>tylosis</b> development were measured. Inoculated trees with xylem infections had a significantly higher frequency of tyloses as compared to wounded, non-inoculated trees. An increase in tyloses in tanoak sapwood was associated with a decrease in specific conductivity, suggesting that tyloses induced by the infection of P. ramorum may interfere with sapflow in the tree stem. At 14 months, <b>tylosis</b> development was affected in tissues further away from the inoculation site as compared to five months, paralleling the vertical spread of infection. This pattern suggests that large, mature cankers might contain numerous tyloses and could significantly impede the transport of water in diseased trees...|$|E

40|$|Keratin 16 (K 16) is a cytoskeletal {{scaffolding}} protein highly expressed at pressure-bearing {{sites of}} the mammalian footpad. It can be induced in hyperproliferative states such as wound healing, inflammation and cancer. Here we show that the inactive rhomboid protease RHBDF 2 (iRHOM 2) regulates thickening of the footpad epidermis through its interaction with K 16. K 16 expression is absent in the thinned footpads of irhom 2 (-/-) mice compared with irhom 2 (+/+) mice, due to reduced keratinocyte proliferation.

Treatment of the stems with inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis (aminoethoxyvinylglycine) and/or action (silver thiosulfate) delayed and greatly reduced the formation of tyloses in xylem tissue and the size and number of those that formed in individual vessels. Our data are consistent with the hypotheses that wound ethylene production is the cause of tylose formation and that embolisms in vessels are not directly required for wound-induced <b>tylosis</b> in pruned grapevines. The possible role of ethylene in the formation of tyloses in response to other stresses and during development, maturation, and senescence is discussed...|$|E

As early as day 5 in culture, IAA enhanced the formation of secondary xylem from vascular cambial cells, whereas it did not induce phloem production. Xylem production increased with the duration of culture, and "meristematization" of the ray cells and ray distortion occurred, The cambial cells also produced callus with xylogenesis, Late in culture, in the de novo formed secondary xylem, nests of non-lignified cells were observed. Polyphenol deposition in some vessels and <b>tylosis</b> were also observed, suggesting the presence of persistently high levels of IAA in the xylem region.

Mass attacks of trees by an ambrosia beetle (Platypus quercivorus) are {{characteristic}} before appearance of the wilting symptoms. This study investigated the pathogenic effects of a fungus detected specifically in the wilting trees. This hyphomycete fungus,Raffaelea sp., has a distribution that correlates with the discolored xylem area called wound heartwood in which vessels are dysfunctional. <b>Tylosis</b> formation around the hyphae indicates vessel dysfunction. In areas with discoloration, the fungal hyphae were invading living ray parenchyma cells from the vessel lumen. As a protective reaction the ray cells exuded yellow substances into the vessels, but these substances seemed ineffective against the fungal activity, probably because the fungus disperses along the beetle's gallery before enough substance can accumulate. It should allow wide discoloration in sapwood. Cambium was not necrotic around the fungus. The cytological process in the host was as follows: (1) synthesis of secondary metabolites by the stimuli of oak fungus; (2) exudation of yellow substances into vessels; and (3) dysfunction of vessels and wound heartwood formation. In regard to wilting of trees, the pathogenicity of the fungus should be assessed by its ability to stop sap flow.|$|E

We show that the distribution of RHBDF 2 in tylotic skin is altered in comparison with that in normal skin, and immortalized tylotic keratinocytes have decreased levels of total epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and display an increased proliferative and migratory potential relative to normal cells, even when normal cells are stimulated with exogenous epidermal growth factor. It would thus appear that EGFR signaling is dysregulated in tylotic cells. Furthermore, we also show an altered localization of RHBDF 2 in both tylotic and sporadic squamous esophageal tumors.
