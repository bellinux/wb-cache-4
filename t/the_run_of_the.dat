Throughout <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show, the animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo.

5|$|Fielding's thirteenth play, The Modern Husband, first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 {{nights at}} Drury Lane, rivalling <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Provok'd Husband and Zara for {{production}} length. Although early-20th-century critics {{believed that the}} play could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and {{the plot of the}} play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot deals with a man selling his wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.|$|E

5|$|Much of Colbert's {{personal}} life {{was reflected in}} his character on The Colbert Report. With the extended exposure of the character on the show, he often referenced his interest in and knowledge of Catholicism, science fiction, and The Lord of the Rings, as well as using real facts to create his character's history. His alternate persona was also raised in South Carolina, is the youngest of 11 siblings and is married. The actual Colbert's career history in acting and comedy, however, was often downplayed or even denied outright, and he frequently referred to having attended Dartmouth College (which was {{at the forefront of}} the conservative campus movement in the 1980s) rather than his actual alma mater, Northwestern. In July 2012, Colbert added two years to his contract with Comedy Central, extending <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Colbert Report until the end of 2014.|$|E

In addition, the Ask the Expert lifeline was sponsored by Skype for its live audio and video feeds.|$|E
