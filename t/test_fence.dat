We report a case study examining effectiveness of a baited electric fence, as an addition to an existing single woven-wire fence (2. 4 m high), for altering behavior and reducing fence-line contact between elk (Cervus elaphus). We used a video-surveillance system to monitor one 20 -m-long <b>test</b> <b>fence</b> at an elk ranch in north-central Colorado, USA from 2006 to 2007. We conducted 26 trials (11 without electric fence during 48. 2 total cumulative days and 15 with electric fence during 63. 7 days) with different levels of motivation for contact between groups of elk separated by the <b>test</b> <b>fence.</b> We documented 426 contacts between elk (direct transmission risk) or the woven-wire fence (indirect transmission risk) during trials without the electric fence. We documented 0 contacts between adult elk or the woven-wire fence during trials when the electric fence was in place. During our case study, 24 of 25 elk exposed to the electric fence were completely deterred. We emphasize that our approach targets behavior modification of farmed elk routinely exposed to the electric fence, not wild elk that may occasionally approach from the outside. Our results suggest that adding a baited electric fence inside an existing woven-wire–fenced enclosure has potential to provide a cost-effective means to minimize contacts between farmed and wild elk...|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} fence {{has been used}} as a data transmission medium in Gallagher Products for a number of years. This has allowed the energizer to be remotely controlled and, with the current generation, to monitor the performance of the fence remotely. Very little investigation has been conducted into determining the optimum frequency bands to transmit in to give optimum performance. We propose that the fence spectrum be split into three frequency bands. A Fence Pulse Guard Band which extends from DC to 10 kHz, a Low Frequency Channel which extends from 10 kHz to 250 kHz, and a High Frequency Channel which extends from 250 kHz to 10 MHz. The fence frequency response is dependent on the length of the fence and is dominated by transmission line effects and radiative losses. For the <b>test</b> <b>fence,</b> the spectrum up to 250 kHz is flat without any frequency selective fading. Above 250 kHz, the spectrum is very unstable and the frequency selective fading can exceed 15 dB. Operating in this region requires an advanced system to utilise the available bandwidth. The impedance of the human operator in the system is best characterised as a fractional capacitor in series with a resistor. Higher frequencies are attenuated less up to 10 MHz after which the impedance is dominated by the resistance. The impedance of an insulating joint is best characterised as a capacitor in series with a resistor. Higher frequencies are attenuated less and are the preferred method for reducing the effect of insulating joints. The Low Frequency Channel is suitable for less robust systems which cannot tolerate frequency selective attenuation. The High Frequency Channel is suitable for robust systems which prioritise performance. We present a number of possible solutions for improving the efficiency of the modulation and error correction strategies. Solution 3 utilising Phase Shift Keying (PSK) with eight symbols and Trellis Code Modulation (TCM) is recommended as the first solution to be implemented and evaluated. A forward error correction strategy as outlined in Solution 1 is also recommended for implementation first. This research suggests that the {{electric fence}} system could be significantly improved in performance and reliability using the methods mentioned above but at some cost...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Recently the National Park Service has {{proposed}} raising fence heights to exclude mouflon sheep (Ovis musimon) from conservation areas at Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. Concern over previous mortality of Hawaiian Petrels (Pterodronia sandwichensis) due to collision with fences prompted {{this study to}} quantify the potential effects of raising fence heights on this critically endangered seabird. Avian perception and navigation capabilities were researched, and vision was judged to be the dominant sense that Hawaiian Petrels may use to detect and avoid fences. Previous studies and the techniques they {{used to assess the}} risk of bird collision with obstructions were also reviewed. In the current study, we used behavior to quantify the ability of Hawaiian Petrels to detect and avoid fences, and the relative collision risk of three different fence designs. We observed night-time flight behavior of Hawaiian Petrels using night vision goggles in a breeding colony display area for seven weeks during the summer of 2003. We recorded petrel behavior around three simulated fence designs: (1) a 1. 2 -m hogwire fence, (2) a 1. 8 -m hogwire fence, and (3) a 1. 8 -m hogwire fence with white flagging added for visibility. We also recorded behaviors during a control observation period, when no fence was present, to represent the natural flight behavior of the birds. Fences used during the trials were made of surrogate materials to mimic hogwire fencing, including 13 -cm square fabric netting and padded bamboo poles that would not harm the birds, should they collide with them. Because collisions with fences were rare, we quantified the risk of petrels colliding with each simulated fence by counting the number of passes attempted below fence height, as evidenced by late avoidance behaviors and collisions. We compared the proportions of late avoidance behaviors and collisions among fence types to investigate the effects of fence type on fence strike risk. Counts during the control period were a measure of the proportion of passes when birds were at risk of colliding with fences of different heights during unobstructed flight. Hawaiian Petrels {{were significantly more likely to}} attempt to pass at heights above ground level below fence height when no fence was present (during the control period) than when the 1. 2 -m fence or 1. 8 -m simulated fences were present. This result indicates that although petrels flew below fence height when no fence was present, they were able to detect and avoid 1. 2 -m and 1. 8 -m fences in their flight path. However, one petrel did collide with the simulated 1. 2 -m fence on a foggy night, suggesting that Hawaiian Petrels may have more difficulty avoiding fences during poor visibility conditions. There was no significant difference in the likelihood of Hawaiian Petrels to exhibit late avoidance behaviors and collisions between the two fence heights. Therefore, the 1. 2 -m and 1. 8 -m simulated fences apparently posed similar fence strike risk to birds. There was a suggestive difference in the likelihood of petrels to exhibit avoidance behaviors and collisions between flagged and unflagged fences. This suggests that Hawaiian Petrels were able to detect and avoid flagged fences at greater distances, possibly reducing fence strike risk. We also investigated the effect of fence orientation relative to slope on petrel avoidance behavior. Fence orientation had no detectable effect on the proportion of late avoidance behaviors and collisions exhibited by displaying Hawaiian Petrels. However, investigations into the effect of fence orientation may be more appropriate when studying behavior of petrels commuting to or from breeding colonies rather than that of displaying birds following circuitous flight paths. In conclusion, fences help to protect essential habitats of native species and pose little risk to displaying Hawaiian Petrels. Fence strike risk for this critically endangered species may be further minimized by adding visible materials, such as white flagging, during construction. The methods developed in this study could be used to <b>test</b> <b>fence</b> designs proposed for future construction, particularly designs that would exclude both introduced predators and feral ungulates from Hawaiian Petrel breeding habitat...|$|E

Mean deer intrusions at treated sites in both 1 - and 2 -choice tests were < 1 /day while control site intrusions were 84 – 86 /day. Mean corn consumption by all wildlife (e. g., deer, raccoons [Procyon lotor], fox squirrels [Sciurus niger]) differed between treated (< 2 kg/day) and control sites (15 kg/day). Based upon the results of this test and the cost of ElectroBraid™ we conclude that this fence, under the conditions of this five week test, was an effective and economical deer barrier. The ElectroBraid <b>fence</b> <b>test</b> was part of a research project, the objective of which was to evaluate the efficacy of ElectroBraid brand electric fencing at reducing deer visitation to a feeding site. The Federal Aviation Administration funded the project as part of a line item within an overall budget examining scare devices for use at airports...|$|R

40|$|Delivery {{of dynamic}} {{intensity}} modulated beams requires extensive knowledge of Multi Leaf Collimator (MLC) position accuracy and reproducibility, since when accurate leaf positioning is lost, significant dose delivery errors can occur. The leaf speed of motion and the transmission are also parameters that highly influence the dose {{delivered to the}} patient. The 2009 report of the AAPM Task group 142 [1] provides an excellent review of MLC Quality Assurance (QA) issues. During the past years radiographic films {{have been widely used}} for checking the accuracy of the MLC positioning. However, the use of an Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) can be very helpful in saving time for daily routine tests, providing images with high spatial resolution, quickly obtained, directly digitalized and stored in a workstation. Dosimetry Check (Math Resolutions, LLC, Columbia, MD, U. S.), is a commercial software for pre-treatment dosimetric verification, in vivo-dosimetry and also MLC QA. The aim of this work is to redact a QA protocol for the Elekta Agility MLC, based on EPID images analyzed with the commercial software Dosimetry Check (DC). First of alls a test to validate EPID measurements of leaf position was performed with a Diode detector: the same field was acquired with Diode and EPID and the leaf position measurements were compared for 10 leaf pairs by using a Matlab code. The difference resulted to be less than 0. 8 mm for all the analyzed leaves. Leaf position accuracy was checked with Garden <b>Fence</b> <b>test</b> acquisitions at the four cardinal gantry angles, while short term and long term reproducibility were respectively tested with 5 Garden <b>Fence</b> <b>test</b> acquisitions repeated in one day and 6 acquisitions repeated in a time interval of 70 days. All the EPID images were analyzed with DC. For what concern the reproducibility, each leaf position resulted to differ from its average value less than 0. 3 mm for the short term repeated measurements and less than 0. 4 mm for the long-term ones. For the Garden <b>Fence</b> <b>test</b> at different gantry angles, the maximum difference between the measured and the prescribed position was 0. 8 mm, except for 270. The radiation field dimension was checked by acquiring 6 different square fields, and comparing the measured and the prescribed dimensions. EPID acquisitions were analyzed with DC, and measurements resulted to be always within 1 mm on one side compared to the prescription. The average MLC transmission was measured, for all the beam energies (6 MV, 10 MV and 15 MV), by acquiring a rectangular field and dividing the signal measured under the MLC with that measured {{at the center of the}} field. The measured transmission was < 0. 5 % for all the energies, according to the Elekta specifications. A swipe acquisition, with a rectangular field translating along the X direction, was used as leaf speed test. Six swipe were acquired with the same dose rate but with different total erogated Monitor Units (MU), in this way a curve of the relation between dose and leaf speed was assessed. This test could be used as reference for the comparison of the swipe acquired in the same conditions during future MLC QA in order to assess leaf speed loss from baseline. Different types of test were implemented, by using the EPID detector and DC for the image analysis, in order to check all the parameters suggested in [1] for the MLC QA, and the results were all within the tolerance. The combined use of EPID and DC allowed to assess an exhaustive MLC QA protocol that could be proposed as routine test in radiotherapy departments.

40|$|White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) pose a {{significant}} threat {{to human health}} and safety. During 1990 - 2003, {{the average cost of}} a deer/aircraft collision was $ 38, 000. Various methods of fencing and gating exist to reduce deer intrusions onto airports. We tested one style of electric fence (ElectroBraid) and an electric mat in separate tests on freeranging deer in northern Ohio by measuring deer intrusions and corn consumption at 10 sites. The fence reduced mean daily deer intrusions by 88 - 99 % in each <b>test</b> when the <b>fence</b> was powered. When power was turned on and off within a four-week period, intrusions decreased 57 %. Mean corn consumption differed between treated (< 2 - 6. 4 kg/day) and control sites (15 - 32 kg/day). In the electric-mat test, deer intrusions at treated sites decreased 95 % for the six-week treatment period. Control site intrusions initially decreased by 60 %, but returned to pretreatment levels by week 3. Mean corn consumption was similar between treated (16. 2 kg/day) and control sites (15. 7 kg/day). Results suggest that the electric fence and electric mat, under the conditions of the tests, may significantly reduce deer intrusions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Intensity {{modulated}} radiotherapy using dynamic {{delivery method}} requires accurate verification of MLC, its position {{and speed of}} motion. These parameter have major impact on dose delivery on patients. For quality assurance (QA) procedure requires more time consumed in a radiotherapy department. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the potential use of amorphous silicon based EPID portal dosimetry for dMLC QA Methods and Materials: A varian Clinac_iX with On Board Imager (OBI) and Rapid Arc facility (VMAT) equipped with 120 leaf Millennium MLC and with Amorphous Silicon Based EPID (aSi- 1000, varian) mounted on a Exact Robotic Arm is used. The dMLC QA consists of different dynamic MLC pattern provided by varian for checking positional accuracy, MLC gap, Leaf speed and complex dynamic field. Results and Discussion: Various dMLC tests were done using portal dosimetry. All results are within the tolerance limit. Picket <b>fence</b> <b>test</b> shows that leaf position errors of upto 0. 2 mm can be detected which are within the tolerance limit. Complex dynamic field were exposed to EPID, which shows the leaf speed and are within the tolerance limit...|$|R
