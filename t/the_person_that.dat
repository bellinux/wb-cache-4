He also ruled himself out of being the lead vocalist of Velvet Revolver due to the experiences he has had of being the vocalist of his own band Loaded, saying that being the lead vocalist and being a bass player at the same time was not as appealing to him because it would require him to be much more static in his stage presence, saying that he prefers moving around on stage during live performances. In the same interview, McKagan talked about his new book which was then in the writing stages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{intention}} {{of our study}} is to examine how the view of homeless people and their life situation looks according to a selection of persons, which in their work get into contact with homeless people. The study {{is based on a}} qualitative method that includes interviews. The result of the study is based on interviews with eight <b>persons</b> working in <b>the</b> social services, volunteer organisations, the police and a security organisation. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> have been interviewed are normalising homeless people; they do not look upon them as different. At the same time they have the opinion that homeless people live a tougher life and that they have to fight more for their living than other people. <b>The</b> <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> we have interviewed share the view that homeless people live under a constant pressure of finding a place to sleep. The results also show that there are differences in views among <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> we have interviewed. That is, concerning how homeless people get money and how the relations between them are. On the basis of the view of homeless people we have discussed different views of people. The views that we have found among <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> we have interviewed are the humanistic view, the comprehensive view, the psychoanalytic view and the existential view. We draw the conclusion that there are both similarities and differences among <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> we have interviewed {{when it comes to the}} view of homeless people and their life situation. The leading similarities consists of that they see the life situation of homeless people as hard and tough and that you as a person have to be a survivor to manage the life of being homeless. The leading difference is the relation between the homeless people. Some of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> we have interviewed have the opinion that there is a fellowship between them and that the relation is strong. Others see the relation as brittle, based on drugs. There are also differences concerning how homeless people get money. Some have the opinion that homeless people get pension and other allowances while others have the opinion that they get money by crime...|$|R

25|$|On 12 March, a eucharistic miracle {{occurred}} in Amsterdam, {{now called the}} Miracle of the Host.

25|$|In May 1798, Congress {{voted for}} {{legislation}} that would use eight hundred thousand dollars {{in order to pay}} for small arms and cannons in case war with France erupted. They offered a 5,000 dollar incentive with an additional 5,000 dollars once that money was exhausted for <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> was able to accurately produce arms for the government. Because the cotton gin had not brought Whitney the rewards he believed he would get, he accepted the contract. Although the contract was for one year, Whitney did not deliver the arms until eight years later in 1809 using multiple excuses for the delay of such. Recently, historians have found that during 1801–1806, Whitney took the money and headed into South Carolina in order to profit from the cotton gin.|$|E

25|$|On {{board the}} Jolly Roger, a young Killian is consoled by his father, Brennan, who promised his son {{that he would}} become <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> he was meant to be, only to {{suddenly}} abandon him and his brother, as he sold his sons into servitude, because Brennan was a wanted man and the ship was stolen. Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, {{who is now the}} tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan {{fell in love with the}} sound of his nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to wake him. They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has to make it look like he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the same things he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's never too late to change, to become a better man.|$|E

500|$|When Cosby {{originally}} pitched The Cosby Show to NBC, it {{revolved around}} {{the life of a}} blue-collar couple; Clair was intended to be a plumber while the character's husband Cliff, portrayed by Cosby himself, was a limousine driver. Eventually, the idea of Clair working as a plumber was discarded and the character briefly became a Dominican housewife instead. Inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, of whom Cosby was a fan, much of the show's humor would have been directly derived from Clair's tendency to revert back to her native language Spanish when upset or agitated. Describing this concept as [...] "the reverse of [...] Lucy," [...] Cosby explained that the husband [...] "would be <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> didn’t understand when she spoke Spanish" [...] as opposed to the wife.|$|E

[...] The Jonas Brothers provided backing vocals and guitars on the track. In addition to co-producing the song, Fields also provided bass, guitars and keyboards. Jack Lawless played the drums, and John Taylor contributed backing vocals and played the guitar. The song was released as the lead single for Don't Forget on August 12, 2008, in the United States and Canada via digital download. The edited Radio Disney version was released on the same day.|$|E
