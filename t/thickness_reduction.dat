50|$|Roll bonding {{is a solid}} state, {{cold welding}} process, {{obtained}} through flat rolling of sheet metals. In roll bonding, two or more layers of different metals are passed through a pair of flat rollers under sufficient pressure to bond the layers. The pressure is high enough to deform the metals and reduce the combined thickness of the clad material. The mating surfaces must be previously prepared (scratched, cleaned, degreased) {{in order to increase}} their friction coefficient and remove any oxide layers.The process can be performed at room temperature or at warm conditions. In warm roll bonding, heat is applied to pre-heat the sheets just before rolling, in order to increase their ductility and improve the strength of the weld. The strength of the rolled bonds depends on the main process parameters, including the rolling conditions (entry temperature of the sheets, amount of <b>thickness</b> <b>reduction,</b> rolling speed, etc.), the pre-rolling treatment conditions (annealing temperature and time, surface preparation techniques, etc.) and the post-rolling heat treatments.|$|E

The induced shear deformation in ASR will result in texture evolution and which could also affect microstructural features controlling mechanical properties (such as the tensile strength). The main objective of this work consists of {{the investigation of the}} influence of ASR process on microstructure and texture evolution and their induced mechanical properties in interstitial free (IF) steel sheets. Both reverse and continuous asymmetric rolling were carried out to deform IF steel sheets. The results of optical microscopy observations showed {{no significant differences between the}} grain morphology of asymmetric and conventionally rolled (CR) samples. However, the obtained results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) indicated that fine and equiaxed microstructure was formed through the asymmetric rolling process. Texture evolution through plastic deformation has also been analyzed using X-ray diffraction. In addition, polycrystalline plasticity simulations were used to predict the texture evolution and the induced mechanical properties. The effect of the induced amount of pre-straining on the mechanical response of the samples through uniaxial tensile test has been studied.

This tool is rigid enough to perform flow forming at lathe machine and can flow-form tubes with a diameter up to 100 mm.

40|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} (BD) {{and major}} depressive disorder (MDD) are characterised by a fundamental disturbance of mood, with strong support for overlapping causal pathways. Structural brain and neurocognitive abnormalities {{have been associated with}} mood disorders, but it is unknown whether these reflect early adverse effects predisposing to mood disorders or emerge as a consequence of illness onset. The Bipolar Family Study is well-suited to examine the origin of structural brain and neuropsychological abnormalities in mood disorders further. The volumes of subcortical brain regions, cortical thickness and surface area measures of frontal and temporal regions of interest and neuropsychological performance over a two-year time interval was compared at baseline and longitudinally between three groups: young individuals at high risk of mood disorders who subsequently developed MDD during the follow-up period (HR-MDD), individuals at high risk of mood disorders who remained well (HR-well), and healthy control subjects (HC). The longitudinal analysis of cortical thickness revealed significant group effects for the right parahippocampal and right fusiform gyrus. Cortical thickness in both of these brain regions across the two time points was reduced in both high-risk groups relative to controls, with the HR-MDD group displaying a thinner parahippocampus gyrus than the HR-well group. Moreover, a significant interaction effect was observed for the left inferior frontal and left precentral gyrus. The HR-well subjects had progressive <b>thickness</b> <b>reductions</b> in these brain regions relative to controls, while the HR-MDD group showed cortical thickening of these areas. Finally, longitudinal analyses of neuropsychological performance revealed a significant group effect for long delay verbal memory and extradimensional set-shifting performance. Reduced neurocognitive performance during both tasks across the two time points was found in the HR-well group relative to controls, with the HR-MDD group displaying decreased extradimensional set-shifting abilities as compared to the HC group only. These findings indicate, that reduced left parahippocampal and fusiform thickness constitute a familial trait marker for vulnerability to mood disorders and may thus form potential neuroanatomic endophenotypes. Particularly strong <b>thickness</b> <b>reductions</b> of the parahippocampal gyrus appear be linked to an onset of MDD. Moreover, progressive <b>thickness</b> <b>reductions</b> in the left inferior frontal and precentral gyrus in early adulthood form a familial trait marker for vulnerability to mood disorders, potentially reflecting early neurodegenerative processes. By contrast, an absence of cortical thinning of these brain regions in early adulthood appears to be linked to the onset of MDD, potentially reflecting a lack or delay of normal synaptic pruning processes. Reduced long delay verbal memory and extradimensional set-shifting performance across time constitute a familial trait marker for vulnerability to mood disorders, likely representing disturbances of normal brain development predisposing to illness. These findings advance our understanding of the origin of structural brain and neurocognitive abnormalities in mood disorders...|$|R
