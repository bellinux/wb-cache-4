5|$|On 2 August 1990, British Airways Flight 149 {{landed at}} Kuwait International Airport four hours after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait. The aircraft, a Boeing 747-100 G-AWND, was destroyed, and all {{passengers}} and crew were captured. Two of the landing gears were salvaged, and are on display in Waterside, BA Headquarters in London.|$|E
5|$|No {{military}} operations {{were conducted by}} NATO during the Cold War. Following {{the end of the}} Cold War, the first operations, Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991, were prompted by <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait. Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E
5|$|RAF Uxbridge {{also became}} {{involved}} in Operation Granby following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> of Kuwait in August 1990. Personnel at Uxbridge were prepared for service in the Gulf at that time, and deployed that year in December. During the aerial assault on Iraq in January 1991, support group meetings began at the station {{for the families of}} service personnel serving during the Gulf War. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, visited one of these groups in February 1991.|$|E
50|$|The Armenian {{population}} {{reached its}} peak of 12,000. But after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasions,</b> <b>the</b> numbers of the Armenians resident in Kuwait greatly diminished to just 500 {{as they left the}} country.|$|R

50|$|The Armenians in Kuwait {{are people}} of Armenian descent living in Kuwait. As of 2013, {{there has been}} a large {{population}} increase and now the Armenians number 6,000. Before the Gulf War, the Armenian population reached its peak of 12,000. But after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasions,</b> <b>the</b> numbers of the Armenians resident in Kuwait greatly diminished to just 500 as they left the country.|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{was called}} to support the {{multinational}} response to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. The brigade grew to a 7,700 soldier force composed of three groups, ten battalions, four separate companies, and eight detachments in support of XVIII Airborne Corps during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The brigade completed 1,500 combat heavy battalions equivalent days of work constructing roads, airfields, heliports, ammunition/fuel/water storage points, life support areas and forward landing strips, distributed over ten million maps, trained over 5,000 coalition engineers, and supported the French attack on Assalman airfield. During follow-on missions the brigade destroyed over 6,000 enemy bunkers and one million tons of munitions.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait in August 1990, No.86 Wing {{prepared}} to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E
25|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia {{joined the}} anti-Iraq Coalition. King Fahd, fearing an attack from Iraq, invited American and Coalition {{soldiers}} to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi troops and aircraft {{took part in}} the subsequent military operations.|$|E
50|$|Saddam Hussein and <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> {{military}} were dealt a heavy blow when Iranian Air Force vulnerabilities {{failed to}} materialize. All Iraqi airbases near Iran {{were out of}} order for weeks and, according to Iran, Iraq's aerial efficiency was reduced by 55%. This allowed Iranians to regroup and prepare for <b>the</b> upcoming <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Kuwait Fund {{remained}} operational during <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> of Kuwait, and {{was instrumental}} in swaying global opinion to Kuwait's side.

50|$|Abu Ghaith first gained {{attention}} during <b>the</b> 1990-1991 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> {{and occupation}} of Kuwait. His sermons denouncing <b>the</b> occupation and <b>Iraqi</b> President Saddam Hussein gained him {{some degree of}} popularity amongst the Kuwaiti people. The Kuwaiti government subsequently removed him from the mosque and banned him from giving sermons, and he became {{a high school teacher}} of religion.|$|R
25|$|As of 1983 {{the branch}} {{was led by}} Faisal al-Sani. The Kuwaiti Ba'ath Party branch {{collapsed}} during Gulf War because of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait.

25|$|Less than a {{year after}} the 37th TFW saw combat in Panama, in {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, the 415th TFS of the 37th TFW was deployed to King Khalid International Airport, Saudi Arabia on 19 August to provide air defense over the Saudi capital of Riyadh.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Kuwait {{had been}} {{producing}} oil above treaty limits established by OPEC. By {{the eve of}} <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion,</b> Kuwait had set production quotas to almost , which coincided with {{a sharp drop in}} the price of oil. By the summer of 1990, Kuwaiti overproduction had become a serious point of contention with Iraq.|$|E
50|$|The rally, held on gravel {{roads and}} sand {{for the most}} part, has {{consistently}} {{been part of the}} Middle East Rally Championship but its history has been intermittent as Kuwait has been embroiled in armed conflict, first with <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and <b>the</b> Gulf War and Iraq War which followed.|$|R
50|$|The {{division}} was formed {{as part of}} the buildup of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army after <b>the</b> Yom Kippur War. It appears to have seen its first action in <b>the</b> initial <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Khuzestan, which began the Iran-Iraq War. It fought in several battles in 1980-81, but then was so badly beaten in the First Battle of al-Basrah (Operation Ramadan), in July 1982, that it was disbanded. The 9th Division was <b>the</b> only <b>Iraqi</b> division to be disbanded without being reformed during the war.|$|R

25|$|Nance recounts {{lessons learned}} from the Lebanon war with Israel in 1992, {{particularly}} how the subsequent occupation of Lebanon by Israel could have provided the U.S with significant ways to improve their strategy in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> in 2003. Nance compares and contrasts the two occupation force strategies, and argues each left their occupiers with many deaths and few tangible results.|$|E
25|$|Khuzestan is ethnically diverse, {{home to many}} {{different}} ethnic groups. This has a bearing on Khuzestan's electoral politics, with ethnic minority rights playing {{a significant role in}} the province's political culture. The province's geographical location bordering Iraq and its oil resources also make it a politically sensitive region, particularly given its history of foreign intervention, notably <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of 1980.|$|E
50|$|Kuwait had 143 Chieftains {{on the eve}} of <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> of Kuwait. Thirty-seven Chieftains of the Kuwaiti 35th Armored Brigade fought at the Battle of the Bridges against {{elements}} of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Hammurabi and Medina divisions before withdrawing over the Saudi border. None of the brigade's tanks were lost in the battle, and the 35th Armored Brigade (known as Al-Fatah) became part of Joint Command Forces East during the 1991 Gulf War and was able to return into Kuwait undefeated.|$|R
50|$|Ferranti Defence Systems started {{development}} of the TIALD pod in the late 1980s. <b>The</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait and the resulting Gulf War saw the TIALD pod rushed into service. In the Gulf War several modified Panavia Tornados and some Blackburn Buccaneers laser designated for unmodified Tornados which carried LGBs. The Buccaneers carried the U.S. Pave Spike designator, which was limited to daylight use.|$|R
50|$|The Iran-Iraq War from 1980 to 1988, <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait, <b>the</b> first Gulf War and {{subsequent}} conflicts all generated {{hundreds of thousands}} if not millions of refugees. Iran also provided asylum for 1,400,000 Iraqi refugees who had been uprooted {{as a result of}} the 1991 uprisings in Iraq (1990-91). At least one million Iraqi Kurds were displaced during the Al-Anfal Campaign (1986-1989).|$|R
25|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{withdrawal}} from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait in August 1990 {{had put the}} Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 2002 Solana {{said that}} the detainees at Guantanamo Bay {{should be treated as}} prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. The EU has stated that it hopes to avoid another war like <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> through this and future negotiations, and Solana has said the most {{difficult}} moments of his job were when the United Kingdom and France, the two permanent EU Security Council members, were in disagreement.|$|E
25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War, Khuzestan was {{the focus}} of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Iran, leading to the flight of {{thousands}} of the province's residents. As a result, Khuzestan suffered the heaviest damage of all Iranian provinces during the war. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein felt confident that the Arab population of the Khuzestan would react enthusiastically to the prospect of union with Iraq. However, resistance to the invasion was fierce, stalling the Iraqi military's advance, and ultimately opening a window of opportunity for an Iranian counter-offensive.|$|E

All Iraqi Air Bases near Iran {{were out of}} order for months and, according to Iran, Iraq's aerial efficiency was reduced by 55%. This allowed Iranians to regroup and prepare for <b>the</b> upcoming <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion.</b> However, <b>Iraqis</b> would advance deep into Khuzestan {{and it would take}} the Iranians up to 2 years before they would finally expel <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> from their territory and eventually enter Iraq. The War endured another 6 years, becoming the longest conventional war of the 20th century in which perhaps close to one million were maimed and killed.|$|R
50|$|Iraqi Airways {{was founded}} in 1945 {{and is a member}} of the Arab Air Carriers Organization.

50|$|Though <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> air <b>invasion</b> {{surprised}} <b>the</b> Iranians, the Iranian {{air force}} retaliated with {{an attack against}} Iraqi military bases and infrastructure in Operation Kaman 99 (Bow 99). Groups of F-4 Phantom and F-5 Tiger fighter jets attacked targets throughout Iraq, such as oil facilities, dams, petrochemical plants, and oil refineries, and included Mosul Airbase, Baghdad, and the Kirkuk oil refinery. Iraq was taken by surprise at {{the strength of the}} retaliation, as Iran took few losses while <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> took heavy defeats and economic disruption.|$|R
25|$|Between {{the autumn}} of 1980 and the summer of 1990, the number of {{aircraft}} in the IQAF went from 332 to over 1000. Before <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Iran, the IQAF had expected 16 modern Dassault Mirage F.1EQs from France and were also {{in the middle of}} receiving a total of 240 new aircraft and helicopters from their Eastern European allies. When Iraq invaded Iran in late September 1980, the Soviets and the French stopped delivery of additional aircraft to Iraq but resumed deliveries a few months later.|$|E
25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait, on August 2, 1990 an Iraqi Air Force Sukhoi Su-22 {{from the}} No.109 Squadron (based at as-Shoibiyah AB) fired a single Kh-25MP anti-radar variant against a Kuwaiti MIM-23B I-HAWK SAM site at Bubiyan Island that had earlier downed another Su-22 {{from the same}} unit and a MiG-23BN from the 49th Squadron. This forced a radar {{shutdown}} on the HAWK. The HAWK battery (which was operated by some American contractors) was later captured by Iraqi special forces and found out to be in automatic mode of operation, after the contractors fled.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 {{billion in}} support of Saddam Hussein in the Iran–Iraq War. However, Saudi Arabia {{condemned}} <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait in 1990 and asked the US to intervene. King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the Kuwaiti government {{and many of its}} citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but expelled citizens of Yemen and Jordan because of their governments' support of Iraq. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait.|$|E
50|$|According to the Pentagon, 250000 ST (of 650000 ST total) of {{ordnance}} was looted, {{providing a}} {{significant source of}} ammunition for <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> insurgency. <b>The</b> <b>invasion</b> phase concluded when Tikrit, Saddam's home town, fell with little resistance to the U.S. Marines of Task Force Tripoli.|$|R
50|$|Though <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> air <b>invasion</b> {{surprised}} <b>the</b> Iranians, the Iranian {{air force}} retaliated {{the day after}} with a large-scale attack against Iraqi air bases and infrastructure in Operation Kaman 99.
