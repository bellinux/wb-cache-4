5|$|Growing food on rooftops {{could be}} an option for fast growing communities. Popular plants grown for food include, chives, oregano and {{lavender}} <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> are suitable for green roofs because they are evolutionarily equipped for Mediterranean climate.|$|E
5|$|Planting near {{other members}} of the cabbage family, or where <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> have been placed in {{previous}} years, can prompt the spread of pests and disease. Excessive water and excessive heat can also cause cultivation problems.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{containing}} phytoestrogens {{have been}} administered for centuries for gynaecological {{disorders such as}} fertility, menstrual, and menopausal problems. Among <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> are Pueraria mirifica, kudzu, angelica, fennel, and anise.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the plant communities of the grasslands of the Pretoria–Witbank–Heidelberg area is presented. Relevés were compiled in 148 stratified random sample plots. A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed fourteen plant communities, and a hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> communities are presented. Each of <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> communities may be regarded as an entity with a unique species composition, and with specific environmental relationships and an inherent forage production potential. The identification, classification and description of <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> communities are not only important for management purposes, {{but also for the}} preservation of biotic diversity...|$|R

5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note that}} one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from <b>these</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many of <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> are {{integrated}} with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path {{across the sky}} to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. Seeds from <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> {{are noted}} for their oil content, but little {{information}} is available on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, the plants are grown as food, with dietary use of the oils as a byproduct of using the seeds as food.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} {{increasing}} genome size over time {{is seen in}} filamentous <b>plant</b> pathogens. <b>These</b> <b>plant</b> pathogen genomes have been growing larger over the years due to repeat-driven expansion. The repeat-rich regions contain genes coding for host interaction proteins. With the addition of more and more repeats to <b>these</b> regions the <b>plants</b> increase the possibility of developing new virulence factors through mutation {{and other forms of}} genetic recombination. In this way it is beneficial for <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> pathogens to have larger genomes.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the plant communities of the Ae land type of the Bloemfontein West District is presented. Relevés were compiled in 62 sample plots. A Twinspan classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed eight plant communities. A hierarchical classification, a description and an ecological interpretation of each of <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> communities are presented. Each of <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> communities may {{be regarded as a}} unique entity within the study area, with its own species composition and specific environmental relationships...|$|R
5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. <b>These</b> <b>plants</b> have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) {{reports that}} world {{production}} of {{carrots and turnips}} (<b>these</b> <b>plants</b> are combined by the FAO) for the calendar year 2013 was 37.2 million tonnes; almost half (~45%) were grown in China. Carrots are widely used in many cuisines, especially {{in the preparation of}} salads, and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional cuisines.|$|E
5|$|The insects {{captured}} by the glandular trichomes {{are too small to}} serve any role in pollination. It is unclear, however, whether <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> evolved the ability to trap and kill insects as an adaptation to low environmental nutrient availability or simply a defensive mechanism against insects damaging flower parts.|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} potentials of {{the wild}} lemon (Afreagle paniculate) and the African rock fig (Ficcus congensis Engl.) leaf powder as an alternative source of control against the cowpea seed bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus Fab.) on stored cowpea was evaluated. The results obtained shows that, <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> material powdered leaves had remarkable effects on all the parameters measured. There were 76. 34 % and 77. 20 % undamaged seeds recorded respectively, when cowpea seeds were stored with <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> material powdered leaves compared to the control, 7. 50 %. High mortality of 84. 61 % and 85. 51 % respectively, was obtained in <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> material powdered leaves and the least was in the control, 16. 84 %. Likewise, there was only 7. 67 and 6. 01 number of adults that emerged while the control had 23. 85. High number of eggs laid was recorded in the control. It was also found out that, <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> material powdered leaves are promising candidates for developing botanical, biodegradable and ecologically friendly insecticides which can be integrated with other pest management procedures and could replace the use of synthetic insecticides on small farmers holding. Therefore, the leaf powders are recommended for storing cowpea seeds for at least 12 weeks giving the grains perfect state of wholesomeness...|$|R
50|$|Many {{plants and}} plant parts are eaten as food and around 2,000 plant species are {{cultivated}} for food. Many of <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> species have several distinct cultivars.|$|R
50|$|These frugivorous bats eat {{from the}} viney pandans and some Ficus. The {{excretion}} of {{seeds in the}} bat's guano helps with the dispersal of <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> species.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. <b>These</b> <b>plants</b> can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. <b>These</b> <b>plants</b> have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum as well {{as other}} trilliums are a favored food of white-tailed deer. Indeed, if trilliums are {{available}} deer will seek <b>these</b> <b>plants,</b> with a preference for T. grandiflorum, to the exclusion of others. In the course of normal browsing, deer consume larger individuals, leaving shorter ones behind. This information can be used to assess deer density and its effect on understory growth in general.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>plant</b> {{species are}} endemic to Southeast Dinaric {{mountains}} range of Bjelašnica and mountains of Herzegovina endemic center - Prenj, Čvrsnica (with the Plasa), Čabulja, and Velež.|$|R
50|$|Many of <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> {{collections}} {{are arranged in}} association with the National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, Dublin, and other botanic institutions such as the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh, Scotland.|$|R
30|$|However, it was {{observed}} that PBR of the SNPs produced via <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> extracts remain as expected (Fig.  1) without any significant shifting [7]. It is interesting, however, to note that most of the reaction initiated by <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> extracts underwent relatively fast reaction and nucleation process characterized by high rate constant (Table  2). The scenario displayed further suggest that these reaction conditions favour a growth rate more akin to the OR process, being predominantly controlled by diffusion without prejudice to the expected passivating influence of the organic inherent in the plant extracts [6].|$|R
5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest {{industrial}} use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process. The chlorine {{was used for}} bleaching paper (hence the location of many of <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage has largely been discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.|$|E
5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E
5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for solar energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power plants have {{been built in the}} Mojave Desert. <b>These</b> <b>plants</b> have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) making them the largest solar power installation in the world. Large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors. The Mojave Solar Park is currently under construction and will produce 280MW when completed.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>plant</b> bugs are polyphagous, {{but they}} mainly feed on Asteraceae species, Anthemis and Salix species. The broken-backed bugs are vectors of a phytoplasma-caused phyllody in species of Parthenium.|$|R
50|$|Livelihood {{of people}} {{dependent}} {{on the sale of}} edible fruit and rhizome of lotus plant products and Euryale ferox (thanging) has suffered due to steep decline in the growth of <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> species.|$|R
50|$|These {{chaparral}} ecoregions contain numerous plant communities, including oak savanna, oak woodland, conifer woodlands, chamise chaparral, coastal sage scrub, {{and coastal}} grassland. <b>These</b> <b>plant</b> communities often {{occur as a}} mosaic, caused by fire.|$|R
5|$|Fish, {{which may}} have been preyed upon by smaller crocodilians, are {{represented}} by teeth and scales. They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an indeterminate member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an indeterminate bowfin. Indeterminate caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding the lakes of the Mussentuchit, containing a canopy of tree ferns, araucarias, and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of the lakes. <b>These</b> <b>plants</b> would have provided an abundant source of food for Eolambia.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa and Australia, two of {{the three}} centers of species diversity, the natural {{habitats}} of <b>these</b> <b>plants</b> are undergoing a high degree of pressure from human activities. Expanding population centers (such as Queensland, Perth, and Cape Town) threaten many such habitats, as does the draining of moist areas for agriculture and forestry in rural areas. The droughts that have been sweeping Australia over the last 10 years also pose a threat to many species by drying up previously moist areas.|$|E
5|$|Some {{non-standard}} {{amino acids}} {{are used as}} defenses against herbivores in plants. For example, canavanine is an analogue of arginine that is found in many legumes, and in particularly large amounts in Canavalia gladiata (sword bean). This amino acid protects the plants from predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing. The non-protein amino acid mimosine is found in other species of legume, in particular Leucaena leucocephala. This compound is an analogue of tyrosine and can poison animals that graze on <b>these</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
50|$|P. incarnata {{extracts}} can be potentially used {{to produce}} organic sunscreens with a protective defense against UV radiations. The use of <b>these</b> <b>plant</b> compounds would diminish the concentration of synthetic UV filters in sunscreens.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>plant</b> organelles contain prolamellar bodies, {{which are}} {{membrane}} aggregations of semi-crystalline lattices of branched tubules that carry the precursor pigment for chlorophyll. The prolamellar bodies are often (and presumed always) arranged in geometric patterns.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} cause of blossom-end rot and/or {{blackheart}} is exposure to a prolonged hot, or drought period. <b>These</b> <b>plant</b> pathologies may also be caused by an extremely low calcium mineral content in the soil.|$|R
