5|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{landings}} on Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo were taking place, Allied troops were also landing on nearby Guadalcanal, with <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> capturing an airfield under construction by Japanese forces.

40|$|This study emphasises {{the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{financial}} statements are not compatible with the principles that establish measurement in the social sciences, and that they therefore cannot {{be considered to be}} measurement <b>objectives.</b> <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> measurement presupposes the comprehension of the principal state and consequently <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> a measurement discipline only make measurement sense {{in the presence of a}} theory of measurement in which they are contained. Currently, accounting is considered to be a measurement discipline with complete measurement <b>objectives,</b> even in <b>the</b> absence of a measurement theory that incorporates <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measurement process. In this study the principles of the representational theory of measurement (a theory that establishes measurement in the social sciences) are used to emphasise that <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial statements are not measurement objectives unless they are supported by a theory of measurement. Hence the financial statements cannot contain measurement information until a theory of measurement is established that incorporates <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accounting measurement processes.
