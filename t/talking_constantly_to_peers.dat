Lisa Batey, however, broadcast her entire life, <b>talking</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>to</b> viewers and informing them of her every decision in her Brooklyn apartment. Batey supplements her 24/7 streaming with entries she posts in her LiveJournal, not unlike the diary entries written by JenniCam. In August 2007, Batey did extensive technical research {{so that she could}} continue to broadcast without interruptions or equipment problems while she vacationed in Tokyo and Kyoto during September 2007. The following year, she moved to Tokyo and continued to lifecast from there before moving to Brazil in 2011. A pioneer in the field, Batey has been lifecasting since 1999 when she was 20 years old.|$|R

He {{came home}} from Queen's every week-end, and Susan had all his {{favourite}} dishes for him, {{in so far as}} she could evade or wheedle the doctor, and waited on him hand and foot. Though she <b>talked</b> war <b>constantly</b> <b>to</b> everyone else she never mentioned it to him or before him, but she watched him like a cat watching a mouse; and when the German retreat from the Bapaume salient began and continued, Susan's exultation was linked up with something deeper than anything she expressed. Surely the end was in sight--would come now before--anyone else--could go.|$|R
50|$|Here a {{connection}} {{can be made}} between the two stated theories of social comparison and projection. First, as social comparison theory explains, individuals <b>constantly</b> look <b>to</b> <b>peers</b> as a reference group and are motivated {{to do so in}} order to seek confirmation for their own attitudes and beliefs. In order to guarantee confirmation and a higher self-esteem, though, an individual might unconsciously project their own beliefs onto the others (the targets of their comparisons). This final outcome is the false-consensus effect. To summarize, the false-consensus effect can be seen as stemming from both social comparison theory and the concept of projection.|$|R
5000|$|Fester {{survived the}} explosion, {{but his mind}} was further addled by his {{experiences}} and he became a homeless alcoholic. He robbed Nathan Lubensky, but was beaten down by Spider-Man and forced to surrender to the police, who try to help Nathan. He was again defeated by Spider-Man and later teamed up with Aura and Override. [...] When Ben Reilly was acting as Spider-Man, Norton has stolen weapons used by various criminals in order to fund his research. He even stated that S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were after his work because of its importance. After Spider-Man beat Norton again - aided by Norton attempting to tie Spider-Man up with his own web-shooters, unaware that the webbing dissolved after an hour - S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrived and took Norton away on board their helicarrier. When circumstances forced Spider-Man to adopt new identities, the Looter was the first foe Spider-Man fought as the Hornet when he attempted to raid the Daily Bugle in order to steal the ransom that Norman Osborn was offering for Spider-Man. Here he was portrayed as <b>talking</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>to</b> the original meteor after attaching it to a gun, despite Hornet's certainty that the rock was just a rock after giving him his strength. He was seen at an auction in which the Venom Symbiote was sold. He later attempted to steal yet another meteor, at a museum display, to grow further in power. Spider-Man defeated him once more in the museum bathroom, {{in front of a}} woman named Vanna Smith, who was obsessed with the wallcrawler.|$|R
60|$|In {{this room}} was all Amelia's heart and treasure. Here {{it was that}} she tended her boy and watched him through the many ills of childhood, with a {{constant}} passion of love. The elder George returned in him somehow, only improved, and as if come back from heaven. In a hundred little tones, looks, and movements, the child was so like his father that the widow's heart thrilled as she held him to it; and he would often ask the cause of her tears. It was because of his likeness to his father, she did not scruple to tell him. She <b>talked</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>to</b> him about this dead father, and spoke of her love for George to the innocent and wondering child; much more than she ever had done to George himself, or to any confidante of her youth. To her parents she never talked about this matter, shrinking from baring her heart to them. Little George very likely could understand no better than they, but into his ears she poured her sentimental secrets unreservedly, and into his only. The very joy of this woman was a sort of grief, or so tender, at least, that its expression was tears. Her sensibilities were so weak and tremulous that perhaps they ought not to be talked about in a book. I was told by Dr. Pestler (now a most flourishing lady's physician, with a sumptuous dark green carriage, a prospect of speedy knighthood, and a house in Manchester Square) that her grief at weaning the child was a sight that would have unmanned a Herod. He was very soft-hearted many years ago, and his wife was mortally jealous of Mrs. Amelia, then and long afterwards.|$|R

But there will come a time where we will do the album. And once we do it we will want to do touring as well.

According to Lassiter, his decision was largely influenced by his beliefs that Carter had started to exhibit an entitled attitude, saying, [...] "I would <b>constantly</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about it, about work ethic and starting at the bottom and working his way up. When he rejected it, I told him to go back to West Philly. He had to go back and experience this for himself, and come out on the other side."

Her advice to Devi is always [...] "You need to get out more", which is generally met with skepticism by Devi. She is thought of as insane, {{due to the fact that}} she <b>constantly</b> <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> her squeaky toy, Spooky. She first appears in the fourth issue of JtHM, trying to calm Devi's fear, and was then called Tonja. A doll version of Spooky can be seen in Layla Miller's room in Marvel Comics' House of M event.|$|R

But soon, to his horror, his mother reappears in the sky over New York City. She begins to annoy Sheldon and Lisa (with the whole city now watching) by <b>constantly</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> strangers about his most embarrassing moments. This puts a strain on his relationship with Lisa, who leaves him. Sheldon is persuaded by his psychiatrist to see a psychic, Treva (Julie Kavner), to try to get his mother back to reality. Treva's experiments fail, but Sheldon falls for her, possibly finding her to be very similar to his mother (see Oedipus complex).
