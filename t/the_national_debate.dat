5|$|The {{situation}} that arose after the incapacity of President Wilson, for which Marshall's vice-presidency is most remembered, revived <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> {{on the process}} of presidential succession. The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson's incapacity during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue. The constitutional flaws in the process of presidential succession had been known since the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem. Nearly fifty years later, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers and duties any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers and duties of the office.|$|E

25|$|In 1854, {{the first}} {{cracks in the}} state Democratic Party began to show {{after the passage of}} the Kansas-Nebraska Act by Congress. Bright and his faction, a {{majority}} of the party, began forcing out anti-slavery members of the party leadership, using support of the act as a litmus test of party loyalty. By then <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> over the possible break-up of the Union had begun. The Whig party was also on the brink of collapse, and a new coalition party of former Whigs, former Democrats, the anti-immigration Free Soil party, and the anti-slavery Liberty Party came together. The result was the so-called Know-Nothing Party and the first real challenge to Democrat control of the state in a generation. The 1854 mid-term election caused the Democrats to lose seats in the Senate, but still maintain control. The Democrats did, however, lose their majority in the house. The House was spilt with no party attaining majority, and the Whigs caucused with the Democrats to control the assembly. The effect was a virtual paralysis to the legislature, and Wright was unable to make any significant accomplishments during his last two years in office.|$|E

The Wall Street Journal, in a headline, deemed Bakke [...] "The Decision Everybody Won". According to Oxford University Chair of Jurisprudence Ronald Dworkin, the court's decision [...] "was received by the press and much of the public with great relief, as an act of judicial statesmanship that gave to each party in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> what it seemed to want most".|$|E
500|$|Early in 1967, <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> on {{abortion}} {{was starting to}} gain traction. In {{the early stages of}} the debate, Democratic California state senator Anthony C. Beilenson introduced the [...] "Therapeutic Abortion Act" [...] in an effort to reduce the number of [...] "back-room abortions" [...] performed in California. The state legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it on June 14, 1967. About two milli{{on abortion}}s would be performed as a result, mostly because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother. Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor, he would not have signed it. After he recognized what he called the [...] "consequences" [...] of the bill, he announced that he was pro-life. He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.|$|E
500|$|Although Daniels {{had claimed}} to be {{reluctant}} to seek higher office, many media outlets, including Politico, The Weekly Standard, Forbes, The Washington Post, CNN, The Economist, and The Indianapolis Star began to speculate that Daniels may intend to seek the Republican nomination for president in 2012 after he joined <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> on cap and trade legislation by penning a response in The Wall Street Journal to policies espoused by the Democratic-majority Congress and the White House in August 2010. The speculation has included Daniels' record of reforming government, reducing taxes, balancing the budget, and connecting with voters in Indiana. Despite his signing into law of bills that toughened drug enforcement, regulated abortion, and a defense of marriage act, he has angered some conservatives because of his call for a [...] "truce" [...] on social issues so the party can focus on fiscal issues. His [...] "willingness to consider tax increases to rectify a budget deficit" [...] has been another source of contention.|$|E
