40|$|This paper {{describes}} an electronic controller that is optimized {{to operate a}} hot air solar system. Thermal information is obtained from copper constantan thermocouples and a wall-type thermostat. The signals from the thermocouples are processed through a single amplifier using a multiplexing scheme. The multiplexing reduces the component count and automatically calibrates the <b>thermocouple</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The processed signals connect to some simple logic that selects {{one of the four}} operating modes. This simple, inexpensive, and reliable scheme is well suited to control hot air solar systems...|$|E
40|$|The AD 8494 <b>thermocouple</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{includes}} an on-chip temperature sensor, normally used for cold-junction compensation, allowing {{the device to}} be used as a standalone Celsius thermometer by grounding the thermocouple inputs. In this configuration, the amplifier produces a 5 -mV/°C output voltage between the output and (the normally grounded) reference pins of the on-chip instrumentation amplifier. One drawback of this approach is the poor system resolution achieved when measuring narrow temperature ranges. Consider this: a 10 -bit ADC running on a single 5 -V supply has 4. 88 -mV/LSB resolution. This means that the system shown in Figure 1 has a resolution of about 1 °C/LSB. If the temperature range of interest is narrow, say 20 °C, the output varies by 100 mV, utilizing only 1 / 50 of the ADC’s available dynamic range. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{relaxation}} of operational amplifier parameters (offset voltage and differential gain) with time after pulsed electron beam irradiation {{has been studied}} {{as a function of}} total dose and amplifier type. Four types of operational amplifiers were studied viz., general purpose bipolar input (mu A 741), super-beta transistor input (LM 308), JFET input (LF 356) and MOSFET input (CA 3140) from different vendors. The experiments were carried out mainly using 500 ns pulses from a Linear Accelerator. The study, the first of its kind, shows that while the electrical transient at the output of the operational amplifier recovers in a few milliseconds. {{relaxation of}} parameters can take several to several tens of seconds. This relaxation is attributed to the build up and/or anneal of damage in the oxide or at the interface of the internal transistor structures. The change and relaxation of parameters depend on operational amplifier type and total dose, and can have significant effects in certain application domains as illustrated by the response of a <b>thermocouple</b> <b>amplifier</b> after pulsed irradiation.

40|$|The {{scientist}} and researchers are facing problems in genetically stabilizing living cells. The living cells can be stabilized by keeping them in cryogenic temperatures. Stabilizing cells at cryogenic temperatures is called cryopreservation, an applied aspect of cryobiology, or {{the study of}} life at low temperatures. Advances in cryopreservation technology have led to methods that allow low-temperature {{maintenance of a variety}} of cell types. Techniques are available for the preservation of microorganisms, isolated tissue cells, small multi cellular organisms, and even more complex organisms such as embryos. The freezing process involves complex phenomena which, even after decades of research, are not fully understood. The aim of this project to make prototype of a cryopreservation system, so, it can preserve the sperm or any other biological material. For the aim of cryopreservation, a circuit board with a microcontroller, thermocouple controller, and a voltage driver for valve are constructed. Two sensors are used, a K-types thermocouple and Water level detector-brick sensor, which send data to the microcontroller. After the microcontroller receives the data, the data of temperature and level are compared to control the valve. The cryopreservation system is modeled in AutoCAD and the temperature control circuit is programmed in MPLAB. An adjustable plastic box which is non-conductive and resistant to heat is used in the fabricated system. It has a metal box inside to reserve sperm tubes. An electrical solenoid valve is used for supplying necessary liquid. The total cryopreservation is activated by sensing physical value by the sensors which are converted by <b>thermocouple</b> <b>amplifier</b> in understandable form for microcontroller. The data are then processed, compared and the valve is then operated accordingly by the microcontroller. The fabricated system is tested at different temperature conditions and it is found that there is very less error. The system functions very effective and is able to control the temperature of the system to preserve the sperm...|$|E
