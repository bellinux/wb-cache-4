5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>congolense,</b> which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E

Nevertheless, if the differences in susceptibility of the two G. pallidipes colonies to infections with the above Trypanosoma species reflect transmission of the trypanosomes by the two populations of tsetse in the field, then the epidemiology of trypanosomiasis must differ between these two areas in Kenya. Glossina pallidipes which originated from Nguruman showed higher infection rates to stocks of T. (Duttonella) vivax than that from Shimba Hills. However, the infection rates in the two allopatric populations were high, and ranged from 71. 3 to 80. 0 percent.

40|$|Trypanosomes are {{bloodstream}} protozoan parasites, {{which are}} pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Several mammalian species, including humans, can be infected by {{different species of}} the genus <b>Trypanosoma</b> (T. <b>congolense,</b> T. evansi, T. brucei, T. vivax) exhibiting more or less virulent and pathogenic phenotypes. A previous screening of the excreted-secreted proteins of T. congolense demonstrated an overexpression of several proteins correlated with the virulence and pathogenicity of the strain.

40|$|Trypanosomatids are {{parasitic}} protists {{that have}} an ATP-dependent glycolysis with no indication of PPi-dependent metabolism. Most of the glycolysis takes place in peroxisome-like organelles, the glycosomes. We characterized in Trypanosoma brucei a single-copy gene encoding a PPi-dependent enzyme, pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (PPDK), which was expressed functionally in Escherichia coli. Specific antibodies detected a 100 -kDa protein in procyclic forms but not in mammalian forms of T. brucei, indicating a differential expression. Glycosomal localization of PPDK was determined by immunofluorescence analysis and was confirmed by Western blot analysis on glycosomal fractions by using anti-PPDK antibodies. Expression and localization of recombinant PPDKs in procyclic forms of T. brucei showed that the AKL motif at the C-terminal extremity of PPDK is necessary for glycosomal targeting.

40|$|The teneral phenomenon, as {{observed}} in Glossina sp., {{refers to the}} increased susceptibility of the fly to trypanosome infection when the first bloodmeal taken is trypanosome-infected. In recent years, the term teneral has gradually become synonymous with unfed, and thus fails to consider {{the age of the}} newly emerged fly at the time the first bloodmeal is taken. Furthermore, conflicting evidence exists of the effect of the age of the teneral fly post eclosion when it is given the infected first bloodmeal in determining the infection prevalence. This study demonstrates {{that it is not the}} feeding history of the fly but rather the age (hours after eclosion of the fly from the puparium) of the fly when it takes the first (infective) bloodmeal that determines the level of fly susceptibility to trypanosome infection. We examine this phenomenon in male and female flies from two distinct tsetse clades (Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina palpalis palpalis) infected with two salivarian trypanosome species, Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) brucei brucei and <b>Trypanosoma</b> (Nannomonas) <b>congolense</b> using Fisher’s exact test to examine differences in infection rates. Teneral tsetse aged less than 24 hours post-eclosion (h. p. e.) are twice as susceptible to trypanosome infection as flies aged 48 h. p. e. This trend is conserved across sex, vector clade and parasite species. The life cycle stage of the parasite fed to the fly (mammalian versus insect form trypanosomes) does not alter this age-related bias in infection.

40|$|Background: Determining if a {{tsetse fly}} is {{infected}} by trypanosomes and thus potentially able to transmit trypanosome-related {{human and animal}} diseases is an extremely laborious and time-consuming task to perform, especially under field conditions. In this study we tested a possible alternative approach that uses the entire insect vector for DNA extraction and PCR analysis to detect and identify Trypanosoma spp. in field collected tsetse flies.

40|$|Antigenic {{variation}} enables pathogens {{to avoid}} the host immune response by continual switching of surface proteins. The protozoan blood parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes human African trypanosomiasis ("sleeping sickness") across sub-Saharan Africa and is a model system for antigenic variation, surviving by periodically replacing a monolayer of variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) that covers its cell surface. We compared the genome of Trypanosoma brucei with two closely related parasites <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>congolense</b> and Trypanosoma vivax, to reveal how the variant antigen repertoire has evolved and how it might affect contemporary antigenic diversity. We reconstruct VSG diversification showing that <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>congolense</b> uses variant antigens derived from multiple ancestral VSG lineages, whereas in Trypanosoma brucei VSG have recent origins, and ancestral gene lineages have been repeatedly co-opted to novel functions. These historical differences are reflected in fundamental differences between species in the scale and mechanism of recombination. Using phylogenetic incompatibility as a metric for genetic exchange, we show that the frequency of recombination is comparable between <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>congolense</b> and Trypanosoma brucei but is much lower in Trypanosoma vivax. Furthermore, in showing that the C-terminal domain of Trypanosoma brucei VSG {{plays a crucial role}} in facilitating exchange, we reveal substantial species differences in the mechanism of VSG diversification. Our results demonstrate how past VSG evolution indirectly determines the ability of contemporary parasites to generate novel variant antigens through recombination and suggest that the current model for antigenic variation in Trypanosoma brucei is only one means by which these parasites maintain chronic infections...|$|E

The exact phylogenetic relationships of these morphologically identical but genetically heterogeneous parasites is obscure. I have designed specific oligonucleotide primers based on conserved nucleotide sequences of 18 S ribosomal RNA (18 S rRNA) gene of Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania donovani, Triponema aequale and Lagenidium gigantum, and used these in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify genomic DNA from four different clones each representing a different genotypic group of T. congolense. PCR products of approximately 1 kb were generated using as template DNA {{from each of the}} trypanosomes. The nucleotide sequences of a segment of the PCR products were determined by direct sequencing to provide partial nucleotide sequence of the 18 S rRNA gene in each of the trypanosomes. Using these sequences and those that have been published for the other Trypanosomatids, sequence similarity scores were determined with the help of appropriate computer software. Additionally, primers of arbitrary nucleotide sequence have been employed in the PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the four trypanosome clones representing the different T. congolense types. The patterns of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) have been used in the calculation of pairwise genetic similarity indices among these trypanosomes without making assumptions regarding relative band intensities. In a parallel study I have demonstrated that the PCR products of the 18 S rRNA gene are sensitive probes for specific identification of trypanosomes. I have used heterologous PCR products as probes in hybridization analyses of genomic DNA and PCR products from the different types of T. congolense and from other protozoa. The RFLPs observed confirmed heterogeneity of the 18 S rRNA gene sequences among the trypanosomes comprising the subgenus Nannomonas...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the epidemiology of Human and Animal trypanosomiasis that occur together in sleeping sickness foci, a study of prevalences of animal parasites (<b>Trypanosoma</b> vivax, T. <b>congolense</b> “forest type”, and T. simiae) infections was conducted on domestic animals to complete the previous work carried on T. brucei gambiense prevalence using the same animal sample. 875 domestic animals, including 307 pigs, 264 goats, 267 sheep and 37 dogs were sampled in the sleeping sickness foci of Bipindi, Campo, Doumé and Fontem in Cameroon. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method was used to identify these trypanosome species. A total of 237 (27. 08 %) domestic animals were infected by at least one trypanosome species. The prevalence of T. vivax, T. congolense “forest type” and T. simiae were 20. 91 %, 11. 42 % and 0. 34 % respectively. The prevalences of T. vivax and T. congolense “forest type” differed significantly between the animal species and between the foci (p < 0. 0001); however, these two trypanosomes were found in all animal species as well as in all the foci subjected to the study. The high prevalences of T. vivax and T. congolense “forest type” in Bipindi and Fontem-Center indicate their intense transmission in these foci...|$|R
