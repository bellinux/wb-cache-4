In the 1890s the Alger, Smith and Company began logging {{on both sides of}} the border. [...] In 1899 a series of sluices, dams, and flumes were built to float the logs safely around the waterfalls and gorges; remains of the wooden <b>timber</b> <b>slide</b> around the High Falls are still visible on the Canadian side. [...] The Pigeon River Lumber Company began operations in 1900 and within a few years the two companies had stripped the land of salable timber and moved away, leaving the area afflicted with unemployment, forest fires, and poor hunting. [...] In the early twentieth century a remote fishing resort was located within the future park. [...] In the 1930s plans were made to route Highway 61 across the Pigeon River at the High Falls, but conservation groups like the Izaak Walton League opposed the plan and the bridge and border crossing were ultimately built farther downstream in 1966.|$|E
60|$|He {{departed}} {{with the}} cheerful {{confidence of the}} salaried man, and Thurston, who fought for his own interests, flung himself down on his trestle cot with all his clothes on. Neither the <b>timber</b> <b>slide</b> nor the bridge was quite finished, but because rivers in that region shrink at night when the frost checks the drainage from the feeding glaciers on the peaks above, the saw-miller had insisted on driving down his logs when there was less chance of their stranding on the shoals that cumbered the high-water channel. Thurston lay awake for some time, listening to the fret of the river, which vibrated far across {{the silence of the}} hills, and to the occasional crash of a mighty log smiting the slide. Hardly had his eyelids closed when he was aroused by a sound of hurried footsteps approaching the tent. He stood wide awake in the entrance before the newcomer reached it.|$|E

50|$|He bought James Wadsworth’s farm at the ‘Fifth Chute’ on the Bonnechere in 1838, {{which he}} later {{developed}} {{into the village}} of Eganville, Ontario. John Egan {{is known as the}} namesake for Eganville. He built dams and <b>timber</b> <b>slides</b> along the Bonnechere River and employed thousands of men through lumber camps and transportation. Thanks to Egan’s interest in red pine and business investments, the surrounding area would become a hub for lumber activity with Eganville at the centre.|$|R
50|$|Examining the project, the Board of Works {{concluded}} that a route with as many locks as Baird had proposed would take so long to transit {{that it would not}} be useful militarily, and thus of little interest to the new federalist government. They agreed to continue construction of the four locks contracted in 1836, largely as a way to employ the many immigrants arriving in the area. They showed little interest in the rest of the route, and agreed to allow the rest of the surveyed lock locations to be turned into <b>timber</b> <b>slides.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{river is}} named after a native hunter and trapper who lived in this area in the mid-19th century. At one time, the river was used to {{transport}} logs downstream to the Mattawa River. A <b>timber</b> <b>slide</b> was built to bypass the rapids at the Eau Claire Gorge.|$|E
50|$|Akin to these, {{man-made}} chutes, {{such as the}} <b>timber</b> <b>slide</b> and log flume, {{were used}} in the logging industry to facilitate the downstream transportation of timber along rivers. These are no longer in common use. Man-made chutes may also be a feature of spillways on some dams. Some types of water supply and irrigation systems are gravity fed, hence chutes. These include aqueducts, puquios, and acequias.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>timber</b> <b>slide</b> on the Ottawa River {{was built}} on the North Side near the Chaudière Falls by Ruggles Wright, son of Philemon {{following}} a visit to Scandinavia to learn of lumbering techniques there. The slide was 26 feet wide and was used to bypass the falls. Prior to this, bypassing the falls was a difficult task, and at times met with fatalities. His first slide was built in 1829 and during the next few years, other locations on the river began to employ them.|$|E

5000|$|The case {{arose from}} a {{controversy}} {{that came to}} be known as the [...] "Lumbermen's Feud". Peter McLaren owned a lumber mill and had added <b>timber</b> <b>slides</b> on the Mississippi river and its northern tributaries that flowed through land that he owned in Lanark County, Ontario, in order to provide for transporting his own logs. Boyd Caldwell owned a rival mill, and was attempting to drive 18,000 logs through those slides. McLaren sued Caldwell's firm, B. Caldwell & Son, to restrain them from passing or floating timber and saw logs through his slides.|$|R
50|$|The front (west) {{elevation}} comprises a two-storeyed decorative gable {{structure with}} asymmetric single-storeyed wing walls to the side. The ground floor and wing walls are of rendered masonry construction, {{while the first}} storey decorative gable is formed in pressed metal sheeting over timber. The ground floor has a centrally placed open entrance, over which is a cantilevered awning with pressed metal detailing. There are two symmetrically placed windows with decorative architraves. The window {{on the south side}} is a 6:9 pane <b>timber</b> vertical <b>sliding</b> sash, the window on the north side is a 6:1 pane <b>timber</b> vertical <b>sliding</b> sash. The side wing walls are terminated by a pilaster with a decorative cap. The north wall which has a pair of vertical timber doors, acts purely as a screen wall with no building behind. The south wall has a 6:4 pane <b>timber</b> vertical <b>sliding</b> sash window and a timber door giving access to a store room.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{purchases}} of stock were slow, far {{too small to}} pay for construction. Thomas McKay offered to buy a considerable share of the shares in exchange for moving the northern terminus to industrial land he owned in New Edinburgh, further down the Ottawa River. This location {{was not nearly as}} practical for logging, as it required logs to be formed into booms to transit a <b>timber</b> <b>slide</b> at the Chaudière Falls, moved only a few kilometres, and then un-boomed and hoisted {{up to the top of}} the hills near where the French embassy stands today.|$|E
50|$|Work on {{the canal}} system {{remained}} stagnant until Confederation in 1867. This turned the Province of Canada's government into a federal body, {{and gave the}} new province of Ontario's government control over construction. However, lacking {{the power of the}} federal coffers, they could only afford small projects. Between confederation and 1879 they rebuilt the lock at Lindsay, which had been converted to a <b>timber</b> <b>slide,</b> and built new locks at Young's Point and Rosedale. These enlarged the continuous area served by the waterway, but still lacked any outlet to the major bodies of water.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Woburn, Massachusetts but moved to Canada with his parents while still young. He later joined the family {{business}} in the timber trade. Wright also served as {{justice of the peace}} and postmaster during the 1820s. In 1829, he built the first <b>timber</b> <b>slide</b> on the Ottawa River to transport logs past the Chaudière Falls. However, by 1840, a competing slide built on the opposite (Ontario) side of the river had won over most of the business. He also discovered a source of cement which was used {{in the construction of the}} Rideau Canal.|$|E
50|$|The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage {{describes}} it as a detached three-bay, two-storey house, built c. 1840, having a front porch, two-storey extension on the southern side, and u-plan hipped slate roof with rendered chimney stacks. Two-storey outbuildings are arranged around a rear courtyard, {{one of which is}} a former barn with stone steps leading to its western elevation. To the south-east is the remains of a red-brick walled garden. Square-profile entrance gate piers adjoin the roadway. Set within its own grounds, the <b>timber</b> <b>sliding</b> sash windows and extensive range of outbuildings add context to its setting.|$|R

50|$|He {{was born}} near Moresby, Cumbria, England in 1817 and studied there, coming to Jesus Island, Lower Canada {{with his father}} and two siblings, Robert and Mary Ann, in 1827 at ten years of age. The family later settled in Bytown, Upper Canada in 1832. Skead entered the lumber {{business}} in 1842, setting up operations on the Madawaska River. As a result of his experience in building <b>timber</b> <b>slides</b> along that river, he was contracted to design and build an advanced slide on the Ottawa River near Bytown. His lumber operations with his brother Robert expanded to include forests along the Mississippi River in Ontario.|$|R
50|$|One of a {{dozen or}} so {{significant}} tributaries of the Ottawa River, the Coulonge was used as a waterway by native North Americans and, later, by the coureurs des bois plying their independent trade in furs. In 1835, Scottish-born lumber baron George Bryson acquired timber rights to thousands of acres of forest in the area, including the 200 acre immediately surrounding the Grandes Chutes. To transport the squared timber safely past the falls and the 750 m gorge below, Bryson built a 1000 m-long <b>timber</b> <b>slide</b> (a wooden chute flowing with water diverted from the head of the falls) to the calmer waters near the confluence of the Coulonge and Ottawa rivers.|$|E
5000|$|By 1866, Fitzroy Harbour was a post {{village with}} a {{population}} of 200 of the Fitzroy Township, on the Ottawa river, {{at the head of the}} Duchesne lake navigation, on a small bay, dotted with beautiful islands. The picturesque Chats Falls, which form eleven falls, and plunge thirty-three feet is nearby. On the south side of the river, directly opposite the village, was the Government <b>timber</b> <b>slide.</b> The community had hydroelectroelectric power, manufacturing, three churches, built of stone: the Church of England, the Canada Presbyterian church, and the Roman Catholic church. The Fourth Division Court was held here and at Riddle's Corners, alternately. The Loyal Orange Lodge, No. 541, met at thc Orange Hall, on the first Friday in each month.|$|E
50|$|Philemon Wright, {{the founder}} of Gatineau, Quebec built the first timber raft, called Colombo, {{to go down the}} Ottawa River on June 11, 1806, taking 35 days to get to Montreal alone. It was manned by Philemon, his son Tiberius and two crewmen and they ended up at the Port of Quebec. The raft had to be broken up into cribs to clear the Long Sault Rapids (confusingly named, and now gone, but was near the {{historically}} significant Carillon Canal). He had an employee, Nicholas Sparks, who owned a lot of the land of early Ottawa, whose name later became associated with Sparks Street. The first <b>timber</b> <b>slide</b> on the Ottawa River was built by Philemon's son, Ruggles Wright, on the North Side near the Chaudière Falls following a visit to Scandinavia to learn of lumbering techniques there.|$|E
50|$|In 1831, John Jackson, an ex-Sergeant in {{the army}} and a miller in Perth was awarded the {{contract}} to build the canal. The route would lead from Perth to the mouth of the Tay River. The locks were to be smaller than those on the Rideau, only 27 by 6.1 m, and a depth in the channel of 1.1 m. This was a less expensive option and it was felt that it would accommodate most of the commercial traffic of the day. By the end of 1834, five locks, six dams (with <b>timber</b> <b>slides),</b> two swing bridges and several embankments were built. This became known as the First Tay Canal.|$|R
