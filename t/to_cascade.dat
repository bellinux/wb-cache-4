5|$|Astorias bridge crew called general {{quarters}} upon sighting the flares {{south of}} Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, {{shortly after the}} Japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around the ship, Astorias main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire. Astorias captain, awakened to find his ship in action, rushed to the bridge and ordered a ceasefire, fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued <b>to</b> <b>cascade</b> around his ship, the captain ordered firing resumed {{less than a minute}} later. Chōkai, however, had found the range, and Astoria was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire. Between 02:00 and 02:15, Aoba, Kinugasa, and Kako joined Chōkai in pounding Astoria, destroying the cruiser's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of Astorias remaining operational main gun turrets fired at Kinugasas searchlight, but missed and hit Chōkais forward turret, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls <b>to</b> <b>cascade</b> onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E

40|$|As the US {{power systems}} {{continue}} to increase in size and complexity, including the growth of smart grids, larger blackouts due <b>to</b> <b>cascading</b> outages become more likely. Grid congestion {{is often associated with}} a <b>cascading</b> collapse leading <b>to</b> a major blackout. Such a collapse is characterized by a self-sustaining sequence of line outages followed by a topology breakup of the network. This paper addresses the implementation and testing of a process for N-k contingency analysis and sequential cascading outage simulation in order <b>to</b> identify potential <b>cascading</b> modes. A modeling approach described in this paper offers a unique capability to identify initiating events that may lead <b>to</b> <b>cascading</b> outages. It predicts the development of cascading events by identifying and visualizing potential cascading tiers. The proposed approach was implemented using a 328 -bus simplified SERC power system network. The results of the study indicate that initiating events and possible cascading chains may be identified, ranked and visualized. This approach may be used to improve the reliability of a transmission grid and reduce its vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>cascading</b> outages...|$|R

25|$|Over {{the last}} 29million years, the Canadian Cascade Arc has been erupting {{a chain of}} volcanoes along the British Columbia Coast. At least four {{volcanic}} zones in British Columbia are related <b>to</b> <b>Cascade</b> Arc volcanism.

They were formed during different geological periods, separated by millions of years, and occur in three regions {{referred to as the}} back-arc, main-arc and fore-arc. The youngest of the three belts has been sporadically active over the last 4.0–3.0million years, with the latest eruption having taken place possibly in the last 1,000years. About 2,350years ago, a major explosive eruption occurred, sending a massive ash column into the atmosphere. This is recognized as the largest volcanic eruption throughout Canada within the last 10,000years.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{cascading}} failures in the risk and reliability assessment of complex infrastructure systems. Conventional reliability assessment is limited to connectivity analysis and does not include {{the effect of}} increased flow demand or flow capacity of existing network components. Network flows are associated with congestion-based disruptions which can worsen connectivity-based predictions of performance. Susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>cascading</b> overloads is modeled with a tolerance parameter that measures current flow against flow capacity. In this study, natural hazards and targeted disruptions constitute the triggering events for cascading failures. It is observed that improvements in component tolerance alone do not ensure robustness <b>to</b> <b>cascading</b> failures. Topological changes are also needed <b>to</b> improve <b>cascading</b> robustness at practical tolerance levels. Interestingly, targeted disruptions of single components can affect network performance more severely than earthquake or lightning episodes. In the event of infrequent natural hazard disruptions, cascading failures do not develop due to significant damage during the triggering event phase. 1...|$|R

500|$|Past I-196, M-11 curves to run east–west {{and becomes}} 28th Street. Wilson {{continues}} southwards {{as a local}} road and 28th Street is the route through Grandville and Wyoming. Chicago Drive runs under 28th Street in Grandville; there is a ramp from eastbound Chicago Drive to eastbound 28th Street, but all other connections are through the [...] "28th Street Cutoff" [...] {{to the east of}} the grade-separated junction. Continuing eastward through Wyoming, M-11 passes through that city's central business district. The highway intersects US Highway 131 and crosses into Grand Rapids at Division Avenue. Near Kalamazoo Avenue, 28th Street passes the Indian Hills Golf Course. From Breton Avenue eastward, 28th Street is dominated by retail establishments as it continues into Kentwood. M-11 meets an intersection with East Beltline Avenue near the Woodland Mall. East Beltline carries M-37 through {{the eastern side of the}} Grand Rapids metro area, and M-44 north of 28th Street.

500|$|M-37 {{through the}} south side of the Grand Rapids area was realigned in late 1949 or early 1950. After the change, the highway follows Broadmoor Avenue to 28th Street and 28th Street west to its former routing along Kalamazoo Avenue. In 1953, this routing was shifted further when M-37 was rerouted to run north on East Beltline Avenue {{concurrent}} with US131 and M-21 <b>to</b> <b>Cascade</b> Road. There it turned west along Cascade Road and Fulton Street into downtown back to its existing alignment. During that same time frame, the gap in the routing between M-55 and Mesick was eliminated. The highway was moved to bypass Sparta, Kent City and Casnovia to the southwest in the 1962. Another change around the same time frame shifted M-37's routing through Grand Rapids again. This time, M-37 was rerouted to follow M-11/M-21 along 28th Street to the US131 freeway north to I-96 and back to Alpine Avenue. The final Grand Rapids routing change was made in 1969 when M-37 was moved to its current course along East Beltline Avenue and I-96. This change resulted in a concurrency with the southernmost end of M-44 that was later removed in 1977 when M-44 was truncated northward. A proposed new routing near Comstock Park in the 1970s would have removed M-37 from Alpine Avenue. The new highway, if built, would have run southeastward from the Alpine Avenue split to US131 near 6Mile Road. In 2008, the northernmost [...] on the Old Mission Peninsula were designated what is now a Pure Michigan Scenic Byway by MDOT.

In particular, we analyze a simple, yet fundamental distributed flow model: current flow in random resistor networks. By the tuning of control parameter β and by considering two general cases of relative node processing capabilities as well as the effect of bandwidth, we show the dependence of transport efficiency upon the correlations between the topology and weights. By studying the severity of cascades for different control parameter β, we find that network resilience <b>to</b> <b>cascading</b> overloads and network throughput is optimal for the same value of β over the range of node capacities and available bandwidth...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{power grids}} are {{vulnerable}} <b>to</b> <b>cascading</b> failures {{that can lead}} to large blackouts. Detection and prevention of cascading failures in power grids is impor- tant. Currently, grid operators mainly monitor the state (loading level) of individual components in power grids. The complex architecture of power grids, with many interdependencies, makes it difficult to aggregate data provided by local compo- nents in a timely manner and meaningful way: monitoring the resilience with re- spect <b>to</b> <b>cascading</b> failures of an operational power grid is a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge. The main ideas behind the paper are that (i) a robustness metric based on both the topology and the operative state of the power grid can be used to quantify power grid robustness and (ii) a new proposed a distributed computation method with self-stabilizing properties can be used to achieving near real-time monitoring of the robustness of the power grid. Our con- tributions thus provide insight into the resilience with respect <b>to</b> <b>cascading</b> failures of a dynamic operational power grid at runtime, in a scalable and robust way. Com- putations are pushed into the network, making the results available at each node, allowing automated distributed control mechanisms to be implemented on top...|$|R
