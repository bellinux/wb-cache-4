40|$|The {{crown of}} a human tooth has an outer layer of highly-mineralized tissue called enamel, beneath which is dentin, a less-mineralized tissue which forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth-crown and root. The {{composition}} and structure of enamel and dentin are different, resulting in different thermal properties. This gives an opportunity to characterize enamel and dentin from their thermal properties and to visually present the findings as a <b>thermal</b> <b>map.</b> The <b>thermal</b> properties of demineralized enamel and dentin may also be sufficiently different from sound tissue to be seen on a <b>thermal</b> <b>map,</b> underpinning future <b>thermal</b> assessment of caries. The primary aim of this novel study was to produce a <b>thermal</b> <b>map</b> of a sound, human tooth-slice to visually characterize enamel and dentin. The secondary aim was to map a human tooth-slice with demineralized enamel and dentin to consider future diagnostic potential of <b>thermal</b> <b>maps</b> for caries-detection. Two human slices of teeth, one sound and one demineralized from a natural carious lesion, were cooled on ice, then transferred to a hotplate at 30 °C where the rewarming-sequence was captured by an infra-red thermal camera. Calculation of thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity was undertaken, and two methods of data-processing used customized software to produce <b>thermal</b> <b>maps</b> from the <b>thermal</b> characteristic-time-to-relaxation and heat-exchange. The two types of <b>thermal</b> <b>maps</b> characterized enamel and dentin.

40|$|Vias, is a {{promising}} technology for future integrated circuits. However, large temperature gradients may exacerbate early-lifefailures {{to the extent}} that the commercialization of 3 D Stacked ICs is challenged. The effective detection of these early-lifefailures requires that burn-in is performed when the IC’s temperatures comply with the <b>thermal</b> <b>maps</b> that properly specify the temperature gradients. In this paper, two methods that efficiently generate and maintain the specified <b>thermal</b> <b>maps</b> are proposed. The <b>thermal</b> <b>maps</b> are achieved by applying heating and cooling intervals to the chips under test through test access mechanisms. Therefore, no external heating system is required. The scheduling of the heating and cooling intervals is based on thermal simulations. The schedule generation is guided by functions that are derived from the temperature equations.

Using pulsed thermal imaging, we heat-stimulated surrogate delaminations in reinforced concrete and asphalt-concrete slabs. Using a dual-band infrared camera system, we measured thermal inertia responses of Styrofoam implants under 5 cm of asphalt, 5 cm of concrete, and 10 cm of asphalt and concrete. We compared <b>thermal</b> <b>maps</b> from solar-heated concrete and asphalt-concrete slabs with <b>thermal</b> inertia <b>maps</b> from flash-heated concrete and asphalt-concrete slabs. <b>Thermal</b> inertia <b>mapping</b> is a tool for visualizing and quantifying subsurface defects. Physically, thermal inertia {{is a measure of}} the resistance of the bridge deck to temperature change. Experimentally, it is determined from the inverse slope of the surface temperature versus the inverse square root of time. Mathematically, thermal inertia is the square root of the product of thermal conductivity, density, and heat capacity. <b>Thermal</b> inertia <b>mapping</b> distinguishes delaminated decks which have below-average thermal inertias from normal or shaded decks.

50|$|Nanoscale {{materials}} are becoming widely investigated for their many advantages in commercial electronics. In particular, these {{materials are}} known for excellent mobility as well as ability to carry high current densities. In addition, new applications have been realized for these materials including thermoelectrics, solar cells, fuel cells, etc. However, significant decrease in size scale in conjunction with increases in current density and device density leads to extreme temperature rises in these devices. These temperature fluctuations can influence electrical behavior and lead to device failure. Therefore, these thermal effects must be studied carefully, in situ, to realize nanoscale electronics. SJEM {{can be used for}} this purpose, allowing for in situ high-resolution <b>thermal</b> <b>mapping.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thermal inertia {{values for}} most of the Martian surface are {{inversely}} related to albedo. Thus, high albedo areas have low thermal inertias indicating surfaces that are covered with dust and other fine granular material. The dark gray, low albedo surfaces have high thermal inertias more typical of consolidated rock. However, thermal inertia values are not high enough to indicate widespread outcroppings are common on Mars. Even the rockier areas appear to be mixed with a significant amount of loose material. Data from the Infrared <b>Thermal</b> <b>Mapping</b> (IRTM) experiment on the Viking orbiters identified areas of high thermal inertia throughout the interior of Valles Marineris and the chaotic terrain, suggesting that these areas contain a relatively large number of blocks and boulders.|$|E
50|$|Miniaturization {{of modern}} {{integrated}} circuits {{has led to}} hugely increased current densities and therefore, self-heating. In particular, vias, or vertical interconnects, experience extreme local temperature fluctuations, which can strongly influence the electrical performance of multi-level interconnect structures. In addition, these large, highly localized temperature fluctuations cause repeated stress gradients on the vias, ultimately leading to device failure. Traditional thermometry techniques use electrical characterization to determine resistivity and estimate the average temperature along an interconnect. However, this method {{is not able to}} characterize local temperature rises which may be significantly higher near vias due to their extremely high aspect ratios. Optical methods are diffraction limited to resolutions greater than 1 um, far larger than most modern vias feature sizes. SJEM has been used to do in situ <b>thermal</b> <b>mapping</b> of these devices with lateral resolution in the sub-0.1 um range.|$|E

40|$|The ever-aggressive {{increase}} in performance {{and integration of}} CMOS ICs is leading to higher power dissipation and power density, with a consequent increase of the circuit junction temperature together with the generation of non-uniform <b>thermal</b> <b>maps</b> and hot-spots. Moreover, it has been predicted that technology scaling will bring static power to a significant {{fraction of the total}} power, complicating further this analysis due to the exponential dependence of leakage with temperature. This scenario represents an important challenge in circuit design {{due to the lack of}} accurate and compact thermal models capable of describing not only the impact of non-uniform <b>thermal</b> <b>maps</b> on circuit performance, but also on static leakage for an accurate power modeling. In this paper we analyze the influence of considering the leakage power contribution to the circuit <b>thermal</b> <b>map</b> and therefore on its overall power dissipation and performance. Based on the analysis of two key thermal parameters (the mean and the maximum junction temperatures) we derive design guidelines to reduce the impact of hot-spots on circuit performance and reliability using an entropy-based cost function for thermal optimization.

50|$|The {{instruments}} of the orbiter {{consisted of two}} vidicon cameras for imaging (VIS), an infrared spectrometer for water vapor mapping (MAWD) and infrared radiometers for <b>thermal</b> <b>mapping</b> (IRTM). The orbiter primary mission ended {{at the beginning of}} solar conjunction on November 5, 1976. The extended mission commenced on December 14, 1976, after solar conjunction. Operations included close approaches to Phobos in February 1977. The periapsis was reduced to 300 km on March 11, 1977. Minor orbit adjustments were done occasionally {{over the course of the}} mission, primarily to change the walk rate — the rate at which the areocentric longitude changed with each orbit, and the periapsis was raised to 357 km on July 20, 1979. On August 7, 1980, Viking 1 Orbiter was running low on attitude control gas and its orbit was raised from 357 × 33943 km to 320 × 56000 km to prevent impact with Mars and possible contamination until the year 2019. Operations were terminated on August 17, 1980, after 1485 orbits. A 2009 analysis concluded that, while the possibility that Viking 1 had impacted Mars could not be ruled out, it was most likely still in orbit.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>mapping</b> uses IR {{thermometry}} {{to measure}} road pavement temperature {{at a high}} resolution to identify and to map sections of the road network prone to ice occurrence. However, measurements are time-consuming and ultimately only provide a snapshot of road conditions {{at the time of}} the survey. As such, there is a need for surveys to be restricted to a series of specific climatic conditions during winter. Typically, five to six surveys are used, but it is questionable whether the full range of atmospheric conditions is adequately covered. This work investigates the role of statistics in adding value to <b>thermal</b> <b>mapping</b> data. Principal components analysis is used to interpolate between individual <b>thermal</b> <b>mapping</b> surveys to build a thermal map (or even a road surface temperature forecast), for a wider range of climatic conditions than that permitted by traditional surveys.

40|$|Abstract—As chips become faster, {{the need}} to test them at their {{intended}} speed of operation has been recognized. High-speed operation, together with the higher switching activity typically induced during test, {{can result in a}} die-thermal distribution significantly different from that achieved during normal operation. Differences in <b>thermal</b> <b>map</b> distribution between normal- and test-mode operations give rise to a nonuniform impact on the relative path delay within logic blocks. The impact of test-induced hot spots may artificially slow down non-critical paths or speed-up critical ones with respect to the clock making the whole die to fail (pass) delay testing for a good (bad) part. The non-uniform thermal-induced delay is especially important for clock circuitry, the most critical block, which is impacted even if exact zero-skew clock routing algorithms are adopted. In this work we analyze the impact of <b>thermal</b> <b>map</b> temperature changes on the clock delay identifying a new delay-fault mechanism. We propose a technique to minimize the impact of different test- and normal-mode <b>thermal</b> <b>maps</b> by making the clock tree speed independent of temperature gradients. This technique allows applying confidently delay test patterns to the die regardless of the thermalmap test-induced modification.

40|$|During {{the winter}} period ice {{is likely to}} form on roads, making {{pavement}} surfaces slippery and increasing accident risk. Road surface temperature (RST) {{is one of the}} most important parameters in ice formation. The LIFE+ “CLEANROADS” project aims to forecast RSTs in advance in order to support road maintenance services in the timely and effective preparation of preventive anti-icing measures. This support is provided through a novel MDSS (Maintenance Decision Support System). The final goal of the project is to quantitatively demonstrate that the implemented MDSS is capable to minimize the consumption of chemical anti-icing reagents (e. g. sodium chloride) and the associated environmental (water and air) impact while maintaining the current high levels of road safety. In the CLEAN-ROADS system RSTs have been forecast by applying the numerical model METRo (Model of the Environment and Temperature of Roads) to a network of RWIS (Road Weather Information System) stations installed on a test route in the Adige Valley (Italy). This forecast is however local and does not take into account typical peculiarities along road network, such as the presence of road sections that are particularly prone to ice formation. <b>Thermal</b> <b>mapping,</b> i. e. the acquisition of mobile RST measurements through infrared thermometry, permits to (i) identify and map those sections, and (ii) extend the forecast from a RWIS station to adjacent areas. The processing of <b>thermal</b> <b>mapping</b> signals is however challenging because of random variations in the road surface emissivity. To overcome this we have acquired several <b>thermal</b> <b>mapping</b> traces along the test route during winter seasons 2014 - 2015 and 2015 - 2016. We have then defined a “characteristic” thermal fingerprint as a function of all its historical <b>thermal</b> <b>mapping</b> signals, and used it to spatialize local METRo forecasts. Preliminary results suggest the high potential of such a technique for winter road applications...|$|E
