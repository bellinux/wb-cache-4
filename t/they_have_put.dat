Presenting the award, judges said, [...] "First Great Western provides an extensive network of commuter, regional, local and intercity trains.

[...] It will be run with three mini-Synods, one a week, for the three-week duration. In week one, the bishops will discuss challenges facing the family, in week two the topic will be the vocation of the family, and the final week is devoted to the mission of the family today. [...] The final mini-Synod will contain some of the most contentious issues, and the small group sessions will take an entire week.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 11, [...] "The Fall of the Meritocracy", {{examines}} falling {{standards in}} British education. Hitchens cites {{the abolition of}} grammar schools {{as one of the}} main causes, which has also resulted in a decline in social mobility. Hitchens claims egalitarians deny these consequences and that comprehensive education has failed. Hitchens also quotes a 2000 study, which asserted that [...] "the general lowering of standards and rigour since the end of selection {{is one of the main}} reasons behind the current drive to devalue examinations". Hitchens asks why, [...] "the educated, conscious servants of the state should seek to pretend that educational standards are rising when the opposite is true. The answer is that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> equality before education". Chapter 12, [...] "'The age of the train'", outlines how the Conservative and Labour parties facilitated the dismantling of much of Britain's rail network. Hitchens asserts this is evidence that the [...] "Tory Party does not love Britain, any more than the Labour Party loves the poor". The chapter also provides a conservative argument against mass car ownership, saying that [...] "roads destroy and distort established ways of living", while [...] "the traditional English town, with its defined centre, ancient street pattern and comfortable shape, was not destroyed by the coming of the railway. It was enhanced". In Chapter 13, [...] "A Comfortable Hotel on the Road to Damascus", Hitchens explores how since the 2001 September 11 attacks and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, certain commentators on the left realigned with an American neoconservative position, which, [...] "delivers him [...] to another portion of the 'centre ground', one where foreign policy is the only thing worth discussing, and where former conservatives and former Leftists can mingle in happy communion", and allows [...] "political conservatism to soothe its tribal base by appearing strong overseas, while failing to be anything of the kind at home".|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, {{although}} they led {{the table before}} {{the final round of}} matches, Lancashire were again runners-up in the County Championship. After being knocked out of the Twenty20 competition in the group states and performing poorly in the other one-day competitions early in the season, supporters started to become discontented with the captain and coach. Sussex ended up winning the title as Lancashire lost their final match of the competition against Surrey. Chris Adams, the Sussex captain, said [...] "you played well, you had a hard season, there's no shame in your performance and you nearly did it". After the match against Surrey, Chilton was in tears and said [...] "I'm extremely proud of what our guys have achieved though. As captain I'm privileged to have seen the efforts <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> in. To get close to our target was a phenomenal effort but the lads are just broken. Our players have risen to an almighty challenge and to come so close is an enormous effort". After three years as captain, Mark Chilton stepped down in October 2007 and was replaced by Stuart Law who is the most successful captain in Australian domestic cricket. However his captaincy lasted for just one season, and Lancashire again failed to claim any silverware. At {{the end of the season}} Law and veteran player Cork were released, with Chapple replacing Law as captain. In December 2008, Watkinson's job as cricket manager was changed to that of director of cricket– a job which would focus solely on aspects of cricket, rather than the traditional all-encompassing job of general team management. The move was explained by the club chairman as an effort to modernise. In February 2009, it was announced that Peter Moores– who had been sacked as England coach the previous month– would be Lancashire's new coach and had a three-year contract. In 2011 Chapple and Moores took Lancashire to their first outright first-class county championship title since 1934, {{although they}} had shared the title with Surrey in 1950. Despite being reigning champions in 2012, Lancashire had a poor season and were relegated to the Second Division. In 2013 they bounced straight back to Division 1 by winning the second division championship with a game to spare. They were once again relegated to Division 2 on the last day of the 2014 season after failing to win a tightly fought game against Middlesex. Ashley Giles (formerly of Warwickshire and England) was appointed as Director of Cricket and Head Coach after Mike Watkinson stepped down from the role in October 2014.|$|E
