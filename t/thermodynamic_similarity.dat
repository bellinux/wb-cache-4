The design methods of a wide spectre of the physico-chemical properties of the molecular non-organic compounds (MNC) are more effective than those known ones.

The developed methods and the physico-chemical properties of the MNC, to by determined with its aid, have cosisted the base of the four reference issues. They allow to fill the shortcoming data with the high validity in the development and investigation of the new processes of the chemical and metallurgical technologies (critical parameters, the properties of the liquid and vapour in the line of saturation, thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of substances).

40|$|Human novel reductase 1 (NR 1) is an NADPH {{dependent}} diflavin oxidoreductase {{related to}} cytochrome P 450 reductase (CPR). The FAD/NADPH- and FMN-binding domains of NR 1 have been expressed and purified and their redox properties studied by stopped-flow and steady-state kinetic methods, and by potentiometry. The midpoint reduction potentials of the oxidized/semiquinone (− 315 ± 5 mV) and semiquinone/dihydroquinone (− 365 ± 15 mV) couples of the FAD/NADPH domain {{are similar to}} those for the FAD/NADPH domain of human CPR, but the rate of hydride transfer from NADPH to the FAD/NADPH domain of NR 1 is ≈  200 -fold slower. Hydride transfer is rate-limiting in steady-state reactions of the FAD/NADPH domain with artificial redox acceptors. Stopped-flow studies indicate that hydride transfer from the FAD/NADPH domain of NR 1 to NADP+ is faster than hydride transfer in the physiological direction (NADPH to FAD), consistent with the measured reduction potentials of the FAD couples [midpoint potential for FAD redox couples is − 340 mV, cf− 320 mV for NAD(P) H]. The midpoint reduction potentials for the flavin couples in the FMN domain are − 146 ± 5 mV (oxidized/semiquinone) and − 305 ± 5 mV (semiquinone/dihydroquinone). The FMN oxidized/semiquinone couple indicates stabilization of the FMN semiquinone, consistent with (a) a need to transfer electrons from the FAD/NADPH domain to the FMN domain, and (b) the thermodynamic properties of the FMN domain in CPR and nitric oxide synthase. Despite overall structural resemblance of NR 1 and CPR, our studies reveal <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>similarities</b> but major kinetic differences in the electron transfer reactions catalysed by the flavin-binding domains...|$|R
40|$|A {{perfectly}} rational decision-maker {{chooses the}} best action {{with the highest}} util-ity gain from a set of possible actions. The optimality principles that describe such decision processes do {{not take into account}} the computational costs of find-ing the optimal action. Bounded rational decision-making addresses this problem by specifically trading off information-processing costs and expected utility. In-terestingly, a similar trade-off between energy and entropy arises when describing changes in <b>thermodynamic</b> systems. This <b>similarity</b> has been recently used to describe bounded rational agents. Crucially, this framework assumes that the en-vironment does not change while the decision-maker is computing the optimal policy. When this requirement is not fulfilled, the decision-maker will suffer inef-ficiencies in utility, that arise because the current policy is optimal for an environ-ment in the past. Here we borrow concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics to quantify these inefficiencies and illustrate with simulations its relationship with computational resources. ...|$|R

40|$|For a {{description}} {{and analysis of}} the flow they consider the conservation equations of the two phases separately, but in thermal and mechanical equilibrium, coupled by the itnerface shear forces (two fluid model, drift flux model). Coupling may be weak or strong, depending on Froude and Mach numbers of the flow. The fluid is highly compressible, not because the individual phases move at such speeds that their individual density changes are significant but because evapiration (phase change) results in large density changes of the system at moderate pressure or temperature changes once flashing occurs. The slip between the phases is caused by unequal wall shear stress, acceleration of the fluid or gravitational forces and is hindered by the interface interaction. if they denote by {gamma} the ratio of the liquid density to the vapor density and by {sigma} the ratio of the vapor speed to the liquid speed they find that in horizontal flows {sigma} = {gamma}{sup 1 / 2 } yields the maximum slip (neglecting acceleration effects) that can be reached with no interface force acting (assuming equal friction coefficients for both phases at the wall). If one investigates the conditions of <b>thermodynamic</b> flow <b>similarity</b> between different substances in two phase flow, one finds that the latent heat of vaporization is the principal controlling parameter. Thus, a 5 cm diameter test section in two phase R- 114, at room temperature, corresponds to a 30 cm diameter duct in water-steam at boiling conditions at high temperatures such as encountered in geothermal and other power production systems...|$|R
40|$|From general perspectives, {{there is}} no {{conceptual}} gap between the structural and orientational glasses. Both kinds of glasses expose universal features during primary relaxation (Low Temp. Phys. 33, 617 (2007)). However, in spite of much efforts made to observe generic two-level systems (TLS) in polymers, organic liquids, and plastic crystals via <b>thermodynamic</b> measurements, no <b>similarity</b> unifying glass formers was established. Re-analyzing a number of experimental studies, it is revealed that no renormalization conditions imposed on occupation numbers of structural units, relaxing to the glass state, were taken into consideration by the experimentalists. In this study, the effective-cluster approach is applied to configurational (excess liquid-over-solid) entropy measured in both supercooled liquids and crystals through the heat capacity. As the result, new relationships between the observable thermodynamic and dynamic characteristics are found for molecular liquids, polymers, and networks {{on the basis of}} available from the literature data. Thereby, new constraints of structure relaxation are shown to give strong evidence for the existence of TLS-type embryos of glassy structure in all studied glass formers...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to describe flows with particles e. g. Lattice-Gas Automata (LGA), Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) or smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). These approaches {{do not use}} fixed grids on which the Navier-Stokes equations are solved via e. g. finite volume method. The flow is simulated using a multitude of particles or particle density distributions, which interacts and due to statistical laws and an even more fundamental approach than the Navier-Stokes equation, the averaged flow variables can be derived. After a short summary {{of the most popular}} particle methods the new DMPC (Dissipative Multiple Particles Collision) approach will be presented. The DMPC-model eliminates some of the weak points of the established particle methods and shows high potential for more accurate CFD solution especially in areas where standard CFD tools still have problems (e. g. aero-acoustics). The DMPC-model deals with discrete circular particles and calculates the detailed collision process (micro scale) of several overlapping particles. With <b>thermodynamic,</b> statistical and <b>similarity</b> laws global (large scale) flow variables can be derived. The model is so far 2 d and the particles can move in every direction in the 2 d plane depending on the forces acting on it. The possible overlap between neighbouring particles and multi-particle interactions are important features of this model. A freeware software is developed and published under www. cfd 2 k. eu.

40|$|When {{applied to}} matter and {{antimatter}} states, the Pauli master equation (PME) may have two forms: time-symmetric, which is conventional, and time-antisymmetric, which is {{suggested in the}} present work. The symmetric and antisymmetric forms correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric extensions of thermodynamics from matter to antimatter [...] - this is demonstrated by proving the corresponding H-theorem. The two forms {{are based on the}} <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>similarity</b> of matter and antimatter and differ only in the directions of thermodynamic time for matter and antimatter (the same in the time-symmetric case and the opposite in the time-antisymmetric case). We demonstrate that, while the symmetric form of PME predicts an equi-balance between matter and antimatter, the antisymmetric form of PME favours full conversion of antimatter into matter. At this stage, it is impossible to make an experimentally justified choice in favour of the symmetric or antisymmetric versions of thermodynamics since we have no experience of thermodynamic properties of macroscopic objects made of antimatter, but experiments of this kind may become possible in the future.

At pH 7 and 25 degrees C, the midpoint {{potential for the}} FAD/FADH 2 couple was determined by c. d. potentiometry to be - 280 +/- 10 mV (n = 2).

40|$|The {{properties}} and physical {{interpretation of the}} electron diffusion coefficient, Dn, observed in nanostructured semiconductors and dye-sensitized solar cells by small perturbation electrical and electrooptical techniques are investigated. The chemical diffusion coefficient {{is defined as the}} product of a thermodynamic factor (that accounts for the effect of nonideal statistics in a gradient of chemical potential) and a jump diffusion coefficient (that depends on average hopping distances and rates). The <b>thermodynamic</b> and kinetic <b>similarities,</b> as well as the differences, between interacting ions in the lattice and electrons in nanostructured semiconductors are discussed. From these considerations, the chemical diffusion coefficient of electrons for multiple trapping transport in nanoporous dye solar cells can be calculated indirectly, and the results are in agreement with the reduction of the kinetic-transport equations in the quasistatic approximation. The chemical diffusion coefficient in several models for electrons is discussed: for a wide but stationary distribution of sites energies, giving the Fermi-level dependent Dn [Fisher et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 949] and for the enhancement of the diffusivity by effect of electrostatic shift of energy levels [Vanmaekelbergh et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 1999, 103, 747]. This last model is shown to correspond to the mean-field approximation to interaction in a lattice gas. A general expression containing all of these cases is provided, and several important consequences of the distinction between macroscopic diffusion and single particle random walk are pointed out. 1...|$|R
40|$|More than 800 {{points of}} {{critical}} heat flux (CHF) data were measured from three test rigs (UO, MR- 7 A and MR- 1 A loops). The UO loop is a multi-fluid boiling loop located at the University of Ottawa, in which HFC- 134 a, HCFC- 123, HCFC- 22, CFC- 12 and CFC- 11 have been tested. The CHF data of HFC- 134 a and HCFC- 123 are the first ever published for these fluids. HFC- 134 a and HFC- 123 are non-ozone and low-ozone depletion fluids. The CHF data from the UO loop cover the range of mass flux from 1 to 4 Mg m- 2 s- 1, pressure from 7 to 10 MPa of water-equivalent (water-equivalent {{is defined as the}} same dimensionless parameters, e. g. ρ f/ρ g and Ψ k, of flow condition for non-aqueous fluids as those for water) and heated length from 0. 5 to 1 meter. The inner diameter of the test section is 4. 2 mm. The MR- 7 A and MR- 1 A loops are the refrigerant and boiling water loops, respectively, located at the Chalk River Laboratories of AECL. In the MR- 7 A loop, CHF data were measured using HCFC- 22 as a coolant for the following conditions: mass flux: 1 - 8 Mg m- 2 s- 1, pressure: 7 and 10 MPa (water-equiv.), heated length: 0. 67 - 1. 61 m, and inner diameter: 4. 38 and 8 mm. The CHF data for water from the MR- 1 A loop cover mass flux: 2. 5 - 8 Mg m- 2 s- 1, pressure: 7 and 10 MPa, heated length: 1. 75 m, an inner diameter: 8 mm. HFC- 134 a, HCFC- 123 and HCFC- 22 are found suitable to replace the CFC's in the CHF experiment for water CHF simulation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{positively}} charged protein transduction {{domain of the}} HIV- 1 TAT protein (TAT-PTD; residues 47 – 57 of TAT) rapidly translocates across the plasma membrane of living cells. This property is exploited for the delivery of proteins, drugs, and genes into cells. The mechanism of this translocation is, however, not yet understood. Recent theories for translocation suggest binding of the protein transduction domain (PTD) to extracellular glycosaminoglycans as a possible mechanism. We have studied the binding equilibrium between TAT-PTD and three different glycosaminoglycans with high sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry and provide the first quantitative thermodynamic description. The polysulfonated macromolecules were found to exhibit multiple identical binding sites for TAT-PTD with only small differences between the three species {{as far as the}} thermodynamic parameters are concerned. Heparan sulfate (HS, molecular weight, 14. 2 ± 2 kDa) has 6. 3 ± 1. 0 independent binding sites for TAT-PTD which are characterized by a binding constant K 0 =(6. 0 ± 0. 6) × 105 M− 1 and a reaction enthalpy ΔHpep 0 =− 4. 6 ± 1. 0 kcal/mol at 28 °C. The binding affinity, ΔGpep 0, is determined to equal extent by enthalpic and entropic contributions. The HS-TAT-PTD complex formation entails a positive heat capacity change of ΔCp 0 =+ 135 cal/mol peptide, which is characteristic of a charge neutralization reaction. This is in contrast to hydrophobic binding reactions which display a large negative heat capacity change. The stoichiometry of 6 – 7 TAT-PTD molecules per HS corresponds to an electric charge neutralization. Light scattering data demonstrate a maximum scattering intensity at this stoichiometric ratio, the intensity of which depends on the order of mixing of the two components. The data suggest cross-linking and/or aggregation of HS-TAT-PTD complexes. Two other glycosaminoglycans, namely heparin and chondroitin sulfate B, were also studied with isothermal titration calorimetry. The thermodynamic parameters are K 0 =(6. 0 ± 0. 8) × 105 M− 1 and ΔHpep 0 =− 5. 1 ± 0. 7 kcal/mol for heparin and K 0 =(2. 5 ± 0. 5) × 105 M− 1 and ΔHpep 0 =− 3. 2 ± 0. 4 kcal/mol for chondroitin sulfate B at 28 °C. The close <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>similarity</b> of the three binding molecules also implies a close structural relationship. The ubiquitous occurrence of glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface together with their tight and rapid interaction with the TAT protein transduction domain makes complex formation a strong candidate as the primary step of protein translocation...|$|E
