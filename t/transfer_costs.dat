25|$|The Department of Defense's Defense Logistics Agency {{is charged}} with off-loading 13,000 MRAPs to 780 {{domestic}} law enforcement agencies on waiting lists for vehicles. The DLA does not transfer property to the agencies, so the vehicles are allocated to the agencies with costs picked up by them or the state, while the vehicles remain {{the property of the}} Defense Department. To receive an armored vehicle, a requesting agency has to meet certain criteria, including justification for use (such as for shooting incidents, SWAT operations and drug interdiction), geographical area and multi-jurisdiction use, the ability to pay for repairs and maintenance, and security and restricted access to the vehicle. Police departments and other agencies in the U.S. can acquire MRAP vehicles through the DLA's 1033 program, which redistributes no longer needed military equipment to state and municipal agencies. Some police departments have picked up surplus MRAPs with no <b>transfer</b> <b>costs</b> or fees. Domestic agencies plan to use them in disaster relief roles, as they can go through flooded areas unlike normal police armored vehicles, and provide security in response to terrorist threats. Some MRAPs used by police forces often have the machine gun turret removed and are repainted black.|$|E
2500|$|When {{government}} statisticians compile gross {{fixed capital}} formation (GFCF) figures, they usually add in [...] "ownership transfer costs" [...] (fees, taxes, charges, insurance costs, installation costs etc.) {{associated with the}} acquisition of a fixed asset put in place.

40|$|A <b>cost</b> <b>transfer</b> is an {{accounting}} entry that <b>transfers</b> <b>costs</b> between accounts to correct {{an accounting}} or clerical {{error in the}} original entry. A proper system of internal financial accounting control with respect to <b>cost</b> <b>transfers</b> dictates that such accounting entries be properly documented, explained and appropriate under the circumstances.

The guideline also establishes {{the responsibility of the}} Principal Investigator (PI) to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the <b>cost</b> <b>transfers</b> made to or from their sponsored project accounts. In addition, the Departmental Administrator is responsible to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the <b>cost</b> <b>transfers</b> made to or from departmental funds.

40|$|Nowadays, Web Services (WSs) play an {{increasingly}} important role in Web data management solutions, since they offer a practical solution for accessing and manipulating data sources spanning administrative domains. Nevertheless, they are notoriously slow and transferring large data volumes across WSs becomes the main bottleneck in such WSbased applications. This paper deals {{with the problem of}} minimizing at runtime, in a self-managing way, the data <b>transfer</b> <b>cost</b> of a WS encapsulating a data source. To reduce the <b>transfer</b> <b>cost,</b> the data volume is typically divided into blocks. In this case, response time exhibits a quadratic-like, non-linear behavior with regards to the block size; as such, minimizing the <b>transfer</b> <b>cost</b> entails finding the optimum block size. This situation is encountered in several systems, such as WS Management Systems (WSMSs) for DBMS-like data management over wide area service-based networks, and WSs for accessing and integrating traditional DBMSs. The main challenges in this problem include (i) the unavailability of an analytical model; (ii) the presence of noise, which incurs local minima; (iii) the volatility of the environment, which results into a moving optimum operating point; and (iv) the requirements for fast convergenc...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of P 2 P systems is to perform load balancing efciently. A distributed hash table (DHT) ab-straction, heterogeneous nodes, and non uniform distri-bution of objects cause load imbalance in structured P 2 P overlay networks. Several solutions are suggested {{to solve this problem}} but they have some restrictions. They as-sume the homogeneous capabilities of nodes, unawareness of the link latency during transferring load and imposing logical structures to collect and reassign load. This paper presents a distributed load balancing algorithm with topol-ogy awareness using the concept of virtual servers. In our proposed approach, each node collects neighborhood load information from physically close nodes and reassigns vir-tual servers to overlay nodes according to topology of un-derlying network. Consequently, it provides rapid conver-gence on load balance and reduces the load <b>transfer</b> <b>cost.</b> Moreover, our parametric algorithm increases the quality of load balancing among close nodes of overlay and also pro-vides a new tradeoff between the quality of load balancing and load <b>transfer</b> <b>cost</b> among all overlay nodes. Our sim-ulations show that our approach reduces the load <b>transfer</b> <b>cost</b> and saves a great network bandwidth. ...|$|R
