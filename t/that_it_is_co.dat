40|$|Molecular {{hydrogen}} is an environmentally clean source of energy, {{but it is}} not available on Earth. Steam reforming of bio-derived compounds represents a valuable route for the generation of molecular hydrogen and has the advantage <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>CO</b> 2 -neutral and it requires a limited amount of additional infrastructure for implementation. At present, suitable catalysts for selective bio-alcohol and dimethyl ether reforming into hydrogen and carbon dioxide are being developed, but their use on structured wall reactors for practical application is still under way. Among them, aerogel-based coated structures appear very promising due to their very high mass transfer rates and their ability to disperse highly active metal nanoparticles. The performance of these systems improves considerably by using microreaction technologies. Microreactors based on silicon micromonoliths together with integrated downstream carbon monoxide selective oxidation hold a promising futurefor the effective on-site and on-demand generation of hydrogen from renewable fuels in portable fuel cell applications.

40|$|In this chapter, {{we study}} the {{structures}} of Hopf algebras living in a symmetric braided tensor category (C, C). We obtain that (H, R) is a quasitriangular bialgebra living in C iff (HM, C R) is a braided tensor category. We show that the antipode of (co) quasitriangular Hopf algebra living in C is invertible. Next we also prove that S 2 is inner when almost cocommutative Hopf algebra (H, R) living in C has an invertible antipode S. In particular, we structure the Drinfeld (co) double D(H) in symmetric braided tensor category with left dual and we prove <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> (<b>co)</b> quasitriangular.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 74 - 77. Chapter 0 {{contains}} {{a summary of}} well-known terminology which will subsequently {{be used in the}} thesis. In Chapter 1 we begin by describing how topological categories may be viewed as categories of models corresponding to theories into the category of complete lattices. This leads naturally to the study of categories of T-models corresponding to theories into categories other than the category of complete lattices. It is shown, for example, that a concrete category corresponds to a poset-valued theory just in the case <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> (<b>co)</b> fibration complete. This shows that a concrete category is of the form Mod(T) only for poset-valued theories T. We make some technical observations regarding the correspondence between transformations and concrete functors. In particular, the fact that natural transformations between theories are in a bijective correspondence to finality preserving concrete functors between their respective categories of models will be of importance in Chapter 2. A theoretic interpretation is given of those categories which are (co) reflective modifications of certain concrete categories. Chapter 2 deals with the theoretic interpretation of certain topological completions of concrete categories. These are described in abstract theoretic terms using the correspondence between transformations and concrete functors. We also consider how concrete categories are embedded into (co) fibration complete categories. These "weak" completions have the nice property that they are always legitimate. For an arbitrary concrete category, the relationship between its topological completions and the various order-theoretic completions of its fibres is rather weak. However, if one assumes some additional structure properties, such as (co) fibration completeness, then the concepts of a categorical completion and an order-theoretic completion are more closely related, as shown by the result that for certain kinds of cofibrations, taking the universal order-theoretic completion of each fibre even yields the universal final topological completion. Chapter 3 is entirely concerned with the main goal of this thesis. We study so-called "convenient" topological categories, i. e., topological categories with additional structure. The purpose is to characterise each such type of category as a category of T-models for some theory T which satisfies a special "preservation" property with respect to pullbacks. The cartesian closed topological categories are characterised as those categories of T-models where the associated theory T sends a pointwise pullback of any regular sink into product covering family of diagrams. The concretely cartesian closed topological categories are characterised as those for which the associated theory T sends the pointwise pullback of an arbitrary sink into a product covering family. We also characterise the concretely cartesian closed categories by means of a certain natural transformation, given by the product of two structures. Perhaps the most satisfactory result of this Chapter is the characterisation of the universally topological categories. The theories corresponding to these categories may be described in two ways : firstly, they are shown to be frame-valued, send pullbacks into covering diagrams, and send morphisms into downset-preserving, cover-reflecting maps; secondly, they are shown to send the pointwise pullback of any sink into an order-covering diagram. Similarly, the concrete quasitopoi may be characterised by those theories which send the pullback of any regular sink into an order-covering family of diagrams. Finally, we consider hereditary topological categories. These are characterised as categories of T-models for which the theory T preserves terminal objects and sends the pointwise pullback of an arbitrary sink along an embedding into a weakly covering diagram family. In this context, a notion of strong heredity is introduced and characterised by a frame-valued theory sending pullbacks along monomorphisms into order-covering diagrams...|$|E

The club also became known for racial prejudice. In May 1969, a group of Cannon Club members threatened several African-American students with knives, chains, and brass knuckles, leading to the expulsion of one club member and suspension of another. [...] The same year, an instructor's pregnant wife was accosted and held off the ground while three club members gunned beers at her. The notoriety led to a fall in membership, ultimately precipitating the closure of the club in the early 1970s. [...] The property came into the possession of the University, which spent 3/4 of a million dollars on renovations and deferred maintenance to turn the clubhouse into an academic building, Notestein Hall, which housed the Office of Population Research for over 30 years.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} X-ray {{study of the}} neutron star low-mass X-ray binary IGR J 17062 - 6143, which has been accreting at low luminosities since its discovery in 2006. Analysing NuSTAR, XMM-Newton and Swift observations, we investigate the very faint nature of this source through three approaches: modelling the relativistic reflection spectrum to constrain the accretion geometry, performing high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to search for an outflow, and searching for the recently reported millisecond X-ray pulsations. We find a strongly truncated accretion disk at 77 ^+ 22 _- 18 gravitational radii (∼ 164 km) assuming a high inclination, although a low inclination and a disk extending to the neutron star cannot be excluded. The high-resolution spectroscopy reveals evidence for oxygen-rich circumbinary material, possibly resulting from a blueshifted, collisionally-ionised outflow. Finally, we do not detect any pulsations. We discuss these results in the broader context of possible explanations for the persistent faint nature of weakly accreting neutron stars. The {{results are consistent with}} both an ultra-compact binary orbit and a magnetically truncated accretion flow, although both cannot be unambigiously inferred.

40|$|Human SCO 1 and SCO 2 {{code for}} {{essential}} metallochaperones with ill-defined {{functions in the}} biogenesis of the CuA site of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CO II). Here, we have used patient cell lines to investigate the specific roles of each SCO protein in this pathway. By pulse-labeling mitochondrial translation products, we demonstrate that the synthesis of <b>CO</b> II <b>is</b> reduced in SCO 2, but not in SCO 1, cells. Despite this biosynthetic defect, newly synthesized <b>CO</b> II <b>is</b> more stable in SCO 2 cells than in control cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of mutant SCO 2 abolishes CO II labeling in the translation assay, whereas knockdown of mutant SCO 1 does not affect CO II synthesis. These results indicate that SCO 2 acts upstream of SCO 1, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> indispen-sable for <b>CO</b> II synthesis. The subsequent maturation of <b>CO</b> II <b>is</b> contingent upon {{the formation of a}} complex that includes both SCO proteins, each with a functional CxxxC copper-coordinating motif.

Overexpression of wild-type SCO 2, or knockdown of mutant SCO 2, in SCO 2 cells alters the ratio of oxidized to reduced cysteines in SCO 1, suggesting that SCO 2 acts as a thiol-disulphide oxido-reductase to oxidize the copper-coordinating cysteines in SCO 1 during CO II maturation. Based on these data we present a model in which each SCO protein fulfills distinct, stage-specific functions during CO II syn-thesis and CuA site maturation...|$|R

The success of any large scale CO 2 sequestration project depends on many factors, and two of the important factors are (a) the stability of injection well and (b) well cement. To date, OPC based cement has been used as well cement, and <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> found <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unstable in <b>CO</b> 2 environments as it undergoes degradation, strength reduction, and shrinkage. Therefore, a comprehensive experimental study has been undertaken to investigate the suitability of geopolymer as well cement and the mechanical behavior of geopolymer and class G cement was compared under different down-hole temperatures. When the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of geopolymer and G cement <b>was</b> compared, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> found <b>that</b> geopolymer possess higher UCS values at elevated temperatures (above 50 &# 0176;C) and G cement possesses the highest values at ambient conditions.

In addition, acoustic emission (AE) test data revealed that the crack propagation stress thresholds of class G cement are higher at ambient conditions, whereas geopolymer possesses highest values at elevated temperatures. The photogrammetric results of strain measurement show that geopolymer undergoes shear failure at lower curing temperatures, whereas the failure was splitting at elevated temperatures. In addition, the type of failure of class G cement was shear failure for all the curing temperatures and the ultimate failure strain did not vary much with the curing temperature...|$|R

Loewen is a key {{politician}} that helped Governor Devlin get elected so Devlin is very insistent on how Loewen will be carefully handled when he gets sent to prison. Devlin has Loewen sent to Oz to placate and appease the African American mob that has formed. Devlin has an unannounced intention of pardoning him as the racial tension outside of Oz cools down. In Oz, Devlin insists that he be placed in the safest unit which happens to be Unit J, the bad police unit which currently has no African American inmates. As Glynn sees Loewen arriving to prison, Loewen tells him that he is innocent but Glynn does not care as the courts have found him guilty. Loewen then pleas that as a Black man, Glynn should realize that the court's decisions aren't always correct. Loewen is in Oz safely until he blackmails Governor Devlin for a pardon. Devlin then uses his African American assistant Perry Loftus to secretly cause the death of Loewen and then handpicks police detectives to help keep their hands clean from the murder. However, Glynn, Tim McManus, Eleanor O'Connor and Detective McGorry figure out <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Loftus and <b>CO</b> Adrian Johnson who are {{responsible for the deaths of}} Loewen and other inmates who know about the murder. Shortly afterwards, O'Connor and Glynn have an affair which shocks McManus. As suspicions grow, Johnson has inmate Lionel Kelsch murder Glynn the night of the lifetime achievement award ceremony.
