40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} needs a simple and compact pump that could deal with slurry and other highly viscous or erosive fluid. The pump should also be able to fit in limited space of a borehole while maintaining comparable or higher efficiency than the current applications. Inspired by the algebraic screw, a new design of power transmission device, named as <b>Transmission</b> <b>Roller,</b> is introduced in this work and incorporated into a diaphragm pump. This mechanism converts rotary motion into linear motion and shows promises of high efficiency with its compact structure. Similar mechanisms have never been used in a hydraulic application before. A pump prototype utilizing the <b>Transmission</b> <b>Roller</b> is built and tested with water to prove its functionality. The transmission efficiency of the <b>transmission</b> <b>roller</b> prototype is 73. 6 %. The <b>Transmission</b> <b>Roller</b> efficiency for the final production pump design is expected to be 96. 3 %, higher than other designs of the same kind...|$|E

The research used experimental methods. Techniques of data analysis in this study using the descriptive data analysis graphically illustrates the results {{of research in the}} histogram or frequency polygon which connects between the variables. Based the research can conclude that: (1) Changes {{in the size of the}} diameter of the roller CVT 16 mm is capable of producing maximum power peak in the early rounds of the engine so as to generate a lap down to the more powerful. (2) Changes in the size of the diameter of the roller CVT 17 mm produces decreased power because of too rapid movement of the roller is not in accordance with engine speed so that the workload is too imposing received roller CVT. (3) The use of roller diameter of 16 mm on a CVT motorcycle Yamaha Mio Sporty produce maximum power at engine speed earlier and more optimal than the use of CVT roller 15 mm. On the use of 16 mm diameter roller CVT engine produces maximum power of 4. 55 hp at 7500 rpm engine speed, while the use of 15 mm diameter roller CVT produce power equal to 4. 54 hp at 7800 rpm engine speed. (4) The use of roller diameter of 17 mm on a CVT motorcycle Yamaha Mio Sporty produce too rapid achievement of resources so that maximum power is not optimal. On the use of CVT roller diameter 17 mm produces a maximum power of 4. 48 hp at 7700 rpm engine speed. (5) The increase in engine speed can increase the power generated at the wheel axle to the maximum because the larger the engine speed will cause a centrifugal force generated CVT roller so that the greater the power of the machine can be supplied with up to the axle. The increase in engine speed upon reaching the maximum power to the power generated at the wheel axis decreases. Keywords: CVT roller diameter, engine speed variatiom, engin...|$|E

It compares the conventional PIDcontroller with the Fuzzy PID controller, implemented ina small wind turbine that was constructed using variousmachines. The concept of changing the gain parameters of the PIDcontroller with fuzzy logic, depending on the wind directionfor greater power generation, is explained and tested. This,with usage of a DC-motor that gets an output signal fromthe system which reads input values from an encoder anda wind vane. The construction included a powertrain inwhich a <b>transmission,</b> <b>roller</b> bearings and shafts were implementedin the yaw mechanism. The tests resulted in showing that the Fuzzy PID controllerperformed better, minimizing the error, when theerror between the wind turbine and the wind itself, wassmall. The power generation was also increased when utilizingthe Fuzzy PID controller. However, the PID controllerperformed similar to the Fuzzy PID controller whenexposed to larger errors. Det här arbetet visar hur små vindkraftverk kan bidra tillen grönare planet genom att omvandla vindenergi till elektriskenergi. Det beskriver jämförelsen mellan den vanligtförekommande PID regulatorn och den suddiga PID regulatorn,implementerad i ett litet vindkraftverk som konstruerades med hjälp av flertalet maskiner.

40|$|International audienceThe {{promises}} of Model Based Design {{have led to}} the development of numerous methodologies and software tools, especially for the specific or detailed design stages, from controller design to finite element analysis. However, the Model Based Design of actuation systems lacks methodologies and expressive simulation models that are suited to preliminary design, where key technical decisions are taken considering various design alternatives and few available design details. In order to fill this gap, the present paper illustrates how scaling laws and acausal modelling can be used as a design tool, exploiting inverse simulation capabilities to evaluate technological alternatives quantitatively from limited design detail information. The application of the modelling approach is shown for two major components of mechanical <b>transmission</b> systems: <b>roller</b> bearings and ball and roller screws.

Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The front sprocket drive shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller {{to move away from}} the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|R
