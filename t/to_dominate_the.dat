50|$|Tiaret {{occupies}} a strategic mountain pass at 3552 ft, and was thus a key <b>to</b> <b>dominating</b> <b>the</b> central Maghreb.

50|$|During the American Revolution, when {{control of}} the Hudson River was viewed by the British as {{essential}} <b>to</b> <b>dominating</b> <b>the</b> American territories, the area that was to become the park saw several significant military engagements.

5|$|After the war, coastal defences became {{increasingly}} irrelevant as nuclear weapons came <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. The remaining Device Forts still in military use were initially garrisoned with reservist units and then closed as military establishments. St Catherine's and Portland were decommissioned {{in the late}} 1940s, Hurst, Pendennis and Yarmouth in the 1950s, Southsea in 1960 and, after, the closure of its air base, Calshot followed in 1961.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the Noel Park {{development}} and the growing nearby community of Wood Green were coming <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> area. In recognition of this, in 1902 Green Lanes railway station was renamed Noel Park & Wood Green.

5|$|During the Middle Ages {{sheep farming}} for the wool trade came <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> economy of Exmoor. The wool was spun into thread on {{isolated}} farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving {{towns such as}} Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During this period a Royal Forest and hunting ground was established, administered by the Warden. The Royal Forest was sold off in 1818.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, Alexander Twining and James Harrison set up ice {{plants in}} Ohio and Melbourne {{respectively}} during the 1850s, both using Perkins engines.

Australia's distance from New England, where journeys could take 115 days, and the consequent high level of wastage– 150 tons of the first 400-ton shipment to Sydney melted on route– made it relatively easy for plant ice {{to compete with the}} natural product. Elsewhere, however, natural ice dominated the entire market.|$|E

5|$|The Permian–Triassic {{extinction}} event about 252 {{million years}} ago, {{which was a}} prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses, ended the dominance of carnivorous therapsids. In the early Triassic, most medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs which, {{over an extended period}} (35 million years), came to include the crocodylomorphs, the pterosaurs and the dinosaurs; however, large cynodonts like Trucidocynodon and traversodontids still occupied large sized carnivorous and herbivorous niches respectively. By the Jurassic, the dinosaurs had come <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> large terrestrial herbivore niches as well.|$|E

Repo Man eventually tried to attack Crush by jumping off the top rope, but Crush caught him and performed the Cranium Crunch to win the match by submission.|$|E
