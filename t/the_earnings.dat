5|$|During {{its first}} day of wide release, Wolverine took in an {{estimated}} $35million, with almost $5million of that from midnight showings. <b>The</b> <b>earnings</b> placed the film as the 16th highest-grossing opening day ever (22nd with ticket-price inflation). It went on to be number one film {{at the box office}} with a total of $85million. Among summer kick-offs, it ranked fifth behind Spider-Man, X2, Spider-Man 3, and Iron Man and it was in the top ten of comic book adaptations. The opening was lower than the last film in the franchise, X-Men: The Last Stand, as well as X2, but higher than X-Men, the first film in the series.|$|E
5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change <b>the</b> <b>earnings</b> figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E
5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} {{were significantly}} smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants. Service {{was a natural}} part of the cycle of life, and it was common for young people to spend some years away from home in the service of another household. This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, {{and at the same time}} earn a wage. This was particularly useful for girls, who could put <b>the</b> <b>earnings</b> towards their dowry.|$|E

By decomposing <b>the</b> sources of <b>earnings</b> elasticity across generations, {{we find that the}} correlation between children's and their fathers' occupations is the most important component. Finally, quantile regressions estimates show that the influence of <b>the</b> father's <b>earnings</b> is greater when we move to the lower tail of <b>the</b> offspring's <b>earnings</b> distribution, {{especially in the case of}} daughters' earnings. ...|$|R

5|$|Malone was {{survived by}} his wife Ida and his eight children. Although {{initially}} well provided with income from his farming estate, the depression of the 1920s impacted on <b>the</b> <b>earnings</b> of the farmland and Ida struggled financially. She eventually moved to England with her three children and a daughter from Malone's previous marriage and died there in 1946. His four oldest sons all served in the NZEF, and one, Maurice, was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Another son, Edmond, received the Military Cross while serving with the Wellington Regiment on the Western Front. He died on 6 April 1918, a few days after being wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} a success, earning {{a total of}} $141.2 million worldwide, {{exceeding}} <b>the</b> <b>earnings</b> of the three previous Bond films. In 1966, John Stears won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and production designer Ken Adam was also nominated for a BAFTA award. Thunderball is the most financially successful film of the series when adjusting for ticket price inflation. Some critics and viewers showered praise on the film and branded it a welcome addition to the series, while others complained of the repetitively monotonous aquatic action and prolonged length. In 1983, Warner Bros. released a second film adaptation of the novel under the title Never Say Never Again, with McClory as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the force}} {{was called in}} to manage {{industrial}} disputes on a range of occasions between 1887 and 1906. In the mining town of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company locked out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed to maintain order, in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on <b>the</b> <b>earnings</b> of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past the picket lines.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} explain <b>the</b> gender <b>earnings</b> gap {{one has to}} {{identify}} variables that differ {{between male and female}} self-employed {{and at the same time}} affect earnings in such a way that they may account for <b>the</b> lower female <b>earnings.</b> Accordingly this paper is structured as follows: In section 2, after presenting our data, we describe men’s and women’s distribution of earnings and their differences in endowments, motivations and job characteristics that may be responsible for <b>the</b> gender <b>earnings</b> gap. We then explore the impact of these variables by estimating earnings functions in section 3.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> {{impact of}} <b>earnings</b> management on <b>the</b> value-relevance of <b>earnings</b> and book value. Two different sources of earnings management are investigated: short-term discretionary accruals and long-term discretionary accruals. A contribution {{of this paper}} is the development of models to estimate short-term and long-term discretionary accruals. <b>The</b> effect of <b>earnings</b> management on <b>the</b> relative value-relevance of earnings and book value depends on <b>the</b> source of <b>earnings</b> management. When examined independently, earnings management via either short-term or long-term discretionary accruals reduces <b>the</b> valuerelevance of <b>earnings</b> but has no impact on the value relevance of book value. Examination of both measures simultaneously reveals the differential impact of short-term versus long-term discretionary accruals. Earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals has no impact, whereas earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals reduces <b>the</b> valuerelevance of <b>earnings</b> and increases <b>the</b> value-relevance of book value. This supports <b>the</b> conclusion that <b>earnings</b> management via long-term discretionary accruals has a greater impact on <b>the</b> value-relevance of <b>earnings</b> and book value than earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals. ...|$|R

Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous HORSE-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful Solipskier. They were able to live from <b>the</b> <b>earnings</b> for Gasketball two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks.

It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired conversion rate at the time of launch.|$|E
5|$|In {{the trail}} of the related {{negative}} publicity, Turner accepted the lead role in Ross Hunter's remake of Imitation of Life (1959) under the direction of Douglas Sirk. Universal Studios capitalized on her new-found notoriety; the result {{was one of the biggest}} hits of the year, and the biggest of Turner's career; she owned 50% of <b>the</b> <b>earnings</b> of the picture and during just the first year of the film's release she earned $11 million. According to Hunter, the film made an excess of $50 million in box office receipts. Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of Peyton Place and Imitation of Life each seemed to mirror certain parts of Turner's private life. Specifically, both films depicted the troubled, complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenaged daughter.|$|E

40|$|Some {{recent studies}} have debated the {{appropriateness}} of semi-log earnings function in approximating actual earnings profiles. This study contributes further to this debate by estimating four specifications of earnings function, namely, semi-log quadratic, semi-log cubic, quadratic and cubic with cross section data for 4035 full-time urban male earners in Iran for 1993. The analysis shows that <b>the</b> semi-log quadratic <b>earnings</b> function fits <b>the</b> actual empirical <b>earnings</b> profiles very poorly. <b>The</b> quadratic <b>earnings</b> function provides a much better approximation to <b>the</b> actual <b>earnings.</b> Measures of out-of-sample prediction errors also show the superiority of quadratic function over others. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} intergenerational earnings mobility models using quantile regressions. Quantile regression {{is a less}} restrictive estimation approach than more commonly used methods such as ordinary least squares and instrumental variables, which only estimate the mean effects of intergenerational earnings correlation. Further, we investigate the role of education as an intergenerational transmission mechanism for earnings. We find that <b>the</b> intergenerational <b>earnings</b> correlation is greater {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> son's conditional <b>earnings</b> distribution than at the top, and that controlling for son's education reduces <b>the</b> intergenerational <b>earnings</b> correlation. We also find that education is relatively more valuable at the bottom of <b>the</b> conditional <b>earnings</b> distribution and thus tends to compress the distribution. ...|$|R

Lad's obituary was carried on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. He was buried near the driveway of Sunnybank, with the Honorary Crosses he was awarded. He was mourned by thousands of fans who had read Terhune's stories, with dozens of readers, primarily children, visiting Sunnybank to see Lad's grave. In one season, over 1,700 visitors came to see Lad's grave, prompting Terhune to close the place to visitors for the day.|$|E
