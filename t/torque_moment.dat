Variation of stress intensity factor with crack length is presented. Possible causes of crack occurrence are given and they include excessive values of fastener <b>torque</b> <b>moments</b> coupled with fretting between fastener and fastener hole that was poorly machined.

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution to the}} problem is to have two joined flywheels spinning synchronously in opposite directions. They would have a total angular momentum of zero and no gyroscopic effect. A problem with this solution is that when the difference between the momentum of each flywheel is anything other than zero the housing of the two flywheels would exhibit torque. Both wheels must be maintained at the same speed to keep the angular velocity at zero. Strictly speaking, the two flywheels would exert a huge <b>torqueing</b> <b>moment</b> at the central point, trying to bend the axle. However, if the axle were sufficiently strong, no gyroscopic forces would have a net effect on the sealed container, so no torque would be noticed.|$|R

We derive a Berry phase expression for the DMI and show that within this Berry phase theory DMI and SOTs are intimately related, in a way formally analogous to the relation between orbital magnetization (OM) and anomalous Hall effect (AHE). We introduce {{the concept of the}} twist <b>torque</b> <b>moment,</b> which probes the internal twist of wave packets in chiral magnets in a similar way like the orbital moment probes the wave packet's internal self rotation. We propose to interpret the Berry phase theory of DMI as a theory of spiralization in analogy to the modern theory of OM. We show that the twist <b>torque</b> <b>moment</b> and the spiralization together give rise to a Berry phase governing the response of the SOT to thermal gradients, in analogy to the intrinsic anomalous Nernst effect. The Berry phase theory of DMI is computationally very efficient because it only needs the electronic structure of the collinear magnetic system as input.
