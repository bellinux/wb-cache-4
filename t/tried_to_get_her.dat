25|$|According to Decca Records {{producer}} Owen Bradley, the Four Star compositions only {{hinted at}} Patsy's potential. Bradley thought that {{her voice was}} best-suited for pop music, but Cline sided with Peer and the other Four Star producers, insisting that she could only record country songs, as her contract also stated. Every time Bradley <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> to sing the torch songs that would become her signature, she would panic, missing her familiar country fiddle and steel guitar. She often rebelled, only wishing to sing country and yodel. She recorded 51 songs with Four Star.|$|E

She claims Crane repeatedly <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> to implicate him and that he became threatening during his last conversation with her. Despite being the sole witness who reported that she could identify the men at the scene, Shawna Ornt was never asked in court if she could identify Ferguson. Zellner alleged that the prosecution did not ask her to identify Ferguson because they knew her answer would hurt their case.|$|E

500|$|In 1980, {{with support}} of two friends and photojournalist Sophie Keir, Millett stopped taking lithium to improve her mental clarity, relieve {{diarrhea}} and hand tremors, and better uphold her philosophies about {{mental health and}} treatment. She began to feel alienated and was [...] "snappish" [...] as Keir watched for behavioral changes. Her behavior was that of psychiatric drug withdrawal, including [...] "mile-a-minute" [...] speech, which turned her peaceful art colony to [...] "a quarrelsome dystopia." [...] Mallory Millett, having talked to Keir, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> committed but was unsuccessful due to New York's laws concerning involuntary commitments.|$|E
500|$|Through the Scientology {{practice}} of [...] "disconnection", Christman's {{husband and the}} majority of her acquaintances and friends who were Scientologists {{at the time of her}} exit from the group were excommunicated from her and cut off contact. Christman recounted how after leaving the organization, the Church of Scientology attempted to damage her reputation through a policy referred to as [...] "dead agenting". According to Christman, the Scientology organization publicized inaccurate information about her online, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> removed from her position of employment, and opened a lawsuit related to her protesting against the group on church property. Then Scientology-spokesperson, Mike Rinder, called her a [...] "wacko" [...] and rejected her assertions as [...] "absolute bullshit".|$|E
500|$|Vivien saw Barney as a muse and as Barney put it, [...] "she {{had found}} new {{inspiration}} through me, almost without knowing me." [...] Barney felt Vivien had cast {{her as a}} femme fatale and that she wanted [...] "to lose herself... entirely in suffering" [...] {{for the sake of}} her art. Vivien also believed in fidelity, which Barney was unwilling to agree to. While Barney was visiting her family in Washington, D.C. in 1901, Vivien stopped answering her letters. Barney <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> back for years, at one point persuading a friend, operatic mezzo-soprano Emma Calvé, to sing under Vivien's window so she could throw a poem (wrapped around a bouquet of flowers) up to Vivien on her balcony.

500|$|Davidson, {{perhaps on}} the basis of his {{youthful}} Thames-side rescue, had convinced himself that nearly all young girls alone in London were in need of rescue from a life of vice. [...] Typical of these was Rose Ellis, whom he met in Leicester Square in September 1920. Twenty years old and living precariously from part-time prostitution, she was homeless and had no money. Davidson gave her cash for a room, and arranged to meet her the following week. Thus began a friendship that endured for more than a decade. Davidson brought her to the rectory, where she worked for a time in the gardens. He also <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> a job with a touring theatre company, took her to Paris to find employment as an au pair, kept her supplied with small sums of money, and paid her medical bills when she was suffering from venereal disease.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , and I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going to put my hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult." [...] Towelhead was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E

Dimato later tried to bribe Naomi and Brennan encouraged {{her to go to}} the police, but she refused and gave the money back. Brennan confronted Dimato, who then cornered Naomi and threatened her for talking about the bribe. O'Reilly commented that Naomi was annoyed at Brennan's interference, as she felt she could handle Dimato. She continued, [...] "She's tough as nails. She would never admit there is danger there – and especially not to Brennan!" [...] Matt Turner (Josef Brown) later asked for Naomi's help, so the police could build a case against Dimato. Naomi gave a statement even though she was still receiving threats from Dimato and his men. Dimato later targeted Sheila, forcing Naomi to retract her statement. Matt <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> to change her mind, but it was only when Sheila learned what she had done and told her to re-submit her statement, that Naomi agreed.|$|E

500|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Badler had joined the cast of Neighbours as [...] "super-bitch" [...] Diana Marshall. Badler said that when she met with the writers, they told her that they are big fans of V and so they wrote the part of Diana with her in mind. They named the character Diana in a homage to the role she played in V. The writers did not know that Badler was living in the county until a chance meeting brought them together. Badler revealed that the guitarist in her band managed to connect her to Neighbours executive producer, Susan Bower and when she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> music featured on the show, she was asked to play Diana instead. Badler said that she still had to audition for the role, which she said was [...] "depressing" [...] as she hates auditioning. However, she said it was fun as the part was for a bad girl, which is the kind of role she enjoys playing. She added [...] "Now I'm happy that I had to earn the role; I feel as though it was made for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Before her arrival, O'Reilly said Naomi was [...] "a lot of fun", but {{she would}} be hiding some secrets {{and it would be}} {{interesting}} to see the lengths she would go to in order to keep them hidden, particularly from her mother. O'Reilly described Naomi as having a [...] "good heart", but when it came to getting what she wants, some of her actions were [...] "questionable". She also said Naomi was good at turning a situation to her advantage, and likened her to a cat, as she enjoys the [...] "finer things in life". The actress continued, [...] "On top of all that, she is her mother's daughter. She has the Canning straight up, strength and vulgarity that her genes and upbringing have given her in spades. She's quirky but sophisticated, and at times petulant and silly. All in all, she is very, very fun to play." [...] O'Reilly did not think Naomi was bad, but she was spoilt and always <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> own way. However, underneath the surface, she was kind and caring. When asked whether viewers would like Naomi, O'Reilly believed that she could turn out to be a [...] "character everyone loves to hate".|$|E

Each class year at the ENA receives a nickname to distinguish it: Royal <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> peers to name their class after Louise Michel, a revolutionary from the 1870s, but they chose the name [...] "Voltaire" [...] instead. During her time at the ENA, Royal also dropped [...] "Marie" [...] from her hyphenated first name because she thought it had been chosen by her father for his daughters out of a degrading and archaic view of the role of women.|$|E

The cousins recorded events in Josephine's life and found Josephine was generous with details about her life after Tombstone, but could not remember events before and while she lived in the town. The Cason manuscript the Earp cousins produced had a serious limitation: it was missing the family's most compelling and interesting story, the time while Josephine and Wyatt lived in Tombstone. Cason and her sister pressured Josephine to supply as much information about her time in Tombstone as she readily recalled {{about the rest of}} her life, but Josie resisted. She was very protective of her and Wyatt's image. She finally revealed only a few details, including that she had returned to Arizona when Johnny Behan promised to marry her, but was disillusioned when he continually put off the wedding.|$|E

2500|$|Through various {{interviews}} and {{discussions about the}} character, Rowling has established that Albus Dumbledore was born in July or August 1881 to Percival and Kendra Dumbledore. The character had previously referenced his brother Aberforth, and in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, it is revealed that Albus is three years older than Aberforth. The same book established their sister Ariana who, at six years old, suffered a vicious attack by three male Muggle youths who had witnessed her doing magic. Frightened, they first <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> to repeat what they had seen, and upon her failure to recreate it due to her young age, they tried to stop her from being [...] "different". It is not explicitly stated in the novel what form this attack took, but Percival {{was sentenced to life}} in Azkaban for tracking down and hexing the boys who seriously traumatised his daughter. The severe trauma of the attack left Ariana unable to function socially or to properly perform magic again. To prevent her being institutionalised in St. Mungo's Hospital, or hurting someone accidentally with her uncontrolled magic, Kendra moved the family to Godric's Hollow, and her illness was concealed. Neighbours assumed that Ariana was a non-magical squib.|$|E

King accepted the apology and pointed out the Senate Select Committee on Assassinations had not found any basis to suggest her husband had communist ties. On February 9, 1987, eight civil rights activists were jailed for protesting the exclusion of African-Americans during the filming of The Oprah Winfrey Show in Cumming, Georgia. Oprah Winfrey tried to find out why the [...] "community has not allowed black people to live there since 1912."
