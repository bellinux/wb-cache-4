5|$|The Chinese never {{spotted the}} D-21B. The first one failed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> {{continued}} straight on, crashing {{somewhere in the}} Soviet Union. Another test flight was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct any problems. The second operational mission, however, was not until 16 December 1970. The D-21B reached Lop Nor {{and back to the}} recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs.|$|E

5|$|That night, two U.S. Army heavy {{equipment}} transporters entered {{the city of}} Khafji, apparently lost, and were fired upon by Iraqi troops. Although one truck managed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> escape, the two drivers of the second truck were wounded and captured. This led to a rescue mission organized by 3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, which sent a force of 30 men to extract the two wounded drivers. Although encountering no major opposition, they did not find the two drivers who had, by this time, been taken prisoner. The Marines did find a burnt out Kuwaiti AMX-30, with its dead crew. That same night, a U.S. Air Force AC-130 was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile (SAM), killing the aircraft's crew of 14.|$|E

5|$|One of the frigates, Santa Dorotea, {{had lost}} a topmast {{sometime}} earlier and as result was slower {{than the rest of}} the squadron. Falling behind the others, Gerraro soon found that his ship was in danger of being isolated by Lion, as Dixon steered for the rapidly opening gap between the Spanish ships. Recognising the danger, O'Neil ordered the front three frigates <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> sail to the defence of Santa Dorotea, passing close by Lion and opening a heavy fire at 11:15. Lion replied, and the Spanish frigates did not immediately turn back for a second pass, continuing ahead as Dixon closed with the straggling Santa Dorotea. In an effort to deter the ship of the line, Gerraro opened fire on Lion with his stern chasers, cannon situated in the frigate's stern, which caused considerable damage to Dixon's rigging. As Lion began to close the distance, O'Neil's ships returned, but the frigates passed Lion at extreme distance, their broadsides having no effect and again coming under fire themselves.|$|E

He recruited ex–intelligence-officers of the Wehrmacht and Nazis from the SS and SD to work for him. On 1 April 1956, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND; the German intelligence agency) was created from the Gehlen Organization, and transferred to the West German government. Reinhard Gehlen became President of the BND and remained its head until 1968.|$|E

From the opening of the Lechmere Viaduct leading to it in 1912 until 1922, {{streetcar}} lines simply fed onto the viaduct from Cambridge Street and Bridge Street (now Monsignor O'Brien Highway). In 1922 a prepayment station was opened, with a new loop for subway trains <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> a separate loop for surface cars, and no intermingling between the two. The surface lines have since been replaced with buses, but the Green Line still turns around at Lechmere.|$|E
25|$|The Hanoi area {{formerly}} {{held by the}} Han and Jin dynasties {{was easily}} recovered from the local ruler in 602. A few years later the Sui army pushed farther south and was attacked by troops on war elephants from Champa in southern Vietnam. The Sui army feigned retreat and dug pits to trap the elephants, lured the Champan troops to attack then used crossbows against the elephants causing them <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> trample their own soldiers. Although Sui troops were victorious many succumbed to disease as northern soldiers did not have immunity to tropical diseases such as malaria.|$|E
25|$|While the Israelis were preparing, the {{two ships}} started moving: the Emir Farouk went {{north and the}} {{minesweeper}} went south. This hastened the Israeli attack. Abramov's boat attacked first, causing the Egyptians to fire at random. Vardi's boat mistakenly turned to attack the Emir Farouk as well. Vardi failed to eject due to a technical difficulty, but managed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> strike again. In the dark, Abramov believed that Vardi's was the extraction boat and caught on, but detached from it as well before it rammed into the Egyptian ship. Vardi's actions also confused Yitzhak Brockman on the rescue boat, who had been moving toward the Emir Farouk, and now believed that Vardi was turning around to collect Abramov. Brockman therefore started moving in Bin-Nun's direction.|$|E

25|$|During the {{recession}} of 2008, SNAP participation hit an all-time high. Arguing in support for SNAP, the Food Research and Action Center argued that “putting more resources quickly {{into the hands of}} the people most likely <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> spend it can both boost the economy and cushion the hardships on vulnerable people who face a constant struggle against hunger.” Researchers have found that every $1 that is spent from SNAP results in $1.73 of economic activity. In California, the cost-benefit ratio is even higher: for every $1 spent from SNAP between $3.67 to $8.34 is saved in health care costs. The Congressional Budget Office also rated an increase in SNAP benefits as one of the two most cost-effective of all spending and tax options it examined for boosting growth and jobs in a weak economy.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{devised a}} complex plan to pursue and destroy McClellan's army. Longstreet's and A.P. Hill's {{divisions}} looped back toward Richmond and then southeast to the crossroads at Glendale, Holmes's division headed farther south, to {{the vicinity of}} Malvern Hill, and Magruder's division was ordered to move due east to attack the Federal rear guard. Stonewall Jackson, commanding three divisions, was to rebuild a bridge over the Chickahominy and head due south to Savage's Station, where he would link up with Magruder and deliver a strong blow that might cause the Union Army <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> fight during its retreat. McClellan's rear guard at Savage's Station consisted five divisions from Sumner's II Corps, Heintzelman's III Corps, and Franklin's VI Corps. McClellan considered his senior corps commander, Sumner, to be incompetent, so he appointed no one to command the rear guard.|$|E

25|$|With {{the fall}} of Fort Henry General Grant was now {{preparing}} to move overland and capture Fort Donelson, approximately twelve {{miles to the east}} on the Cumberland River. Foote at this time insisted on returning to Cairo for badly needed repairs on his gunboats. After learning that only the Carondelet would lend naval support to his Army he urged General Halleck to have Foote promptly send more ironclads. Needing more time, Foote, however, relented and transferred men from the damaged gunboats to become part of another flotilla. On February 12, the gunboats Saint Louis, Pittsburg and Louisville passed the Conestoga and Lexington on their way to Cairo for repairs. Foote hailed the vessels and ordered Phelps <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> join his flotilla. The badly damaged Lexington, however, continued on, while Phelps, aboard the Conestoga, joined forces with Foote and together proceeded up the Ohio River.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{passenger}} loads soon {{required a}} further {{expansion of the}} carrying capacity of the harbor crossing. A new, four track station and two loops were constructed under Maverick Square in East Boston. The station was constructed while passenger service through the East Boston Tunnel was maintained. The new Maverick station would have the local East Boston streetcars enter the incline as always, but would stop inside the new station. All of the passengers would disembark the trolleys and cross the platform to the waiting rapid transit trains. A loop was provided west of the station for the trolleys <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> return to the outbound side of the station. The rapid transit trains would return to Boston via a loop {{on the eastern side}} of the station. A short extension of the tunnel beyond the east loop provided train storage and a couple of inspection pits for light maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Once again, Hancock {{would be}} the senior general on the expedition. On August 13, the X Corps, {{commanded}} by Maj. Gen. David B. Birney, Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg's cavalry division, and Hancock's II Corps artillery crossed pontoon bridges from Bermuda Hundred to Deep Bottom. Meanwhile, {{the remainder of the}} II Corps conducted a ruse to make the Confederates think that Hancock was being sent north to reinforce Sheridan. After a grueling march through oppressive heat to City Point—a march during which a number of the men were felled by heat stroke—they embarked on ships and steamed toward the Chesapeake Bay, many of the individual soldiers unaware of their actual destination. A tugboat followed the flotilla and brought new orders, which caused the transport ships <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> deposit the II Corps at Deep Bottom the night of August 13–14. The landings were not managed well and fell behind schedule; Grant's staff had not arranged for adequate wharves to handle the deep-water steamers.|$|E

25|$|When Blücher {{heard about}} Olsufiev's disaster, he ordered Kaptzevich and Kleist <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> make a night march back to Vertus. Sacken, who had marched west to Trilport, {{was ordered to}} return to Montmirail. Yorck was {{requested}} to meet Sacken near Montmirail while holding open an escape route over the Marne at Château-Thierry. After the battle, Napoleon found himself squarely {{in the middle of}} the overextended Army of Silesia. If he advanced to the east, he would merely push the corps of Kaptzevich and Kleist back. A move to the west held the possibility of trapping and destroying the forces under Sacken and Yorck, so he turned west. Napoleon ordered Marmont with Lagrange's division and the I Cavalry Corps to hold Étoges and keep Blücher under observation. At 7:00 pm the emperor directed Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty with two cavalry divisions to occupy Montmirail. They were to be joined there in the morning by Ricard's division and the divisions under Ney and Mortier. The Battle of Montmirail was fought the next day against Sacken and Yorck.|$|E
25|$|Santa Dorotea {{was built}} in Ferrol in 1775. In 1798 she was {{assigned}} to a small frigate squadron under Commodore Don Felix O'Neil and departed Cartagena in company with the frigates Pomona, Proserpine and Santa Cazilda on 8 July. Santa Doroteas captain for the expedition was Don Manuel Gerraro. Their attempts to raid shipping in the area were unsuccessful, and while returning to port at 09:00 on 15 July, they were spotted by the 64-gun HMS Lion, under Captain Manley Dixon. Dixon approached the squadron, closing on the Santa Dorotea, which had begun to fall behind her consorts, having lost a topmast sometime earlier. Realizing that Manley was attempting to cut off and engage Santa Dorotea, O'Neil ordered the front three frigates <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> sail to her defence. They passed close to Lion commencing fire at 11:15. Lion replied, and O'Neil made two further attempts to distract Lion, while Santa Dorotea tried to damage her pursuer with her stern guns. The Spanish broadsides had no real effect, and Dixon was able to come alongside and exchange broadsides with Santa Dorotea.|$|E
