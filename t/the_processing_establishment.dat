40|$|Abstract This paper compares SPS-requirements of the USA {{and of the}} EU {{from the}} {{perspective}} of <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> <b>establishment,</b> and analyzes the consequences of differences for national as well as firm policies. Differences in safety requirements may impede the competitiveness of the food industry. Backward, forward and location-specific requirements are described to see whether the US- and EU SPS-requirements are comparable. The paper shows that the systems are quite similar, although individual standards can defer. Such differences influence not only the compliance costs, but also prospected mending costs. Only the first category has been stressed by science and practice. It is shown that opposite effects of the two cost categories when safety levels increase, can lead to different interpretations by firms versus national authorities. It is concluded that differences in SPSs can be bridged by means of effective dispute settlement within the WTO. To assess the gravity of such disputes an economic analysis of the before-mentioned cost categories should be combined with a analysis of consumer perceptions. Differences in consumer perception (as is the case with hormone-use in the production of meat) can be addressed by means of improved compliance efforts, or by means of compensation. Economically, both could lead to the same economic equilibrium, as national as well as firms could desire the same safety levels.

The APC and Escherichia coli were enumerated in 130 samples of raw minced meat preparation, by the respective Standard ISO methods. The first enumeration was checked on the date of production. The samples were stored in 2 - 4 oC according to the producers recomandation, and reanalyzed on the 7 th day, on the 14 th day and 2 days before the expired date. At the first examination for E. coli 32 out of 130 samples resulted without the presence; 36 samples resulted with acount from 1. 6 x 102 cfu/g to 3. 2 x 102 cfu/g, 26 samples resulted with 3. 5 x 102 cfu/g to 4. 9 x 103 cfu/g, 36 samples resulted with a count from 1, 3 x 104 - 2. 1 x 105 cfu/g.

Also it was determinated the APC on both temperatures where we took this results: in the produced day, 25 samples resulted with a count from 1. 2 x 101 - 1. 4 x 102 cfu/g, 56 samples resulted with 1. 8 x 10 3 - 5. 1 x 10 5 cfu/g, 49 samples resulted with 5. 1 x 105 - 2. 1 x 106 cfu/g.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of various concentrations of dextrose, valine, glycine and thiamine as well as different incubation temperatures on growth rate of Lactobacillus acidophillus in steril milk. In order to locate the ideal temperature, L. acidophillus was incubated at 38 °C, 40 °C, 42 °C and 44 °C. Moreover, thiamine (0, 5, 10 and 15 ppm), dextrose (0, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8 and 1 %), glycine and valine (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 ppm) was added to steril milk. The acidity of milk-as an indication of bacterial activity-was measured periodically during 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h of incubation. In comparison with the other temperatures, the activity of L. acidophillus was found significantly (P < 0. 05) higher at 42 °C. According to the results, addition of dextrose, valine, glycine did not accelerate the production of acidic components; however, it seems that these substances could enhance the potency of L. acidophillus to produce gas and proteolytic enzymes...|$|R

Overall, M. paratuberculosis DNA was detected by immunomagnetic PCR in 19 (7. 8 %; 95 % confidence interval, 4. 3 to 10. 8 %) and 67 (11. 8 %; 95 % confidence interval, 9. 0 to 14. 2 %) of the raw and pasteurized milk samples, respectively. Confirmed M. paratuberculosis isolates were cultured from 4 (1. 6 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 04 to 3. 1 %) and 10 (1. 8 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 7 to 2. 8 %) of the raw and pasteurized milk samples, respectively, following chemical decontamination with 0. 75 % (wt/vol) cetylpyridinium chloride for 5 h. The 10 culture-positive pasteurized milk samples were from just 8 (3. 3 %) of <b>the</b> 241 dairy <b>processing</b> <b>establishments</b> that participated in the survey. Seven of the culture-positive pasteurized milk samples had been heat treated at 72 to 74 °C for 15 s; the remainder had been treated at 72 to 75 °C for the extended holding time of 25 s. When typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis methods, some of the milk isolates were shown to be types distinct from those of laboratory strains in regular use within the testing laboratory. From information gathered at the time of milk sample collection, all indications were that pasteurization had been carried out effectively at all of the culture-positive dairies. That is, pasteurization time and temperature conditions complied with the legal minimum high-temperature, short-time process; all pasteurized milk samples tested phosphatase negative; and postprocess contamination was considered unlikely to have occurred. It was concluded that viable M. paratuberculosis is occasionally present at low levels in commercially pasteurized cows' milk in the United Kingdom...|$|R

Clonal types of Cronobacter strains in the environment, raw materials, and products were investigated using PFGE and RAPD in order to shed light on the possible dissemination routes within the facility. Over the course of the study, a total of 153 Cronobacter isolates were obtained from 46 end-products, 23 raw materials and 44 environmental samples. The 153 Cronobacter isolates represented 71 PFGE pulso-types, with 24 pulso-types containing multiple isolates. Clonal isolates present in products could be matched to indistinguishable pulso-types in raw materials and in the environment, however no strains were identified that were present in both the environment and raw materials.
