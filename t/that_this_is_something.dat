Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that should never have been attempted.|$|E

[...] She told Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "We built the show around my actual life and my kids. The 'domestic goddess', the whole thing". [...] In the same interview, Werner said, [...] "I don't think Roseanne, to this day, understands <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> legislated by the Writers Guild, and it's part of what every show has to deal with. They're the final arbiters." [...] During the first season, Barr sought more {{creative}} control over the show, opposing Williams' authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode.|$|E
500|$|Talk of a {{potential}} sequel to The Terminator arose soon after its release, but several outstanding issues precluded such a production. There were technical limitations regarding computer-generated imagery, a vital aspect of the film that would be crucial {{in the creation of}} the T-1000 Terminator. The production of James Cameron's 1989 film The Abyss provided the proof of concept needed to satisfactorily resolve the technical concerns. Perhaps more serious were the intellectual-property disputes between Hemdale Film Corporation, which owned the franchise and stymied efforts to produce a sequel, and Carolco Pictures. Given that Hemdale was then experiencing financial problems, Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Mario Kassar, head of Carolco, to bid for the rights: [...] "I reminded Mario <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that we've been looking for four years, and that it should be him that should go all-out, no matter what it takes to make this deal." [...] Carolco eventually paid Hemdale $5million for the franchise in 1990, resolving the legal gridlock.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think that we can use this story to really educate people and get the word out there <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E

[...] "It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants," [...] he stated. [...] "We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment." [...] Although he felt Avatar would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic, he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: [...] "If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience." [...] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that Avatar would need significant [...] "repeat business" [...] just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed Avatar could inspire the same [...] "sharing" [...] reaction as Titanic. He said that film worked because, [...] "When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it.

2500|$|Giddens {{discards}} {{the possibility}} of a single, comprehensive, all-connecting ideology or political programme. Instead he advocates going after the 'small pictures', ones people can directly affect at their home, workplace or local community. This, to Giddens, is a difference between pointless utopianism and useful utopian realism, which he defines as envisaging [...] "alternative futures whose very propagation might help them be realised". (The Consequences of Modernity). By 'utopian' he means <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> new and extraordinary, and by 'realistic' he stresses that this idea is rooted in the existing social processes and can be viewed as their simple extrapolation. Such a future has at its centre a more socialised, demilitarised and planetary-caring global world order variously articulated within green, women's and peace movements, and within the wider democratic movement.|$|E

Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, because we are not in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations.

2500|$|Aristarchus's [...] "hyper-criticism" [...] {{establishes}} a science for the mock heroic and follows {{up some of}} the ideas set forth by Pope in Peri Bathos in the Miscellanies, Volume the Third (1727). In this piece, the rules of heroic poetry could be inverted for the proper mock-heroic. The epic hero, Pope says, has wisdom, courage, and love. Therefore, the mock-hero should have [...] "Vanity, Impudence, and Debauchery." [...] As a wise man knows without being told, Pope says, so the vain man listens to no opinion but his own, and Pope quotes Cibber as saying, [...] "Let all the world impute to me what Folly or weakness they please; but till Wisdom can give me something that will make me more heartily happy, I am content to be Gazed at." [...] Courage becomes a hero, Pope says, and nothing is more perversely brave that summoning all one's courage just to the face, and he quotes Cibber's claim in the Apology that his face was almost the best known in England. Chivalric love is the mark of a hero, and Pope says <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> easy for the young to have. A mock-hero could keep his lust going when old, could claim, as Cibber does, [...] "a man has his Whore" [...] at the age of 80. When the three qualities of wisdom, courage, and love are combined in an epic hero, the result is, according to Pope, magnanimity that induces admiration in the reader. On the other hand, when vanity, impudence, and debauchery are combined in the [...] "lesser epic" [...] hero (Pope uses the term [...] "lesser epic" [...] to refer to the satirical epic that would function like a satire play in the Classical theatre), the result is [...] "Buffoonry" [...] that induces laughter and disgust. Finally, Pope says that Cibber's offences are compounded by the outlandishness of his claims. Although he was [...] "a person never a hero even on the Stage," [...] he sets himself out as an admirable and imitable person who expects applause for his vices.|$|E

60|$|But yet, {{if after}} all this any one will be so sceptical as to {{distrust}} his senses, and to affirm that all we see and hear, feel and taste, think and do, during our whole being, is but the series and deluding appearances of a long dream, whereof there is no reality; and therefore will question the existence of all things, or our knowledge of anything: I must desire him to consider, that, if all be a dream, then he doth but dream that he makes the question, {{and so it is}} not much matter that a waking man should answer him. But yet, if he pleases, he may dream that I make him this answer, That the certainty of things existing in RERUM NATURA when we have the testimony of our senses for it is not only as great as our frame can attain to, but as our condition needs. For, our faculties being suited not to the full extent of being, nor to a perfect, clear, comprehensive knowledge of things free from all doubt and scruple; but to the preservation of us, in whom they are; and accommodated to the use of life: they serve to our purpose well enough, if they will but give us certain notice of those things, which are convenient or inconvenient to us. For he that sees a candle burning, and hath experimented the force of its flame by putting his finger in it, will little doubt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> existing without him, which does him harm, and puts him to great pain: which is assurance enough, when no man requires greater certainty to govern his actions by than what is as certain as his actions themselves. And if our dreamer pleases to try whether the glowing heat of a glass furnace be barely a wandering imagination in a drowsy man's fancy, by putting his hand into it, he may perhaps be wakened into a certainty greater than he could wish, that it is something more than bare imagination. So that this evidence is as great as we can desire, being as certain to us as our pleasure or pain, i.e. happiness or misery; beyond which we have no concernment, either of knowing or being. Such an assurance of the existence of things without us is sufficient to direct us in the attaining the good and avoiding the evil which is caused by them, which is the important concernment we have of being made acquainted with them.|$|E
