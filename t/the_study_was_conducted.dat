5|$|In 1994, the NFL {{established}} the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later {{replaced by the}} Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating {{that there is not}} enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury. Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because {{he did not have a}} background in neurology and the research he published on brain injuries disagreed with the findings of independent scientists. In 2009, a NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, including the fact that <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> by phone. The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term brain injuries. A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.|$|E

25|$|Further, recent {{research}} has found that ketamine, a sedative, is capable of blocking referred pain. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> on patients suffering from fibromyalgia, a disease characterized by joint and muscle pain and fatigue. These patients were looked at specifically due to their increased sensitivity to nociceptive stimuli. Furthermore, referred pain appears in a different pattern in fibromyalgic patients than non-fibromyalgic patients. Often this difference manifests as a difference in terms of the area that the referred pain is found (distal vs. proximal) as compared to the local pain. The area is also much more exaggerated owing to the increased sensitivity.|$|E

25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim to have experienced and the effects these experiences have had on their lives. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> as an online survey with over 2,000 respondents {{from around the world}} participating. The results revealed that around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in a positive way. About 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or been touched by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E
25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits {{is not a new}} notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper. Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years. Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.|$|E
25|$|US News and World Report ranking In 2012, Wyalusing Area Junior Senior High School was {{recognized}} by US News and World Report as a Bronze level high school in a nationwide school ranking. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> by American Institutes for Research which examined how many students attained performance levels that exceed statistical expectations given the school's relative level of student poverty, as measured by state accountability test scores for all the school's students in the core subjects of reading and math. The study also examined the success rate for the school's least advantaged student groups (e.g., black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students) that exceed state averages. The study included 752 high schools in Pennsylvania, including traditional public schools, public charter schools and public magnet schools. In Pennsylvania, 136 public high schools achieved a Bronze rating in 2012; 49 achieved a silver rating and 7 received a gold rating. The highest ranking went to Julia R. Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School in the School District of Philadelphia in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, 33 {{percent of}} the journalists on SVT and SR {{supported}} the Left Party, which {{was about the same}} as journalists in commercial broadcasting and print media, but significantly more than among the general public, among whom 15 percent supported the Left Party. Support for the Left Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Party was stronger among journalists on SVT and SR than the general public, while the Moderate Party, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats had significantly less support among SVT and SR journalists than the public. However, the study concluded that the private political opinions of the journalists had little impact on their work and that news stories are treated the same regardless of the political color of the journalist, worth mentioning as well is that SJF, the organisation in which <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> partly is a unionbased organisation which could skew the accuracy of the representation within the selection (lessening the validity of the survey) as it is possible it excludes some rightwing journalists. The University of Gothenburg also made another study during the Swedish 2006 general election, comparing SVT's news programme Rapport to the country's five largest newspapers. The study concluded that Rapport's coverage of the election was the most balanced of them all.|$|E
500|$|Falkner Island {{has been}} the site of human {{activity}} for thousands of years. An archaeological survey performed on the island from 1997-1998 found a quartz projectile point of the Squibnocket triangle variety which dates to 1000-3000 B.C. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{as part of the}} erosion control project; it was required by law under the National Historic Preservation Act because the island is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Menta's The History of the Quinnipiac Indians identifies Falker Island as the site of ceremonial and religious practices, but that these practices are still unknown. [...] According to Bruchac's Thirteen Moons on Turtle's Back the island was not a permanent settlement, but was likely used for fishing and hunting trips in the summer.|$|E

2500|$|Asian {{elephant}} (Elephas maximus): [...] In a study {{performed in}} 2006 three female Asian elephants {{were exposed to}} a large mirror to investigate their responses. Visible marks and invisible sham-marks were applied to the elephants' heads to test whether they would pass the MSR test. [...] One of the elephants showed mark-directed behaviour, though the other two did not. An earlier study failed to find MSR in two Asian elephants; it was claimed this was because the mirror was too small. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) using elephants at the Bronx Zoo in New York. All three Asian elephants {{in the study were}} {{standing in front of a}} 2.5m-by-2.5m mirror—they inspected the rear and brought food close to the mirror for consumption. Evidence of elephant self-awareness was shown when one (and only one) elephant, Happy, repeatedly touched a painted X on her head with her trunk, a mark which could only be seen in the mirror. Happy ignored another mark made with colorless paint that was also on her forehead to ensure she was not merely reacting to a smell or feeling. Frans De Waal, who ran the study, stated, [...] "These parallels between humans and elephants suggest a convergent cognitive evolution possibly related to complex society and cooperation." ...|$|E
