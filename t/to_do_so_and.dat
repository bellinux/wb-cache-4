50|$|By {{the time}} the A-12 was {{operational}} in the early 1960s the blip/scan avoidance technique was no longer considered useful. The A-12 never flew over the Soviet Union (although it came close <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so)</b> <b>and</b> was limited <b>to</b> missions against other countries, like Vietnam.

In consequence, Barrow, the commander of the 4th Cavalry Division, relieved Howard-Vyse of his command on the spot. Lieutenant Colonel W. G. K.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the increase in}} journal prices and the resulting pressures on library budgets and argues {{that it is no}} longer possible or reasonable for libraries to continue to purchase subscription based journals in the ways they have done in the past.

5|$|The Congress {{endorsed}} the joint {{statement from the}} London conference over the angry dissent from some elements.

However, by December 1946, he insisted on a fully sovereign Pakistan with dominion status.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations {{has been}} a disappointing failure.... It {{has been a}} failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply {{sanctions}} except where it suited their individual national interests <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.|$|E

After venturing deep inside, Link must battle a flying creature known as Thunderbird, followed by a shadowy doppelgänger of himself known as Dark Link. Link then claims the Triforce of Courage and returns to Zelda. The three triangles unite into the collective Triforce, and Link's wish awakens Zelda. The game ends as they (presumably) kiss under a falling curtain.|$|E

In 1911, the Commonwealth Bank was established, but did not have the authority to print notes, which was a power that was still reserved to the Treasury. A movement toward reestablishing the gold standard occurred after World War I, with John Garvan leading various boards in contracting the money supply on the route <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> the gold standard was instituted for both the British pound sterling and the Australian pound in 1925.|$|R

5|$|Although MacArthur had no {{specific}} directive <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> the fighting on Luzon {{was far from}} over, he committed his forces to liberate {{the remainder of the}} Philippines. In the GHQ communiqué on 5 July, he announced that the Philippines had been liberated and all operations ended, although Yamashita still held out in northern Luzon. Starting in May 1945, MacArthur used his Australian troops in the invasion of Borneo. He accompanied the assault on Labuan, and visited the troops ashore. While returning to GHQ in Manila, he visited Davao, where he told Eichelberger that no more than 4,000 Japanese remained alive on Mindanao. A few months later, six times that number surrendered. In July 1945, he was awarded his fourth Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{was popular}} at Cambridge and enjoyed his time there. He {{took part in}} a variety of social engagements and became {{involved}} in other sports. These included fives, tennis, rugby union, golf and football. He captained Pembroke College at rugby and was close to playing for the full university side. Chapman continued to play rugby for Berkshire Wanderers until he was nearly 30 years old. Also for Pembroke, he played as goalkeeper in the football team and might have played for the university at hockey had he taken the sport seriously. In later years, he also displayed proficiency at tennis, in which critics thought he could have reached a high standard if motivated <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> golf.|$|E

5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, a new Mint director, Robert W. Woolley, took office. Woolley {{advocated}} {{the replacement of}} the silver coins when it was legal <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare new designs. He consulted with the Commission of Fine Arts, asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint's engravers and, if they felt they were not suitable, to recommend artists to design the new coins. The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers. Although Woolley had hoped that each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and half dollar, and one by MacNeil for the quarter.|$|E
