5|$|The Chhera Pahara (sweeping with water) is a {{significant}} ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra. During this ritual, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots. The king cleans <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder. As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannatha. This ritual signifies that under the lordship of Jagannatha, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign and the humblest devotee.|$|E
5|$|The gangsters/gun-runners {{who own the}} {{ammunition}} dump arrive and block <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang. The gangsters threaten the family, but Commander Pott throws the switch which transforms the car into an aeroplane and they take off, leaving the gangsters in helpless fury. The Potts stay overnight in a hotel in Calais. While the family sleeps, the gangsters break into the children's room and kidnap them and drive off towards Paris. Chitty tracks the gangsters' route, wakes Commander and Mrs. Pott, and they drive off in pursuit.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} to Ramsay Street, Bridget makes friends with Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) {{and she joins}} his {{football}} team, despite opposition from bully Justin Hunter (Chris Toohey). Bridget joins Declan Napier when he begins joyriding. During a race with Justin, they are pursued by the police. They return home thinking they escaped, {{only to find the}} police waiting for them. Bridget is banned from seeing Declan, but she sneaks out to meet him at the park, where they argue. On her way home, Bridget trips and falls into <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a car being driven by Susan Kennedy. Susan blacks out, a result of suffering from multiple sclerosis, and hits Bridget. She drives off, unaware of what she has done. Bridget is found and rushed to the hospital, where she undergoes emergency surgery for a bleed on her brain. She remains unconscious, until Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) visits and pleads with her to wake up. Bridget's hand moves and she awakes the next day. However, she cannot feel anything down the left side of her body and she is told that she could be permanently disabled. Susan realises that she caused the accident and comes forward. She is arrested and put on trial. Bridget remembers that she fell into the road and that the accident was not Susan's fault, and she tells the court. During a rehabilitation class at the swimming pool, Bridget meets Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). Following a disastrous date with Declan, where Bridget is given the impression that Declan cannot handle her disability, Bridget begins dating Josh. Following a roof collapse at an illegal dance party, Bridget and Josh are both trapped in rubble. Declan carries Josh out before coming back for Bridget. Another collapse traps Declan and Bridget together and Declan tells her that he does not have a problem with her disability. Shortly after, Bridget begins to walk without her walking aid and her mobility returns.|$|E
25|$|As his brigade retreated up {{the upper}} Piave valley, General-Major Josef Schmidt {{thoroughly}} obstructed <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Rusca. Unable {{to move his}} wagons and artillery in that direction, Rusca backtracked and followed in Eugène's path. The main column also faced a route littered with broken bridges. Eugène finally sent his artillery, cavalry, and trains back and directed them to follow in Seras' track. He continued to advance to Pontebba (Pontafel) with his infantry and some light guns.|$|E
25|$|Sykes had a {{difficult}} start to his next posting, in the Middle East. He was almost {{killed in a car}} accident on a steep road to the Horns of Hattin in Palestine. His car was fired on by a French warship as he drove to Sidon; he noticed tiny flashes blinking on the side of the ship, shortly followed by explosions on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him. He was violently sick on an aerial reconnaissance flight, and he became ill with malaria, ending up in hospital in Jerusalem.|$|E

The driver saw Duggan move onto <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him. The car swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but the driver said Duggan leapt in front of the car, arms raised and mouth open. The car hit him, denting the {{passenger}} door and shattering the passenger window and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue Golf, which ran over him. He was certified dead at the scene at 6:35am.|$|E

Lawlor had been travelling with Julia Kushnir, a Ukrainian legal assistant, aged 29, confirmed by the Lawlor family to be working as Lawlor's interpreter in Russia. She was injured in the crash that killed Lawlor. The driver, a Russian businessman, Ruslan Suliamanov, was fatally injured, when he swerved the car to avoid {{a man and a}} woman who ran out onto <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of it.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to Homer, Lisa has to fix Linguo, {{and misses}} {{the school bus}} as a result. She runs to school but on the way gets a ride from Krusty. However, Krusty mistakenly takes her to West Springfield Elementary School. Lisa leaves the school and, needing a ride, stops at Moe's Tavern looking for her dad, {{but he is not}} there. Homer comes in just as she is leaving by the back door. Outside, Lisa finds Marge, who tries to take her to school, but the car runs out of gas. Marge and Lisa see Cletus' truck and hitch a ride, but when he exits his truck they steal it and drive off for the school themselves. However, they are forced to stop when Bart emerges from a manhole in <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{worked with}} others in the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to try to persuade it to condemn fox hunting. The society disapproved of the {{campaign}} and in 1961 decided to purge itself of the leaders. Johnson was summoned before a special council in July 1961 and asked to explain his [...] "conduct prejudicial to the society"; the outcome was his expulsion. He moved on to the League Against Cruel Sports of which he became Vice-President; he supported direct action by squatting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of hunts, arguing that the result of any protesters being killed was that the huntsman [...] "stand a very fine chance of hanging or imprisonment".|$|R

25|$|In {{another example}} of the fierce, close fighting, a single soldier was {{responsible}} for disabling several tanks during a 24-hour period. On the evening of 17 December in nearby Rocherath, Pfc William A. Soderman of Company K, 9th Infantry, 2nd Infantry Division, heard enemy tanks approaching his position in the early evening. Armed with a bazooka, he waited until five Panthers were within pointblank range. He stood up in the road and fired a rocket into the lead tank, setting it on fire. The other tanks passed him by, but the next morning he repeated his actions. When five more German tanks approached, he jumped onto <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the tanks and disabled the lead tank. The remaining tanks were unable to bypass the lead tank and withdrew. Soderman was severely wounded and received the Medal of Honor for his actions.|$|E

Stöve followed with a stunning 7–6 set win over reigning Wimbledon champion and WTT Female Most Valuable Player Evert to extend the Golden Gaters lead to 13–8. Stöve and Dürr then dominated Evert and Shaw, 6–0, in women's doubles pushing the Golden Gaters lead to 19–8. Okker won the men's singles against Pattison, 7–6, in a tiebreaker, and Dürr and Lucas took the final set from Shaw and Roche, 6–2, for a final score of 32–16. Stöve had lost all six women's singles matchups with Evert during the regular season.|$|E
25|$|The last {{formation}} {{to leave}} Damascus, the 146th Regiment (Fourth Army) left {{during the night}} of 30 September, was followed early the next morning; 1 October by the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade), in the process accepting the surrender of the city. The Australian light horsemen followed the retreating columns north {{along the road to}} Homs during the day, encountering numerous rearguards which were attacked and captured, until they we were stopped by strong defences protecting a 2,000-strong column near Khan Ayash. Early the next morning a large column of retreating German and Ottoman combatants was seen moving towards a pass just north of Khan Ayash. Two squadrons of the 9th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) rode north to cut <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the column while the third squadron charged into the column splitting it and forcing it to surrender.|$|E

25|$|Kỳ {{was well}} known for his flamboyant, {{colorful}} conduct and dress during his younger days. His trademark fashion accessory before he faded from public view in the 1970s was a silk scarf, which he wore with his black flight suit. He often raised eyebrows {{when he was the}} military prime minister by arriving at events to meet civilians with his wife in matching black flight suits, boots, blue caps, and silk scarves. He rarely was seen without a cigarette. He was notorious for his love of gambling, women, and glamour, which made American officials wary of him. One official called him an “unguided missile.” When he was a young pilot, Kỳ once landed a helicopter in <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a girlfriend's house in order to impress her, causing the locals to panic and earning the ire of his commander for misusing military equipment. On one occasion, Kỳ is said to have pulled a handgun on a journalist whose questions annoyed him. Many in the South Vietnamese public service, military, and the general public hated his tempestuous and impetuous style and regarded him as a “cowboy.” and a “hooligan.” At his only public campaign appearance during the 1967 presidential election, the large crowd repeatedly heckled him loudly, calling him a “cowboy leader” and “hooligan” and as a result he did not make any more appearances at rallies.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the Jagannatha Temple {{started in}} 1136 AD and {{completed}} towards {{the latter part}} of the 12th century. The Eastern Ganga king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to Lord Jagannatha, then known as the Purushottam-Jagannatha, and resolved that from then on he and his descendants would rule under [...] "divine order as Jagannatha's sons and vassals". Even though princely states do not exist in India today, the heirs of the Gajapati dynasty of Khurda still perform the ritual duties of the temple; the king formally sweeps <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the chariots before the start of the Ratha Yatra.|$|E

When this line is sung, Madonna is shown kneeling on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the advancing car, then turns her head back while exposing her throat back in a posture of submission. However, her voice tone and her look at the camera portray a hardness and defiance that contradict the submissiveness of her body posture and turn the question of the line into a challenge for her lover.|$|E

In 1956, the Passionist monks who resided there sold the monastery site to Chicago-based developers Joseph Abbell and Bernard Greenbaum. Abbell, in a 1994 interview, {{stated that the}} developers chose Des Moines for their mall because of the city's [...] "reputation as a model urban area in middle America." [...] The mall was known as Northland Shopping Center early in its planning stages until Younkers executives suggested that it be named for Merle Hay, the first Iowan killed in World War I and namesake of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the mall, instead.

Creger and Slape exited {{by the back door}} and ducked into a nearby cowshed. They crossed a field and then found themselves in a minefield. Picking their way forward, they circled through the woods until they encountered a handful of Germans. Opening fire, they killed them. Creger and Slape spotted Bouck and Milosevich across the road and sprinted towards them, drawing German fire. They made it back to their ridge-top position and Bouck called Regimental Headquarters. He requested artillery support, but when he reported the German column advancing on his position, the {{voice on the other end}} of the radio told him [...] "he must be seeing things".

Eduardo Joson, would be sent in opposite directions to hold the main road near the camp. Pajota and 200guerrillas were {{to set up a}} roadblock next to the wooden bridge over the Cabu River. This setup, northeast of the prisoner camp, would be {{the first line of defense}} against the Japanese forces camped across the river, which would be within earshot of the assault on the camp. Joson and his 75guerrillas, along with a Ranger bazooka team, would set up a roadblock [...] southwest of the prisoner camp to stop any Japanese forces that would arrive from Cabanatuan. Both groups would each place 25 land mines in front of their positions, and oneguerrilla from each group was given a bazooka to destroy any armored vehicles. After the POWs and the remainder of the attacking force had reached the Pampanga River meeting point, Prince would fire a second flare to indicate to the ambush sites to pull back (gradually, if they faced opposition) and head to Plateros.|$|E
