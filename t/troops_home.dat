5|$|Although Gibraltar's {{civilian}} inhabitants {{had started}} to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after VJ Day {{was a lack of}} shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring <b>troops</b> <b>home,</b> but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of the}} peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.|$|E

5|$|At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul {{announced}} his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent).

Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing {{either of the two}} main parties' candidates (McCain– Republican Party, or Obama– Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the “charade” that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process. Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the same again.|$|E

40|$|The Blyde Canyon Nature reserve {{displays}} {{its natural}} beauty for most National and International visitors {{all over the}} World. The region is renowned for its high rainfall and misty weather, which enhances {{the natural beauty of}} the area. Because of the mist belt effect, the area {{is one of the largest}} commercial forestry areas in South Africa. Baboons also seek after the topography and vegetation type (Northeastern mountain sourveld) that is typical of this area and numerous baboon troops occur in this region. This combination is often the cause of conflict between baboons and humans. The need arise for these baboons to be studied and managed as a component of this very important ecosystem. The main aims of the study were firstly to identify a natural ranging baboon troop, to habituate them and gather data regarding <b>home</b> range sizes, <b>troop</b> sizes, densities and seasonal food selection and secondly to give a detailed habitat description and vegetation map of the <b>troop's</b> <b>home</b> range. The baboon activity data was collected in 15 -minute intervals over a one year period on a troop at Bourke's Luck. This included all activities such as walking, social, foraging, and resting. The food parts selected as well as the species foraged on was identified. Numerous statistical methods were used on the baboon data such as; the Shapiro Wilk test, Spearman rank-order correlation, ANOVA, and the Kolmogarov-Smirnov two sample test. There was a positive correlation between home range areas and troop sizes and the baboons preferred certain habitats above others during different seasons. To give a detailed habitat description of the <b>troop's</b> <b>home</b> range, 50 sample plots was stratified-randomly distributed in order to include all the different stratification units. a TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures was carried out on the Bourke's Luck section that included the baboons home range. 13 Plant communities, which can be grouped into 7 major community types were identified. This study resulted in the ecological interpretation of baboon activities related to the ecological interpretation of the vegetation in the baboon <b>troop's</b> <b>home</b> range.
