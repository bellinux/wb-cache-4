5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, what can be done with various objects <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> setting, and what characters can do during the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E
5|$|The storyline is {{primarily}} followed with missions through the governing nations <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> base game {{as well as}} each expansion that the player is affiliated with. Nation or governing body affiliation is relatively simple, sometimes requiring prerequisite quests being completed and have several stages of progression to achieve higher recognition and reward throughout each story. Some missions are even required to be completed to further progress into {{the start of the}} additional storylines of each expansion or specific areas.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} time {{anything}} other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron, and La Salle's voyage was thus germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes. Located in the natural harbour, the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products. The natural port and the salt caverns <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding areas, together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 led to the massive growth of the petroleum industry in this area. Because Oil Springs {{was the first}} place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil, the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other nations how to drill for oil.|$|E

25|$|Third {{generation}} sequencing {{may also}} be {{used in conjunction with}} second generation sequencing. This approach {{is often referred to as}} hybrid sequencing.

In general, this hybrid approach has been shown to improve de novo genome assemblies significantly.|$|E

25|$|The Public Libraries Act 1850 (13 & 14 Vict c.65) was an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament {{which first}} gave local boroughs {{the power to}} {{establish}} free public libraries. The Act was the first legislative step {{in the creation of}} an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature, and was indicative of the moral, social and educative concerns of the time. The legacy of the Act can be followed through subsequent legislation that built on and expanded the powers granted in 1850 and the 4,145 public libraries <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom in the 21st century can trace their origins back to this Act.|$|E
25|$|There {{appears to}} be no {{official}} precursory education; apparently, wizard parents home-school their children in basic non-magical topics, such as literacy and arithmetic. Muggle-born wizards (or Muggle-raised wizards), however, clearly experience an ordinary Muggle primary education before enrolling at Hogwarts, something that could be viewed as either a cognitive edge or disadvantage. There are also no compulsory educational laws <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Wizarding World. Parents may continue to home-school their children, send them to Hogwarts, or send them abroad to other wizarding schools. However, during the time Voldemort had overthrown the Ministry of Magic, attendance at Hogwarts was compulsory, so that his followers could have complete control over the wizarding youth.|$|E

25|$|The Iberian Peninsula, {{located on}} an {{important}} route between Africa and Europe, was enriched by the arrival, following the climate change, of wetland plants, thermophilic plants (those {{that require a}} great deal of heat), xerophilic plants (those that require a dry climate), orophilic (sub-alpine) plants, Boreo-alpine plants, and so on, many of which managed to remain, thanks to the diversity of environments <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountain ranges, and which allowed them to rise in altitude if the climate was too warm, or descend if it became too cold. The geological complexity of the majority of Iberian mountains, especially of the Cordillera Bética, Sistema Ibérico, and Pyrenees, also greatly increased the number of new environments to which it was possible to adapt, resulting in today's wide variety of flora.|$|E
25|$|Rainforests are {{the oldest}} {{ecosystems}} on earth. Rainforest {{plants and animals}} continued to evolve, developing into the most diverse and complex ecosystems on earth.

Since the tropical rainforests are estimated to hold 50% of the planet's species, the canopy of rainforests worldwide may hold 45% of life on Earth. The Amazon rainforest borders 8 countries, it has the world's largest river basin and the source of 1/5 of the Earth's river water. It has the world's highest diversity of birds and freshwater fish. The Amazon is home to more species of plants and animals than any other terrestrial ecosystem on the planet—perhaps 30% of the world's species are found there.|$|E
