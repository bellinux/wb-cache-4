5|$|Adenhart was {{declared}} the best prospect in the Angels organization going into 2009, and was ranked 68th overall on Baseball Americas 2009 Top 100 Prospects list, citing his 158 innings pitched per year over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>seasons.</b> Adenhart earned his {{spot in the}} Angels' 2009 starting rotation during spring training. He appeared in six starts and had a 3–0 record with a 3.12 ERA over 26 innings pitched. He allowed only nine earned runs and five walks, while striking out 18. Adenhart opened the 2009 season as the third starter in the Angels' rotation. In his season debut on April 8, 2009, he earned a no-decision, giving up seven hits and no runs while striking out five batters and walking three in six innings against the Oakland Athletics at Angel Stadium of Anaheim.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 draft {{class is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best in NBA history as it produced five Hall of Famers and seven All-Stars. However, it was also marked by the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie, considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history. It is believed that the Blazers picked Bowie over Michael Jordan because they already had an All Star shooting guard in Jim Paxson and a young shooting guard in Clyde Drexler, whom they drafted in the 1983 draft. Although Drexler went on to have a successful career, Bowie's career was cut short by injuries; he had missed two of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>seasons</b> in his college career as well. Despite having a 10-year career in the NBA and averaging 10.9points and 7.5rebounds per game, Bowie's career was interrupted by five leg surgeries, which limited him to 139games in 5years with the Blazers.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the squad that performed so well {{in the second half}} of the club's 2008–09 campaign were retained, with very little transfer activity in comparison to previous seasons under Westley. Steve Morison, the club's top goalscorer for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>seasons,</b> moved to Millwall for a fee of £130,000, while both John Martin and Calum Willock were released by Westley in late May 2009. Midfielder Gary Mills was the last departure of the close season; rejecting a contract and instead opting to join fellow Conference Premier rivals Mansfield Town. Five players joined the club during the close season. Charlie Griffin was the first signing of the season, joining Stevenage from Salisbury City on a free transfer. Yemi Odubade, Chris Beardsley, and Joel Byrom signed for the club shortly after; the latter commanding a transfer fee of £15,000. Westley had previously managed Beardsley at Rushden & Diamonds and Kettering Town. The last signing of pre-season was Stacy Long; who joined the club on a free transfer from Ebbsfleet United. No players departed the club during the season, with Tim Sills the only addition – signing for an undisclosed fee from Torquay United in January 2010.|$|E

5|$|Most pre-race {{analyses}} identified Ivan Basso, Cadel Evans, and Carlos Sastre as {{the major}} favorites to win the overall classification, with Evans perhaps the consensus pick. Basso and Sastre had both ridden the Giro in 2009 and come away finishing in the top five. Sastre also won two difficult mountain stages in the race's final week, and was noted as a rider who gets stronger as a race goes along, making the Giro's very climbing-intensive third week possibly sit in his favor. Evans had finished on a Grand Tour podium in each of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>seasons,</b> including {{in the most recent}} three-week event, the 2009 Vuelta a España. He also entered the race as the reigning world cycling champion and had had a successful 2010 season to date, with a win in La Flèche Wallonne and a podium finish in the Tirreno–Adriatico. Neither Basso nor Sastre had raced much in the 2010 season prior to the Giro. Other riders named as contenders included Bradley Wiggins, former Giro winners Damiano Cunego and Stefano Garzelli, Alexander Vinokourov, Marzio Bruseghin, Christian Vande Velde, Domenico Pozzovivo, David Moncoutié, and Michele Scarponi. Race director Angelo Zomegnan also named Basso, Evans, and Sastre as his three favorites, and included Wiggins and Linus Gerdemann as possible darkhorses.|$|E

These changes, as well as a reduced fixed purse for non-chartered teams, effectively reduces the viability of start and park strategies.|$|R
5000|$|After the call, angry Braves fans began {{throwing}} {{plastic bottles}} and other debris onto the field, causing {{the game to}} be delayed for nearly 20 minutes.

40|$|Received Best Paper Award at Conference. The Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center {{has been}} {{sponsoring}} {{regional and international}} underwater robotics competitions for 10 years. In that period, thousands of students and educators have taken part in the independent evaluation of the program, reported annually to the National Science Foundation. The evaluation sheds light on the impacts of involvement in this hands-on engineering design competition. Evaluation topics include changes in student awareness of and interest in pursuing a marine science, technology, engineering and/or math (STEM) career, interest in studying STEM topics, STEM knowledge and skills, and SCANS skills.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the paper, daily price data for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> summer <b>seasons</b> in <b>the</b> PJM {{wholesale}} market are used to estimate a stochastic regime switching model. These data show that the average price in 1999, when market-based offers were allowed, was twice as high as it was in the previous two seasons when offers had to be cost-based. The primary cause was that the price spikes in 1999 were much higher than they were in 1997 - 98, but not more frequent. The second part of the paper derives an optimum set of offers for individual suppliers endowed with different levels of market power. A supplier controlling generation equivalent to 20 % of the expected load in the market is shown to submit offers that are up to 80 % higher than the true cost. Nevertheless, these offers are still much lower than the offers that set the high prices in the PJM market. The explanation is that suppliers with sufficient market power are indifferent to whether or not marginal units are dispatched, and they can set high offers on these units without forfeiting expected profits. The author wishes to thank Yumei Ning for research assistance in estimating the price models in Section 2, and Jonell Blakeley and Dan Chapman for help preparing the manuscript.

25|$|Another pre-game storyline {{involved}} backup Steelers tight end/fullback Sean McHugh. McHugh, {{who spent}} <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>seasons</b> with the Detroit Lions, made that team's 53-man roster {{at the end}} of the preseason, only to be released 24 hours later alongside linebacker Anthony Cannon in order for the Lions to make room for linebacker Ryan Nece and running back Marcus Thomas. The Steelers promptly signed McHugh after the team traded center Sean Mahan back to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for a draft pick before the start of the season. The subsequent media attention surrounding McHugh had to do with him being deemed not good enough for the Lions (a team that would finish 0–16, the NFL's first imperfect season since the expansion 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers), but good enough for a Super Bowl team such as the Steelers and being a valuable blocker for Ben Roethlisberger and Willie Parker. McHugh himself had mixed feelings about the situation, feeling bad for his former Lions teammates, but also feeling it's a little payback for the Lions for releasing him in the first place. McHugh would play in the Super Bowl as a blocker, much like his regular season role.|$|E

40|$|Key Findings: • Long-term {{monitoring}} at permanent transects {{revealed that}} seagrasses in the Western Basin and Rodds Bay underwent distinct seasonal changes {{as well as}} significant inter-annual changes in seagrass distribution, abundance and species composition. • Over {{the duration of the}} monitoring program (since November 2009), Gladstone has received higher than average rainfall in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> consecutive wet <b>seasons,</b> punctuated by two of the worst flood events on record. • Significant declines in seagrass abundance occurred at all sites during the monitoring program, particularly following the 2010 / 2011 floods. Some sites have shown substantial recovery, particularly in the outer harbour; however inner harbour sites have yet to recover to pre-flood levels. • Inner harbour sites were particularly impacted by the floods with many sites losing all seagrass cover. These sites have shown initial recolonisation in subsequent growing seasons, but abundance has declined each senescent season to very low levels. Increased rainfall and flooding and an associated decrease in Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching seagrasses was strongly correlated with the declines in seagrass abundance. • During 2011 seagrass C:P, N:P and C:N ratios plummeted at all sites in the inner and outer harbour, indicating that seagrasses were existing in a nitrogen limited, low light and nutrient rich environment. This was most likely associated with very high rainfall and river flow events in early 2011 bringing large volumes of highly turbid water and increased nutrients to the system. • Seed banks for Halophila ovalis and Zostera capricorni were detected at some locations in the harbour from which recovery could be initiated when conditions are favourable for germination, seedling survival and for subsequent clonal growth and colonisation. • Gladstone seagrasses were capable of rapid clonal growth and the production of flowers, fruits and seeds. However this varied substantially between meadows and time of year. It is likely that propagule limitation at some sites may be inhibiting seagrass recovery. • It is estimated that the major area of dense seagrass in Gladstone, the intertidal Zostera capricorni meadow at Pelican Banks, incorporates up to 0. 63 grams of carbon m⁻² day⁻¹ into its above-ground biomass, which translates to more than 4 tonnes of carbon per day for the meadow at peak distribution and density. ...|$|R
