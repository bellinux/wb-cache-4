The stations planned <b>transmitter</b> <b>site</b> was at Burslem Cricket Club, and it proposed a mix of music and talk with a local angle. However, 6 Towns' license application, and other local stations were turned down. No station in Stoke-on-Trent was awarded a licence due to frequency allocations.

25|$|KQV is an AM radio station, {{licensed}} to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which broadcasts at 1410 kHz, with 5,000 watts of power day and night.

KQV's <b>transmitter</b> <b>site</b> consists of five towers located in Ross Township; a different directional pattern is used days and nights. Since 1993 the main studio has been located in Pittsburgh's Centre City Tower. It {{is the sole}} radio station owned by Calvary, Inc.|$|E
25|$|CBS also {{maintained}} an arrangement with Channel 4 {{to use the}} station's remote unit to transmit live programming broadcast by the network during the 1960s and 1970s; in particular, the remote transmission truck was used to relay color broadcasts of CBS's NFL and college football game telecasts held in Texas. In 1964, KDFW moved its operations from the Times Heralds Patterson Street offices into its current, purpose-built studio facility at 400 North Griffin Street (across {{the street from the}} former building, at the intersection of Griffin and San Jacinto). In 1968, KDFW's original <b>transmitter</b> <b>site</b> in Cedar Hill was struck by a helicopter, causing substantial damage to the tower.|$|E

25|$|RTÉ was {{established}} on 1 June 1960 (as Radio Éireann) under the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960, the principal legislation under which it operates. The existing Radio Éireann service {{was transferred to}} the new authority, which was also made responsible for the new television service (Telefís Éireann). The television service started broadcasting on 31 December 1961, from the Kippure <b>transmitter</b> <b>site</b> near Dublin. Eamonn Andrews was the first Chairman of Radio Éireann, the first director general was Edward Roth. The name of the authority was changed, at the suggestion of Áine Ní Cheanainn, to Radio Telefís Éireann by the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act 1966, and both the radio and television services became known as RTÉ in that year.|$|E
25|$|The Navy had {{installed}} a high-powered Alexanderson alternator, built by General Electric (GE), at the American Marconi <b>transmitter</b> <b>site</b> in New Brunswick, New Jersey. It {{proved to be}} superior for transatlantic transmissions to the spark transmitters that had been traditionally used by the Marconi companies. Marconi officials were so impressed by {{the capabilities of the}} Alexanderson alternators that they began making preparations to adopt them as their standard transmitters for international communication. A tentative plan made with General Electric proposed that over a two-year period the Marconi companies would purchase most of GE's alternator production. However, this proposal was met with disapproval, on national security grounds, by the U.S. Navy, which was concerned that this would guarantee British domination of international radio communication.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, {{the station}} {{suffered}} {{what could have}} been a crippling blow; the collapse of its main antenna at the Bloomingdale <b>transmitter</b> <b>site.</b> WMAQ was able to be on the air, but not at its normal 50,000 watt power. While the main antenna was out of service, NBC found a solution with some history to it to get WMAQ back broadcasting at full power. RCA had a tower in storage in one of its New Jersey facilities that was used as part of its 1939 New York World's Fair exhibit. The tower, which originally came from NBC's WTAM in Cleveland, was shipped to Chicago and became the acting main antenna; it stands today at Bloomingdale. The station launched a new main antenna tower at Bloomingdale in 1951, which was considered to be one of the tallest structures in the US at the time.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{acquisition}} of the licence, CTL needed to find suitable sites for both a studio and a transmitter. Initially, Mount Ainslie (approximately 10km north-east of Canberra's city centre, at an elevation of 842 m above sea level) was considered as a potential <b>transmitter</b> <b>site.</b> It was turned down, however, because it was already {{under the control of}} the Department of Civil Aviation (who would be unwilling to surrender or lease the site due to its proximity to the Airport and the Air Force base). It was also determined that a transmitter located atop Mount Ainslie would not provide ample coverage of the entire Canberra area (notable black-spots would have included the Woden and Belconnen districts), nor would there be enough room for the ABC's television transmitter (whose service was due to commence in December 1962) as well as CTC. Other sites considered included Mounts Gray, Bowning, Ginini and Bull's Head.|$|E
25|$|Greenville was {{the largest}} <b>transmitter</b> <b>site</b> for the Voice of America shortwave {{broadcasts}} {{under the auspices of}} the U.S. government's International Broadcasting Bureau. Both transmitter buildings and three large antenna 'farms' were located just outside Greenville. The Greenville Transmitting Station provided shortwave broadcasts for U.S. government-funded, non-military, international broadcasting and served as a standby, alternate gateway for the Satellite Interconnect System to use to uplink programming, should the Washington, D.C., SIS gateway have become unavailable. The station was also a backup facility for uplinking programming to the Atlantic Ocean Region satellite and served as the primary return link of that satellite. For the VOA, the main target areas for the station's shortwave broadcasts were Latin America, the Caribbean with special emphasis on Cuba, and Africa. Three complexes, one for management, distribution, and monitoring, and the other two for actual transmitting, formed an approximately nineteen mile (30km) equilateral triangle around Greenville. At one time, these formed the largest international broadcasting site in the world. Two of the three sites have been decommissioned.|$|E
