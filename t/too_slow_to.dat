The driving force of development of DDBMS is the demand of the applications that need to query very large databases (order of terabytes).

This paper presents a better way to find the optimal number of nodes in a distributed database management systems...|$|R

Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> replenish them.|$|E
5|$|Humans are not {{appropriate}} prey because the shark's digestion is <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> {{cope with a}} human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 {{there have been a}} total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.|$|E

5|$|Once in space, sudden {{exposure}} of unprotected humans to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs, {{due to the}} large pressure differential between {{inside and outside the}} chest. Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1936–37 season, the Rangers signed Johnson {{to serve}} as the {{defensive}} coach while he continued to play. He appeared in 35 games but scored no points. Seeing little playing time, and having an offer to coach a minor league team, Johnson requested that the Rangers give him his outright release following the season. Believing that he had become <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> play, the team agreed. He subsequently signed with the New York Americans, with whom he played one final NHL season in 1937–38.|$|E

50|$|The Type 1 Ho-Ha was {{developed}} in 1941 {{as a result of}} a request from the army for a vehicle that could be used to transport a squad of infantry to the battlefield protected from enemy small arms fire. Despite experiences of the Second Sino-Japanese War, armored personnel carriers were viewed as <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> compared <b>to</b> wheeled trucks and there was not much effort for their development in the army.|$|R
5|$|Although {{existing}} sources do not record {{when the}} Mk. XIV went into {{production in the}} UK, they do record that operational testing started in January 1942 and production examples started reaching squadrons in March. It was manufactured by small machine shops and instrument makers, such as the Aron Meter Company. Production was <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> meet the demand; between July and October, fewer than a hundred a month were being delivered. As the design was finalized, automated production was undertaken and by mid-1943, 900 a month were available. This was enough to equip the heavy bombers as they arrived from the production lines and by late 1942 the Handley Page Halifax was being delivered with the sight head already installed.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War in August 1914, she was mobilised for service in the South America Station, where she patrolled for German commerce raiders. She was involved in the search for the German East Asia Squadron of Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee. <b>Too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> follow Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock's cruisers, she missed the Battle of Coronel in November 1914, where Cradock was defeated. Moored at Port Stanley as a defensive battery, she fired the first shots of the Battle of the Falklands in December, which led Spee to break off the attack before being chased down and destroyed by Admiral Doveton Sturdee's battlecruisers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, the {{mobilization}} of the fleet was complete; Kaiser Karl VI {{was assigned to the}} Cruiser Flotilla, which was commanded by Vice Admiral Paul Fiedler. For most of the war, the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though the armored cruisers were <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> operate with the newer s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations. In May 1915, Italy declared war on the Central Powers. The Austro-Hungarians continued their strategy of serving as a fleet in being, which would tie down the now further numerically superior Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought.|$|E

5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E
5|$|Deutschland {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} until 1896, though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted {{with the exception of}} the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels. She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean, often escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on official state visits. Deutschland was rebuilt in the early 1890s as an armored cruiser, though she was <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> perform satisfactorily in this role. Nevertheless, she spent three years in the East Asia Squadron before returning to Germany in 1900. She was used in secondary roles after 1904, until 1908 when she was sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E
50|$|When {{hostilities}} {{between the}} Sassanids and the Arabs finally began, the Persian army faced fundamental problems.

5|$|Hydra and {{her sisters}} saw heavy service with the Greek Navy. They participated in the GrecoTurkish War in 1897 until the Great Powers intervened and {{prevented}} the Greek Navy from capitalizing on their superiority over the Ottoman Navy. Hydra saw action in the First Balkan War at the Naval Battle of Elli and {{was present at the}} Naval Battle of Lemnos, but was <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> actively engage the Ottoman forces. She did not see action during World War I, and was reduced to a gunnery training ship {{after the end of the}} war. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E
5|$|In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval {{historian}} Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But {{in other}} respects, {{they were a}} dismal failure. They were <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn {{out of control and}} even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.|$|E

Kaiser was rebuilt in the early 1890s as an armored cruiser, though she was <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> perform satisfactorily in this role. Nevertheless, she spent several years as the flagship of the East Asia Squadron before returning to Germany in 1899. She was used in secondary roles after 1904, until after the end of World War I in 1919, when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
