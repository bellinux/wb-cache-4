5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E

5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Walter Baade {{became the}} first {{astronomer}} to identify a nebula as a supernova remnant when he suggested that the Crab Nebula was the remains of SN 1054. He noted <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> had {{the appearance of a}} planetary nebula, the measured velocity of expansion was much too large to belong to that classification. During the same year, Baade first proposed the use of the Type Ia supernova as a secondary distance indicator. Later, the work of Allan Sandage and Gustav Tammann helped refine the process so that Type Ia supernovae became a type of standard candle for measuring large distances across the cosmos.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the {{government}} went before Moskowitz seeking summary judgement. The case turned {{on whether the}} KD II was a fishing vessel under the SFPA. Early in 2005 he issued his ruling, holding <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> was not directly engaged in fishing it was nevertheless engaging in activities supporting fishing and thus also subject to the SFPA. He did not grant the forfeiture as NOAA had not moved for it yet.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the war, No.11 Group {{was formed}} on Morotai in the Dutch East Indies, using {{elements}} of Northern Command and the First Tactical Air Force; this freed the latter from garrison duties following the liberation of Borneo. In recommending the Morotai garrison's establishment, Bostock explained <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> shared the static characteristic of an area command, it differed in that the area commands were part of the permanent structure of the Air Force and situated within the borders of Australia's mainland and overseas territories, whereas the new formation was a temporary wartime measure, headquartered on foreign territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of sodium bicarbonate solution to rapidly improve the acid {{levels in the}} blood is controversial. There {{is little evidence that}} it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed some evidence <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> may improve the acidity of the blood, it may actually worsen acidity inside the body's cells and increase the risk of certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged, although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH<6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH 6.9–7.0).|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Author John Sellers listed {{it among the}} weirder arcade games released. Clare Edgeley of Computer and Video Games echoed similar statements. She criticized the game, stating that the constant blue background was dull and the game lacked longevity. Retro Gamers Darran Jones described the game as engrossing and obscure. He also expressed disappointment that few people remember it. Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame called Bubbles a slightly underrated game. He stated <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> lacked excitement, its gameplay was enjoyable. Weiss further commented that the control scheme was unique for its time, and {{that the number of}} on-screen objects moving smoothly was impressive.|$|E

5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator are very close to it.|$|E
5|$|A December 2007 QSR Magazine {{article about}} the {{conflict}} claimed that Burger King Brands had devised a contingency plan to remove itself from the dispute. Citing internal company documents, the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might {{prove to be a}} possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax implications, and that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements. As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its Have it Your Way Foundation) for family members of CIW workers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> could have been implemented, it {{did not need to}} be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E
5000|$|Dread Central {{gave the}} film a mixed review, saying <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it's</b> [...] "a great looking low budget horror movie", it [...] "was a 75-minute movie where very little {{happened}} until {{the film is}} already halfway over and what did happen wasn't worth the wait."

5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the blanket was soaked by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> is true that the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> is not impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object {{would have to be}} lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{negative}} reception, the Wii version has had some positive reception. While Official Nintendo Magazine UK editor Tom East similarly bemoaned the motion controls, {{he felt that the}} multiplayer still held up, as it becomes balanced since the other players would have the same problems with the controls. 1UP.com editor Justin Haywald agreed, stating <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> made single player modes difficult, the game was meant to be played with friends. Game Informer editor Matt Helgeson, however, found the motion controls to be good, commenting that other developers should learn from Nintendo. In spite of this, fellow Game Informer editor Matthew Kato described the controls as being only so-so. GameShark editor Danielle Riendeau, however, described the controls as excellent, though adding that it occasionally misreads her shots. In the first four days of the Wii version's release in Japan, Mario Power Tennis sold 56,000 copies. By January 3, 2010, it had sold 205,070 copies in Japan.|$|E
50|$|In {{a conference}} call with a number of {{predominant}} support groups that formed in anticipation over the Canadian Premier League.

However, the 7th and 8th team will already be known. Beirne also stated that he hopes that the league will eventually grow to 12 teams within 10 years of forming.|$|R

Goro's boss calls him {{at the hospital}} and berates him for slacking off rather than pursuing more information on Agon's attack, informing him that Dr. Ukyo had an important announcement {{that he was going to}} make later that day.|$|R
5000|$|Eurogamer gave A Machine for Pigs a {{score of}} 7 out of 10, noting that it [...] "will {{absolutely}} keep you fed". GameSpot gave the game {{a score of}} 8 out of 10, saying <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it's</b> a [...] "captivating adventure", it is also [...] "a very dark and disturbing one that touches on depressing real-world themes and doles out psychological horror along with monsters and gore". Edge magazine wrote that [...] "A Machine For Pigs will prove divisive among fans of Frictional Games' much-lauded original".|$|R
5|$|The river {{has been}} managed {{by a number}} of bodies, {{including}} the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers, the Rye Harbour Commissioners, and the Board of Conservators for the River Rother. After the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, it was managed by the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board, the Kent River Board, the Kent and Sussex River Authorities, the National Rivers Authority and finally the Environment Agency. It is unusual, in <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Environment Agency, it has been a free river since 1826, and so no licence is required to use it. Management of the levels adjacent to the river is undertaken by the Romney Marshes Area Internal Drainage Board. The Rother passes by or near the villages of Etchingham, Robertsbridge, Bodiam, Northiam, and Wittersham.|$|E
5|$|The River Board Act of 1950 {{sought to}} replace the Catchment Boards with larger organisations, and from 1950 the East Sussex River Board took over the {{responsibilities}} {{of most of the}} catchments in East Sussex, but the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board became part of the Kent River Board. Further changes followed the Water Resources Act 1963, and responsibility passed to the Kent and Sussex River Authorities in 1964. Ten years later, these structures were replaced by unitary authorities, who had responsibility for the supply of drinking water and for the drainage function of rivers. This lasted until the passing of the Water Act 1989, which split apart the two functions, and management of the river became the responsibility of the National Rivers Authority, Southern Region. Finally in April 1996, the National Rivers Authority was abolished with the formation of the Environment Agency. The agency has responsibility for drainage and water quality, {{and in the case of}} some rivers, it holds the navigation rights. The Rother is unusual, in <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> is under the jurisdiction of the Environment Agency, it is a free river, and so a licence is not required to use it. The Environment Agency also acts as the harbour authority for Rye Harbour, another unique situation, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs acts as a signatory to the Harbour of Rye Bylaws.|$|E
