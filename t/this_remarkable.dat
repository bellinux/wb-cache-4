5|$|Around {{this time}} the marshall of Jülich {{approached}} Mercator {{and asked him to}} prepare a set of European regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron's son, the crown prince Johannes. <b>This</b> <b>remarkable</b> collection has been preserved and is now held in the British Library under the title Atlas of Europe (although Mercator never used such a title). Many of the pages were assembled from dissected Mercator maps and in addition there are thirty maps from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius.|$|E
5|$|To the {{disappointment}} of the Catholic party, however, Mary tolerated {{the newly established}} Protestant ascendancy, and kept her half-brother Lord Moray as her chief advisor. Her privy council of 16 men, appointed on 6 September 1561, retained those who already held the offices of state and was dominated by the Protestant leaders from the reformation crisis of 1559–1560: the Earls of Argyll, Glencairn, and Moray. Only four of the councillors were Catholic: the Earls of Atholl, Erroll, Montrose, and Huntly, who was Lord Chancellor. Modern historian Jenny Wormald found <b>this</b> <b>remarkable,</b> suggesting that Mary's failure to appoint a council sympathetic to Catholic and French interests was an indication of her focus on {{the goal of the}} English throne over the internal problems of Scotland. Even the one significant later addition to the council, Lord Ruthven in December 1563, was another Protestant whom Mary personally disliked. In this, she was acknowledging her lack of effective military power {{in the face of the}} Protestant lords, while also following a policy that strengthened her links with England. She joined with Lord Moray in the destruction of Scotland's leading Catholic magnate, Lord Huntly, in 1562 after he led a rebellion in the Highlands against her.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{result is}} what {{is now known as}} the Prime Number Theorem. It is a central result in {{analytic}} number theory. Loosely speaking, it states that given a large number N, the number of primes {{less than or equal to}} N is about N/log(N).|$|E

25|$|Regarded as the {{archetype}} {{of the classic}} Gothic style, the cathedral also presents some elements of the radiant Gothic style and flamboyant Gothic. The speed of construction, barely 70 years for the shell (1220 to 1269), explains <b>this</b> <b>remarkable</b> homogeneity of style.

25|$|Chicago's Monadnock Building (not {{designed}} by Sullivan) straddles <b>this</b> <b>remarkable</b> moment of transition: the northern {{half of the}} building, finished in 1891, is of load-bearing construction, while the southern half, finished only two years later, is of column-frame construction. While experiments in this new technology were taking place in many cities, Chicago was the crucial laboratory.

25|$|In 613, outside Antioch, the Persian generals Shahrbaraz and Shahin decisively {{defeated}} a major counter-attack led {{in person}} by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius.

However, Nicklaus did not win the Grand Slam that year, as Lee Trevino {{repeated}} as the Open Championship winner (Nicklaus finished second, one shot behind), and Gary Player prevailed in the PGA Championship. Nicklaus closed out <b>this</b> <b>remarkable</b> year with a second of three consecutive Walt Disney World Golf Classic victories by shooting a 21-under par 267 to win by nine shots.

25|$|There is {{the tale}} (p.28 ff.) of the arrow that landed at al-Mansur's feet with verses inscribed {{in each of}} the three {{feathers}} and along the shaft causing him to investigate the unjust imprisonment of a distinguished notable from Hamadan. There is the story of the singer Harun al-Rashid asks to keep singing until the caliph falls asleep. Then a handsome young man arrives, snatches the lute from the singer's hand and shows him how it really should be done. On awakening Harun is told of this and suggests his singer had a supernatural visitation. Al-Mas‘udi quotes the lines (five in English) of <b>this</b> <b>remarkable</b> song.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} the Gagikashen, this church was {{constructed}} between the years 1001 and 1005 and {{intended to be a}} recreation of the celebrated cathedral of Zvartnots at Vagharshapat. Nikolai Marr uncovered the foundations of <b>this</b> <b>remarkable</b> building in 1905 and 1906. Before that, all that was visible on the site was a huge earthen mound. The designer of the church was the architect Trdat. The church is known to have collapsed a relatively short time after its construction and houses were later constructed on top of its ruins. Trdat's design closely follows that of Zvartnotz in its size and in its plan (a quatrefoil core surrounded by a circular ambulatory).|$|E
