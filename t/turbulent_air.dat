5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the <b>turbulent</b> <b>air</b> under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|The third {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in early 1948, but {{the pace of}} the flight testing was leisurely with only 7 hours and 40 minutes completed by 30 November, over half of which were connected with air show performances. Testing concluded in March 1949 when the officer in charge concluded that there was no further purpose to the tests. While the Firecrest was faster than the Firebrand, and gave its pilot a much better view from the cockpit, it was otherwise disappointing, with test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown claiming that the Firecrest was even less manoeuvrable than the sluggish Firebrand, while the powered ailerons gave lumpy controls, leading to instability in <b>turbulent</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{the ball}} is new the seam is {{used to create a}} layer of <b>turbulent</b> <b>air</b> {{on one side of the}} ball, by angling it to one side and {{spinning}} the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this <b>turbulent</b> <b>air</b> creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the <b>turbulent</b> <b>air</b> due to the greater air coverage and as there is a difference in air velocity, the static pressure of both sides of the ball are different and {{the ball is}} both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the turbulent airflow side of the ball.|$|E

25|$|A {{jet blast}} {{deflector}} (JBD) or blast fence is a safety device that redirects the high energy exhaust from a jet engine to prevent damage and injury. The structure must {{be strong enough to}} withstand heat and high speed air streams as well as dust and debris carried by the <b>turbulent</b> <b>air.</b> Without a deflector, jet blast can be dangerous to people, equipment and other aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Arctic haze is the {{phenomenon}} of a visible reddish-brown springtime haze in the atmosphere at high latitudes in the Arctic due to anthropogenic air pollution. A major distinguishing factor of Arctic haze {{is the ability of}} its chemical ingredients to persist in the atmosphere {{for an extended period of}} time compared to other pollutants. Due to limited amounts of snow, rain, or <b>turbulent</b> <b>air</b> to displace pollutants from the polar air mass in spring, Arctic haze can linger for more than a month in the northern atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|The misconception, like most, {{has a small}} {{basis in}} truth. Research {{has been done in}} a few {{metropolitan}} areas suggesting that the urban heat island effect may discourage the formation of weak tornadoes in city centers, due to <b>turbulent</b> warm <b>air</b> disrupting their formation.

25|$|The {{variable}} {{temperature of}} the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as , the boiling point of water. The authors suggest that elements of {{the bottom of the}} flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient <b>turbulent</b> <b>air.</b> In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or <b>turbulent</b> <b>air</b> flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products.|$|E
500|$|In the 1940s, NACA was a {{research}} and development organization, devoted to cutting-edge aeronautical research. At the Langley Research Center, advanced wind tunnels were used to test new aircraft designs, and studies were taking place on new concepts such as the X-1 rocket plane. Kraft {{was assigned to the}} flight research division, where Gilruth was then head of research. His work with NACA included the development of an early example of gust alleviation system for an aircraft flying in <b>turbulent</b> <b>air.</b> [...] This involved correcting for variations in the atmosphere by automatically deflecting the control surfaces. He also discovered that wingtip vortices, and not prop-wash, are responsible for most of the turbulence in the air that trails flying aircraft. This finding was forgotten and later rediscovered independently.|$|E

Several test cases are considered and the results are compared with available experimental measurements...|$|R
500|$|Fire Management {{officials}} in Shoshone National Forest recognize that forest fires are {{a natural part}} of the ecosystem; however, this was not always the case. 20th century fire fighting efforts, especially {{in the first half of}} that century, emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, as fire was seen as completely detrimental to a forest. In 1935, fire management officials established the 10am rule for all fires on federal lands, which recommended aggressive attack on fires and to have them controlled by 10am, the day after they are first detected. This was intended to prevent fires from remaining active into the afternoon when the rising temperatures and more <b>turbulent</b> <b>air</b> caused fires to expand and become more erratic. However, this policy led to an increase in fuels because fires were often extinguished before they had a chance to burn out dead and dying old growth. It was in a stand of old growth fir trees in Shoshone National Forest that the Blackwater fire of 1937 killed 15 fighters during a firestorm [...] west of Cody, Wyoming. The fire was one of the deadliest in terms of forest firefighter deaths in U.S. history.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the ball}} is older {{and there is an}} {{asymmetry}} in roughness the seam no longer causes the pressure difference, and can actually reduce the swing of the ball. Air turbulence is no longer used to create separation point differences and therefore the lift and pressure differences. On the rough side of the ball there are scratches and pits in the ball's surface. [...] These irregularities act {{in the same manner as}} the dimples of a golf ball: they trap the air, creating a layer of trapped air next to the rough side of the ball, which moves with the surface of the ball. The smooth side does not trap a layer of air. The next layer of air outward from the ball will have a greater velocity over the rough side, due to its contact with a layer of trapped air, rather than solid ball. This lowers the static pressure relative to the shiny side, which swings the ball. If the scratches and tears completely cover the rough side of the ball, the separation point on the rough side will move to the back of the ball, further than that of the <b>turbulent</b> <b>air,</b> thereby creating more lift and faster air flow. [...] This is why a new ball will swing more than an old ball. If the seam is used to create the <b>turbulent</b> <b>air</b> on the rough side, the tears will not fill as quickly as they would with laminar flow, dampening the lift and pressure differences.|$|E

In the far field of the lobed jet, this geometrical asymmetry is accompanied by the reduction of the turbulence intensities and of the turbulent shear stress. It is also found that the mixing performance of the lobed jet remains superior to the one of the axisymmetric reference jet for the explored axial range...|$|R

2500|$|The A300-600 {{took off}} {{immediately}} after a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 {{on the same}} runway. It flew into the larger jet's wake, an area of <b>turbulent</b> <b>air.</b> The first officer attempted to stabilize the aircraft with alternating aggressive rudder inputs. The force of the air flowing against the moving rudder stressed the aircraft's vertical stabilizer, and eventually snapped it off entirely, causing the aircraft to lose control and crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the enormous stress on the rudder {{was due to the}} first officer's [...] "unnecessary and excessive" [...] rudder inputs, and not the wake turbulence caused by the 747. The NTSB further stated [...] "if the first officer had stopped making additional inputs, the aircraft would have stabilized". [...] Contributing to these rudder pedal inputs were characteristics of the Airbus A300-600 sensitive rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Training Program (AAMP).|$|E
