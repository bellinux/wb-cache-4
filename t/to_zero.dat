5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), any increase in the price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E
5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions. The {{reason for this is}} that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E

After SG-1 go missing on their off-world mission, a Goa'uld named Ba'al {{contacts}} Stargate Command and suggests an exchange of the captured SG-1 against Camulus, another Goa'uld who requested asylum on Earth several episodes before. With the help of Camulus, a potent power source is found and brought back to Stargate Command, only to find it tainted by Camulus (powering it up could result in the destruction of the Solar system). With the SGC suffering from a temporary electricity failure caused by the alien plants, Ba'al's renewed contacting only results in O'Neill's mocking. Exhausted by sleep deprivation two days <b>to</b> <b>Zero</b> Hour, O'Neill finishes his letter to General Hammond to inform him of his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Damage from {{enemies to}} the player's {{characters}} affect an endurance and health pool. While endurance regenerates after combat, health {{can only be}} restored by resting. The party can either set up camp, or rest in an inn. If a character in the party has their endurance drained, they are knocked out {{until the end of}} combat. If a companion has their health reduced <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> they die permanently.|$|E
5|$|Each worm {{begins the}} round with a {{specific}} amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options or by scripting in campaign levels. When hit with a weapon, the worm will lose health depending upon {{the power of the}} weapon and the directness of the hit. A worm can be killed either by exploding after having its health reduced <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> or by being knocked into the water around and below the level.|$|E

5|$|In applied mathematics, as we {{have done}} here, the delta {{function}} is often manipulated {{as a kind of}} limit (a weak limit) of a sequence of functions, each member of which has a tall spike at the origin: for example, a sequence of Gaussian distributions centered at the origin with variance tending <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to explain why zero is even without referring to formal definitions.
