5|$|After the South Carolina Supreme Court {{declined}} to rehear the case, the Capobiancos filed a petition with the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari. Seven entities filed amici curiae briefs with the Supreme Court {{in support of}} hearing the case. This included amici briefs by two former Solicitors General of the United States, Paul Clement {{on behalf of the}} guardian ad litem, and Greg Garre on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother,</b> suggesting that the Equal Protection Clause requires applying strict scrutiny to ICWA’s race-based placement preferences. The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, the National Council for Adoption, the California State Association of Counties and the Center for Adoption Policy were also among those that submitted briefs.|$|E
5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E
5|$|The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie {{breaks up}} with Ross {{to get back}} {{together}} with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together and decide {{it would be best}} to remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise of Monica and Chandler— a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother).</b> Monica and Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the changes in his life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by Chandler, making a joke for the last time. The camera's last view is of all of the character's keys to the apartment on the counter table, finishing with a shot of the apartment door.|$|E
50|$|In the 1988 article {{which was}} {{originally}} in The Progressive and reprinted in Pound Pup Legacy, a South Korean orphanage director said {{that according to}} his orphanage's questionnaire data 90% of Korean <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> indicated that wanted to keep their biological child and not give it up for adoption, but the South Korean orphanage director said that only maybe 10% of <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> eventually decided to keep their biological child after his orphanage suggested to <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> that unwed mothers and poor couples should give their child up for adoption. The 1988 news article said that <b>the</b> Korean <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> felt guilty after giving their child up for adoption, and it said that most of <b>the</b> Korean <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> who gave their child up for adoption were poor and worked at factory or clerical jobs in South Korea.|$|R

When she recovers her memories, she realizes that she was Mrs. B and <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> of Arell but was separated from him upon re-entry into the 20th century. She was surgically altered by Viel and it is implied that he is also responsible for maintaining her memory gaps.

Her [...] "Enemy Zero" [...] ability allows her to sense enemies no matter where they are in Fairy Tale's headquarters, but also allows her to {{duplicate}} and master those abilities. She captures Moka so she can use the rosario in a device she made to awaken and to control Alucard. She turns many of the Shuzen family members into grotesque ghouls by implanting pieces of Alucard into their bodies. When Tsukune defeats her, she fuses with Alucard, but she is unable to land a finishing blow on Moka because the rosario connects with Akasha and not Alucard. After Moka takes back her rosario, Gyokuro is quickly devoured by Alucard.|$|E
50|$|The {{historical}} legal assumption {{has been}} that <b>the</b> woman giving <b>birth</b> to a child is that child's legal mother, {{and the only way}} for another woman to be recognized as the mother is through adoption (usually requiring <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother's</b> formal abandonment of parental rights).|$|R

50|$|In all {{adoption}} searches, it is {{uncommon to}} find both <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> and {{father at the}} same time. A separate search, if desired, can be done afterwards for the father. Since males seldom change their surnames, and the mother might have additional information, it is usually easier than the initial search for <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother.</b> In many cases, adoptees {{are able to do}} this second search for their birth father by themselves (or they try before paying for assistance).|$|E
50|$|Many birth {{mothers do}} more than just meet the adoptive parents once before the birth. If they live close enough to each other it is not {{uncommon}} for <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> to invite the adoptive mother (or adoptive father too if <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> wishes) to come to her doctor appointments. This lets <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> see the adoptive parent's joy and anticipation of soon becoming a parent, and allows all parties to the adoption a chance to bond. The same is true at the hospital, where it is not unusual for the adoptive parents to be present for the delivery if that is the birth mother's wish. Many birth mothers ask the hospital staff to hand the baby to the adoptive parents first so they can be the first people to hold their child, before she has even done so.|$|E

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> has narrowed {{down her}} {{prospective}} adoptive parents {{to one or}} a few families, normally they arrange to meet in person. Good adoption agencies and attorneys do this in a pressure-free setting where no one is encouraged to make an immediate decision. If they are geographically distant from each other (as some adoptions are interstate, with <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> living in a different state from the adoptive parents), the first meeting will normally be by phone, then advance to a face-to-face meeting if the meeting by phone went as well as hoped.|$|E

The court declined {{to hear the case}} without comment on March 20, 2000 and continued a 21-day stay to give <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> a chance to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.

50|$|In 2003 the European Court of Human Rights {{ruled in}} a case {{involving}} anonymous birth in Odievre v. France. The applicant's mother had given birth anonymously and when the applicant later asked for more information she was only given non-identifying information. The applicant appealed to the Court citing article 8 of the ECHR stating {{that it was a}} violation to the right to a family life. The Court noted that the case could not simply be viewed as a conflict between the rights of <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> and the child, but also affected the rights of the adoptive parents and any family of <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother.</b> The Court ruled that, given that the recently created National Council on Access to Information about Personal Origins presented avenue to contact <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> in a controlled way, that the state had attempted to strike a sufficient balance between the competing right and the application was denied.|$|E

50|$|Although {{practices}} vary {{state by}} state, most adoptions start with <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> reviewing dozens of photo-resume letters or online profiles of prospective adoptive parents. Usually, these are adoptive {{families who have}} retained that agency or attorney {{to assist them in}} the adoption process. Most US states permit full openness not just regarding identities, but also personal information about each other. Just as the adoptive parents want to learn about the birth mother's life and health history, so does <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> want the same information about the people she is considering as the parents for her child.|$|E
