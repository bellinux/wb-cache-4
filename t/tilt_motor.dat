50|$|Mark 3 was radically different. A {{high quality}} colour camera became available, a Pulnix TMC-X not {{much bigger than}} a Mini-Maglite. It was also much more sensitive, so the light could be smaller and a remote tilt {{mechanism}} became practicable. A coded control signal was needed that would go down the video cable to save using extra wires, so a model radio control system was adapted, giving 2 proportional channels for tilt and eventual pan movements. The 27 MHz carrier was easily combined and split from the baseband video. The first <b>tilt</b> <b>motor</b> was a standard model control servo with 180 degree rotation. The camera head and light were mounted in an open-framework cage about 25 cm long, rotated on a horizontal axis by the servo. Despite taking care, motor gears were frequently stripped when the cage hit obstacles and the servo had to be replaced regularly! The light source needed to pan with the camera, so had to be small enough to fit in the cage. A 12 V 50 W quartz-halogen lamp with 5 cm diameter integral dichroic reflector was fitted, powered from a small switch-mode PSU. Although the lighting power had been reduced, it still required a high voltage supply down the cable to reduce voltage drop, so 240 V was still used.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDirectional room impulse {{responses}} (DRIRs) {{are typically}} measured with spherical micro- phone arrays (SMA). When being combined with spherical loudspeaker arrays (SLA), also the directivity {{of the sound}} source can be controlled. Such multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems allow for an in-depth analysis of the acoustics of a room. A prototype SMA/SLA system was used to capture 3 -D MIMO DRIRs for several measurement points and under different acoustic conditions at the opera hall of the Salzburg Festival. The SLA consists of 64 micro- phones on a rigid sound-hard sphere (25 cm diameter). It captures the 3 -D sound field up to the spherical harmonics expansion order N = 7. The SLA consists of 28 speakers (of three different sizes) on a rigid sound-hard sphere (40 cm diameter). It is equipped with an internal <b>tilt</b> <b>motor</b> and mounted on a remote-controlled turntable. The rotated loudspeaker positions chosen for this measurement approximate a Gaussian sampling of order N = 11.

40|$|The {{importance}} of viscosity in determining plasma flow structures {{has been widely}} recognized. In laboratory plasmas, however, viscosity measurements have been seldom performed so far. In this paper we present and discuss an estimation method of effective plasma kinematic viscosity utilizing flow velocity field measurements. Imposing steady and axisymmetric conditions, we derive the expression for radial flow velocity from the azimuthal component of the ion fluid equation. The expression contains kinematic viscosity, vorticity of azimuthal rotation and its derivative, collision frequency, azimuthal flow velocity and ion cyclotron frequency. Therefore all quantities except the viscosity are given provided that the flow field can be measured. We applied this method to a rotating magnetized argon plasma produced by the Hyper-I device. The flow velocity field measurements were carried out using a directional Langmuir probe installed in a <b>tilting</b> <b>motor</b> drive unit. The inward ion flow in radial direction, which is not driven in collisionless inviscid plasmas, was clearly observed.

40|$|Human {{perception}} {{is an active}} process. By altering its viewpoint rather than passively observing surroundings and by operating on sequences of images rather than on a single frame, the human visual system {{has the ability to}} explore the most relevant information based on knowledge, therefore when growing up a human is able to develop cognitive perception. Comparably, for humanoid robots to develop cognitive perception, active vision is indispensable. Humanoid robot research has already nearly half a century history. There are approximately 2000 research papers on active vision published during 1986 ? 2010 that covered a large range of research fields in robotics. Nowadays, the new trend is to use a stereo setup or a Kinect with neck movements to realize active vision. However, human {{perception is}} a combination of eyes and neck movement. In order to design such an advanced humanoid active vision system, eye movements with biological inspiration similar to human eyes should be taken into consideration. Depth perception based on pure image information can then be obtained without utilizing any advanced sensors. This thesis presents a complete active vision system with 4 degrees of freedom that works in a similar way as human vision. It is composed of the following parts: 1. The mechanical design has 4 motors with independent vergence angle control, one <b>tilt</b> <b>motor</b> for both eyes and one pan motor for the neck. 2. The controllers simulate the eye movements as humans: saccade eye movements, pursuit eye movements, vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) eye movements and vergence eye movements, where motor positions and velocities are controlled with input from an Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU). 3. An optimal feature selection mechanism which is based on various properties of objects is applied before tracking. 4. In order to smoothly pursue and learn an object from different perspectives, three different trackers are used: a color based tracker, an AR marker based tracker for testing, and a robust online tracker. 5. A saliency detector segments the most dominant objects from the scenes and a robust online tracker provides refined segmentations. As a result, the robots have a self-explorative ability for unknown environments. 6. Owing to vergent eyes moving at different angles, intrinsic calibration as well as extrinsic calibration is required to ensure the accuracy of 3 D perception. Here the motor positions are utilized together with a robust M-Estimator to recover the geometry between two eyes. 7. Humans utilize multiple cues for depth perception. Depth perception is strongly related to eye movements. Multi-mode depth perception is applied to perceive environment and objects in 3 D for further vision tasks such as object recognition, and object grasping. The realized system works within real-time constraints and with low cost cameras and motors. Therefore it provides an affordable solution for industrial applications. In conclusion, active vision can be applied to various applications and it is a rapid-growing research domain. This thesis and its proposed vision system provides an insight into the research field of active humanoid robot vision. BioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Camera {{positioning}} {{units are}} widely used in surveillance and they are sometimes mounted on floating supports, e. g. on patrolling ships or buoys. The support motion, in turn, induces an apparent motion in the image plane, which can create troubles to the image processing, especially when a specific feature must be tracked (e. g. a distant ship, getting close to a forbidden area). Low cost devices are often characterized by low frame rate and low image resolution, for which traditional image stabilization techniques usually results to be rather ineffective. Additionally, low-end camera units are usually driven by hybrid stepper motors and, being conceived {{to work in an}} harsh environment, they do not mount any optical image stabilization (OIS) system, either in the camera lenses or in the image sensor. In this paper, the image acquired by a pan–tilt camera positing unit mounted on a moving support is stabilized by exploiting the camera attitude information provided by a MEMS-based IMU with an embedded magnetometer. In particular, two independent integral control loops are designed for the pan and <b>tilt</b> <b>motors</b> in order to compensate for the yaw and pitch motions of the support. As for the roll motion, since it relates to an unavailable degree of freedom in the positioning unit, it can be compensated only on the captured image. The proposed solution is experimentally tested on a real device mounted on a moving table actuated by a 6 degrees–of–freedom pneumatic hexapod. Realistic motions are recreated by using the data recordings taken aboard of a patrolling ship and a costal buoy. Experimental results show that the proposed solution is capable of keeping the camera pointing at a fixed target with a good accuracy, thus making higher-level image processing easier and more effective...|$|R
