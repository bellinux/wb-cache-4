This study used The Varian Statistical Analysis (ANOVA) and the Post-Hoc testing with Scheffe technique of 0. 05 significance level by using a test for normality and homogeneity test firstly.

There are the differences between the influence of “high nutrient status” and “low nutrient status” to <b>the</b> result <b>running</b> <b>of</b> 100 -meter (Fh 8. 381 > Ft 3. 94). (4). There are the interactions between the “sprint training method” and the “achievement motivation” to <b>the</b> result <b>running</b> <b>of</b> 100 -meter (Fh 4. 885 > Ft 3. 94). (5). There are the interactions between the “sprint training method” and “nutritional status” to <b>the</b> result <b>running</b> <b>of</b> 100 -meter (Fh 4. 302 > Ft 3. 94).

Conclusion, that the use of proper exercise, good motivation and good nutritional condition will give a positive effect to the ability of the results of one's 100 -meter dash.
