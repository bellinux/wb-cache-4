2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1858, Li was reassigned to serve in Zeng Guofan's office, where {{he was in charge}} of {{drafting}} documents. Li led a carefree life, flouted rules and regulations, and often woke up late. Zeng Guofan once chided him, [...] "Shaoquan, now that you're working in my office, I only have this piece of advice for you: 'Commitment' is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> to us here." [...] Li was shocked and he improved his behaviour after that. In the same year, Weng Tongshu (翁同書), the xunfu of Anhui, abandoned his post when he came under attack by the Taiping rebels. Zeng Guofan drew from Li's draft when he wrote a memorial to the imperial court to accuse Weng Tongshu of failing in his duty. The lines from Li's draft that were included in Zeng Guofan's actual memorial included: [...] "It is my duty, as Your Majesty's subject, [...] I do not dare to let this pass just because of Weng Tonghe's fame and prestige." [...] Although Li earned Zeng Guofan's praise for drafting the memorial, he also caused Weng Tonghe (Weng Tongshu's brother) to bear a grudge against him for what he wrote. While serving under Zeng Guofan, he was put in charge of Yanjianshao Circuit (延建邵道) in Fujian Province but did not take up his appointment and remained with Zeng.|$|E
