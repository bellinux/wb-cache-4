40|$|This {{paper the}} author {{looks at the}} effect of {{education}} and training on productivity, as indicated by performance on government <b>trade</b> <b>tests</b> of craft skills in engineering, building, woodwork, electrical and tailoring trades. In January and February 1973, 446 candidates for government <b>trade</b> <b>tests</b> in Nairobi and Kisumu were interviewed, 70 per cent of the candidates during this period, and full job histories were obtained for 185. Although the sample was small and perhaps not strictly representative, a number of interesting results were obtained. It was {{found that those who}} had undergone full-time training courses did worse at all grades of test than those who had not. Similarly, the small significance of schooling in explaining test performance calls into question the tendency to upgrade academic qualifications required for entry into employment or training courses. It was also found that employers tend to reward higher productivity at least in the sense that, especially at grade I level, they anticipate the test results, paying more to those who are going to pass than to those who are going to fail. Further, there {{does not seem to be}} an excess supply of skilled and semi-skilled workers: on the contrary, the high returns to movement between jobs suggest that this is still very much a seller's market. Finally, a firm conclusion can be drawn from this survey that this is a relatively inexpensive way of collecting useful information which would be worthwhile repeating on a regular basis with a large coverage...|$|R

40|$|The study {{analyzes}} {{the relation between}} a trading imbalance metric that captures data observable by investors, and future momentum and reversals in Taiwan index futures returns. Standard regression analyses do not show any significant dynamic relations between daily index futures returns and the trading imbalance, {{regardless of whether the}} trading imbalance metric is lagged, contemporaneous, or leads the index futures return. However, when the analyses are focused on periods with extreme trading imbalances I find that the daily index futures returns exhibit significant reversals following periods of extreme (low) trading imbalances and low returns. I also find some evidence of residual momentum in consecutive daily index futures returns following periods of extreme (high) trading imbalances and high returns. Trading simulation, directional accuracy, and market timing tests show these effects to be economically significant, even after accounting for transaction costs.
