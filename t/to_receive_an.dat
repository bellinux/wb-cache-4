40|$|SummaryPurposeThis study {{aimed to}} explore the factors {{associated}} with the intention <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>a</b> Pap test among married immigrant women of Vietnamese origin living in Taiwan. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional community-based study. We enrolled 281 women aged 30 years and over in the study, from July 2013 to January 2014. The participants' characteristics, cervical cancer knowledge, Pap test knowledge, attitudes toward cervical cancer, barriers <b>to</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>a</b> Pap test, fatalism, and intention <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>a</b> Pap test, were measured using self-report questionnaires. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the variables associated with participants' intentions <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>a</b> Pap test. ResultsVietnamese women with low scores on the measures of cervical cancer knowledge and perceived barriers <b>to</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>a</b> Pap test were more willing <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> the test, as were those with high scores on the measures of Pap test knowledge and fatalism. Women who <b>received</b> <b>a</b> Pap test {{in the previous year}} were more willing <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>a</b> Pap test within the next 3 years. ConclusionsPreventive healthcare for immigrant women should be a focus of nurses. The development of culturally appropriate health education and strategies should enhance their knowledge of Pap tests and reduce perceived barriers to Pap test participation. This study's results can be a reference for nurses who work with immigrant women...|$|R
