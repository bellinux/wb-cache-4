40|$|Acoustic {{scattering}} {{cross sections}} of smart furtive obstacles are studied and discussed. A smart furtive obstacle is an obstacle that, when hit by an incoming field, avoids detection {{through the use}} of a pressure current acting on its boundary. A highly parallelizable algorithm for computing the acoustic scattering cross section of smart obstacles is developed. As a case study, this algorithm is applied to the (acoustic) scattering cross section of a "smart" (furtive) simplified version of the NASA space shuttle when hit by incoming time-harmonic plane waves, the wavelengths of which are small compared to the characteristic dimensions of the shuttle. The solution to this numerically challenging scattering problem requires the solution of systems of linear equations with many unknowns and equations. Due to the sparsity of these systems of equations, they can be stored and solved using affordable computing resources. A cross section analysis of the simplified NASA space shuttle highlights three findings: i) the smart furtive obstacle reduces the magnitude of its cross section compared to the cross section of a corresponding "passive" obstacle; ii) several wave propagation directions fail <b>to</b> <b>satisfactorily</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the smart strategy of the obstacle; satisfactory furtive effects along all directions may only be obtained by using a pressure current of considerable magnitude.

A total of 444 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to OFC (N 221) or fluoxetine (N 223). Time-to-relapse was significantly longer in OFC-treated patients compared with fluoxetine-treated patients (po 0. 001).

40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome is {{a constellation of}} clinical risk factors comprising atherogenic dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein and high triglycerides levels), elevated blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose, a prothrombotic state, and a proinflammatory state accompanied by an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The adipose tissue of obese humans contains increased numbers of macrophages, and once activated, these macrophages {{are responsible for the}} expression of most of the tissue's tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and interleukin (IL) - 6. Chronic inflammation associated with visceral obesity induces altered lipoprotein metabolism and insulin resistance in the liver. Adipocytes secrete a variety of hormones, cytokines, growth factors, and other bioactive substances, conceptualized as adipocytokines, including plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1), TNF-α, leptin, and adiponectin. The dysregulation of these adipokines contributes to the pathogenesis of obesity. Adipose tissue-resident macrophages and adipocytes in the adipose tissue combined with the consequences of hyperglycemia, altered lipoproteins, and hyperinsulinemia in the vasculature and within organ microcirculation lead to dysfunctional endothelia and a proinflammatory state. Metabolic syndrome thus represents a combination of synergistic vascular pathologies that lead to an accelerated atherogenic state that compromises the ability of the patient <b>to</b> <b>satisfactorily</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> humoral, cellular, and mechanical stresses. Clinical RelevanceThe incidence of {{metabolic syndrome}} is rapidly approaching epidemic levels. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality increases 1. 5 -fold to 3 -fold {{in the presence of the}} metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors of metabolic origin characterized by hyperinsulinemia, low glucose tolerance, and truncal obesity. The syndrome is associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein and high triglycerides levels), elevated blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose, and a prothrombotic and a proinflammatory state that act synergistically to produce a proinflammatory prothrombotic state in the vascular patient.

A rare blood group is usually {{defined as the}} absence of a high {{prevalence}} antigen or the absence of several antigens within a single blood group system. These individuals may develop clinically significant red cell antibodies to the high incidence red cell antigens they lack. A 33 -year-old alloimmunized woman was referred to our center at the 12 th week of her third pregnancy for evaluation and follow up. The laboratory work-up grouped her as belonging to "p" phenotype, associated with difficulties to find compatible blood for transfusion and a high incidence of recurrent miscarriage. At 36 weeks, a baby girl was born by induced labor due to fetal suffering. With a negative direct antiglobulin test but a positive elution test, she was in the neonatology ward for one week receiving luminotherapy. Homozygosity for a missense mutation at position 752 (c. 752 C > T) in the A 4 GALT gene was found to be responsible for the p phenotype. This mutation changes a proline to a leucine at codon 251 of the 4 -alpha-galactosyltransferase.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Significant {{morbidity}} and mortality result from the ineffective evacuation of empyema. Failure of conventional first line treatment with closed intercostal tube drainage and antibiotic therapy may result in fibrin deposition and loculated empyema. Enzymatic debridement using intrapleural instillation of streptokinase is a non-invasive therapeutic option which may obviate the need for surgical intervention. METHODS [...] Eleven adults with multiloculated post-pneumonic empyemas who had failed <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>satisfactorily</b> <b>to</b> intercostal tube drainage and antibiotic therapy were treated with intrapleural streptokinase between November 1992 and January 1994. A small catheter was inserted under ultrasound guidance into a loculation within the pleural space. Aliquots of 250, 000 units of streptokinase in 100 ml normal saline were instilled into the pleural cavity and the tube clamped for four hours. Response was assessed by clinical outcome, measurement of drain output after unclamping, and subsequent pleural ultrasound, chest radiography, or both. RESULTS [...] Streptokinase enhanced drainage in all patients. Complete resolution of the empyema with re-expansion of the underlying lung was effected in eight patients, all of whom remain well. Further resolution of minimal pleural thickening was shown on subsequent chest radiographs. Two patients with considerably thickened visceral pleura following empyema drainage underwent successful decortication. The other, with myocarditis and a pyopneumothorax, underwent surgery for non-resolution of the pneumothorax but died perioperatively from cardiac failure. The number of streptokinase instillations per patient ranged from two to six (median three), and the volume of empyema fluid drained per patient ranged from 100 ml to 4870 ml (median 900 ml). Streptokinase was well tolerated in all patients. CONCLUSIONS [...] Intrapleural streptokinase is an effective adjunct {{in the management of}} complicated empyema and may reduce the need for surgery...|$|E

Here, we investigated {{the efficacy of}} aripiprazole augmentation for TRD including both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder and the clinical predictors of treatment efficacy in a Japanese population.   Methods: Eighty-five depressed Japanese patients who underwent aripiprazole augmentation therapy after failing <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>satisfactorily</b> <b>to</b> antidepressant monotherapy {{were included in the}} study. Treatment responses were evaluated based on Clinical Global Impression Improvement scores assessed 8 weeks after initiation of aripiprazole administration. We compared demographic and diagnostic variables, psychiatric medication variables, and clinical variables between remission and nonremission groups.   Results: The aripiprazole augmentation remission rate was 36. 5 %. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that aripiprazole augmentation was significantly more effective for bipolar depression than for major depressive disorder, and both absence of comorbid anxiety disorders and current episode duration > 3 months were significantly associated with the efficacy of aripiprazole augmentation.   Conclusion: Polarity of depression, comorbidity of anxiety disorders, and current episode duration may predict the efficacy of aripiprazole augmentation for TRD including both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Among them, comorbidity of anxiety disorders was significantly related to the efficacy for TRD including only major depressive disorder. Additional studies are needed to examine the association between the efficacy of aripiprazole augmentation and bipolarity, and these findings should be validated further in a prospective study.

40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article by Weijenborg et al. showing that PPI therapy is equally effective in relieving heartburn in patients with both erosive esophagitis (ERD) and well-defined non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). These results are {{in contrast with the}} common belief, mainly sustained by a previous metaanalysis, that the response to PPIs is much lower in NERD than in ERD patients and confirm that the pathophysiological characterization of the various subgroups generally comprised under the umbrella term of NERD is fundamental to identify patients with true NERD, who can be expected <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>satisfactorily</b> <b>to</b> powerful antisecretory therapy. At present, functional testing is the only method allowing us to differentiate well-defined NERD from functional heartburn, which does not pertain anymore to the realm of GERD. These patients complaining of heartburn do not present any esophageal mucosal lesion at endoscopy and do not have any acid reflux underlying their symptoms. Therefore, the lack of any pathogenetic role of acid makes it difficult that they can benefit from PPIs. However, there is an additional subgroup of NERD patients who are characterized by an esophagus hypersensitive to weakly acidic reflux which has been shown to induce the same typical symptoms of the acidic one. The identification of these patients has permitted to narrow down further the subgroup with functional heartburn, because their heartburn is strictly correlated with weakly acidic reflux. As the role of acid is greatly reduced also in them, the response to PPI therapy can be predicted to be unsatisfactory. The meta-analysis by Weijnborg et al. is welcome because the extraction from the medical literature of the two studies in which acid reflux was correctly documented by esophageal pH-metry allowed to avoid the usual contamination of true NERD population with the patients with functional heartburn who cannot respond to PPIs and eventually to understand that well-defined NERD patients are equally responsive to PPIs as ERD ones. It is time to plan clinical trials on NERD patients who are no more enrolled simply on the basis of negative endoscopy, but it is necessary to characterize this complex population from a pathophysiological point of view to assess the efficacy of PPI therapy only in patients whose symptoms are really sustained from acid reflux and to exclude the two subgroups of NERD with weakly acidic reflux generally unresponsive to PPIs and functional heartburn, who do not have reflux disease...|$|E
