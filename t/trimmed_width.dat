40|$|Industrial {{compressor}} manufacturers {{often have}} to respond instantly to new impeller designs or in an aftermarket situation to modification of an existing impeller. To deal with this, design from scratch {{is out of the}} question and de-signers often rely on their experience to design by scaling or modification. A compressor designer’s wish is to have one single stage unit design with good performance that can cover a wide rang of applications and a wide range of mass flow rates. This means a stage whose impeller and diffuser chocking areas can be varied, which is not impossible but difficult. Currently there are five main ways of dealing with this: 1. Varying the angle of the inlet guides (if guide vanes are there) 2. Narrowing the impeller flow passage depth (impeller exit <b>width</b> <b>trimming)</b> 3. Varying the inlet angle of the diffuser vanes 4. Radial cropping of the impeller vanes 5. Radial cropping of the diffuser vanes This paper discusses item No. 2, impeller exit <b>width</b> <b>trimming.</b> On the basis of experimental data for two impellers, one with a low flow coefficient and the other with a high flow coefficient, the effect of impeller exit <b>width</b> <b>trimming</b> is studied and discussed.

Robustness {{and stability in}} cluster analysis are not only data dependent, but even cluster dependent. Robustness is in the present paper defined as a property of not only the clustering method, but also of every individual cluster in a data set.

5000|$|Nag Hammadi {{bindings}} {{were constructed}} with a textblock of papyrus sheets, assembled {{into a single}} section and trimmed along the fore edge after folding to prevent the inner sheets from extending outward beyond the outer sheets. Because the inner sheets were narrower than the outer sheets after <b>trimming,</b> the <b>width</b> of text varied through the textblock, {{and it is likely}} that the papyrus was not written on until after it was bound; this, in turn, would have made it a necessity to calculate the number of sheets needed for a manuscript before it was written and bound. [...] Covers of Nag Hammadi bindings were limp leather, stiffened with waste sheets of papyrus. The textblocks were sewn with tackets, with leather stays along the inside fold as reinforcement. These tackets also secured the textblock to the covers; on some of the Nag Hammadi bindings, the tackets extended to the outside of the covering leather, while on others the tackets were attached to a strip of leather which served as a spine liner, and which was in turn pasted to the covers. [...] A flap, either triangular or rectangular, extended from the front cover of the book, and was wrapped around the fore edge of the book when closed. Attached to the flap was a long leather thong which was wrapped around the book two or three times, and which served as a clasp to keep the book securely shut.|$|R

2500|$|The CR.100 is a {{conventional}} single engine, low-wing monoplane, {{with the large}} control surface areas and absence of dihedral expected in an aerobatic aircraft. [...] The structure is mostly wood and fabric, though the main wing spar is a plywood and carbon laminate composite and carbon covered ply is an option for the wing surfaces. All the flying surfaces are straight edged and tapered. [...] The ailerons take up about 60% of the wing's trailing edge. The ailerons have spades to reduce control loads. The remainder of the wing trailing edge is three-position flaps. The rudder and elevators are horn balanced {{and there is a}} fixed rudder <b>trim</b> tab. The <b>width</b> of the flat sided fuselage is determined by the side by side seating arrangement. Full dual controls, including a pair of left hand throttles, are fitted. [...] A sliding bubble canopy covers the cockpit and is faired behind into a raised and rounded fuselage top decking. [...] The wide track main conventional undercarriage has cantilever legs in fairings, with wheels usually in spats. The tailwheel is freely castoring. The CR.100T variant offers the alternative of a tricycle undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|Spacer {{patterning}} is {{a technique}} employed for patterning features with linewidths smaller than {{can be achieved by}} conventional lithography. In the most general sense, the spacer is a layer that is deposited over a pre-patterned feature, often called the mandrel. The spacer is subsequently etched back so that the spacer portion covering the mandrel is etched away while the spacer portion on the sidewall remains. The mandrel may then be removed, leaving two spacers (one for each edge) for each mandrel. The spacers may be further <b>trimmed</b> to narrower <b>widths,</b> especially to act as mandrels for a subsequent 2nd spacer formation. Hence this is a readily practiced form of multiple patterning. Alternatively, one of the two spacers may be removed and the remaining one trimmed to a much smaller final linewidth. Whereas immersion lithography has a resolution of ~40 nm lines and spaces, spacer patterning may be applied to attain 20 nm. This resolution improvement technique is also known as Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP). SADP may be re-applied for even higher resolution, and has already been demonstrated for 15 nm NAND flash memory. Spacer patterning has also been adopted for sub-20 nm logic nodes, e.g., 14 nm and 10 nm.|$|R
40|$|From {{the general}} {{dimensional}} and mechanical similarity theory {{it follows that}} a condition of steady motion of a given shape with constant speed {{on the surface of}} water is determined by four nondimensional parameters. By considering the various systems of independent parameters which are applied in theory and practice and special tests, there is determined their mutual relations and their suitability as planning characteristics. In studying the scale effect {{on the basis of the}} Prnndtl formula for the friction coefficient for a turbulent condition the order of magnitude is given of the error in applying the model data to full scale in the case of a single-step bottom For a bottom of complicated shape it is shown how from the test data of the hydrodynamic characteristics for one speed with various loads, or one load with various speeds, there may be obtained by simple computation with good approximation the hydrodynamic characteristics for a different speed or for a different load. (These considerations may be of use in solving certain problems on the stability of planning.) This permits extrapolating the curve of resistance against speed for large speeds inaccessible in the tank tests or for other loads which were not tested. The data obtained by computation are in good agreement with the test results. Problems regarding the optimum trim angle or the optimum width in the case of planning of a flat plate are considered from the point of view of the minimum resistance for a given load on the water and planning speeds. Formulas and graphs are given for the optimum value of the planning coefficient and the corresponding values of the <b>trim</b> angle and <b>width</b> of the flat plate...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} (CFRP) {{have seen}} {{a significant increase in}} use over the years thanks to their specific properties. Despite continuous improvements in the production methods of laminated parts, a trimming operation is still necessary to achieve the functional dimensions required by engineering specifications. Laminates made of carbon fibers are very abrasive and cause rapid tool wear, and require high cutting temperatures. This creates damage to the epoxy matrix, whose glass-transition temperature is often recognized to be about 180 °C. This study aims to highlight the influence of the cutting temperature generated by tool wear on the surface finish and mechanical properties obtained from tensile tests. Trimming operations were performed on a quasi-isotropic 24 -ply carbon/epoxy laminate, of 3. 6 mm thickness, with a 6 flutes diamond-coated (CVD) cutter. The test specimens of 6 mm and 12 mm wide were obtained by <b>trimming.</b> The reduced <b>width</b> of the coupons allowed amplification of the effect of defects on the measured properties by increasing the proportion of coupon cross-section occupied by the defects. A new tool and a tool in an advanced state of wear were used to generate different cutting temperatures. Results showed a cutting temperature of 300 °C for the new tool and 475 °C for the worn tool. The analysis revealed that the specimens machined with the new tool have no thermal damage and the cut is clean. The plies oriented at − 45 ° presented the worst surface finish according to the failure mode of the fiber. For the worn tool, the surface was degraded and the matrix was carbonized. After cutting, observations showed a degraded resin spread on the machined surface, which reduced the surface roughness and hid the cutting defects. In support of these observations, the tensile tests showed no variation of the mechanical properties for the 12 mm-wide specimens, but did show a 10 % loss in mechanical properties for the 6 mm-wide specimens. These results suggest that the thermal defects caused by tool wear affect tensile properties, but only from a certain coupon width below which the machining defects increase their influence on the properties...|$|R
40|$|Carotid endarterectomy {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to reduce future stroke risk; however, stroke is a procedural risk. Therefore, to achieve the maximum benefit for patients, complications must be minimised. There are variations {{in the way that}} the operation is performed which may influence this peri-operative stroke risk. In particular, patch closure of the artery is a possible way of improving outcomes and the evidence is considered. Flow haemodynamics are considered to be a major aspect of the potential benefit with patch closure. The related evidence is presented, though the evidence to date is inadequate to prove that patching improves the haemodynamic profile sufficiently to improve outcomes. The hypothesis of a study is presented to try to answer this key question in carotid disease. Around one third of surgeons use primary closure with patching indicated with a median ICA diameter under 5 mm. Of those surgeons who always use patch angioplasty around half use a full size patch of median 8 mm diameter and the other half <b>trim</b> the patch <b>width</b> to a median of 6 mm. Carotid geometry is complex but can be defined by using an index which uses the long and short axes or the cross-sectional area divided by the dimensions in the CCA proximal to endarterectomy; this index has been validated. Primary closure reduces the diameter and cross-sectional area in contrast to patch angioplasty which increases these dimensions in proportion to the width of the patch. Primary closure, in some cases, causes stenoses in the distal CCA which produces detrimental haemodynamics, whereas in those cases without a stenosis, physiological haemodynamics are produced. Patch closure produces less advantageous haemodynamics, however the larger 8 mm patch is considerably worse than the trimmed 5 mm patch. There is a direct link between geometry and haemodynamics. Increasing geometry index produces worse haemodynamics, the exception being a CCA stenosis in a primary closure. Increasing model size has only a limited effect on haemodynamics. This study affirms the practice of those surgeons who trim their patches. Very large bifurcations (an internal carotid diameter of around 8 mm) are prone to low wall shear stresses and may be best repaired by primary closure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVigour is an {{essential}} parameter in vineyard management. Highest grape quality potential is obtained when vine vigour is moderate. Excessive vigour induces high yield and shaded canopy, resulting in quality losses. Excessively low vigour reduces crop yield. Vine vigour is highly variable among vineyard blocks as well as inside vineyard blocks. The reasons for this variability are mainly soil type, soil depth and topography. Spatial representation of vine vigour (vigour maps) can provide {{a useful tool for}} vineyard management. Traditionally, vine vigour is estimated either by the measurement of pruning weight or by the measurement of leaf area, and particularly of secondary leaf area. These techniques are labour intensive and they cannot be implemented to map vine vigour at a reasonable cost. Vine vigour can be mapped by remote sensing, using vegetation indexes like NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index). In low density vineyards, row width varies with vine vigour. In these conditions vine vigour can be mapped by means of remote sensing without differentiating pixels from the canopy and the soil, given that no vegetation is present on the soil. In high density vineyards, vine canopy is severely <b>trimmed</b> and row <b>width</b> does not vary with vine vigour, making vigour mapping by remote sensing much more complex. It is only possible, when very high resolution images contain pixels largely inferior in size to the row with, i. e. inferior to 10 cm, in order to separate pixels from canopy and pixel from soil. We developed a semi-automatic method to transform high resolution images in vine vigour maps, by using only pixels from the canopy. Images are spatially referenced. Red and Near Infra Red images are combined to construct a NDVI image. An algorithm based on deformable templates was developed to find automatically the centres of the rows. NDVI is calculated on the pixels of the centres of the rows and on the two adjacent pixels on each side. All other pixels (soil pixels, mixed soil-vegetation pixels) are excluded. Anisotropic NDVI data is transformed in a NDVI map by means of a Geographic Information System (G. I. S.). The NDVI vigour maps {{can be used in a}} precision viticulture approach, to implement an intra-block modulation of the use of fertilizers or pesticide sprayings depending on the density of vine vegetation...|$|R
40|$|We are {{developing}} a fiber laser front end suitable for high energy petawatt laser systems on large glass lasers such as NIF. The front end includes generation of the pulses in a fiber mode-locked oscillator, amplification and pulse cleaning, stretching of the pulses to > 3 ns, dispersion trimming, timing, fiber transport of the pulses to the main laser bay and amplification of the pulses to an injection energy of 150 {micro}J. We will discuss current status of our work including data from packaged components. Design detail such as how the system addresses pulse contrast, dispersion <b>trimming</b> and pulse <b>width</b> adjustment and impact of B-integral on the pulse amplification will be discussed. A schematic of the fiber laser system we are constructing {{is shown in figure}} 1 below. A 40 MHz packaged mode-locked fiber oscillator produces {approx} 1 nJ pulses which are phase locked to a 10 MHz reference clock. These pulses are down selected to 100 kHz and then amplified while still compressed. The amplified compressed pulses are sent through a non-linear polarization rotation based pulse cleaner to remove background amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The pulses are then stretched by a chirped fiber Bragg grating (CFBG) and then sent through a splitter. The splitter splits the signal into two beams. (From this point we follow only one beam as the other follows an identical path.) The pulses are sent through a pulse tweaker that trims dispersion imbalances between the final large optics compressor and the CFBG. The pulse tweaker also permits the dispersion of the system to be adjusted for the purpose of controlling the final pulse width. Fine scale timing between the two beam lines can also be adjusted in the tweaker. A large mode area photonic crystal single polarization fiber is used to transport the pulses from the master oscillator room to the main laser bay. The pulses are then amplified a two stage fiber amplifier to 150 mJ. These pulses are then launched into the main amplifier chain. We are currently constructing a packaged prototype of this system, which will ultimately be deployed on the National Ignition Facility (NIF). In our talk we will discuss the packaged components as well as the numerous technical challenges that needed to be overcome in order to make this system possible. Of particular interest was the quality of recompressed pulses that could be achieved with a CFBG. We will show background free auto-correlation data from pulses with a dynamic range noise limited to six orders of magnitude that were stretched with a CFBG and then recompressed in a standard compressor (figure 2). We will also discuss in detail the impact of B-integral accumulation on the recompressed pulses. Our current system is projected to run at an accumulated B-integral of 7. However, because our injected system bandwidth is much wider than the NIF system bandwidth our system can tolerate this high B-integral...|$|R
