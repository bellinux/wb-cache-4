40|$|This paper investigates how the tying of {{complementary}} {{products can}} be used to both preserve and create monopoly positions, where our focus is on the use of tying to deter the entry of efficient producers. We first show how a firm that is a monopolist of a product in the current period can use tying to preserve its monopoly position in the future. We then show using related arguments how a monopolist in one market can employ tying to extend its monopoly position into a newly emerging market. The analysis focuses on the importance of entry costs and network externalities. The paper includes a Tying is a common practice in many markets, i. e., the seller of product A refuses to sell A to a consumer unless the consumer also purchases B (in this scenario product A {{is referred to as the}} tying product and B as the tied product).

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the fin configuration and booster body configuration effects on a composite booster/ 040 A orbiter launch configuration. Aerodynamic performance and stability characteristics in pitch and yaw were obtained. Configurations tested included two stepped cylindrical bodies of different lengths with a conical nose, four fin shapes of various sizes and aspect ratios mounted in different positions {{around the base of the}} bodies, two base flare angles and three 040 A orbiter configurations. The orbiter variations included a tailless configuration and two tail sizes. A tailless booster launch configuration with deflected petals (expanded flare sectors) was also tested. The model scale was 0. 003366. Data were converted to coefficient form in near real time, punched on <b>cards,</b> and <b>tabulated.</b> The <b>cards</b> used in conjunction with a Benson-Lehner plotter were used to provide plotted data.

2500|$|Herman Hollerith (February 29, 1860 – November 17, 1929) was an American {{inventor}} {{who developed}} an electromechanical punched card tabulator {{to assist in}} summarizing information and, later, accounting. He was {{the founder of the}} Tabulating Machine Company that was [...] amalgamated (via stock acquisition) in 1911 with three other companies to form a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company later renamed IBM. Hollerith is {{regarded as one of the}} seminal figures in the development of data processing. His invention of the punched <b>card</b> <b>tabulating</b> machine marks the beginning of the era of semiautomatic data processing systems, and his concept dominated that landscape for nearly a century.|$|R
5000|$|The American {{effort was}} {{directed}} from Washington, D.C. by the U.S. Navy's signals intelligence command, OP-20-G; at Pearl Harbor it was centered at the Navy's Combat Intelligence Unit (Station HYPO, {{also known as}} COM 14), led by Commander Joseph Rochefort. With the assistance of Station CAST (also known as COM 16, jointly commanded by Lts Rudolph Fabian and John Lietwiler) in the Philippines, and the British Far East Combined Bureau in Singapore, and using a punched <b>card</b> <b>tabulating</b> machine manufactured by International Business Machines, a successful attack was mounted against the December 1941 code edition. Together they made considerable progress by early 1942.

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the [...] "Remington" [...] name {{date back to the}} {{formation}} of E. Remington and Sons, a firearms maker founded in 1816. E. Remington & Sons made occasional forays into products other than firearms, such as sewing machines and farm implements — but its most significant side venture was when inventor Christopher Sholes persuaded the firearms company to help him develop the typewriter with the QWERTY keyboard, which is still the standard today. In 1886, E. Remington & Sons sold the typewriter company, which became Remington Typewriter Company. This in turn merged with the Rand Kardex Corporation in 1927 to become Remington Rand. Remington Rand branched out into making adding machines, filing cabinets, punched <b>card</b> <b>tabulating</b> machines, and other office equipment to become a leading office equipment company.|$|R
5000|$|Ballot cards punched on a Votomatic {{could be}} {{tabulated}} by standard punched <b>card</b> <b>tabulating</b> machines or sorted on card sorters. The machines cost only $185 each in 1965 dollars, and weighed only 6 pounds. This {{was one of}} the first machines to attract serious thinking about accessibility; John Ahmann filed for a patent on a punching stylus for the Votomatic adapted for use by voters with motor disabilities in 1986. [...] IBM marketed the Votomatic until 1968, when it spun off Computer Election Systems Inc. to produce and market the system. By 1980, the Votomatic system was used by over 29% of U.S. voters. By 1992, the Votomatic had replaced mechanical voting machines as the dominant voting system used in the United States. The dominance of the Votomatic ended abruptly following the Florida election recount of 2000.|$|R
50|$|Around 1933 Eckert {{proposed}} interconnecting punched <b>card</b> <b>tabulating</b> machines from IBM {{located in}} Columbia's Rutherford Laboratory to perform more than simple statistical calculations. Eckert arranged with IBM president Thomas J. Watson for a donation of newly developed IBM 601 calculating punch, which could multiply {{instead of just}} adding and subtracting.In 1937 the facility was named the Thomas J. Watson Astronomical Computing Bureau. IBM support included customer service and hardware circuit modifications needed to tabulate numbers, create mathematical tables, add, subtract, multiply, reproduce, verify, create tables of differences, create tables of logarithms and perform Lagrangian interpolation, all to solve differential equations for astronomical applications. In January 1940, Eckert published Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation, which solved the problem of predicting the orbits of the planets, using the IBM electric tabulating machines, based on the punched card. This slim book is only 136 pages, including the index.|$|R
5000|$|The Jacquard head used {{replaceable}} {{punched cards}} {{to control a}} sequence of operations. It is considered {{an important step in}} the history of computing hardware. [...] The ability to change the pattern of the loom's weave by simply changing cards was an important conceptual precursor to the development of computer programming and data entry. Charles Babbage knew of Jacquard looms and planned to use cards to store programs in his Analytical engine. In the late 19th century, Herman Hollerith took the idea of using punched cards to store information a step further when he created a punched <b>card</b> <b>tabulating</b> machine which he used to input data for the 1890 U.S. Census. A large, punched-card-based data processing industry developed {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, dominated by the International Business Machine corporation (IBM), with its line of unit record equipment. The cards were used for data, however, with programming done by plugboards.|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} short descriptions, flow {{charts and}} listings {{of the computer}} programs that are currently being used for routine processing of strong-motion accelerograms at the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. All programs are in Fortran IV. The programs are presented in five groups corresponding to the processing scheme developed at the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory for Volume I, II, III, IV, and eventually Volume V reports (Hudson, et al, 1969; Hudson, et al, 1971; Hudson, et al, 1972 a; and Hudson, et al, 1972 b). The programs belonging to the Volume I operation are used to check the raw digitized data, to perform the elementary corrections for time and fixed base line, and to scale the raw digitized acceleration data to seconds and G/ 10 (G is the acceleration of gravity = 981 cm/sec'). The programs belonging to Volume II processing perform the instrument and base line corrections and calculate ground velocity and displacement. The programs for Volume III processing calculate the true velocity spectra, the Fourier amplitude spectra and the pseudo velocity spectra, while the programs for Volume IV compute the Fourier amplitude spectra using the Fast Fourier Transform approach. On {{the completion of the}} various stages of processing the output data are plotted, <b>tabulated,</b> punched on <b>cards,</b> and stored on magnetic tapes. The programs for Volume V processing at present plot the RES curves on linear and logarithmic scales by reading the Volume V tape containing the corrected accelerogram and the RES amplitudes...|$|R
40|$|Transcript, 23 pp. Audio file {{available}} at [URL] Lautenberg {{is the senior}} U. S. Senator from New Jersey. He was born in Paterson, NJ, the son of Polish and Russian immigrants, and served in the Army Signal Corps during World War II. He graduated from Columbia University with an Economics degree in 1949. Lautenberg helped co-found the early payroll services firm Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) and served as both Chairman and CEO. In this oral history Lautenberg refers to his roots in Paterson, which was then still heavily involved in silk manufacturing. He describes his early relationship with silk industry accountant Henry Taub, the originator of ADP (then called Automatic Payrolls) in 1949. Lautenberg remembers the decision to outsource the rendering payroll service, including the intricate financing required in recasting {{the direction of the}} company in 1952. Henry became chief planner and strategist. His younger brother Joseph became manager of operations, and Lautenberg became the marketer of service. Lautenberg describes use of Friden calculators and the Comptometer bookkeeping machine at Automatic Payrolls, as well as later punched <b>card</b> <b>tabulating</b> operations. Lautenberg explains the decision to go public in 1961 to accommodate the major payroll and human resource information needs of employers, and later expansion of company facilities and services like records, brokerage, and time-sharing. He talks about his service to ADAPSO and his Senate race. Lautenberg also deals briefly with privacy and security concerns related to automated data processing systems. This oral history was sponsored by the Software History Center in conjunction with the Center's ADAPSO reunion (3 May 2002) ...|$|R
