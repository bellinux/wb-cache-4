5|$|<b>Tod</b> {{was born}} in London and educated in Scotland. He joined the East India Company as a {{military}} officer and travelled to India in 1799 as a cadet in the Bengal Army. He rose quickly in rank, eventually becoming captain of an escort for an envoy in a Sindian royal court. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War, during which <b>Tod</b> {{was involved in the}} intelligence department, he was appointed Political Agent for some areas of Rajputana. His task was to help unify the region {{under the control of the}} East India Company. During this period <b>Tod</b> conducted most of the research that he would later publish. <b>Tod</b> was initially successful in his official role, but his methods were questioned by other members of the East India Company. Over time, his work was restricted and his areas of oversight were significantly curtailed. In 1823, owing to declining health and reputation, <b>Tod</b> resigned his post as Political Agent and returned to England.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel James <b>Tod</b> (20 March 1782– 18 November 1835) was an English-born {{officer of}} the British East India Company and an Oriental scholar.

5|$|<b>Tod</b> {{is a red}} fox kit, {{raised as}} a pet {{by one of the}} human hunters who killed his mother and litter mates. <b>Tod</b> {{initially}} enjoys his life, but when he reaches sexual maturity he returns to the wild. During his first year, he begins establishing his territory, and learns evasion techniques from being hunted by local farm dogs. One day, he comes across the Master's house and discovers that his presence sends the chained pack of dogs into a frustrated frenzy. He begins to delight in taunting them, until one day when Chief breaks his chain and chases him. The Master sees the dog escape and follows with Copper. As Chief skillfully trails the fox, <b>Tod</b> flees along a railroad track while a train is approaching, waiting to jump to safety until the last minute. Chief is killed by the train.|$|E

5|$|Tod's {{enthusiasm for}} bardic poetry {{reflected}} {{the works of}} Sir Walter Scott on Scottish subjects, which had a considerable influence both on British literary society and, bearing in mind Tod's Scottish ancestry, on <b>Tod</b> himself. <b>Tod</b> reconstructed Rajput history {{on the basis of}} the ancient texts and folklore of the Rajputs, although not everyone– for example, the polymath James Mill– accepted the historical validity of the native works. <b>Tod</b> also used philological techniques to reconstruct areas of Rajput history that were not even known to the Rajputs themselves, by drawing on works such as the religious texts known as Puranas.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} people of Scots descent who sought {{adventure}} and success at that time, <b>Tod</b> joined the British East India Company and initially spent some time studying at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He left England for India in 1799 {{and in doing so}} followed in the footsteps of various other members of his family, including his father, although <b>Tod</b> senior had not been in the Company but had instead owned an indigo plantation at Mirzapur. The young <b>Tod</b> journeyed as a cadet in the Bengal Army, appointment to which position was at the time reliant upon patronage. He was appointed lieutenant in May 1800 and in 1805 was able to arrange his posting {{as a member of the}} escort to a family friend who had been appointed as Envoy and Resident to a Sindian royal court. By 1813 he had achieved promotion to the rank of captain and was commanding the escort.|$|E

5|$|The Tale of Mr. <b>Tod</b> {{is longer}} than the typical Potter tale with 16 colour {{illustrations}} {{and a series of}} 42 black and white drawings, one illustration per page. The illustrations depict the wider landscape of Near Sawrey: Bull Banks, Oatmeal Crag, and Esthwaite Water. The interior of Mr. Tod's house provided the opportunity to present details of the interiors of village homes. In the frontispiece, Mr. <b>Tod</b> stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of muntin and plank construction (interlocking thick and thin vertical panels) covered with a sage-green limewash. A tea caddy, a silver salt, and blue and white willow china decorate his kitchen. The beehive-shaped brick oven was drawn from the one at the Sun Inn in Hawkshead and serves as a place for Brock to hide the bunnies. Emphatic frames in the black and white illustrations give the impression of woodcuts. Potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back the distance. Potter made the kitchen dim to eliminate some detail of the battle between <b>Tod</b> and Brock.|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} of {{how best to}} allocate land around transit stations is a debated topic, with transit officials often opting for park-and-ride lots over active uses such as multifamily housing, office, and retail organized into transit-oriented developments (<b>TODs).</b> In practice, guidelines for providing parking and mitigating vehicle trips come mainly from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual and the ITE Parking Generation Manual. However, both manuals have well-known shortcomings. The goal {{of this study is}} to determine how many fewer vehicle trips are generated at <b>TODs,</b> and how much less parking is required at <b>TODs,</b> than ITE guidelines would suggest. To answer these questions, we measure trip and parking generation at five <b>TODs</b> using a methodology that is the most robust published to date...|$|R

5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, <b>Tod</b> stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt <b>Tod,</b> and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
5|$|Back home in England, <b>Tod</b> {{published}} {{a number of}} academic works about Indian history and geography, most notably Annals and Antiquities of Rajas'han, based on materials collected during his travels.

40|$|Program {{monitoring}} is {{an important}} and necessary assessment practice {{within the field of}} early childhood deaf education. Effective program monitoring requires a focus on both the consistent implementation of intervention strategies (fidelity) and the assessment of children’s ongoing progress in response to interventions (progress monitoring). Teachers of the deaf and hard of hearing (<b>TODs)</b> who provide early intervention services need to conduct regular program monitoring to evaluate the merit of their efforts. However, progress monitoring is a practice often overlooked by practitioners within the field of early intervention. It is recommended that <b>TODs</b> monitor children’s progress “regularly,” but evidence of such practices by <b>TODs</b> is as yet unavailable. In this article, we describe how <b>TODs</b> can use both progress monitoring and fidelity checks to achieve the goal of effective program monitoring for young children who are deaf and hard of hearing...|$|R
40|$|Transit-oriented developments, or <b>TODs,</b> are {{commonly}} thought {{to appeal to}} non-traditional households. This paper reviews experiences with <b>TODs,</b> drawn mainly from Europe, that are kid-friendly. What makes them attractive to families are extensive shared green spaces and playgrounds in lieu of surface parking, no-traffic zones, and ample play spaces and cycling paths. Mixed land uses, high-levels of nearby transit services, and defensible spaces also have appeal. In some instances, higher rents reflect these benefits. Reducing on-site parking requirements and introducing transfer mechanisms that help cover the higher costs of family-size affordable units near rail stops can help promote kid-friendly <b>TODs...</b>|$|R
