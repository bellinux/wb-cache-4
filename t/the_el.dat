40|$|ON THE ORIGIN OF THE NOUN COMPOUNDS IN OLD PRUSSIAN Summary The article {{deals with}} {{the origin of the}} noun {{compounds}} of <b>the</b> <b>Elbing</b> Vocabulary and <b>the</b> Third Catechism. It establishes that more than a half of the noun compounds of <b>the</b> <b>Elbing</b> Vocabulary and only three noun compounds of the Third Catechism are of Old Prussian origin. The remaining compounds of <b>the</b> <b>Elbing</b> Vocabulary and <b>the</b> majority of those in the Third Catechism are loan translations from German. The noun compounds of <b>the</b> <b>Elbing</b> Vocabulary obviously tend to have simple base words. Except for a few questionable examples, there are no case compounds in <b>the</b> <b>Elbing</b> Vocabulary — all of them may be termed as stem compounds. However the compounds of the Third Catechism follow a clear trend of being comprised of underlying derivatives as well as having a case form for the first constituent. The German influence on the compounds of <b>the</b> <b>Elbing</b> Vocabulary is not very strong — it has impacted it only on the lexical level, while the compounds of the Third Catechism have also undergone more radical changes on the structural level. According to the above-mentioned features, it can be stated that the noun compounds of <b>the</b> <b>Elbing</b> Vocabulary resemble Lithuanian ones, while those of the Third Catechism show similarities with Latvian compounds which are influenced by German to a fairly large extent. </p...|$|R

40|$|Layered video coding creates {{multiple}} {{layers of}} unequal importance, which enables us to progressively refine the reconstructed video quality. When the base layer (BL) is corrupted or lost during transmission, <b>the</b> enhancement layers (<b>ELs)</b> must be dropped, regardless whether they are perfectly decoded or not, which implies that the transmission power assigned to <b>the</b> <b>ELs</b> is wasted. For the sake of combating this problem, the class of inter-layer forward error correction (IL-FEC) solutions, {{also referred to as}} layer-aware FEC (LA-FEC), has been proposed for layered video transmissions, which jointly encode the BL and <b>the</b> <b>ELs,</b> thereby protecting <b>the</b> BL using <b>the</b> <b>ELs.</b> This tutorial aims for inspiring further research on IL-FEC/LA-FEC techniques, with special emphasis on the family of soft-decoded bit-level IL-FEC schemes...|$|R
