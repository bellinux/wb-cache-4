5|$|Before the race, McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship with 145 points, twelve {{points ahead}} of <b>teammate</b> Jenson Button in second who was five points {{in front of}} Mark Webber in third. Webber's <b>teammate</b> Sebastian Vettel was fourth on 121 points and Fernando Alonso was fifth on 98 points. McLaren were leading the Constructors' Championship with 278 points; Red Bull and Ferrari were second and third with 249 and 165 points, while Mercedes (126 points) and Renault (89) contended for fourth place. McLaren and Red Bull had {{dominated}} the championship, while Alonso won the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. His <b>teammate</b> Felipe Massa and Robert Kubica had finished in second place, and Nico Rosberg (three times) Massa and Kubica (once) had taken third-place finishes.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} sought to {{identify}} the impact of whether <b>teammates</b> in a cooperative videogame were controlled by other humans (avatars) or by the game (agents). The impact on player experience was explored through both subjective questionnaire measures and brain wave activity measurement (electroencephalography). Play with human <b>teammates</b> {{was associated with a}} greater sense of relatedness, but less competence and flow than play with other computer-controlled <b>teammates.</b> In terms of brain activity, play with human <b>teammates</b> was associated with greater activity in the alpha, theta and beta power bands than play with computer-controlled <b>teammates.</b> Overall, the results suggest that play with human <b>teammates</b> involves greater cognitive activity in terms of 'mentalising' than play with computer-controlled <b>teammates.</b> Additionally, the associations between subjective measures of player experience and brain activity are described. Limitations of the current study are identified and key directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

5|$|David Gilliland, who had {{the pole}} position, was passed {{immediately}} by <b>teammate</b> Dale Jarrett. The race lead changed 63 times, with Dale Earnhardt Jr. leading for the most laps (37). Earnhardt was leading on the final lap when he and Jimmie Johnson crashed after Vickers made contact with Johnson's right rear quarter panel, causing the race to end under caution flag conditions. Vickers (Johnson's <b>teammate)</b> was determined the race winner by NASCAR and was later criticized since the crash lowered Johnson in the points standings.|$|E
5|$|During Q3, contested {{by the top}} ten, Hamilton just {{beat his}} <b>teammate</b> to pole position, with a time set during his first timed lap. Both Ferrari drivers ran their first lap on used tyres {{in order to save}} one set for the race. In their second outing, Vettel was able to get ahead of the two Williams cars of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, while <b>teammate</b> Kimi Räikkönen {{struggled}} with the handling of his car {{in the first part of}} the track to finish sixth on the grid.|$|E
40|$|This book {{is devoted}} to the {{encounter}} and interaction of agents such as robots with other agents and describes how they cooperate with their previously unknown <b>teammates,</b> forming an Ad Hoc team. It presents a new algorithm, PLASTIC, that allows agents to quickly adapt to new <b>teammates</b> by reusing knowledge learned from previous <b>teammates.</b>   PLASTIC is instantiated in both a model-based approach, PLASTIC-Model, and a policy-based approach, PLASTIC-Policy.   In addition to reusing knowledge learned from previous <b>teammates,</b> PLASTIC also allows users to provide expert-knowledge and can use transfer learning (such as the new TwoStageTransfer algorithm) to quickly create models of new <b>teammates</b> when it has some information about its new <b>teammates.</b> The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on three domains, ranging from multi-armed bandits to simulated robot soccer games...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{training}} teams increasingly occurs in synthetic environments. However, {{it is often}} still modeled after live team training, including the disadvantages of live training, for example, {{the fact that all}} <b>teammates</b> must be available. This paper explores overcoming the disadvantages of human <b>teammates</b> in training teams in synthetic environments, while keeping the advantages of learning in a collaborative and cooperative fashion. Simulated <b>teammates</b> are a promising alternative because they are always available, may be modeled after experienced training personnel, and may be more cost effective in the long run [...] This paper details a research approach towards the definition of requirements for simulated <b>teammates.</b> In our approach, we carry out a set of experiments using confederates as simulated <b>teammates,</b> in a well-controlled simulation of a military command-and-control task The results of a first experiment show slightly better teamwork skills for those teams trained with simulated <b>teammates...</b>|$|R

5|$|Hamilton {{clinched}} {{his sixth}} pole {{position of the}} season with a lap time of 1:18.404. He was joined on the front row by Räikkönen, who was fastest for most of the final session. Provisionally sitting in third as the session drew to a close, Massa was pushed back to fifth as Kovalainen and Alonso put in last-minute laps to fill the second row of the grid. Kubica took sixth place, ahead of both Toyota cars of Jarno Trulli and Glock and the Toro Rossos of Sebastian Vettel and Sébastien Bourdais. Coulthard bettered <b>teammate</b> Webber when he qualified 11th; Piquet split the Red Bull drivers in 12th. The only Japanese driver in the field, Nakajima, managed 14th ahead of his Williams <b>teammate</b> Nico Rosberg. Heidfeld could only achieve 16th place, ten places behind his BMW <b>teammate</b> Kubica. Heidfeld spent the majority of the first session struggling with the set-up of his car. The Honda cars of Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button filled the ninth row in front of the constructor's home crowd.

Both McLarens had shown promising pace, but nevertheless dropped out of contention in 12th and 14th, while Daniil Kvyat was the last driver to secure a place in Q3, demoting Carlos Sainz Jr. to 11th. Kvyat's Red Bull <b>teammate</b> Daniel Ricciardo also progressed, albeit suffering a failure of his wing mirror, which hung {{off the side of}} his vehicle during his last timed lap.

His <b>teammate</b> Hamilton was third fastest, albeit running wide at turn 8 on one of his laps. Ricciardo was fourth fastest, half a second down on Vettel and one tenth of a second ahead of <b>teammate</b> Verstappen in fifth. Fernando Alonso, who lost parts of his bodywork when running over the kerbs late in the session, was tenth fastest, 1.2 seconds behind Vettel.
