5|$|To {{ensure the}} mission to steal a Zero Point Module is a success, Dr. McKay (David Hewlett) proposes to use Dr. Weir (Torri Higginson) and her nanites to access the Asuran {{collective}} and guide them; should the Asurans take her over, McKay would activate a kill switch on the nanites, which would also effectively kill Weir. With their experimental jumper ready, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) leaves Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) in command of Atlantis. The jumper's hyperdrive works and they arrive over the Asuran homeworld (M7R-227). With Weir's access, Sheppard and Ronon (Jason Momoa) easily steal <b>the</b> <b>Zero</b> <b>Point</b> Module.

5|$|Unlike {{any other}} element, helium will remain liquid down to {{absolute}} zero at normal pressures. This {{is a direct}} effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, <b>the</b> <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> energy {{of the system is}} too high to allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5K (about −272°C or −457°F) at about 25 bar (2.5MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214±0.006g/cm3 at 1.15K and 66atm; the projected density at 0K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187±0.009g/cm3. At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.|$|E

Because of the difficulties with PSF fluxes of brighter stars, we recommend that comparisons of ugriz and UBVRI photometry should only be made for unsaturated stars with g, r and i in the range 14. 5 - 19. 5, and u in the range 16 - 19. 5.
