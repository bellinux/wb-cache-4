5|$|During his 1965-1966 world tour, Dylan {{was backed}} by a five-member rock group, <b>The</b> <b>Hawks,</b> who would later become famous as The Band. After Dylan was injured in a {{motorcycle}} accident in July 1966, four members of <b>The</b> <b>Hawks</b> came to Dylan's home in the Woodstock area to collaborate with him on music and film projects. While Dylan {{was out of the}} public's eye during an extended period of recovery in 1967, he and the members of <b>The</b> <b>Hawks</b> recorded more than 100 tracks together, incorporating original compositions, contemporary covers, and traditional material. Dylan's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, toward songs that were more intimate and which drew on many styles of traditional American music. While some of the basement songs are humorous, others dwell on nothingness, betrayal and a quest for salvation. In general, they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the Americana genre. For some critics, the songs on The Basement Tapes, which circulated widely in unofficial form, mounted a major stylistic challenge to rock music in the late sixties.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2016–17 season, <b>the</b> <b>Hawks</b> {{extended}} Hardaway a qualifying offer, {{making him}} a restricted free agent (giving <b>the</b> <b>Hawks</b> the right to match any offer that he signed).

5|$|After {{the release}} of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band.

Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he {{did not wish to}} continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, {{was in the process of}} setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and <b>the</b> <b>Hawks,</b> consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended <b>the</b> <b>Hawks</b> to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Albert Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; <b>the</b> <b>Hawks</b> had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.|$|E

40|$|When a {{black hole}} is in an empty space on {{which there is no}} matter field except that of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> {{radiation}} (<b>Hawking</b> field), then <b>the</b> black hole evaporates and the entropy of the black hole decreases. The generalised second law guarantees the increase of the total entropy of the whole system which consists of the black hole and <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field. That is, the increase of the entropy of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field is faster than the decrease of the black hole entropy. In naive sense, one may expect that the entropy increase of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field is due to the self-interaction among the composite particles of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field, and that the "self"-relaxation of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field results in the entropy increase. Then, when one consider a non-self-interacting matter field as <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field, {{it is obvious that the}} self-relaxation does not take place, and one may think that the total entropy does not increase. However, using nonequilibrium thermodynamics which has been developed recently, we find for <b>the</b> non-self-interacting <b>Hawking</b> field that <b>the</b> rate of entropy increase of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field (<b>the</b> entropy emission rate by the black hole) grows faster than the rate of entropy decrease of the black hole along the black hole evaporation in the empty space. The origin of the entropy increase of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field is <b>the</b> increase of the black hole temperature. Hence an understanding of the generalised second law in the context of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics is suggested; even if the self-relaxation of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field does not take place, the temperature increase of the black hole during the evaporation process causes the entropy increase of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field to result in the increase of the total entropy.

50|$|Starting in <b>the</b> <b>hawk's</b> early life, it is fed by its parents {{until it}} leaves the nest. <b>The</b> young <b>hawk,</b> while still in its fledgling phase, will leave its nest as early as six weeks old.

The falcon uses its claws to catch the prey but kills the small animal with its mouth instead of its claws. <b>The</b> <b>hawk's</b> preferred time for hunting is usually just before nightfall when daylight lessens. Although <b>the</b> <b>hawk</b> is known for being a violent predator, some are gentle and quiet. When it flies, <b>the</b> <b>hawk</b> flaps its wings rapidly, and then uses that momentum to glide smoothly and gracefully through the air.|$|R

On March 3, he made five of nine three-pointers and scored a career-high 36 points in a 135–130 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

5|$|However, Boston's {{chances of}} getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had {{finished}} second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward Tom Heinsohn. But Auerbach knew that the Rochester Royals, who owned the first draft pick, already had a skilled rebounder in Maurice Stokes, were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested. The St. Louis Hawks, who owned the second pick, drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time All-Star who had roots in St. Louis. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order to be with his sick son, if <b>the</b> <b>Hawks</b> gave up Russell. The owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade.
