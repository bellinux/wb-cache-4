5|$|Tyrannosaurid skulls {{had many}} unique characteristics, {{including}} fused parietal bones with a prominent sagittal crest, which ran longitudinally along the sagittal suture and separated the two supratemporal fenestrae on the skull roof. Behind these fenestrae, tyrannosaurids had a characteristically tall nuchal crest, which also {{arose from the}} parietals but ran along a <b>transverse</b> <b>plane</b> rather than longitudinally. The nuchal crest was especially well-developed in Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Alioramus. Albertosaurus, Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus had tall crests {{in front of the}} eyes on the lacrimal bones, while Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus had extremely thickened postorbital bones forming crescent-shaped crests behind the eyes. Alioramus had a row of six bony crests on top of its snout, arising from the nasal bones; lower crests have been reported on some specimens of Daspletosaurus and Tarbosaurus, as well as the more basal tyrannosauroid Appalachiosaurus.|$|E
25|$|The {{frontal plane}} or coronal plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or {{posterior}} and anterior) portions. For post-embryonic humans a coronal plane is vertical and a <b>transverse</b> <b>plane</b> is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal plane is horizontal and a <b>transverse</b> <b>plane</b> is vertical. A longitudinal plane is any plane {{perpendicular to the}} <b>transverse</b> <b>plane.</b> The coronal plane and the sagittal plane are examples of longitudinal planes.|$|E
25|$|A <b>transverse</b> <b>plane,</b> {{also known}} as a cross-section, divides the body into cranial and caudal (head and tail) portions.|$|E

30|$|Vessels {{should be}} “pre-scanned” in {{longitudinal}} and <b>transverse</b> <b>planes</b> to identify important surrounding structures, anatomic anomalies, {{and to determine}} the optimal site(s) for cannulation.|$|R
25|$|The <b>transverse</b> <b>plane</b> is {{the plane}} that divides the body or organ {{horizontally}} into upper and lower portions. Transverse planes produce images referred to as cross sections.|$|E
25|$|File:Range of {{acetabular}} anteversion.png|Acetabular anteversion {{is normally}} between 5 and 25°. An anteversion below or above this range {{increases the risk}} of dislocation. There is an intra-individual variability in this method because the pelvis may be tilted in various degrees in relation to the <b>transverse</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} enamel tufts {{is not fully}} understood. It appears, however, that they may arise during enamel {{development}} in areas where enamel rods are crowded at the boundaries where they are bundled together, creating periodic weakened mineral reduced planes. These weaknesses then produce transient longitudinal cracks in the <b>transverse</b> <b>plane</b> of the developing enamel.|$|E
30|$|Tendons are {{comprised}} of organised bundles of collagen with a regular, ordered structure. This regular structure results in markedly differing ultrasound properties {{depending on whether}} the tendon is scanned in longitudinal or <b>transverse</b> <b>planes.</b> In addition, the ultrasound characteristic will differ between images in similar planes, for example, in <b>transverse</b> <b>planes,</b> as a result of varying angles of the incident ultrasound beam. This property, known as anisotropy, may result in artefactual appearances of pathology, in particular, spurious impressions of rupture or oedema.|$|R
30|$|Our {{data and}} {{analysis}} demonstrate that competitive swimming during the growth phase has a favourable effect on dental arch {{development in the}} sagittal, vertical and <b>transverse</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R

30|$|Abdominal and/or transrectal 2 D US {{where the}} presence, {{the shape and}} the {{dimensions}} of the uterus (cavity, wall and external contour) should be recorded in a systematic and pre-defined manner in longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Linear {{coupling}} {{between the}} <b>transverse</b> <b>planes</b> {{together with the}} tune separation $Q_h$ $Q_v$ is important for Landau damping of coherent instabilities. Often beam stability {{is found to be}} more critical in one of the <b>transverse</b> <b>planes.</b> Overall stability can then be improved by tuning the coupling and/or the tune split, to transfer a certain amount of Landau damping from the stable to the unstable <b>plane.</b> The <b>transverse</b> tune spreads, the skew gradient (due to skew quadrupoles or solenoids) and the tune separation are four major parameters {{that can be used to}} damp transverse coherent instabilities. A stability criterion for both coasting and bunched beams (with long and short-range interactions) is derived using these parameters, considering the smooth approximation and Lorentz spectra for the transverse tune spreads (an "elliptical" tune distribution is also discussed at the end of the paper and a simple example is treated). These assumptions should be sufficient to expose the essential physics of the topic. To obtain quantitative results concerning the sharing of Landau damping between the <b>transverse</b> <b>planes,</b> we discuss the case of a coasting beam without horizontal tune spread in a circular vacuum pipe of finite resistivity (the general case is then deduced) ...|$|R
30|$|We {{report a}} case of a multiplanar {{malunion}} in the tibia. An OSCRO was planned using advanced three-dimensional imaging techniques, and it provided a patient-specific cutting guide for performing a single oblique osteotomy accurately and correcting angular malrotations in the sagittal, coronal and <b>transverse</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... 2D/3D reconstruction: Early PET {{scanners}} {{had only}} a single ring of detectors, hence the acquisition of data and subsequent reconstruction was restricted to a single <b>transverse</b> <b>plane.</b> More modern scanners now include multiple rings, essentially forming a cylinder of detectors.|$|E
2500|$|Cipriano Andrade, Jr., {{engineer}} and yacht designer, said of Spray: “After a thorough analysis of Sprays lines, I found {{her to have}} a theoretically perfect balance. Her balance is marvelous — almost uncanny. Try as I would — one element after another — they all swung into the same identical line. I attacked her with proportional dividers, planimeter, rotameter, Simpson's rule, Froude's coefficients, Dixon Kemp's formulae, series, curves, differentials, and all the appliances of modern yacht designing, and she emerged from the ordeal a theoretically perfect boat. For when she is underway every element of resistance, stability, weight, heeling effort, and propulsive force is in one <b>transverse</b> <b>plane,</b> and that plane is the boat's midship section. I know of no similar case in the whole field of naval architecture, ancient or modern.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{other type}} of {{external}} frame which recently was proposed, is made from composite plastic which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also {{it is a kind}} of material that can be shaped like human spine curvature. In this type of backpack, load directly transfers to the shoulders through the non-flexible straps. This non-flexible structure diminishes the momentum at lumbar region of the back. Strap curvature is shaped close to spine curvature and there are two flexible drawstrings to prevent backpack movement in <b>transverse</b> <b>plane.</b> The straps of this backpack are wide enough to distribute the pressure on shoulders and also a white glass wool layer is added to the internal part of them to absorb dynamic forces, which could be produced through walking. This backpack type is an experimental sample that need further options to be prepared for [...] usage. One of the benefits of backpack with external frame is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying.|$|E
30|$|With multiplanar malunion, {{there is}} {{malalignment}} in the coronal, sagittal and <b>transverse</b> <b>planes.</b> Performing the correct osteotomy {{and the subsequent}} reduction and fixation is challenging; while angular deformities can be measured using orthogonal radiographs, rotational deformity cannot be measured accurately using 2 -D images.|$|R
30|$|Size (in centimeters) of {{inferior}} vena cava {{and size}} of aorta were measured at minimum and maximum diameters in both longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>planes</b> in all study patients; as previously described [7, 8].

40|$|The {{transverse}} resistive-wall impedance {{is discussed}} in the particular case of the LHC collimators, which reveal a new physical regime. Single-bunch and coupled-bunch instability mechanisms are then reviewed in both longitudinal and tranverse planes.

50|$|The axes and the {{sagittal}} plane {{are the same}} for bipeds and quadrupeds, but {{the orientation of the}} coronal and <b>transverse</b> <b>planes</b> switch.
