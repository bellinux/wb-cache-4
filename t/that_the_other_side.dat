25|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about it is that the problem is not about the chance <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> is black, it's about the chance that you drew the all black card.

25|$|It was a {{supposedly}} Berber Jewish woman Dahiyah, or Damia (mistaken identity), {{better known as}} Kahina, who aroused her people in the Aures, the eastern spurs of the Atlas Mountains in Algeria, to a last although fruitless resistance to the Arab general Hasan ibn an-Nu'man. As in the Hellenic lands of Christendom, so also in Mauretania, Judaism involuntarily prepared the way for Islam; and {{the conversion of the}} Berbers to Islam took place so much the more easily.

25|$|The {{influence}} of xenophobia and ethnic hatred {{in the collapse}} of Yugoslavia became clear during the war in Croatia. Propaganda by Croatian and Serbian sides spread fear, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> would engage in oppression against them and would exaggerate death tolls to increase support from their populations. In the beginning months of the war, the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army and navy deliberately shelled civilian areas of Split and Dubrovnik, a UNESCO world heritage site, as well as nearby Croat villages. Yugoslav media claimed that the actions were done due to what they claimed was a presence of fascist Ustaše forces and international terrorists in the city.|$|E

25|$|Euclid {{often used}} proof by contradiction. Euclidean {{geometry}} also allows {{the method of}} superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving {{one of the two}} triangles so that one of its <b>sides</b> coincides with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> triangle's equal <b>side,</b> and then proving <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>sides</b> coincide as well. Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} bout was {{the last}} match in the Terri Invitational Tournament, contested between The New Brood (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) and Edge and Christian in a tag team ladder match. For the match, a bag with 100,000 dollars was hung from the ceiling, and {{the goal of the}} match was to use one of the two ladders in the ring to climb and retrieve the bag. The first team to retrieve the bag would win the match. The manager of The New Brood, Gangrel brought a ladder to the ring, but as a result, he got ejected from ringside by the referee. During the match, the ladders were set up so that one was on top of the other, resembling a Seesaw, Jeff jumped on one side so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> jutted upwards, knocking down both Matt and Christian. Later in the match, all four men were on the ladders and after Edge pushed Matt off of the ladder they were both on, he fell into the other ladder, knocking Christian to the mat. Jeff however, jumped onto the other ladder to continue to battle with Edge. As Jeff and Edge climbed the ladder, Jeff pushed Edge to the ground and grabbed the bag of money to win the match. As a result of winning the match, The New Brood won $100,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. Backstage, the trio celebrated the win and their new partnership with a bottle of champagne.|$|E

2500|$|The {{answer is}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> is black with {{probability}} [...] However, common intuition suggests a probability of [...] either {{because there are}} two cards with black on them that this card could be, or because there are 3 white and 3 black sides and many people forget to eliminate {{the possibility of the}} [...] "white card" [...] in this situation (i.e. the card they flipped CANNOT be the [...] "white card" [...] because a black side was turned over).|$|E
2500|$|In question, however, one {{has already}} {{selected}} a card from the hat {{and it shows}} a black face.

2500|$|From {{the view}} of the West, the Eastern {{rejection}} of the Filioque denied the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son and was thus a form of crypto-Arianism.

Siecienski asserts that, as much as power and authority were central issues in the debate, the strength of emotion rising even to the level of hatred can be ascribed to a belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> had [...] "destroyed the purity of the faith and refused to accept the clear teachings of the fathers on the Spirit's procession".|$|E

50|$|Another {{trait of}} Polasek’s work is his {{emphasis}} on all perspectives of a sculpture being important.

As a retort to the sculptor’s later comment {{that it is impossible to}} make the ends of a flat composition interesting, Polasek sculpted a piece entitled “Aspiration,” for which he won the Widener Gold Medal in 1915, which demonstrates that all sides of a sculpture can be interesting.|$|R

2500|$|One {{solution}} {{method is}} to label the card faces, for example numbers 1 through 6. Label {{the faces of the}} black card 1 and 2; label the faces of the mixed card 3 (black) and 4 (white); and label the faces of the white card 5 and 6. The observed black face could be 1, 2, or 3, all equally likely; if it is 1 or 2, the other side is black, and if it is 3, the other side is white. The probability <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> is black is [...] This probability can be derived in the following manner: Let random variable B equal the a black face (i.e. the probability of a success since the black face is what we are looking for). Using Kolmogrov's Axiom of all probabilities having to equal 1, we can conclude that the probability of drawing a white face is 1−P(B). Since P(B)=P(1)+P(2) therefore P(B)=+=. Likewise we can do this P(white face)=1−=.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1933 and 1939, Pacelli issued 55 {{protests of}} {{violations}} of the Reichskonkordat. Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber to help him write a protest of Nazi {{violations of the}} Reichskonkordat; this was to become Pius XI's 1937 encyclical, Mit brennender Sorge. The encyclical was written in German and not the usual Latin of official Roman Catholic Church documents. Secretly distributed by an army of motorcyclists and read from every German Catholic Church pulpit on Palm Sunday, it condemned the paganism of the National Socialism ideology. Pius XI credited its creation and writing to Pacelli. It was the first official denunciation of Nazism made by any major organization and resulted in persecution of the Church by the infuriated Nazis who closed all the participating presses and [...] "took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging {{a long series of}} immorality trials of the Catholic clergy." [...] On 10 June 1941, the pope commented on the problems of the Reichskonkordat {{in a letter to the}} Bishop of Passau, in Bavaria: [...] "The history of the Reichskonkordat shows, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> lacked the most basic prerequisites to accept minimal freedoms and rights of the Church, without which the Church simply cannot live and operate, formal agreements notwithstanding".|$|E
2500|$|General Murray {{also worked}} for a {{division}} of Lockheed Skunk Works. He {{was assigned to the}} project development of [...] "The Black Missile". This was the first missile that was undetectable by radar. It was being built in a large tan-colored hangar located on the north corner of The Burbank Airport, located in Burbank, California. The hangar was owned by Lockheed Skunk Works Division. It was accessed via San Fernando Rd. This hangar was not the typical hangar. It was larger than normal and heavily guarded. There were no signs of what was really going on there. General Murray worked there daily, entering the door {{on the west side of}} the hangar. He explained, upon entering the hangar there was an enormous black curtain that was drawn across the center of the hangar, splitting the work space. He stayed on his side and the other workers stayed on their side. They never saw each other or looked beyond the curtain. General Murray was advised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the curtain contained a highly classified development, as his project wasn't classified enough. Years later, General Murray discovered what was going on behind the curtain. He was told the first stealth aircraft was in its early stages of development and testing. Murray declined to speak about which aircraft. The hangar was torn down in the year 2002, closing another door to an amazing piece of history.|$|E

The Princeton students [...] "saw" [...] the Dartmouth team make twice as many infractions as their own team, and they also saw the team make twice as many infractions compared to what the Dartmouth students saw. Dartmouth students viewed the game as being evenly-matched in violence, in which both sides were to blame. This study revealed that two groups perceived an event subjectively. Each team believed they saw the event objectively and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side's</b> perception of <b>the</b> event was blinded by bias.|$|R
