5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government</b> allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E

25|$|On 29 January, the LJM and JEM leaders {{issued a}} joint {{statement}} affirming {{their commitment to the}} Doha negotiations and intention to attend the Doha forum on 5 February. <b>The</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government</b> postponed decision to attend the forum due to beliefs that an internal peace process without the involvement of rebel groups might be possible. Later in February, <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>Government</b> agreed to return to Doha with a view to complete a new peace agreement {{by the end of that}} month. On 25 February, both LJM and JEM announced that they had rejected the peace document proposed by the mediators in Doha. The main sticking points were the issues of a Darfuri vice-president and compensation for victims. <b>The</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government</b> did not comment on the peace document.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government</b> {{has been}} accused of suppressing {{information}} by jailing and killing witnesses since 2004, and tampering with evidence, such as covering up mass graves. <b>The</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government</b> has also arrested and harassed journalists, thus limiting the extent of press coverage of the situation in Darfur. While the United States government has described the conflict as genocide, the UN has not recognized the conflict as such. (see List of declarations of genocide in Darfur).|$|E

50|$|The U.S. {{government}} imposed {{economic sanctions}} against Sudan in 1997, due to <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government's</b> sponsorship of international terrorism and poor human rights record. The sanctions prohibit trade between the United States and Sudan, as well as investment by U.S. businesses in Sudan. In February 2000, the U.S. government extended its sanctions to include Sudapet and GNPOC.|$|R
5000|$|From <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government's</b> {{point of}} view, the {{conflict}} is simply a skirmish. <b>The</b> <b>Sudanese</b> president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, said, [...] "The international concern over Darfur is actually a targeting of the Islamic state in Sudan." [...] Sudan has warned Britain and the United States not to interfere {{in the internal affairs}} of the East African country saying it will reject any military aid, while asking for logistic support.|$|R

5000|$|... "These {{conflicts}} lead to strange {{alliances with}} the US. Once eager hosts of Osama bin Laden, Sudan's Islamist movement has since split, {{with the two}} factions now fighting a proxy war in Darfur. In the 1990s, the U.S. rejected every initiative offered by <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> to cooperate on counter-terrorism issues, including an offer to extradite Osama bin Laden. <b>The</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government’s</b> willingness to share its copious intelligence on Al-Qaeda has now bought it some immunity from responsibility for the atrocities in Darfur.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, the New Sudan Council of Churches invited Eibner {{to come to}} {{southern}} Sudan to observe the effect of <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> civil war on Sudan’s Christian population. The atrocities Eibner witnessed there, including mass slaughter and slave raiding by government-supported militias, led him to describe <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government’s</b> campaign against <b>the</b> south as “genocide” in an October 1992 article for Wall Street Journal Europe. According to author Richard Cockett, Eibner’s article marks the first {{use of the word}} “genocide” in connection with modern Sudan.|$|R

25|$|The NGO Human Rights First {{claimed that}} over 90% {{of the light}} weapons {{currently}} being imported by Sudan and used in the conflict are from China. Human rights advocates and opponents of <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government</b> portray China's role in providing weapons and aircraft as a cynical attempt to obtain oil, just as colonial powers once supplied African chieftains with the military means to maintain control as they extracted natural resources. According to China's critics, China threatened to use its veto on the U.N. Security Council to protect Khartoum from sanctions {{and was able to}} water down every resolution on Darfur in order to protect its interests. Accusations of the supply of weapons from China, which were then transferred to Darfur by <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government</b> in violation of the UN arms embargo, continued in 2010.|$|E

50|$|The {{contemporary}} left, {{according to}} Levy, believes that any opponent of America or capitalism is good by definition. It is this reasoning {{that has led}} the left to support the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein; to turn the World Conference against Racism 2001 into a forum for anti-Semitic hatred, and to <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government's</b> attacks first on southern Sudan and now {{on the people of}} Darfur because that government is anti-American and no anti-American government is to be criticized.|$|R
25|$|On 26 August, {{two days}} before the UNSC meeting and Frazer was due to arrive in Khartoum, Paul Salopek, a U.S. National Geographic Magazine journalist, {{appeared}} in court in Darfur facing charges of espionage; he had crossed into the country illegally from Chad, circumventing <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government's</b> official restrictions on foreign journalists. He was later released after direct negotiation with President al-Bashir. This came a month after Tomo Križnar, a Slovenian presidential envoy, was sentenced to two years in prison for spying.|$|R
