40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and general psychological symptoms in <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> autistic children in comparison with those in <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> mentally retarded children. Forty <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> autistic children and 38 <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> mentally retarded children were included in the study. After a clinical interview, psychometric tests were performed for depression, anxiety, alexithymia, and Symptom Distress Check List (SCL- 90) for general psychological symptoms. Non-depression rates was 27. 5 % in <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> autistic children whereas the rate was 55. 3 % in <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> mentally retarded children. There was no difference regarding anxiety and alexithymia between the two groups. The psychopathology in <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> autistic children was more frequent than in those of mentally retarded children in all sub-scales of SCL- 90 (somatization obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, anger-hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid thought, psychotism, and extra scale). <b>The</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> autistic children experienced more psychological distress than those of mentally retarded children.

40|$|To {{explore the}} actual {{practices}} {{and perceptions of}} giving breastmilk and breastmilk substitutes (BMS), this cross-sectional study was conducted among 326 <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> low (income/month Tk 4, 000, n= 163) socioeconomic status (SES) with infants aged 6 - 12 months in Dhaka city during February-April 2001. Qualitative data on perceptions <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> on appropriate breast-feeding practices were also documented through focus-group discussions (FGDs). The prevalence of exclusive breast-feeding was low in both the socioeconomic groups but was comparatively higher among <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> middle SES (3. 1 % vs 12. 3 %, p< 0. 001), although predominant breast-feeding was high among <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> low SES.

The majority (62. 3 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> mentioned insufficiency <b>of</b> breastmilk as {{the main reason for}} introducing BMS. Perception on appropriate feeding practices was also significantly different between the two groups.

The Beck Depression Inventory, (Beck, Ward, Mendelson & Erbaugh, 1961), the Attributional Style Questionnaire (Abramson, Seligman &Teasdale, 1978), and the Tennessee Self Concept Scale (Fitts, 1965) were completed by <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> 20 boys with psychoneurological learning. disabilities and <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> 20 boys with anxiety disorders, aged 6 - 12 years.

The conclusion was drawn that the nature of the psychopathology did not depend as much on one factor such as a specific learning disability or an anxiety disorder, but was rather a manifestation of the functioning of the family system. Further research seems indicated to investigate the strengths and vulnerabilities in the family system as a whole, in terms of the reciprocal influence of the learning disabled child and his family [...] ...|$|R
