40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to improve the understanding of some aspects on wood and fibre mechanics related to conditions in the <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> process. Another objective was to measure the power distribution between the rotating plates in a refiner.   The thesis comprises the following parts: –A literature review aimed at describing fracture in wood and fibres as related to the <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> process –An experimental study of fracture in wood under compression, at conditions {{similar to those in}} feeding of chips into preheaters and chip refiners –An experimental study of the effect of impact velocity on the fracture of wood, related to conditions of fibre separation in the breaker bar zone in a chip refiner –A micromechanical model of the deterioration of wood fibres, related to the development of fibre properties during the intense treatment in the small gap in the refining zone –Measurements of the power distribution in a refiner.   The fracture in wood under compression was investigated by use of acoustic emission monitoring. The wood was compressed in both lateral and longitudinal directions to predict preferred modes of deformation in order to achieve desired irreversible changes in the wood structure. It was concluded that the most efficient compression direction in this respect is longitudinal. Preferable temperature at which the compression should be carried out and specific energy input needed in order to achieve substantial changes in the wood structure were also given.   The fibre separation step and specifically the effect of impact velocity on the fracture energy were studied by use of a falling weight impact tester. The fracture surfaces were also examined under a microscope. An increase in impact velocity resulted in an increase in fracture energy. In the <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> process the fibres are subjected to lateral compression, tension and shear which causes the creation of microcracks in the fibre wall. This damage reduces the fibre wall stiffness. A simplified analytical model is presented for the prediction of the stiffness degradation due to the damage state in a wood fibre, loaded in uni-axial tension or shear. The model was based on an assumed displacement field together with the minimum total potential energy theorem. For the damage development an energy criterion was employed. The model was applied to calculate the relevant stiffness coefficients {{as a function of the}} damage state. The energy consumption in order to achieve a certain damage state in a softwood fibre by uniaxial tension or shear load was also calculated. The energy consumption was found to be dependent on the microfibril angle in the middle secondary wall, the loading case, the thicknesses of the fibre cell wall layers, and conditions such as moisture content and temperature. At conditions, prevailing at the entrance of the gap between the plates in a refiner and at relative high damage states, more energy was needed to create cracks at higher microfibril angles. The energy consumption was lower for earlywood compared to latewood fibres. For low microfibril angles, the energy consumption was lower for loading in shear compared to tension for both earlywood and latewood fibres. Material parameters, such as initial damage state and specific fracture energy, were determined by fitting of input parameters to experimental data. Only a part of the electrical energy demand in the <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> process is considered to be effective in fibre separation and developing fibre properties. Therefore it is important to improve the understanding of how this energy is distributed along the refining zone. Investigations have been carried out in a laboratory single-disc refiner. It was found that a new developed force sensor is an effective way of measuring the power distribution within the refining zone. The collected data show that the tangential force per area and consequently also the power per unit area increased with radial position. The results in this thesis improve the understanding of the influence of some process parameters in <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> related wood and fibre mechanics such as loading rate, loading direction, moisture content and temperature to separate the fibres from the wood and to achieve desired irreversible changes in the fibre structure. Further, the thesis gives an insight of the spatial energy distribution in a refiner during <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the study, the {{selected}} wood and fiber properties were investigated in terms of their occurrence and variation in wood, as well as their relevance from the perspective of <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> process and related end-products. It was concluded that the most important factors were the fiber dimensions, juvenile wood content, and in some cases, the content of heartwood being associated with extremely dry wood with low permeability in spruce. With respect to the above properties, the following three pulpwood assortments of which pulping potential was assumed to vary were formed: wood from regeneration cuttings, first-thinnings wood, and sawmill chips. In the experimental part of the study the average wood and fiber characteristics and their variation were determined for each raw material group prior to pulping. Subsequently, each assortment - equaling about 1500 m 3 roundwood - was pulped separately for a 24 h period, at constant process conditions. The properties of obtained newsgrade <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> were then determined. <b>Thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (TMP) from sawmill chips had the highest proportion of long fibers, smallest proportion of fines, and had generally the coarsest and longest fibers. TMP from first-thinnings wood was just the opposite, whereas that from regeneration cuttings fell in between the above two extremes. High proportion of dry heartwood in wood originating from regeneration cuttings produced a slightly elevated shives content. However, no differences were found in pulp specific energy consumption. The obtained pulp tear index was clearly best in TMP made from sawmill chips and poorest in pulp from first-thinnings wood, which had generally inferior strength properties. No dramatical differences in any of the strength properties were found between pulp from sawmill residual wood and regeneration cuttings. Pulp optical properties were superior in TMP from first-thinnings. Unexpectedly, no noticeable differences, which could be explained with fiber morphology, were found in sheet density, bulk, air permeance or roughness between the three pulps. The most important wood quality factors in this study were the fiber length, fiber cross-sectional dimensions and percentage juvenile wood. Differences found in the quality of TMP manufactured from the above spruce assortments suggest that they could be segregated and pulped separately to obtain specific product characteristics, i. e., for instance tailor-made end-products, and to minimize unnecessary variation in the raw material quality, and hence, pulp quality...|$|R

Mechanical pulping does not remove the lignin, so the yield is very high, >95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{relevant}} {{issues regarding}} the use of Eucalyptus wood: the factors affecting energy consumption during wood defibration, with focus on fiber wall chemistry and the assessment of wood quality {{from a wide range of}} novel Brazilian Eucalyptus hybrids. The obtained results are reflected to mechanical and traditional chemical processes. Wood refining experiments were carried out in laboratory scale, with and without chemical pretreatment: alkaline peroxide mechanical <b>pulping</b> (APMP) and <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (TMP) processes, respectively. The most important finding was the direct influence of the lignin structure on the defibration energy. Especially, the relative contents of the guaiacyl moieties in the wood lignin seem to play a crucial role. The results showed that the higher the amount of guaiacyl structures in the lignin, especially in the middle lamella between the fibers, the higher the specific energy consumption (SEC) in the APMP process. However, for the TMP process the correlation was not as clear. This is most probably due to the fact that in the APMP process the defibration takes place in the middle lamella while in the TMP process other mechanism prevails. However, in the samples with very low amount of guaiacyl structures, SEC decreased substantially also in the TMP process. A different approach was promoting fiber wall deconstruction via autohydrolysis of wood. The autohydrolysis process changed notably the mechanical properties of the Eucalyptus chips, with impressive SEC decrease. Although autohydrolysis was performed under mild temperature (120 oC), lignin structure was changed. This assumption was based on the characterization of the fiber surfaces via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results showed high coverage of the fiber surfaces with lignin, indicating that the defibration of autohydrolyzed Eucalyptus wood chips takes place along the middle lamella. This behavior differs from the traditional <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping,</b> where the rupture occurs mostly in the fiber wall (especially in the S 1 layer), being similar to chemimechanical processes. As a final step, traditional kraft pulping was performed, alongside with soda-anthraquinone (NaOH-AQ) pulping, with focus on the surface properties of the produced fibers, analyzed by SEM and XPS. The surface lignin content of NaOH-AQ pulp fibers was lower than that of the kraft counterpart. However, kraft pulp handsheets showed better physical and mechanical properties. XPS data (C 2 /C 3 ratio) strongly suggested, together with the pulp bulk chemical composition that xylan is more abundant on the surface of kraft fibers, probably enhancing their mechanical properties...|$|R
