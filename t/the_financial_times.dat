40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{modeling}} of <b>the</b> real <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series of <b>the</b> PX Index using linear and nonlinear volatility models. In the theoretical part the major terms and typical properties of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series are presented and it {{is followed by the}} theoretical description of the linear and nonlinear volatility models including a general volatility model building. The key part of this thesis is the practical application of chosen linear and nonlinear volatility models on the time series of log returns of the PX Index. By using the real data set we verify if the volatility models are really capable of explaining the theoretical properties of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series, such as volatility clustering, leptokurtic distribution and leverage effect...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the stylized facts in <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series is carried out. We find that, instead of the heavy tails in asset return distributions, the slow decay behaviour in autocorrelation functions of absolute returns is actually {{directly related to the}} degree of clustering of large fluctuations within <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series. We also introduce an index to quantitatively measure the clustering behaviour of fluctuations in these time series and show that big losses in financial markets usually lump more severely than big gains. We further give examples to demonstrate that comparing to conventional methods, our index enables one to extract more information from <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} half of 2011 analysts and the {{financial}} press widely reported that the currency war had ended or at least entered a lull, though speaking in July 2011 Guido Mantega told <b>the</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Times</b> that the conflict was still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{financial}} journalists {{agreed with}} Mantega's view, such as <b>the</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Times</b> Alan Beattie and The Telegraph's Ambrose Evans-Pritchard.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Times</b> {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates {{in each of the last}} three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent response rate. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by <b>the</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Times.</b> The survey responses are audited by KPMG.|$|E
30|$|However, {{all these}} {{researchers}} {{have raised the}} problem of high noise in <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series, {{as well as some}} <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series only possess poor information and small sample size. Predicting them with SVR directly is probably sensitive to the noise and may lead to overfitting.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} three {{strategies for}} <b>the</b> analysis of <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series based on time averaged observables. These comprise the time averaged mean squared displacement (MSD) {{as well as}} the ageing and delay time methods for varying fractions of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series. We explore these concepts via statistical analysis of historic time series for several Dow Jones Industrial indices for the period from the 1960 s to 2015. Remarkably, we discover a simple universal law for the delay time averaged MSD. The observed features of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series dynamics agree well with our analytical results for the time averaged measurables for geometric Brownian motion, underlying the famed Black-Scholes-Merton model. The concepts we promote here are shown to be useful for financial data analysis and enable one to unveil new universal features of stock market dynamics...|$|R
