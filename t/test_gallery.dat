40|$|ABSTRACT: Face {{recognition}} {{is one of}} the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding and has gained much attention in recent years. Various algorithms were proposed and research groups across the world reported different and often contradictory results when comparing them. The aim of this paper is to present an independent, comparative study of three most popular appearance-based face recognition projection methods (PCA, ICA, and LDA) in completely equal working conditions regarding preprocessing and algorithm implementation. We are motivated by the lack of direct and detailed independent comparisons of all possible algorithm implementations (e. g., all projection–metric combinations) in available literature. For consistency with other studies, FERET data set is used with its standard <b>tests</b> (<b>gallery</b> and probe sets). Our results show that no particular projection–metric combination is the best across all standard FERET tests and the choice of appropriate projection–metric combination can only be made for a specific task. Our results are compared to other available studies and some discrepancies are pointed out. As an additional contribution, we also introduce our new idea of hypothesis testing across all ranks when comparin...|$|R

In the frame of ERRA task A 5 - 'Safety and Security of underground hubs', and together will the annual main training event of the public volunteer first responders of the region Flums, Switzerland, an evacuation exercise was organized in the facilities of Hagerbach <b>Test</b> <b>Gallery.</b> Involved parties included the Rescue Service Center of Sankt Galien, both Heads of the regional Fire and Police Departments as well as two groups of visitors and the ERRA A 5 partners. For the iNTeg-Risk partners, the main objective of the exercise was to prove and evaluate the Emerging Risk Issues which have been defined in the first phase of ERRA A 5. In general, the evacuation exercise happens in two separate settings. The first one is the external, where persons are alerted, communicate and try to understand and react on a specific situation of emergency which happens in the second, the internal setting - the location of the complex facility. During the exercise, some activities or involved persons may change from the external to the internal setting or location. Consequently, they have access to other information and face problems different to the ones they had before. As a conclusion, all Emerging Risk Issues were proven through the evacuation exercise. In addition; criteria for the development of Key Performance Indicators have been identified {{as a result of the}} work done in ERRA A 5 and the evacuation exercise.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the final concept for the {{disposal}} of high-level radioactive waste (HAW) in boreholes drilled into salt formation plans were developed {{a couple of years}} ago for a full scale testing of the complete technical system of an underground repository. To satisfy the test objectives, thirty highly radioactive radiation sources were planned to be emplaced in six boreholes located in two <b>test</b> <b>galleries</b> at the 800 -m-level in the Asse salt mine. A duration of testing of approximately five years was envisaged. Because of licensing uncertainties the German Federal Government decided on December 3 rd, 1992 to stop all activities for the preparation of the test disposal immediately. In the course of the preparation of the test disposal, however, a system, necessary for handling of the radiation sources was developed and installed in the Asse salt mine and two non-radioactive reference tests with electrical heaters were started in November 1988. These tests served for the investigation of thermal effects in comparison to the planned radioactive tests. An accompanying scientific investigation programme performed in situ and in the laboratory comprises the estimation and observation of the thermal, radiation-induced, and mechanical interaction between the rock salt and the electrical heaters and the radiation sources, respectively. The laboratory investigations are carried out at Braunschweig (FRG), Petten (NL), Saclay (F) and Barcelona (E). As a consequence of the premature termination of the project the working programme was revised. The new programme agreed to by the project partners included a controlled shutdown of the heater tests in 1993 and a continuation of the laboratory activities until the end of 1994. (orig.)

Face recognition in uncontrolled conditions, such as in security camera footage presents two extra challenges. First, {{it is difficult to}} capture good quality images of faces in this setting.

High quality face images are captured using a foveated wide field sensor, in which a narrow-field camera is directed towards faces using information from a static wide-field camera.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIFace {{recognition}} {{is one of}} the most active areas of research in computer vision. Gabor features have been used widely in face identification because of their good results and robustness. However, the results of face identification strongly depend on how different are the <b>test</b> and <b>gallery</b> images, as is the case in varying face pose. In this paper, a new Gabor-based method is proposed which modifies the grid from which the Gabor features are extracted using a mesh to model face deformations produced by varying pose. Also, a statistical model of the scores computed by using the Gabor features is used to improve recognition performance across pose. Our method incorporates blocks for illumination compensation by a Local Normalization method, and entropy weighted Gabor features to emphasize those features that improve proper identification. The method was tested on the FERET and CMU-PIE databases. Our literature review focused on articles with face identification with wide pose variation.

40|$|Questions {{have been}} raised about the {{effectiveness}} of ventilation control devices (VCDs) to safely resist explosions during their intended life. This functionality depends on the ability of the VCDs and in particular seals to withstand changes in the behaviour of the strata, particularly where longwall abutments influence the stress regime in and around the chain pillars. As a consequence of an explosion impact on a seal, the surrounding strata could experience increased loads possibly resulting in permanent deformation and requiring grout consolidation. These aspects of seal design have been investigated using advanced numerical analysis. Globally since the early 20 th century, to protect underground personnel, ventilation seal designs have been required to be tested at an internationally recognized explosion <b>test</b> <b>gallery</b> to achieve pressure ratings required by legislation. The last two decades has seen advances in materials technology and engineering of structures. It has become accepted practice to use numerical methods to provide engineering ratings for mine seals in line with other industries where the elimination of prototype testing provides more rapid product introduction to the market. Before presenting the results of numerical analysis, structural aspects of seal design are simply explained including arching behaviour and the contribution of dynamic magnification due to impact loads. High-fidelity physics-based computer simulations using software LS-DYNA were able to predict the results from physical testing of mine based seals in a most realistic way.

40|$|Thanks to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), {{museums are}} {{experiencing}} a longawaited redisplay renaissance {{in the early}} 21 st century. The thesis, prompted by the observed renaissance, explores and examines the factors and processes involved in the redevelopment of biological displays in British museums. Using a qualitative, grounded theory methodology and analytic process, the research focuses on three case study museums; Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow, the Great North Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne, and the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter. Informed by preliminary research, the main study employs the semi-structured interview method to collect primary data from key project team members. To triangulate findings from the interviews, and develop an overarching theory, complementary primary and secondary data was also collected {{in the form of}} project reports, meeting minutes, photographs, etc. The findings demonstrate that 'accepting change' in the museum is key to the redisplay of biological collections. The single most important change in these redevelopments has been the approach to the redisplay process; namely the shift from the curator-driven model to the team approach. This has, singlehandedly, transformed the key elements of the process; decision-making and communication, whilst introducing the important element, teamwork. By applying a team approach, powers of decision making are shared across team members and work progresses more rapidly. It also ensures that the final gallery incorporates the educational, design, conservation and curatorial aspects. The driving factors were also uncovered {{in the course of the}} research. Categorised as internal and external factors, some were more influential than others; the collections and project team members (internal) and the audience and funders (external) proved particularly influential in early stages of the three projects.

40|$|Until {{the early}} 1980 s, mine face {{ventilation}} systems {{were designed for}} ventilating cutting depths up to 20 feet. Since that time, use of remotely operated mining machines have allowed cutting depths to increase to 40 ft, increasing concerns about the effects on methane levels at the mine face area. The principles for efficient methane control during deeper cutting remained the same, namely: 1. Move a sufficient quantity of intake air {{from the end of}} the tubing or curtain to the face. 2. Mix intake air with methane gas liberated at the face. 3. Move methane contaminated air away from the face. However, when cutting to depths greater than 20 ft (known as deep-cut mining), airflow quantities reaching the face area often decreased because it was difficult to maintain tubing or brattice setback distances. Earlier research showed that use of machine-mounted scrubbers and water sprays increased airflow at the face area during deep cutting. NIOSH research examined how these and other factors affected face airflow. A full-scale ventilation <b>test</b> <b>gallery</b> was used to study how different operating conditions caused airflow patterns and methane distributions near the face to vary. The research results showed that during deep-cut mining: 1. Without additional controls, only a small percentage of the air delivered to the end of the tubing or curtain reached the face area. 2. Operation of a machine-mounted scrubber increased airflow and reduced methane levels at the face area as long as the quantity of intake air delivered to the end of the curtain or tubing was not reduced. 3. Operation of water sprays did not significantly increase the volume of air reaching the face but did improve mixing of methane and intake air at the face. Methane monitoring requirements remained the same for deep cutting, but the possibility of rapidly changing conditions at the face increases the need for accurate estimates of face methane concentration. Research examined currently available instrumentation and sampling methods for monitoring methane at the face. The results from this NIOSH research program demonstrate how existing and new engineering controls can be used to (educe face methane levels. The sampling methods that were investigated can provide better ways to measure methane levels near the front of the continuous mining machine. In this report several practical guidelines are recommended for controlling and monitoring methane levels in the face areas of underground coal mines. Most of the recommendations were based on studies conducted in the NIOSH ventilation <b>test</b> <b>gallery.</b> 1. Free-standing fans can be used to ventilate empty headings in coal mines; a) The fan nozzle should be designed to provide maximum throw distance. b) Recirculation should be minimized by proper placement of fan inlet and or by placing curtains partway across the entry. 2. With blowing systems, the single most important factor on face methane dilution is the velocity of the air directed toward the face; a) For the same airflows, use of tubing rather than a curtain usually provides better control of face methane, especially at longer setback distances. 3. With blowing and exhausting systems, and with the mining machine at the face, use of scrubbers increases the amount of intake airflow reaching the mining face; a) Scrubber and spray systems should be designed to achieve efficient face ventilation for the effective removal of gas from the face. 4. Measurement of airflow speed and direction between the curtain and the face helps to predict methane concentrations in the face area; a) In empty entries, airflow velocity is much lower in narrower entries. More airflow should be provided during box cuts to prevent higher methane levels. 5. Regardless of intake flow quantity, increasing scrubber flow will reduce face methane levels if recirculation is controlled. Recirculation can be controlled by; a) Minimizing leakage around the ventilation curtain; b) Directing scrubber exhaust away from the blowing curtain. With exhaust systems the mouth of the curtain should always be outby the scrubber exhaust. 6. Water sprays on the mining machine should be directed to provide the best airflow across the entire face. 7. Methanometer response times can be measured using either of two techniques developed by NIOSH. Instruments with shorter response times more accurately measure current methane levels. Dust cap design has the greatest effect on response times; a) When selecting a methanometer the dust cap design should be examined. The cap should protect the methane sensor from dust and water but not significantly increase the response time. 8. Alternative methane sampling locations on the mining machine should be compared and selected based on the relative protection provided to the face workers. 9. Mine personnel should be provided with methane monitors that can be worn while working in areas that cannot be regularly monitored. Audible, visual, and vibratory alarms for the monitors should be evaluated based on the environment in which the instruments are used. 10. Miners must be safely removed from a mine without exposure to excessive methane following stoppage of a main fan; a) Mines should be evaluated for the most likely area where methane gas can accumulate following stoppage of a main mine fan. 11. In areas between the mouth of the ventilation curtain and the face, airflow direction is constantly changing and it is difficult to accurately measure flow velocity with a single-axis anemometer (e. g., a vane anemometer); a) Following approval for underground use, multi-axis anemometers should be used to monitor airflow direction and velocity between the mouth of the ventilation curtain or tubing and the face. Multi-axis instruments should also be used to monitor flow at locations outby the mining face. 12. During roof bolting, if it is not practical to monitor methane levels at the mining face, methane levels should be measured with a bolter machine-mounted monitor and a detector held 16 ft inby the last row of bolts using a extensible pole.

40|$|The Wider {{system is}} a newly {{developed}} computer-assisted image-processing device for both bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. It has been adapted {{to be able to}} read and interpret commercial MicroScan panels. Two hundred forty-four fresh consecutive clinical isolates (138 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 25 nonfermentative gram-negative rods [NFGNRs], and 81 gram-positive cocci) were tested. In addition, 100 enterobacterial strains with known β-lactam resistance mechanisms (22 strains with chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase, 8 strains with chromosomal class A β-lactamase, 21 broad-spectrum and IRT β-lactamase-producing strains, 41 extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing strains, and 8 permeability mutants) were <b>tested.</b> API <b>galleries</b> and National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution methods were used as reference methods. The Wider system correctly identified 97. 5 % of the clinical isolates at the species level. Overall essential agreement (± 1 log 2 dilution for 3, 719 organism-antimicrobial drug combinations) was 95. 6 % (isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 96. 6 %; NFGNRs, 88. 0 %; gram-positive cocci, 95. 6 %). The lowest essential agreement was observed with Enterobacteriaceae versus imipenem (84. 0 %), NFGNR versus piperacillin (88. 0 %) and cefepime (88. 0 %), and gram-positive isolates versus penicillin (80. 4 %). The category error rate (NCCLS criteria) was 4. 2 % (2. 0 % very major errors, 0. 6 % major errors, and 1. 5 % minor errors). Essential agreement and interpretive error rates for eight β-lactam antibiotics against isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae with known β-lactam resistance mechanisms were 94. 8 and 5. 4 %, respectively. Interestingly, the very major error rate was only 0. 8 %. Minor errors (3. 6 %) were mainly observed with amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefepime against extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing isolates.

Contrary to initial expectations, the NO/sub x/ (= NO + NO/sub 2 /) fumes from the large <b>gallery</b> <b>test</b> were found to be in essential agreement with the Crawshaw-Jones results. It was also concluded that TIGER calculations offer a good approach to the prediction of toxic fumes; there is a basic problem in extrapolating laboratory measurements of CO fumes to mine conditions, this being due to postdetonation oxidation of CO to CO/sub 2 /; and the detonation velocity decay rate of an explosive is a useful experimental parameter for correlating toxic fumes production with nonideal detonation behavior.

40|$|Books in Common’ and ‘Olympia’ are two ‘newspapers’ {{that address}} {{different}} aspects of Gunning’s Kenneth Armitage Foundation (KAF) Fellowship 2011 - 2013. They are published and distributed by Matt’s Gallery, {{with support from the}} KAF. During the residency, Gunning lived and worked in what was the house and studio of the sculptor Kenneth Armitage (1916 – 2002). Living in what was Kenneth Armitage’s domestic and professional space, her activity was in relation to a living museum and archive. The two newspapers focus on the specificity of the artist’s studio/house, which Gunning used to explore ways in which the social, cultural and political values from the past both inform the present and are radically altered. The overall project title ‘Anvil Gantry Vice’ was Gunning’s response to the somewhat obsolete, although defining, equipment in the studio. Ideas of an artists’ studio are negotiated as our relationship to materiality changes. Armitage and the previous residents of the studio had a relationship to sculpture that privileged the ‘object’ with no consideration of its ‘expanded field’ – in contrast, the studio for Gunning is ‘subject matter’ as well as a space for making, a <b>testing</b> ground, a <b>gallery,</b> a performance space and a platform for exchange...|$|R
