James Harden is the other player to record more than one 50-point triple double with two in the same season. It is more <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> that Wilt Chamberlain recorded many 50-point triple-doubles during his historic 1961-62 NBA season, but they remain unofficial, as steals and blocked shots were not yet recorded as official statistics.|$|E

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, it is more <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It {{is possible that the}} territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E
5|$|Johnson wrote a {{considerable}} part of Irene in 1737 while teaching at Edial Hall School, the academy he had founded in 1735. Johnson spent his evenings {{working on his}} play while ignoring his wife Elizabeth (known as Tetty). This provoked David Garrick, his student, to perform a skit mocking the incidents, although the incidents he portrayed were more <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> his own fabrications. However, the play was written mostly for Mrs. Johnson; she was fond of it and {{hoped it would be}} a success. Her belief in the play inspired Johnson to finish it and push to have it performed. When Edial Hall failed, Johnson travelled to London and brought the unfinished manuscript with him. In 1737, Johnson tried to submit Irene to Charles Fleetwood, the owner-manager of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, but Fleetwood rejected it on the grounds that there was no patron and his theatre was catering to other types of performances. Johnson tried in 1741 to have the unperformed play printed, but this too failed. He seems to have continued to revise it over the next several years, since a manuscript notebook contains draft material made not earlier than June 1746.|$|E

50|$|The {{dependency}} constraint {{creates a}} structure (syntax) in which any {{word of the}} appropriate class can be an argument for a given operator.

Thus, John wears hats is more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> John wears snow {{which in turn is}} more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> John wears vacation. The likelihood constraint creates meaning (semantics) by defining each word in terms of the words it can take as arguments, or of which it can be an argument.|$|R

25|$|CBS' {{first year}} of Major League Baseball postseason {{coverage}} in general, proved to be problematic for the network. First and foremost, none of the teams involved in the ALCS (Boston and Oakland), NLCS (Cincinnati and Pittsburgh), and World Series (Cincinnati and Oakland) involved teams from baseball's largest media markets. This more <b>than</b> <b>likely,</b> helped reduce playoff ratings by 9.4% for prime time games and 3.4% for weekend daytime games. This was below the levels of the playoffs the year before, when they aired on NBC.|$|E

25|$|Aminopeptidase N has {{the same}} ability to {{interact}} with plant lectins C-type mannose-binding and {{also serves as a}} receptor for a retrovirus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE, aminopetidase A and aminopeptidase N have cascading actions in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which suggests a common phylogenetic origin between these molecules. Some advanced studies have shown a high homology between the Aminopeptidase N and the Angiotensin-converting enzyme. It is more <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> that the unknown FCoV serotype I receptor {{is also a member of}} this receptor family and acts with mannose binding lectins.|$|E
25|$|The final {{variation}} of the globe was introduced on 7 July 1968 and was {{a variation on the}} watchstrap theme.

It is unknown whether a new clock design accompanied the look, however it is more <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> that the clock was modified. The newer globe look appears to use the same model as the previous looks but with a modified legend and background, however we can't be certain.|$|E

The Whitlam Government, using the race power, enacted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 to override the State laws and eliminate racial discrimination against Aboriginal people. No federal government ever enforced this Act.|$|E

25|$|Hemphill style pottery spans {{most of the}} 14th and {{the first}} half of the 15th century CE In this time period there were more <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> only a few potters working in this style at any one time and in some cases archaeologists have found {{signature}} features that suggest a specific potter made multiple known examples. Archaeologists have also dated the ceramics and found that the most expertly made pieces were done in the 14th century. These earlier pieces also show more influences from outside thematic sources, specifically early Walls Phase and late Braden style shell engravings from the Central Mississippi Valley. As the 15th century progressed, less competency is shown by the potters, which may indicate that less importance was attached to this particular artform.|$|E
25|$|Versions of {{the life}} of young Thaddeus vary.

It is confused about his life around the age of ten whether his mother had died and Clovis married Mary Randall, or if Lowe was sent away to another farm during which time his mother died and his father remarried. He apparently did work for another farm owned by the Plaisted’s, but whether or not he lived there is uncertain. Clovis and Mary had seven more children, but there is a timeline confusion that may indicate she already had children when she married Clovis.|$|E
25|$|Rain ravaged {{the match}} between Somerset and Lancashire {{allowing}} little {{play on the}} first three days. Between the showers, Lancashire had Somerset at 48 for 2 on the first day, but the little play that was possible after that gave Mike Burns (87) and Sanath Jayasuriya (72 not out after three days) opportunity to increase the score to 195 for 3 on day 3. A draw looked more <b>than</b> <b>likely,</b> even if the sides would agree to forfeiting an innings. The fourth day was {{a full day of}} cricket, and Muttiah Muralitharan took five for 56 for Lancashire as they bowled Somerset out for 294. Iain Sutcliffe then lifted Lancashire to four batting points and 351 for 3 declared with his 150, well helped by an unbeaten century from Australian Brad Hodge.|$|E
