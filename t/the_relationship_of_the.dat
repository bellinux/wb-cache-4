5|$|Alice's sister, Melisende, Fulk's wife, persuaded Fulk {{to allow}} Alice {{to return to}} Antioch in 1135.

5|$|Historians in the 16th and 17th centuries {{focused on}} Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward's reign {{and the events}} surrounding <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duc d'Épernon and Henry III of France, and between the Duke of Buckingham and Charles I. In {{the first half of}} the 19th century, popular historians such as Charles Dickens and Charles Knight popularised Edward's life with the Victorian public, focusing on the King's relationship with his favourites and, increasingly, alluding to his possible homosexuality. From the 1870s onwards, however, open academic discussion of Edward's sexuality was circumscribed by changing English values. By the start of the 20th century, English schools were being advised by the government to avoid overt discussion of Edward's personal relationships in history lessons. Views on Edward's sexuality have continued to develop over the years.|$|E

5|$|Managers in the Premier League are {{involved}} in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e. more than 12 weeks – the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities and in part on <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{note that}} Tibetan leaders during the Ming frequently engaged in {{civil war and}} conducted their own foreign diplomacy with neighboring states such as Nepal. Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming dynasty's shortage of horses for warfare and thus {{the importance of the}} horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant religious nature of <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ming court with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. In hopes of reviving the unique relationship of the earlier Mongol leader Kublai Khan (r.1260–1294) and his spiritual superior Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280) of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Yongle Emperor (r.1402–1424) made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with Deshin Shekpa (1384–1415), the Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu school. However, the Yongle Emperor's attempts were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure and}} brutal {{suppression}} of Muhammad and Ibrahim's revolt {{was followed by}} a large-scale reprisal campaign against the Alids, many of whom were imprisoned or killed, until the death of al-Mansur brought about another period of attempts at conciliation under al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), which ended after another Alid uprising in 786. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abbasids with the Alids remained troubled: periods of repression, usually following pro-Alid revolts, were alternated with periods of relative tolerance. Although al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) at one point nominated an Alid, Ali ibn Musa al-Rida, as his heir during the Fourth Fitna, this move was not followed up, and under Ma'mun's successors, the two families became completely estranged. Of Muhammad's sons and brothers, many fled the Abbasid persecution to the remoter corners of the Caliphate, where they sometimes succeeded in establishing local dynasties, e.g. the Idrisids of Morocco, founded by Muhammad's brother Idris, or the Alavids in Tabaristan.|$|E
5|$|The family Picidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820.

The Picumninae is returned as paraphyletic.|$|E
