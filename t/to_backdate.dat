500|$|Henry {{dismissed}} the mercenaries in his force, retaining {{only a small}} core of local soldiers to form the [...] "Yeomen of his Garde", and proceeded to establish his rule of England. Parliament reversed his attainder and recorded Richard's kingship as illegal, although the Yorkist king's reign remained officially {{in the annals of}} England history. The proclamation of Edward IV's children as illegitimate was also reversed, restoring Elizabeth's status to a royal princess. [...] The marriage of Elizabeth, the heiress to the House of York, to Henry, the master of the House of Lancaster, marked the end of the feud between the two houses and the start of the Tudor dynasty. The royal matrimony, however, was delayed until Henry was crowned king and had established his claim on the throne firmly enough to preclude that of Elizabeth and her kin. [...] Henry further convinced Parliament <b>to</b> <b>backdate</b> his reign to the day before the battle, [...] enabling him retrospectively to declare as traitors those who had fought against him at Bosworth Field. [...] Northumberland, who had remained inactive during the battle, was imprisoned but later released and reinstated to pacify the north in Henry's name. [...] The purge of those who fought for Richard occupied Henry's first two years of rule, although later he proved prepared to accept those who submitted to him regardless of their former allegiances.|$|E
500|$|Nash {{was convicted}} of the Roscommon murders in October 1998 and sentenced to life imprisonment. In July 1998 the Garda {{recommended}} charging him for the Grangegorman murders, and in September 1999 the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) said this should be done when the Book of Evidence was complete. In November 2000, shortly after Lyons' death, the DPP and Garda agreed that no charges should be brought against Nash in the shot term, but the case would remain open. As Nash was already in prison, the urgency was less, and pressure of other work meant the Forensic Science Laboratory was slow to test items of evidence. In July 2009, a [...] "spectacular breakthrough" [...] came when new DNA tests showed the victims' blood on Nash's jacket. Nash was formally charged with the murders in October 2009. He launched a legal challenge, claiming excessive delay and negative publicity would prevent a fair trial. This was rejected by Michael Moriarty in the High Court in 2012, and confirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court in January 2015. In March 2015, Nash was put on trial for the murders. In April he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The judge refused <b>to</b> <b>backdate</b> the sentence to the direction to charge Nash or his original arrest in 1999. The jury was excused from jury service for life.|$|E

2500|$|According to the SEC {{indictment}} against Annette Bongiorno and Joann Crupi, two {{back office}} workers {{who worked for}} Madoff, they created false trading reports based on the returns that Madoff ordered for each customer. For example, when Madoff determined a customer's return, one of the back office workers would enter a false trade report with a previous date and then enter a false closing trade in the amount required to produce the required profit, according to the indictment. Prosecutors allege that Bongiorno used a computer program specially designed <b>to</b> <b>backdate</b> trades and manipulate account statements. They quote her as writing to a manager in the early 1990s [...] "I need the ability to give any settlement date I want." [...] In some cases, returns were allegedly determined before the account was even opened.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1974 Bjelke-Petersen outmanoeuvred Whitlam {{after the}} prime {{minister}} offered Democratic Labor Party senator Vince Gair, a bitter opponent of the government, the position of ambassador to Ireland {{as a way of}} creating an extra vacant Senate position in Queensland. Whitlam, who lacked a majority in the Senate, hoped Gair's seat would be won by his Labor Party. But when the arrangement was disclosed by newspapers before Gair had resigned from the Senate, Bjelke-Petersen's colleagues in Canberra immediately devised a strategy in which Gair's seat would be declared a casual vacancy, allowing the Queensland government to fill the vacancy until the next federal election, thus blocking the ALP move to control the Senate. In Canberra, the Opposition conspired to keep Gair away from the Senate President (to whom Gair had not yet give his resignation) and ensured he voted in a Senate debate late that night to avoid any move <b>to</b> <b>backdate</b> the resignation. At 5.15pm the Queensland Cabinet met to pass a [...] "flying minute" [...] and advised the Governor, Sir Colin Hannah, to issue writs for five, rather than six, vacancies, denying Labor the chance of gaining Gair's Senate spot. Labor argued that Gair's appointment, and hence his departure from the senate, was effective from no later than when the Irish government accepted his appointment, in March. [...] This was a matter of protracted debate in the Senate over many days, and was never resolved, but it was rendered irrelevant when Whitlam called a double dissolution of both Houses, in an election gamble he only narrowly won.|$|E

50|$|When company {{executives}} {{discovered that they}} had the ability <b>to</b> <b>backdate</b> stock option grants, thus making them both tax deductible and “in the money” on the date of actual issuance, the common practice of stock option backdating for financial gain began on a widespread level.
