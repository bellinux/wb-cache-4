Further down the Ohio, Clark stopped at the mouth of the Kanawha River, but again he decided to keep moving in order to prevent desertion. Clark left a letter fastened to a pole which instructed Lochry to keep following.|$|E
5|$|As {{promotion}} for the show, Showtime {{posted a}} preview of the pilot on their website. In September 2006, CBS and YouTube struck a strategic content and advertising partnership, and the YouTube CBS Brand Channel started including daily contributions from the Showtime network, including promotional video clips from its critically acclaimed original series, such as Dexter. On October 28, after the first few episodes had aired, Showtime made it easier for viewers <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the show by dedicating a whole night to showing the first five episodes.|$|E

5|$|In their spare time, {{crews were}} able <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> work, observe the Earth below, respond to letters, {{drawings}} {{and other items}} brought from Earth (and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard Mir), or {{make use of the}} station's ham radio. Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{was unaware}} that his latest letters had {{galvanised}} the British authorities into action. They had hitherto been content with merely monitoring his communications but the militarily significant content {{of his most}} recent letters caused them to consider him now {{to be a serious}} threat. It did not take them long <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him. His lack of even basic security precautions had left the authorities with a trail of clues that enabled them to track him down in less than a day.|$|E
5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We looked at it as a chance <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> our obscenity quota.|$|E
25|$|While their hind limbs are {{unfit for}} {{locomotion}} on land, elephant seals use their fins as support to propel their bodies. They {{are able to}} propel themselves quickly (as fast as 8km/h) in this way for short-distance travel, to return <b>to</b> water, <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a female or chase an intruder.|$|R

50|$|Despite its {{commercial}} success and early achievements, Seiberling failed <b>to</b> adapt and <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the market changes, {{especially with the}} arrival of foreign companies who were quick to introduce the radial tire.|$|R
5|$|The relief {{force of}} Clinton and Grey arrived at Newport on 1 September. Given {{that the threat}} was over, Clinton instead ordered Grey to raid several {{communities}} on the Massachusetts coast. Admiral Howe was unsuccessful in his bid <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> d'Estaing, who held a strong position at the Nantasket Roads when Howe arrived there on 30 August. Admiral Byron, who succeeded Howe {{as head of the}} New York station in September, was also unsuccessful in blockading d'Estaing: his fleet was scattered by a storm when it arrived off Boston, while d'Estaing sailed away, bound for the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the Naruto storyline, known as Part II, encapsulates all the {{chapters}} following chapter 244; specifically chapters 245-700, and is set {{two and a half years}} after the end of the Part I storyline. The English adaptation of Part II began serialization in the American Shonen Jump on December 4, 2007, and the first volume was released on March 4, 2008. <b>To</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Japanese serialization, Viz Media released eleven volumes from Part II between February and April 2009, after which it began releasing Naruto on a quarterly basis.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E
50|$|The HSBB project, {{which is}} the {{flagship}} of the National Broadband Initiative (NBI), is hoped <b>to</b> help Malaysia <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> countries such as Japan, Korea and Singapore, which have high speed broadband at relatively low prices.|$|R
50|$|Since 2006 Bachmann {{has been}} concentrating on {{implementing}} a Digital Command Control ("DCC") system and products in its product lines, {{with the help}} and partnership of the German company, Lenz Elektronik, GmbH. Bachmann released its Dynamis DCC system in 2007 which enabled Bachmann <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> technologically <b>with</b> other DCC companies. Currently Bachmann HO Spectrum lines are DCC on board, while {{the vast majority of}} its N Spectrum lines are DCC-ready.|$|R
50|$|While {{devising a}} plan <b>to</b> finally <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> God and {{challenge}} Him, Jesse {{realized that he}} would be putting Tulip in danger once more.

5|$|In 550, Artabanes was {{appointed}} magister militum per Thracias {{and sent to}} replace the aged senator Liberius in command of an expedition under way against Sicily, which had recently been overrun by the Ostrogoth king Totila. Artabanes failed <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the expedition before it sailed for Sicily, and his own fleet was driven back and scattered by severe storms in the Ionian Sea. Eventually he arrived in Sicily and took command of the Byzantine forces there. He besieged the Gothic garrisons left behind by Totila {{after he left the}} island and soon forced them to surrender. Over the next two years, he remained in Sicily. According to Procopius, the inhabitants of the mainland city of Croton, which was being besieged by the Goths, repeatedly sent to him for help, but he did nothing.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after returning, Heather {{slips into}} a trance so John makes his excuses and quickly leaves. Upon {{coming out of}} it she pleads with her sister to go after John, sensing that {{something}} terrible is about to happen, but Wendy is unable <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him. Meanwhile, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red and this time pursues it. He corners the elusive figure in a deserted palazzo and approaches it, believing it to be a child. Instead, it is revealed to be a hideous female dwarf, and while John is frozen in terror the dwarf pulls out a meat cleaver and cuts his throat. As the life drains from him, John realises too late that the strange sightings he has been experiencing were premonitions of his own murder and funeral.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man tries <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him {{and notices}} him sneaking into his friend Harry's apartment.

Spider-Man is forced to slip out after Harry walks in, and misses Harry drinking an experimental, drug-like formula. A short while later, Peter Parker calls Harry and invites him to a Bleecker Street Halloween carnival along with Gwen, Mary Jane and Liz. Harry accepts the invitation. On his way to the carnival, Peter attempts to sell some Spider-Man photographs to Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson, but he refuses and tells him to try selling them to the Globe.|$|E

50|$|As {{technology}} and satellite {{started to take}} off and expand, KUAM began <b>to</b> gradually <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{the rest of the}} continental United States. The station now follows the complete NBC schedule, but on a Tuesday through Monday pattern rather than the traditional Monday-Sunday pattern, with the exception of NBC's sports lineup, which is live {{in the early morning hours}} of Sunday (for all Saturday games and events) and Monday (for all Sunday games and events).|$|R

Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives in his neck are neutralized.|$|E
5|$|Their semi-final was {{a rematch}} of the 1966 Football League Cup Final, with West Ham United the {{opposition}} over two legs. Albion took a commanding {{lead in the}} first leg with a 4–0 victory, a goal from Dennis Clarke and a hat-trick from Jeff Astle. West Ham captain Bobby Moore urged his team to push Albion hard in the second leg, even in the closing stages of the match when they still had all four goals from the first leg <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with.</b> Goals from Geoff Hurst and Johnny Byrne for West Ham were cancelled out by goals from Stanley Jones and Clarke by the 60th minute. The match finished with 2–2, thus Albion progressed due to a 6–2 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|A raid on Amman was {{the next}} {{operation}} for the regiment. The ANZAC Mounted Division, the 60th (London) Division and the ICCB would all take part. On 13 March the regiment started back to the Jordan Valley, through heavy rain. Orders for the raid were issued; the brigade would advance on mountain tracks via the village of Ain Es Sir, then to Amman. The rains continued postponing the raid {{and it was not}} until 01:30 on 24 March that the brigade crossed the River Jordan, by pontoon bridge at Hajlah. At 09:30 the regiment, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and the 181st (2/6th London) Brigade started clearing the area between the river and the foothills. At 11:25 they charged and captured three artillery pieces. The brigade advance continued at 15:00, without the 6th Squadron which remained behind to assist the 181st Brigade in their assault on Es Salt. Still negotiating the mountain track, it started to rain again at 18:00 and the brigade camped for the night; starting again next morning they reached Ain Es Sir just after midday. There they were forced to stop and wait for their supplies <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> them.|$|E

50|$|Having <b>to</b> play <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the frontrunners among {{internet}} {{newspapers and}} with its particularly left-leaning viewpoint even among progressive media, VOP struggled {{to survive in the}} South Korean internet news distribution market dominated by powerful portals. However, much due to the successful distribution via global social network services, VOP has made market growth. According to a 2014 report issued by the conservative South Korean ruling party think tank, Saenuri Party's Yoido Institute, VOP was the fourth most often quoted news source in Facebook in the nation.|$|R

5|$|After {{the failure}} of the 26th Corps at Hagaru-ri, the PVA High Command ordered the 26th and the 27th Corps to chase the {{escaping}} UN force with the 20th Corps blocking the escape route. But with most of the 20th Corps destroyed at Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the only forces between Koto-ri and Hungnam were the remnants of the 58th and the 60th Divisions. In desperation, Song Shi-Lun ordered these troops to dig in at Funchilin Pass while blowing up the vital treadway bridge, hoping the terrain and obstacles would allow the 26th and the 27th Corps <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the retreating UN forces. The PVA 180th Regiment that occupied Hill 1081 blew up the original concrete bridge and two improvised replacements in succession, believing the bridge was rendered irreparable. In response, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines (1/1) attacked Hill 1081 from the south, and the hill was captured on 9 December after the defenders fought to the last man. At the same time, the 7th Marines and RCT-31 attacked the treadway bridge from the north, only to encounter defenders that were already frozen in their foxholes.|$|E
5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. They asked the umpire to search the pitcher. Lavender refused to be searched and ran into the outfield, and the umpire refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|The Matriculation exam tested {{candidates}} on five subjects: Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Science, and English Literature. By exam-time this dedication to his studies had paid off spectacularly; the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, {{with the highest}} marks in the Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding; a misunderstanding {{at the start of}} the year led Jan to believe that he would be exempted from the Greek exam – as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before the exam this potentially devastating oversight was exposed – there was now less than a week in which <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a year’s study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar and vocabulary upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of the exam this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and had mastered the Greek language to a remarkable degree.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the launch}} of Sputnik on 4 October 1957, the U.S. was in a panic over how <b>to</b> quickly <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Soviets in what {{appeared}} to be a [...] "Space Race". One idea quickly gained currency [...] - [...] the formation of a civilian space agency that would evolve into NASA. The Army had already lost interest in the development of the Saturn due to a lack of mission requirements, and had agreed to turn over the ABMA team to NASA on 1 July 1960.|$|R
5000|$|IGN {{summed up}} its review by saying [...] "It may be shallow, but it's {{also the most}} {{engaging}} racing experience you'll find anywhere", but expressed its excitement in the potential of its sequel due to the strong foundations the original laid out. However, GameTrailers criticized the AI of the game saying {{it was based on}} a [...] "rubber-band" [...] principle which allowed computer drivers <b>to</b> easily <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the player regardless of the player's performance, but it praised the online gameplay of MotorStorm as well as its gameplay physics.|$|R
