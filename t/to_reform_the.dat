5|$|Garfield lingered for two-and-a-half {{months before}} dying on September 19, 1881. Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, {{was sworn in}} as {{president}} that night. Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> civil service—and Arthur, erstwhile member of the Conkling machine, joined the cause. In 1883, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E

5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> welfare system, adding {{changes such as}} work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} he took <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> {{government of the}} empire have been praised by historians. In the provinces, Andronikos' reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. Andronikos's fierce determination to root out corruption and many other abuses was admirable; under Andronikos, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. Every form of corruption was eliminated with ferocious zeal.|$|E
5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} the Austrian Emperor, had started <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), the military-political council {{responsible}} for decisionmaking in the Austrian armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular with the royal court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria {{decided to go to}} war with France.|$|E
5|$|Bucer's efforts <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> {{church in}} Wissembourg {{resulted}} in his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church, {{and he was}} forced to flee to Strasbourg. There he joined a team of reformers which included Matthew Zell, Wolfgang Capito, and Caspar Hedio. He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli, who differed on the doctrine of the eucharist. Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the Tetrapolitan Confession and the Wittenberg Concord, working closely with Philipp Melanchthon on the latter.|$|E

5|$|Days {{before the}} coup, fellow Lusophone country Angola {{announced}} its forces would be ending the two-year-old Angolan Military Mission in Guinea Bissau (MISSANG) that followed a similar failed {{effort by the}} European Union {{as part of the}} United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS). State-owned Angolan news agency ANGOP said that the Angolan troops were sent to Guinea-Bissau in March 2011 in accordance with a bilateral military agreement <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> armed forces. On 16 April, Guinea-Bissau Defense Minister Jorge Tolentino Araújo was scheduled to arrive in Angola to meet his counterpart Cândido Pereira dos Santos Van-Dúnem and the Army Chief-of-Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda. He was also expected to visit the Higher Warfare School (ESG) and the Higher Technical Military Institute (ISTM). The same day as the coup, the two Lusophone countries of Angola and Cape Verde agreed to review their defense cooperation agreements. Presidential candidate and former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior was also unpopular with the army for his attempts <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> institution.|$|E

5|$|Efforts made {{by local}} {{authorities}} in the Cluj-Napoca district {{at the end of}} the 1990s <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> protection of children's rights and assistance for street children proved insufficient due to lack of funding, incoherent policies and the absence of any real collaboration between the actors involved (Child Rights Protection Directorate, Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social Protection, Minors Receiving Centre, Guardian Authority within the City Hall, Police). There are numerous street children, whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with local law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|Formed in late 1853, the Conciliation cabinet {{faced the}} Parliament {{only when it}} {{gathered}} in May 1854. Paraná presented a bill <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> Code of Criminal Procedure, which had already been reformed in 1841. In search of support, Paraná {{went as far as}} to aid Liberal candidates in the 1854 provincial elections. The opposition by most saquaremas to this judicial reform was so fierce that a year later, Paraná (who had been raised from Viscount to Marquis in late 1854) backed down and implicitly withdrew the bill.|$|E

He attempted to control public spending and sought to increase the funding for education and healthcare. His economic strategy was market-based, attempting <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> welfare state through a tax credit scheme for poorer working families, and he assigned the Bank of England to set interest rates.|$|E

5|$|In 1244, Boniface {{rejected}} Robert Passelewe, who {{had been}} selected as Bishop of Chichester, {{on the grounds that}} Passelewe was illiterate. Boniface then nominated his own candidate, Richard of Chichester, and although the king objected, Pope Innocent IV confirmed Richard's election. In 1258, Boniface objected to the selection of Hugh de Balsham as Bishop of Ely, and tried to elevate Adam Marsh instead, but Hugh appealed to Rome, which upheld Hugh's election. Boniface held church councils <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> <b>the</b> clergy, in 1257 at London, in 1258 at Merton, and in 1261 at Lambeth.|$|E
5|$|In 446BC, quaestors, administrators {{with wide}} terms of reference, were first elected; {{and the office}} of censor was created to {{administer}} the census in 443BC.

5|$|In the Christian world {{prior to}} Galileo's {{conflict}} with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed either to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the earth {{was the center of}} the universe and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth, or the Tychonic system that blended geocentrism with heliocentrism.
