5|$|In November 1995, after abandoning {{development}} of a smaller version of the 777, Boeing {{announced that it was}} revisiting studies for a larger 767. The proposed 767-400X, a second stretch of the aircraft, offered a 12percent capacity increase versus the 767-300, and featured an upgraded flight deck, enhanced interior, and greater wingspan. The variant was specifically aimed at Delta Air Lines' pending replacement of its aging Lockheed L-1011 TriStars, and faced competition from the A330-200, a shortened derivative of the Airbus A330. In March 1997, Delta Air Lines launched the 767-400ER when it ordered <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>to</b> replace its L-1011 fleet. In October 1997, Continental Airlines also ordered the 767-400ER to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fleet. The type completed its first flight on October 9, 1999, and entered service with Continental Airlines on September 14, 2000.|$|E

5|$|While the Hornet Upgrade Program {{has been}} successful, the RAAF's Hornets are {{approaching}} retirement. It {{is expected that}} the aircraft will be increasingly expensive to operate as they age, and improvements to the fighter aircraft and air defences operated by other countries will reduce the Hornets' combat effectiveness. The Australian Government is currently planning to replace the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornets with Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighters from 2018 onwards. The Defence Materiel Organisation's Project AIR 6000 Phase 2A/B specifies that 72 F-35A fighters will be acquired to equip three squadrons and an operational training unit. No. 3 Squadron {{will be the first}} Hornet unit to be reequipped, commencing in 2018, and all of the F/A-18A and Bs are scheduled to be retired by 2023.

Okabe fails at first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does not go back to the time she came from, still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be able to go back far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is not <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>to</b> give up.

5|$|Deliveries of the Vengeances to Australia {{were much}} delayed. Following Australia's entry into Pacific War in December 1941, the RAAF order still stood at 297 Vengeances. These {{aircraft}} {{were scheduled to}} be delivered between January and December 1942. No Vengeances had arrived by 8 May 1942, though the RAAF's order had been increased to 367. A small number of the type arrived in Australia in late May 1942, but subsequent deliveries were slow. This was because the USAAF was also rapidly expanding at this time, which limited the number and types of aircraft available to its allies. Attempts by the Australian Government to obtain Vengeances from USAAF allocations in March 1942, when the country faced a possible Japanese invasion, were unsuccessful. The majority of the dive bombers arrived after April 1943; {{by this time the}} threat of invasion had passed. Overall, Australia received 15 Vengeances in 1942, 227 in 1943 and 100 during 1944.

Flight tests of the prototype continued up until 27 May 1954, by which point it had been found that the Proteus engine, once perfected, would be capable of enabling <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>to</b> achieve its envisioned performance figures.

The Potez 637 featured a glazed gondola located beneath the fuselage for an observer to be carried in the prone position. Some variants, such as the Potez 631 and 633, had a vertical bomb bay located between the two crew members.
