25|$|Mansell {{began to}} attack Senna {{and after the}} stops got ahead of him. There was trouble when Berger spun after his stop and {{lost a lot of}} time. After the stops, Mansell led Alesi (who planned to go without stopping), Senna, Piquet, a {{recovering}} Patrese and de Cesaris. Then on lap 22, Mansell slowed to a halt with an electrical failure, giving Alesi the lead of the race. Senna's engine then stopped for some time and because of that Piquet, Patrese and de Cesaris were right with him and allowing Alesi to remain in the lead. Senna was unable to pull away because he had gearbox troubles. On lap 31 — still intending <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>non-stop</b> — Alesi's engine blew up and Senna was back in the lead. Patrese tried to pass Piquet but went wide and de Cesaris was able to take third.|$|E
25|$|At first, the Metropolitan had {{advocated}} a new underground line roughly following {{the line of}} the Edgware Road between the tube station and a point near Willesden Green. Indeed, construction advanced as far as the rebuilding of Edgware Road station to accommodate 4 platforms of 8-car length. Things changed, though, with the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) and the subsequent absorption of the Metropolitan. The solution was now a new branch of the Bakerloo line from Baker Street to serve new stations at St. John's Wood and Swiss Cottage, thereby rendering the existing stations of Lord's, Marlborough Road and Swiss Cottage on the parallel route redundant, and negating the need for the Met's extension from Edgware Road station. It was originally proposed that Swiss Cottage (Metropolitan) would remain open during peak hours for interchange with the Bakerloo, and that Lord's station would open for special cricketing events, but both were closed permanently as economy measures during the Second World War. The new line rose between the Metropolitan tracks at Finchley Road, providing cross-platform interchange with the Metropolitan line. Continuing north to Wembley Park, the new Bakerloo was to provide intermediate service on the Metropolitan line, allowing Metropolitan line trains <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>non-stop</b> between Finchley Road and Wembley Park, cutting seven minutes from journey times. At Wembley Park, the new Bakerloo would run on to serve Kingsbury, Queensbury, Canons Park and Stanmore, taking over the former Metropolitan branch. The Bakerloo extension, built as above, opened in 1939.|$|E
50|$|Between 1888 and 1901 the G&SWR {{operated}} a slip coach service. The slip coach section was slipped at Irvine off the 4.15 pm St Enoch <b>to</b> Ayr, which <b>ran</b> <b>non-stop</b> from Paisley <b>to</b> Prestwick. The slip section {{was attached to}} an Ardrossan to Ayr stopping train, with which it followed the main train. Six-wheel brake vans with end windows were built for the service.|$|R
5000|$|Direct {{trains to}} Liverpool via Ormskirk (and also to [...] and East Lancashire) were {{withdrawn}} from Rufford station in October 1969, though Liverpool trains continued <b>to</b> <b>run</b> through <b>non-stop</b> until May {{of the following}} year. From July 1970, Rufford became the only passing point on the truncated Preston-Ormskirk branch line after the Midge Hall to Ormskirk section was singled. Over that same summer the station was rebuilt, with its wooden platforms and substantial station building demolished and replaced with more functional and basic facilities.|$|R
2500|$|They {{were the}} first Pacific-type {{locomotives}} on the VR, {{as well as its}} first 3-cylinder locomotive type. Renowned for their power and speed, in the ten years that followed their introduction the running time of the premier Sydney express service they operated was progressively reduced by one and a half hours. These service improvements culminated in 1937 with the replacement of the Sydney Limited with the Art Deco streamliner Spirit of Progress, and the Sclass locomotives were fitted with streamlined casings to match the new train set. They were also equipped with long-range tenders to enable the entire [...] journey <b>to</b> be <b>run</b> <b>non-stop</b> at a speed that remained for the next 20 years Australia's fastest train service.|$|R

50|$|Carluke is {{situated}} 6.5 mi from Junction 8 of the M74, 8 mi from Junction 6 of the M8 and 17 mi from the M80 at Cumbernauld, {{and is the}} meeting place of the A73 and A721 roads. The town also benefits from frequent direct rail services to Lanark, Motherwell, Hamilton and Glasgow and a recently enhanced bi-hourly service to Edinburgh (Sundays excepted) from Carluke railway station, less than a 10-minute walk from the town centre. There is a circular town bus route that connects the town centre with several local housing schemes. There are also regular bus services to Lanark, Wishaw, Motherwell, Hamilton and Glasgow {{as well as an}} hourly express coach service <b>to</b> Glasgow that <b>runs</b> <b>non-stop</b> from the outskirts of Motherwell via the M74, M73 and M8 motorways.|$|R

50|$|In September 1996 some morning peak {{journeys}} began <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>non-stop</b> via the new Limehouse Link {{instead of}} the A13. In May 1997, the Heathrow service was withdrawn again, and this time was not reinstated. On 7 September, route number X4 appeared for two morning journeys ex London which did not serve Basildon.|$|E

Later, Ghaziabad and Etawah were added as intermediate stops and from 9 July 2016 [...] Aligarh was also added.It is called Kanpur Reverse Shatabdi because it follows the reverse timetable of Lucknow Shatabdi; i.e. UP follows DOWN time table and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{a long-standing}} {{agreement}} between the competing West Coast and East Coast Main Line routes since the famous railway races of 1888 and 1895, speeds of the Scotch expresses were limited, {{the time for the}} 392 mi between the capitals being a pedestrian 8 hours 15 minutes. However, following valve gear modifications, the A1 locomotive's coal consumption was drastically reduced and it was thus found possible <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the service <b>non-stop</b> with a heavy train on one tender full of coal. Ten locomotives of classes A1 and A3, which were to be used on the service, were provided with corridor tenders; these avoided engine crew fatigue by enabling a replacement driver and fireman to take over halfway without stopping the train.|$|R

50|$|Because {{the station}} {{had been a}} {{terminus}} for the Metropolitan Railway the original junction layout on the route to London Marylebone included a sharp curve. This became inconvenient once some Great Central trains began <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>non-stop</b> through Aylesbury from 1899 onwards. Rather than change the junction layout to suit faster trains, a 15 mph speed restriction {{was applied to the}} curve.|$|E

Water troughs were installed at Halifax Junction, Ipswich and at Tivetshall St. Mary.|$|E
