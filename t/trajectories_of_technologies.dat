40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic study of rights {{restitution}} as {{an arrangement that}} establishes boundaries, and how those boundaries are translated, challenged, and exceeded. Following the guidelines of International Humanitarian Law and its version contained in the Law of Victims and Land Restitution (1448 / 2011), the Colombian government established a wide network of professionals in charge of registration and reparation for claimants registered as victims of the armed conflict (7, 999, 963 people in April 2016). In these procedures of recognition and reparation, technologies like forms and protocols become crucial for the mediation of rights restitution. As a starting point, I trace the <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> of recognition and reparation across assistance centres, governmental offices and sessions of psychosocial assistance. I am interested in functionaries and applicants’ experiences of forms and protocols, the procedures of recognition and reparation, and the circulation of official numbers as narratives of rights restitution. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies, a central concern of this thesis is to ask what technologies of recognition and reparation assemble. I interrogate the translation of experiences of pain and mobility into numbers and the circulation of those numbers by state representatives. I also explore some of the material forms of organisation developed by registered and unregistered interlocutors, as arrangements {{beyond the boundaries of}} state interventions. I describe how some of those alternative orders translate state interventions and enact spaces of material justice. Instead of reproducing the notion of reparation as a cornerstone of rights restitution in transitional justice societies, I suggest that a different sort of Reparation might occur beyond the boundaries of post-conflict statehood and within its intersections with alternative arrangements...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{terrorist}} acts, {{in particular}} the 9 - 11 attacks in 2001, have created disruptions in the global economy. The short-term impact had been felt in the global tourism, airline industries, {{as well as the}} financial markets. While the global economy has recovered and is adjusting to the new global realities, the longer-term impact of heightened security risk across the world can be felt in the form of higher risk premiums in asset markets, as well as a shift of resources towards dealing with terrorism. Just as World War II had accelerated the development of nuclear energy as well as a major contributing factor in the genesis of Silicon Valley, the current war against terrorism will affect both the pace and <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> trends, as efforts are focused on developing technologies to combat terrorism.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{question}} the claims {{made for a}} ‘coming era of nanotechnology’ and the ethical challenges, it is argued, that are entailed by this particular technological revolution. I argue that such futurist claims are sustained by an untenable modernist narrative which separates the technical and the social. This is exemplified {{by the work of}} K.

The problem then, on the basis of knowledge about the future state <b>of</b> <b>technology,</b> is to make choices now which will forestall unintended and undesirable consequences. Firstly, the paper argues for a radical scepticism towards all forms of forecasting or prediction but especially technological forecasting of the type exemplified in the debate around nanotechnology. Secondly, given this radical scepticism the paper criticises the idea that a prospective ethics can be created on the basis of an assessment of consequences of nanotechnology...|$|R

40|$|The {{competitive}} environment for most firms {{has been transformed}} by global competition, rapid changes in technology and shorter product life cycles. Innovation has become critical for survival in this {{competitive environment}}. The telecommunication industry is {{the best example of}} a dynamic global market environment.

40|$|Housing in the UK {{accounts}} for 30. 5 % of all energy consumed and {{is responsible for}} 25 % of all carbon emissions. The UK Government’s Code for Sustainable Homes requires all new homes to be zero carbon by 2016. The development and widespread diffusion of low and zero carbon (LZC) technologies is recognised as being a key solution for housing developers to deliver against this zero-carbon agenda. The innovation challenge to design and incorporate these technologies into housing developers’ standard design and production templates will usher in significant technical and commercial risks. In this paper we report early results from an ongoing Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council project looking at the innovation logic and <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> LZC <b>technologies</b> in new housing. The principal theoretical lens for the research is the socio-technical network approach which considers actors’ interests and interpretative flexibilities <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> and how they negotiate and reproduce ‘acting spaces’ to shape, in this case, the selection and adoption <b>of</b> LZC <b>technologies.</b> The initial findings are revealing the form and operation <b>of</b> the <b>technology</b> networks around new housing developments as being very complex, involving a range of actors and viewpoints that vary for each housing development...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} {{question}} <b>of</b> how the <b>technology</b> choices <b>of</b> automakers, {{responding to the}} regulatory obligations placed on them by policymakers, influence the <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> diffusion {{and the cost of}} compliance with CAFE Standards for Light Duty Vehicles (LDVs). Automakers have two main strategies to close the gap between current new vehicle fuel economy and the fuel economy mandated by CAFE: (1) deployment <b>of</b> fuel saving <b>technologies</b> to improve the fuel economy of conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; or (2) increasing the share of high-efficiency electric vehicles (EVs) in the sales mix. I develop a model of the LDV fleet to determine the long term CAFE target compatible with limit global warming to two degrees Celsius. I then use this result to study the options for automaker strategy, and I optimize the strategy for both the short term (2012 - 2025) and long term (2012 - 2050) compliance cost for two CAFE regulatory regimes. I find that the extent to which automakers use the two main compliance strategies impacts the cumulative cost of complying with the CAFE standards to 2025, the cost of meeting long-term climate change goals, and the pace at which EVs penetrate the U. S. fleet. Specifically, I find that early emphasis on EVs reduces the overall cost of CAFE compliance through 2050 by allowing automakers benefit from time-dependent learning feedbacks. Although the pace of EV penetration into the market varies with automaker strategy, the 2050 market share of EVs reaches or very nearly reaches 100 percent under a 2050 CAFE target that is compatible with limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius. by Samantha L.

For this objective, products have to be manufactured with proven quality and consistency {{to be accepted by}} the customers in, especially developed countries. Also it helps to spread the ancient wisdom of traditional knowledge of the country. The manufacturers should gain technological competences to ensure authenticity and efficacy, complying with quality and safety regulations, enhanced productivity and efficiency. The manufacturers, therefore, should regularly assess their position in the rapidly changing market environments, in order to keep abreast with competitors. Technology Assessment is a tool that can be used effectively to understand the current performance level of an organization and also to identify future <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology.</b> Out <b>of</b> the available models and frameworks for technological assessments, this study has used inputs from two models, namely the Technology Audit Model by Garcea- Areola and Outline of Innovation Management Audit by Tidd et al. These inputs have been used to develop a single model that can be effectively adaptable to herbal products industry. This study attempts to derive outcomes for useful recommendations to enhance innovative capabilities and competitive advantage of Sri Lankan Herbal Healthcare Industry. Accordingly the objectives of study are, i. Development of a model which includes guide lines for <b>technology</b> assessment <b>of</b> the herbal products industry in Sri Lanka ii.

This paper introduces, as an additional concern, society’s increased dependence on digitisation, which decreases society’s resilience in the face of possible localised or systemic disruptions to Web services. Given that technological progress is often envisaged as a future in which daily life is characterised by greater dependence on technology, this paper seeks to understand how this seemingly unsustainable trend is fostered by powerful associations between the notion of ‘progress’ and Post-Industrial conceptions of ‘meaning’. To determine how this specific understanding of progress has underpinned the current <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> technological development, we analyse Progress as a frame that encompasses a set of values, shown here to be in tension with environmental, social and spiritual sustainability.

40|$|This {{study is}} a sociological {{exploration}} {{of the work of}} engineering design. The data for this research were generated from a two-year ethnographic study of three engineering design projects within an Australian iron and steel producing company. This study provides an account of the activities undertaken, by engineers and others, during the design of human computer interfaces for process control. The study takes a symbolic interactionist perspective and acknowledges its criticisms. The study draws on Strauss 2 ̆ 7 s social worlds/arena theory, and Clarke 2 ̆ 7 s subsequent conceptualisation of the theory in an organisational context, to provide a broad set of sensitising concepts focussed on the interactive aspects of the construction of meaning amongst the social collectives involved in the process of engineering design. The findings of this study are organised around five interlinked and over lapping themes - <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> and work, design boundaries, engineering and operator social worlds, arenas in the process of design, and routine and non routine action. These themes reflect emergent concepts identified through the constant interplay between observation and analysis. The accounts given describe design negotiations riven through with ideologies of engineers, plant operators, and others, as individuals and as members of social collectives, such as occupational groups. I have come to understand these negotiations can be seen as battlefields with winners, losers, and only sometimes agreeable truces. These battles are conducted according to what appear to be predetermined rules of engagement that reflect - and define - who has power and over what elements of the battle that power can be exercised. The outcomes of these battles are design specifications that guide the 2 ̆ 7 trajectory 2 ̆ 7 <b>of</b> a <b>technology</b> from an initial concept toward its final shape.

40|$|Successful {{technological}} innovation frameworks {{are based on}} synergistic packages of technology-push and demand-pull measures. As the massive deployment of premature renewable energy technologies risks becoming very expensive, {{the debate on the}} optimal <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> renewable <b>technologies</b> should explicitly consider the balance between deployment incentives and R&D efforts. This paper explores this balance regarding wind and PV technology support in Europe. Based on rather conservative estimates, we calculate future deployment costs and compare these figures to the current public investments in PV and wind R&D. We find that, today, for each Euro spent on R&D to develop future technologies, 35 to 41 Euros are spent on the deployment <b>of</b> existing <b>technologies.</b> Furthermore, private PV and wind technology companies tend to underinvest in R&D for various reasons. In an alternative scenario, we assess the optimal R&D efforts for the PV and wind sectors based on a 7 % R&D-to-sales benchmark that is typical for engineering sectors. If public R&D efforts would increase according to this benchmark, and hence compensate for the private underinvestments in R&D, pull/push ratios between 6 and 8 could be achieved. This leads us to conclude that the current balance between deployment and R&D is far from optimal...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{development}} is {{an outcome of}} collective social processes among actors in different institutional fields. In the literature on technology development, there have been long debates regarding whether technology shapes social structure and order, or whether social forces determine the developmental <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology.</b> From a series of studies, I seek to understand the social dynamics <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> development {{in order to address}} theoretical tensions, both theoretically and empirically. Three separate yet related studies together provide a theoretical model and relevant empirical evidence for the linkages among actors, institutional logics and technologies. In Chapter 1 I first attempt to theorize about how actors, including scientists, engineers and technology users, collectively shape technological evolution in the general technology context. Combining the two perspectives [...] institutional logics and collective actions, I develop a theoretical model that addresses how scientists and engineers, faced with multiple institutional logics, strategically respond to the multiple institutional logics, and how the different formation of institutional logics can systematically lead to different types <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> development. In the theoretical model, I discuss four distinctive social mechanisms of framing institutional logics [...] replacing, patching, sequencing, and reinforcing, and the relationships between the social mechanisms and the types <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> development. In Chapter 2, building upon the theoretical model proposed in Chapter 1, I empirically investigate the emergence and decline of electric and hybrid drives in the community of electric vehicle researchers from 1969 - 2009. Combining the perspectives of institutional logics and social movements, I argue that an institutional logic is a product of collective social processes among actors in different institutional fields, and that established logics play an integral role in shaping the differential development <b>of</b> new <b>technology.</b> Empirical findings suggest that environmental protests and economic recessions systematically influence technologists' incorporation of two institutional logics (environmentalism vs. industrialism), and that social cohesion among actors within each institutional logic tends to shape differential developmental <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> electric and hybrid drives in the community of electric vehicle researchers. In Chapter 3 I further explore the process through which actors respond to multiple and conflicting institutional logics, suggesting that actors can purposefully create new concepts and meanings, modify meanings of institutional logics, or reinforce existing meanings. While existing institutional work has suggested and empirically demonstrated that institutional logics shape cognitive and behavioral patterns of actors, it still remains unanswered as to how actors can mobilize existing and new logics [...] differential decoupling processes. To trace the processes of constructing meanings of institutional logics, I conducted an inductive study by employing keyword-based, computer-aided text analysis of research proceedings published by the international Electric Vehicle Symposium in 1969 and in 1994. From the analysis, I identify four social mechanisms of logic construction: clarifying, patching, expanding and reinforcing. Moreover, empirical findings suggest that social mechanisms of patching, expanding and reinforcing are closely related to the emergence of hybrid drive...|$|R

40|$|Based on a {{model of}} {{industrial}} dynamics, this paper examines the impact of polluting emissions standards on <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> clean <b>technologies</b> implemented by firms subject to competitive selection and supply chain pressure. The model incorporates a few stylised facts on the relationships between environmental regulation, innovation and diffusion.

In some cases, emission standards lead to prevent both a situation of lock-in on the supply side and a situation of behavioural inertia on the user side. Standards may thus lead to preserve a certain form of technological and behavioural diversity. Based on the computer simulations, it will be shown that the efficiency of standards depends on the nature of performance standards (process or product), on the market structure and on the timing of intervention. environmental innovation; industrial dynamics; environmental supply chain pressure; emission standards...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a qualitative {{study on the}} adoption <b>of</b> early information <b>technologies,</b> such as typewriters, calculators or Hollerith machines in US manufacturing in the period between 1870 and 1930, which was by all means a true systemic innovation. Our empirical work is guided by a theoretical framework in which the theory of induced innovation is interpreted along "classical" lines in which an explicit link {{to the concept of}} technological regimes is established. We show how the presence of a distinct bias in technical change in US manufacturing led to the opening of a window of opportunity for early information technologies. We work out how the presence of this bias influenced the technological search and adoption process of firms and how this found its final reflection in the rules and heuristics of the regime, as well as the technological <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> the <b>technologies.</b> The reliance on established practices led organisation designers to cast the logic of large scale manufacturing into the administrative organisation of firms. This required the convergence of technical practices. The resulting technological trajectories and path dependencies were the outcome of the diffusion and the hardening of the early office work regime. Our analysis of US manufacturing data of the period suggests that even though electrification and "bureaucratisation" overlapped they cannot considered being the result of the same pattern <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> adoption, identified by the development of the capital-labour ratio. ...|$|R
