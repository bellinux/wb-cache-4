40|$|Additional {{services}} for the uranium enrichment cascade process, such as UF{sub 6 } feed, sampling, and material storage are provided by several ancillary Uranium Material Handling (UMH) facilities at the PORTS site. These facilities include the X- 343 Feed Vaporization and Sampling Facility, the X- 744 G Bulk Non-Uranium Enrichment Service Activity (UESA) Storage Building, the X- 744 H Waste Separation and Storage Facility, the X- 344 A <b>Toll</b> <b>Enrichment</b> Services Facility and the X- 342 A Feed Vaporization and Fluorine Generation Facility. As uranium operations are performed within these facilities, {{the potential for a}} criticality accident exists. In the event of a criticality accident within a process facility at PORTS, a Criticality Accident Alarm System (CAAS) is in place to detect the criticality accident and sound an alarm. In this report, an analysis was performed to provide verification that the existing CAAS at PORTS provides complete criticality accident coverage in the X- 343, X- 744 G. X- 744 H. X- 344 A and X- 342 A facilities. The analysis has determined that all of the above-mentioned facilities have complete CAAS coverage...|$|E
