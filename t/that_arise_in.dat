5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is also interesting for a variety of reasons. Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chern–Simons theory. The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory. In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>in</b> condensed matter physics.|$|E

Frequently, partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt, anger, anxiety, and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses. Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.|$|E

Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.|$|E

25|$|Harmonic {{functions}} <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>in</b> physics {{are determined}} by their singularities and boundary conditions (such as Dirichlet boundary conditions or Neumann boundary conditions).

In this case, uniqueness follows by Liouville's theorem.|$|E
25|$|If M is a Riemannian n-manifold with a cocompact proper {{isometric}} {{action of}} a discrete group Γ, then the orbit space X = M/Γ has natural orbifold structure: for each x in X take a representative m in M {{and an open}} neighbourhood V'm of m invariant under the stabiliser Γm, identified equivariantly with a Γm-subset of T'm'M under the exponential map at m; finitely many neighbourhoods cover X and each of their finite intersections, if non-empty, is covered by an intersection of Γ-translates g'm·V'm with corresponding group g'm Γ g'm−1.

25|$|The LALR(1) parser is less {{powerful}} than the LR(1) parser, and more {{powerful than the}} SLR(1) parser, though they all use the same production rules. The simplification that the LALR parser introduces consists in merging rules that have identical kernel item sets, because during the LR(0) state-construction process the lookaheads are not known. This reduces the power of the parser because not knowing the lookahead symbols can confuse the parser as to which grammar rule to pick next, resulting in reduce/reduce conflicts. All conflicts <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>in</b> applying a LALR(1) parser to an unambiguous LR(1) grammar are reduce/reduce conflicts. The SLR(1) parser performs further merging, which introduces additional conflicts.|$|E
