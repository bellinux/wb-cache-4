40|$|The large {{amplitude}} non-linear vibratory {{behavior of}} a rotating cantilever beam is addressed in this study. The motivation of this work is to built a simplified model for analyzes of turbomachinery and <b>turbopropeller</b> blades vibrations in the geometrically non-linear regime. Since blades are designed more and more flexible, in particular when composite materials are used, quantifying the amount of non-linear effects on the vibratory characteristics such as the resonance frequencies and predicting possible jump phenomena is essential. Moreover, {{we also want to}} address the effect on those non-linearities of centrifugal forces due to rotation. In this study, three models are compared. The beam vibrations are restricted to the plane that contains the rotation axis and the beam at rest. The first model (denoted as VK in the following) is based on the classical von Karman assumptions, that keeps in the strain-displacement law only the first non-linear flexural term in the axial strain. It successfully predicts the non-linear axial/flexion coupling that arises in plates and shells [7] as well as in beams with axially fixed ends (like strings, clamped/clamped beams etc.).

40|$|Since 2011 the {{aerodynamic}} {{research group}} of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering of the University of Naples "Federico II" makes use of the University's computing grid infrastructure SCoPE to perform parallel computing simulations with the commercial CAE package Star-CCM+. This infrastructure allows Navier-Stokes calculations on complete aircraft configurations in a relative short amount of time. Therefore, the software and the above mentioned infrastructure allow the parametric analysis of several configurations that are extremely useful to the correct estimation of aerodynamic interference among aircraft components and to highlight some useful trends that could indicate how a specific aerodynamic characteristic (i. e. the drag of a component, the wing downwash or the directional stability contribution of the vertical tail) is linked to aircraft geometrical parameters. Thus, with {{the choice of a}} specific set of test-cases it is possible to make a deep investigation on some aerodynamic features and, from the analyses of results, it is possible to extract and develop ad-hoc semi-empirical methodologies {{that could be used in}} preliminary design activities.

40|$|The present paper aims {{to provide}} {{aerodynamic}} design guidelines for an aircraft dorsal fin, obtained using CFD RANS technique. A parametric aerodynamic investigation about dorsal fin length, height, sweep angle, and planform {{area has been}} performed in order to evaluate the effects of geometric variations on the dorsal fin and vertical tail aerodynamic behavior in sideslip conditions. More than 30 dorsal fin geometries have been investigated, mounted on a typical large <b>turbopropeller</b> fuselage with a vertical tail. Main results {{show that there is}} no effect of the dorsal fin up to 20 ° of sideslip angle. At higher angles, the vertical tail stalls and the flow field around the empennage is strongly influenced by two vortices generated by the dorsal fin intersection with the fuselage (primary vortex) and with the vertical tail (secondary vortex). The stall phenomenon appears around 35 ° of sideslip angle. Moreover, dorsal fin slightly reduced fuselage instability. Finally, some wind tunnel tests have been performed on two dorsal fin geometries to validate the numerical analyses. Experimental tests have shown a good agreement with CFD simulations and have given useful qualitative indications on the aerodynamic behavior of the vertical tail at high angles of sideslip, with and without dorsal fin...|$|E
40|$|Propulsion, while {{conventionally}} {{included on}} the list of important aeronautical disciplines along with aerodynamics, structures, etc., is in itself a systems endeavor, analogous to the engineering of the entire vehicle; indeed propulsion encompasses important aspects of all the other disciplines. In recognition of this fact, the panel focused its discussion on those aspects of the key disciplines that are especially or uniquely important to propulsion. From the initial development of the airplane, the propulsion system has been {{recognized as one of the}} pacing technologies. It is perhaps because of the technological disparity between the reciprocating engine and the primitive airframe that the two remained relatively and separate, were developed somewhat independently, usually by different organizations. In recent years, the maturing of the gas turbine power plant and the advance in high-speed airframes have rendered this separation somewhat artificial. The power plant and the airframe now share common structural and aerodynamic elements; as the flight Mach number rises, the degree of interaction increases. By the year 2000, this interdependence will have increased in many respects to a point where independent design may not be practical or possible. During the period since the initiation of the aircraft gas turbine, the solid propellant rocket and the liquid propellant rocket, a vast array of other novel engines have been studied, covering the full spectrum of flight conditions from low subsonic to hypersonic and transatmospheric flight. In each instance, performance limits have been investigated under the assumption that current technology or reasonably foreseeable technology would be available for their development. Among the extensive list of advanced, high-performance concepts and cycles examined are the hypersonic ramjet, the variable cycle, runway-to-orbit airbreathing engine, the ram rocket (airbreathing and rich solid propellant rocket), and the air turborocket. At various times, these systems have come relatively close to meriting development and application. In many instances, limitations of materials and technologies curtailed development. As important and with almost equal frequency, the lack of commercial or military utility of the concept precluded the necessary funding. It is instructive to note that two former items on this list, the turbofan (bypass engine) and the high-speed turboprop, are respectively a mainstay engine and a promising development. In the case of the turbofan, its full potential could not be realized until turbine cooling technology had been developed and new materials developed to permit the construction of transonic fans. In the case of the highspeed <b>turbopropeller</b> engine, not only were the material and turbine technologies needed, but, in addition, the rise in fuel costs provided the impetus to take advantage of its favorable fuel consumption characteristic. As the basic technologies progress and as new missions become attractive, the engines in the foregoing list become candidates for new feasibility studies and further technology development. At the present time, the ram rocket is the prime contender to augment the range of small missiles. Of interest also is the hypersonic ram jet and its logical extension, the runway-to-orbit airbreathing engine. Much of this report deals with the development of current or near-future power plant concepts. First, the motivating factors for aeronautical propulsion research are reviewed as a reminder of the importance of continued effort in a field that has often been characterized as mature. Next, technical areas are discussed in which the panel feels additional research effort is warranted and would lead to the realization of the technological potentials between now and the year 2000. Under these guidelines, new cycles (e. g., isothermal energy exchange) were not considered by the panel. Finally, although facility requirements were not a prime consideration in the current projections, the panel believes that the increasing complexity of propulsion systems; the need for more refined interaction between propulsion system, airframe, and controls; and increasing operation in adverse weather will require test capabilities beyond those now available (see appendix). Enhanced test capability is needed in the areas of propulsion airframe integration and in largescale icing research with proper concurrent treatment of altitude, temperature, and speed...|$|E
