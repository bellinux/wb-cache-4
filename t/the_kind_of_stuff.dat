Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing."

[...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have.

We saw, along the wayside, the never-failing green fields, hedges, and other monotonous features of an ordinary English landscape.

[...] Coker was as specific with his choices of music in the season as [...] "Martin Scorsese is with the rock 'n' roll references like in Casino or in Goodfellas", rather than just adding hip-hop music for the sake of it.

2500|$|After [...] "Jump Back" [...] in 1964, {{the hits}} dried up for several years, as Stax gave more {{attention}} to younger artists and musicians.

2500|$|Back in New York, Rushmore {{used his}} {{severance}} pay from Confidential {{to buy an}} air ticket to California, where he contacted Giesler's office. Rushmore offered to become a witness {{in exchange for a}} job in Hollywood, but Giesler refused. Then Rushmore became a witness for California Attorney General Edmund [...] "Pat" [...] Brown. Since Confidential was ensconced in New York state, and New York refused to let Brown extradite Harrison to California, Brown instead put Hollywood Research and Harrison's niece Marjorie and her husband, Fred Meade, on trial. The Meades were actually in New York City {{at the time of the}} grand jury indictments and originally intended not to participate in the California trial—libel was not an extraditable offense under New York State law. But Harrison, seeing an opportunity of a lifetime for front-page headlines, wanted to avoid a trial in absentia and encouraged the Meades to return to Los Angeles with defense attorney Arthur Crowley to pleaded their case. Crowley's strategy was simple: put subjects of Confidentials stories on the witness stand and ask them under oath if the stories were true. Film industry executives, who previously tried to convince Edmund Brown to charge Robert Harrison with conspiracy to publish criminal libel, now tried to backpedal for fear of adverse publicity from what would be [...] "heralded by the press as the 'Trial of a Hundred Stars'."

An excerpt was used in the comedy film, but was not included on the soundtrack album. Swedish humorist heavy metal band Black Ingvars covered the song for their 2000 album Kids Superhits. The same year, British death metal cover band Ten Masked Men included a rendition of the song on their Return of the Ten Masked Men album. A cover by Ahmet and Dweezil Zappa was featured in the soundtrack of the 2000 film Ready to Rumble. In 2003, the song was covered by American pop punk band Bowling for Soup for the soundtrack of the remake film Freaky Friday and commented that their version was [...] "really, really, dark and really rock, [...] not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> 'pop'-py <b>stuff</b> that we usually do." [...] In 2005, power pop band Fountains of Wayne covered the song for their compilation album Out-of-State Plates. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice highlighted their rendition saying the song is [...] "as redolent and fetching as any of 's peaks". Japanese pop singer Shiori Takei covered the song of her 2005 album The Note of My Nineteen Years.|$|R
