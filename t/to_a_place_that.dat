25|$|The {{layout of}} ancient Malaka is unknown, but its {{location}} {{on a hill}} {{at the foot of}} Mount Gibralfaro suggests it was a more dense and irregular urban cluster than neighbouring Cerro del Villar, that is, Mainake. Traces of ancient landings there, as of a port, correspond with the description in the Periplous. The ruins mentioned by Strabo were still visible in the 1st century BC, and could only belong <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> was already vacated in the Roman period, as occurred in Cerro del Villar but not in Malaka. The Phoenician city at Cerro del Villar lay in ruins {{at the beginning of the}} 6th century BC, when it was apparently resettled by the Phocaean Greeks.|$|E

I've been doing this very strange, like, lemon and cayenne pepper and water fast. I didn't eat any food for 10 days straight; I think I lost 20 pounds that first 10 days." [...] Losing the excess weight after Chapter 27 proved a challenge. [...] "It took about {{a year to get}} back <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> felt semi-normal," [...] he said; [...] "I don't know if I'll ever be back to the place I was physically. I'd never do it again; it definitely gave me some problems." ...|$|E

Time was spent leisurely crafting the album; previous endeavors had been limited by deadlines. [...] "This time around, we said, 'Look, let's not just put out another record,'" [...] said Schwab, [...] "'Let's make sure we get the record <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> we're happy with it.'" [...] The band focused on a heavy metal sound. However, they did not entirely jettison their 1980s influences as synthesizers percolated several songs. Schwab's lyrics focused on his belief that power and corruption often [...] "run hand-in-hand {{when it comes to}} human souls." [...] "The world is teaching us that fame is to be sought after; that recognition will equal success, fortune and, ultimately, peace," [...] he said, [...] "But the search for and attainment of fame and wealth usually destroy us in the end." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray {{gave the}} episode a B. He had {{an issue with}} the episode [...] "reducing 'love' to an abstraction, {{for the sake of}} making it into a plot-driver," [...] but noted that [...] "at least 'A Short Story About Love' {{confines}} those wince-inducing reductions to a couple of short scenes, and in service of propelling this season’s 'displaced Peter' arc <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> it needs to be." [...] SFXs Dave Bradley was more critical of the episode, opining that the love premise failed to [...] "completely satisfy, at least not on a rational level" [...] and that the [...] "orange" [...] universe explanation felt like [...] "hand-waving, a cheeky attempt to untangle the series’ continuum without any further universe-hopping." [...] Bradley also noted that the plot surrounding the villain, a [...] "mad scientist MacGuffin," [...] seemed rushed and the script and direction [...] "jarringly unsubtle", but that the episode featured good performances with [...] "great details in every scene".|$|E

2500|$|A song {{featured}} as {{the closing}} track on the deluxe edition of Thick as Thieves, [...] "Closer", was written about Andrew Chan. Chan, along with Myuran Sukumaran, were charged {{and sentenced to}} death in 2005 for leading a heroin-smuggling operation in Indonesia, and made headline news in Australia after the newly-elected President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, ordered their execution in early 2015 after an unusually prolonged period on death row, despite multiple calls for clemency internationally. Mandagi himself was a friend of Chan, corroborating with many who talked of Chan's positive attitude and personality. Mandagi spoke of Chan, [...] "he brought a lot of change <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> was rotting.

2500|$|If {{a shared}} library that an {{executable}} depends on is deleted, moved, or renamed, or if an incompatible {{version of the}} library is copied <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> is earlier in the search, the executable would fail to load.

[...] This problem cannot occur if each version of each library is uniquely identified and each program references libraries only by their full unique identifiers.

[...] On 4 May 1955, a survey team arrived at Groom Lake and laid out a , north-south runway on the southwest corner of the lakebed and designated a site for a base support facility. [...] "The Ranch", also known as Site II, initially consisted of little more than a few shelters, workshops and trailer homes in which to house its small team. In a little over three months, the base consisted of a single, paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and rudimentary accommodations for test personnel. The base's few amenities included a movie theatre and volleyball court. Additionally, there was a mess hall, several water wells, and fuel storage tanks. By July 1955, CIA, Air Force, and Lockheed personnel began arriving. The Ranch received its first U-2 delivery on 24 July 1955 from Burbank on a C-124 Globemaster II cargo plane, accompanied by Lockheed technicians on a Douglas DC-3. Regular Military Air Transport Service flights were set up between Area 51 and Lockheed's Burbank, California offices. To preserve secrecy, personnel flew to Nevada on Monday mornings and returned to California on Friday evenings.|$|E
