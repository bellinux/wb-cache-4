50|$|<b>The</b> Ontario Health <b>Premium</b> (OHP) is a {{component}} of Ontario's Personal Income Tax system. The OHP is based on taxable income for a taxation year. As of May 2010, an Ontario resident with taxable income (i.e., income after subtracting allowable deductions) of $21,000 pays $60 per year. With taxable income of $22,000, <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> doubles to $120. With taxable income of $23,000, <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> is $180. With taxable income of $24,000, <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> is $240. <b>The</b> <b>premium</b> increases at a decreasing rate thereafter for taxable incomes up to $200,600 at which point <b>the</b> maximum <b>premium</b> of $900 is reached.|$|R
25|$|The statute {{expanded}} MassHealth (Medicaid and SCHIP) {{coverage for}} children of low income parents and restores MassHealth benefits like dental care and eyeglasses. The legislation included a merger of the individual (non-group) insurance market into the small group market to allow individuals to get lower group insurance rates. The process of merging the two markets also froze the market for such insurance {{for a short period}} in April–May 2010 as the current government tried to keep the leading non-profit insurers, which insure over 90% of the residents, in the state from raising premiums for small businesses and individuals. Eventually the state's non-partisan insurance board ruled that the government did not have the actuarial data or right to freeze <b>the</b> <b>premiums.</b> Five of the non-profit insurers then settled for slightly lower premium increases than they had initially requested rather than litigate further. The sixth litigated and won the right to implement all its original increases retroactively. Payment rates were supposed to be increased to hospitals and physicians under the statute but that has not happened. The statute also formed a Health Care Quality and Cost Council to issue quality standards and publicize provider performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{explanation}} above discloses another {{difference between}} title insurance and other types: title insurance premiums are not principally calculated {{on the basis}} of actuarial science, as is true in most other types of insurance. Instead of correlating the probability of losses with their projected costs, title insurance seeks to eliminate the source of the losses through the use of the recording system and other underwriting practices. As a result, a relatively small fraction of title insurance premiums are used to pay insured losses. The great majority of <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> is used to finance the title research on each piece of property and to maintain the title plants used to efficiently do that research. There is significant social utility in this approach as the result conforms with the expectations of most property purchasers and mortgage lenders. Generally, they want the real estate they purchased or lent money on to have the title condition they expected when they entered the transaction, rather than money compensation and litigation over unexpected defects. This {{is not to say that}} title insurers take no actuarial risks. There are several matters that can affect the title to land that are not disclosed by the recording system but that are covered by the policies. Some examples are deeds executed by minors or mentally incompetent persons, forged instruments (in some cases), corporate instruments executed without the proper corporate authority and errors in the public records. However, historically, these problems have not amounted to a high percentage of the losses paid by the insurers. A more significant percentage of losses paid by the insurers are the result of errors and omissions in the title examining process itself.|$|E
500|$|The CBO {{reported}} in August 2017 (prior to President Trump's decision) that ending the CSR payments might increase ACA premiums by 20 percentage points or more, with a resulting increase of nearly $200 {{billion in the}} budget deficit over a decade, as the premium tax credit subsidies would rise along with premium prices. CBO also estimated that initially up to one million fewer would have health insurance coverage, although more might have it in the long-run as the subsidies expand. CBO expected the exchanges to remain stable (i.e., no [...] "death spiral" [...] before or after Trump's action) as <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> would increase and prices would stabilize at the higher (non-CSR) level.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{application}} of <b>the</b> proportional hazard <b>premium</b> calculation principle in the parametric and non parametric framework. In the parametric approach, we propose a method to calculate <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> of a compound risk when the severity distribution is subexponential. In the non parametric approach, {{the use of the}} empirical distribution to cal-culate <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> using <b>the</b> proportional hazard principle leads to a system-atic underestimation of <b>the</b> <b>premium.</b> After studying <b>the</b> bias of <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> calculated using this non-parametric approach we use the bootstrap technique with subsampling to reduce it...|$|R
50|$|In this form, <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> paid {{each year}} {{remains the same}} for the {{duration}} of the contract. This cost is based on the summed cost of each year's annual renewable term rates, with a time value of money adjustment made by the insurer. Thus, the longer the period of time during which <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> remains level, <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> amount. This relationship exists because the older, more expensive to insure years are averaged, by the insurance company, into <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> amount computed at the time the policy is issued.|$|R
500|$|Stelmach's {{policy on}} health care was {{highlighted}} by his removal of the province's health care premiums effective the end of 2008. [...] Critics had denounced <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> as being regressive, both {{because they were the}} same amount regardless of the payer's income and because people with better-paying jobs often had their premiums covered by their employer. The opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties had long called for their removal. This elimination was announced in a throne speech immediately before the dissolution of the legislature for the 2008 election, although it was initially promised to take effect by 2012. During this campaign, Stelmach promised to increase the capacity of Alberta universities to train doctors and nurses over four years, eventually resulting in the graduation of 225 more doctors, 350 more registered nurses, and 220 licensed practical nurses. After the registrar of the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons called the plan unfeasible, Health Minister Dave Hancock clarified that most of the increase would in fact come from the immigration of foreign doctors to Alberta, rather than from in-province training.|$|E

2500|$|From the insurers' {{point of}} view, medical {{underwriting}} {{is necessary to}} prevent people from purchasing health insurance coverage only when they are sick, pregnant or need medical care. Adverse selection {{is a system that}} attracts high-users and discourages low-users from participating. Proponents of underwriting believe that if given the ability to purchase coverage without regard for pre-existing medical conditions (no underwriting), people would wait to purchase health insurance until they got sick or needed medical care. Waiting to obtain health insurance coverage until one needs coverage then creates a pool of insureds with [...] "high use," [...] which then increases <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> that insurance companies must charge to pay for the claims incurred.

A New York study found that only 1.5% of hospital negligence led to claims; moreover, the CBO observed that [...] "health care providers are generally not exposed to the financial cost of their own malpractice risk because they carry liability insurance, and <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> for that insurance do not reflect the records or practice styles of individual providers but more-general factors such as location and medical specialty."

2500|$|The bill Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2013 (H.R. 3370; 113th Congress) {{passed in}} the House on March 4, 2014.

Miller opposed the bill and argued {{that the state of}} Michigan should opt out of the National Flood Insurance Program entirely and urged the governor to do so. According to Miller, Michigan residents subsidize other, more flood prone parts of the country, by paying higher premiums than they should. Miller accused insurance premiums of being decides by politics rather than actuarial costs. She said that [...] "too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who I represent, are being forced to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater." ...|$|E
2500|$|The PAA was due {{to expire}} in 2002, and the former U.S. {{vice-president}} Dick Cheney said in 2001 that [...] "nobody's going to invest in nuclear power plants" [...] if the PAA is not renewed. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) concluded that the liability limits placed on nuclear insurance were significant enough to constitute a subsidy, but a quantification of the amount was not attempted at that time. Shortly after this in 1990, Dubin and Rothwell {{were the first to}} estimate the value to the U.S. nuclear industry of the limitation on liability for nuclear power plants under the Price Anderson Act. Their underlying method was to extrapolate <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> operators currently pay versus the full liability they would have to pay for full insurance {{in the absence of the}} PAA limits. The size of the estimated subsidy per reactor per year was $60 million prior to the 1982 amendments, and up to $22 million following the 1988 amendments.
