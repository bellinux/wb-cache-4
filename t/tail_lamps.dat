5|$|The VX update from 2000 {{featured}} a revised headlamp design. The VT's rear tail lamp panel {{was replaced by}} two separate light assemblies. Conversely, the luxury-oriented Berlina and Calais sedans continued using a full-width boot-lid panel incorporating the registration plate and <b>tail</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, <b>tail</b> <b>lamps)</b> may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches, and extended <b>tail</b> <b>lamps</b> that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E

25|$|Typically, bulbs of 21 to 27watts, {{producing}} 280 to 570 lumens (22 to 45 mean spherical candlepower) {{are used}} for stop, turn, reversing and rear fog lamps, while bulbs of 4 to 10W, producing 40 to 130lm (3 to 10 mscp) {{are used for}} <b>tail</b> <b>lamps,</b> parking lamps, side marker lamps and side turn signal repeaters.|$|E
25|$|The Eagle Premier and its badge {{engineered}} variant, the Dodge Monaco, continued basically unchanged for 1992, except every model {{received the}} grille and <b>tail</b> <b>lamps</b> {{that were only}} on the Limited in 1991. Chrysler also announced {{it would be the}} Premier's final year as the automaker prepared to launch all its new LH models in the Bramalea assembly plant. Bramalea ended Dodge Monaco and Eagle Premier output on December 17, 1991.|$|E

The <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> is a physical indication that the train was complete — that is, {{that it has not}} become divided in the section, leaving a portion behind (although in reality, almost all modern trains are fully fitted with continuous brakes, and hence both portions of a divided train would come to a stand if separated).|$|R
25|$|In 2011 (for the 2012 model year), the third-generation Prius Liftback {{receives}} modest {{style and}} equipment changes. The exterior changes include updated headlamps, revised <b>tail</b> <b>lamps,</b> plus a distinctive front fascia and bumper. The Prius can {{be equipped with}} an updated infotainment system featuring the optional Toyota Entune suite of connectivity features. Other updates include a 6.1-inch touch-screen, AM/FM CD player unit, a USB port for iPod connectivity, auxiliary input jack, Bluetooth hands-free phone capability and streaming audio.|$|E
25|$|All P2 {{platform}} Volvos {{received a}} minor facelift across all markets for 2005. The front fascia was redesigned, <b>tail</b> <b>lamps</b> & head lamps were changed to clear covers, the center console and dashboard received detail changes. Some minor changes were {{done to the}} electrical system and some engines, for example diesel engined models received a particle filter. A new 6-speed automatic transmission was introduced, available in both AWD and FWD configurations. Production of the second generation V70 and XC70 ended with the 2007 model year.|$|E
25|$|The body of each car {{is based}} on its {{corresponding}} production car. However, due to the regulations governing {{the dimensions of the}} cars to ensure parity, the race cars are lowered and shortened or lengthened to meet the regulations. As of 2017, only the Ford FG X Falcon, Holden VF Commodore, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG W212, Nissan Altima L33 and Volvo S60 are eligible to compete. To save costs, the front guards, passenger-side front door, rear doors and rear quarter panels are made from composite materials. The <b>tail</b> <b>lamps</b> are carried over from the road car, while the windscreen is replaced by a polycarbonate unit.|$|E
50|$|Exterior {{changes on}} the Hardtop version {{includes}} a slanted nose which requires a new grille, a thinner headlamp assembly that match the slanted nose, frameless door windows, thinner <b>tail</b> <b>lamp,</b> front fenders and bumper. Body panel is stamped different from the standard version.|$|R
50|$|It was a signalman's duty {{to check}} each train that passed his signal box, {{looking for the}} red <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> {{exhibited}} on the trailing vehicle, the sighting of which confirmed that the train was still complete, and thus the section was clear.|$|R
25|$|Standard Tranz Metro logos {{were applied}} along {{the centre of}} the car sides. The car numbers were painted in black Frutiger script on the ends of the car, {{underneath}} the left-hand <b>tail</b> <b>lamp.</b> The end numbers were painted in the same style on {{the centre of the}} cab doors.|$|R
25|$|A {{facelift}} {{was designed}} through late 2010 and patented on 7 January 2011 under design registration number 001845801-0004. The facelift was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show with new wheels, interior colors, new head and <b>tail</b> <b>lamps</b> and new grilles. New LED running lights were introduced as well. The F Sport was introduced, with a honeycomb grille, 8-speed automatic transmission, and a unique sporty interior. In the US, {{the new model}} uses the Lexus Enform telematics system, which includes the Safety Connect SOS system and Shazam tagging. Sales began worldwide in April 2012 for the RX 350 and RX 450h, with sales for the F-Sport variants starting in July of the same year.|$|E
25|$|For the facelifted {{version that}} debuted at the January 2009 North American International Auto Show, Toyota worked to better {{differentiate}} the styling of the hybrid {{away from the}} rest of the Camry range. This was achieved by fitting a distinct front fascia with a large, central air dam, vertically slotted fog lamps, and a single-blade grille. From the rear, the <b>tail</b> <b>lamps</b> abstain from the primarily red lens inserts fitted previously, to predominantly clear lenses, while the interior receives a newly designed fuel economy gauge. The design registrations for the facelifted Camry Hybrid, noting changes made to the original were filed on 19 December 2008 at the US Patent and Trademark Office.|$|E
25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by rear position lamps (also called <b>tail</b> <b>lamps</b> or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. Rear position lamps may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light for the rear position lamp function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (rear position) modes, so that a vehicle displaying rear position lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 {{model year}} had little {{news for the}} Premier except for a new {{anti-lock}} braking system (ABS) that was also available on the Canadian-built Dodge Monaco twin. The new safety feature came standard on the ES Limited and was optional on other models. The Limited model received a new front grille and rear <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> assemblies.|$|R
2500|$|The Prius Plug-in Hybrid shares many of {{the same}} {{exterior}} and interior design elements as the standard 2012 Prius, keeping the coefficient of drag at [...] Among the design features exclusive to the plug-in are: unique chrome grille and bumper trim, chrome door handles, unique 15-inch alloy wheels, blue-accented headlamps, a distinct <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> design, and a new Hybrid Synergy Drive Plug-in badge.|$|R
50|$|Altezza lights (also {{known as}} Lexus lights, Euro lights, crystal lights, or clear lights) are vehicle <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> {{clusters}} consisting {{of one or}} more internal lamp units, covered with a clear (or tinted) acrylic cover made popular by Lexus and have been coming as stock equipment on Altezza and Lexus IS300's since 1998.

25|$|In August 1991, {{there was}} a small Apollo facelift, given the {{designation}} JL, with an altered model range. The SL and SLX continued, with the SLE now available only as a sedan. The Executive pack was now no longer offered, and a sports version, dubbed GS was introduced in both body variants. Equipment levels mostly mirrored the previous JK, although the SLX was now similar in specification to the discontinued Executive and the GS to the JK SLE, albeit without standard automatic transmission. GS specification cars also added body stripes, red highlights, a tachometer and upgraded audio. Appearance-wise, the JK and JL are very similar, with the JL's grille treated with bolder chrome highlighting and slightly altered <b>tail</b> <b>lamps</b> on sedans. The XV10 Camry-based JM Apollo replaced the JL in March 1993.|$|E
25|$|The Holden Apollo, a rebadged variant to the Toyota Camry, retailed in Australia {{alongside}} the facelifted Camry V20 series from August 1989. Production had started in July. This model sharing occurred {{due to the}} United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI) joint venture between Toyota Australia and General Motors-Holden's starting in 1987 that resulted in model sharing between both automakers from August 1989. Known as the JK series, the Apollo differentiated itself {{by way of a}} redesigned grille, rehashed <b>tail</b> <b>lamps</b> and other minor trim items. This rebranding scheme {{was the result of the}} Button car plan, introduced in May 1984 to rationalise and make the Australian automotive industry more competitive on a global scale by means of reducing import tariffs. Offered in sedan and wagon guises, Apollo replaced the Camira.|$|E
50|$|For 2006 the Subaru Impreza WRX {{received}} a complete front-end re-design, boldly styled headlights with smoke-tinted lenses, a three-section mesh-type grill, and distinguished new <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> clusters. Three trims levels are available: WRX TR (Tuner Ready), WRX, and Limited. The car's curb weight is 3140 lb for the WRX TR, 3192 lb for the WRX, and 3240 for the WRX Limited.|$|R
50|$|Luxgen also {{introduced}} a Luxgen7 MPV electric vehicle co-developed by AC Propulsion. The top speed is 145 km/h and the electric range is 350 km at 40 km/h.While {{most of the}} exterior {{was based on the}} regular Luxgen7 MPV, the EV+ receives a different front bumper and grille compartment design and clear <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> clusters in a lightly tinted blue color.|$|R
50|$|The turn {{indicators}} have been {{integrated into the}} headlamp housing and the <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> cluster features a segmented stop and brake light section with the {{turn indicators}} built into a single unit that wraps around the brake light’s bottom side. Also LEDs have been used replacing the conventional bulbs. The split hand grips for the pillion rider serves in providing a different look.|$|R
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, <b>tail</b> <b>lamps,</b> grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
500|$|In 1999 Peter Hughes, Holden's {{manager of}} {{exterior}} design, produced a two-dimensional {{image of a}} sketch drawn earlier by Michael Simcoe, Holden's design director at the time. Known in house as the [...] "Bill of Design", the sketch formed the design basis for the production-ready car. Various elements of the sketch were changed, including the rear <b>tail</b> <b>lamps,</b> the low-profile side window cluster and the drawn out wheelbase, but the aggressive stance remained.|$|E
500|$|Toyota {{claims that}} the Aurion is {{designed}} to Australian tastes, {{although it has been}} designed with markets such as Asia in mind. Hogios states that the Aurion follows the traits of current Australian styling, with a tendency to look towards European designs for inspiration. In addition, like its other vehicles of similar vintage, Toyota designed the Aurion within the realm of its [...] "vibrant clarity" [...] design language. According to chief designer Hogios, the car makes particular use of the [...] "vibrant clarity" [...] theory known as [...] "perfect imbalance". This involves body features that act as a counterpoint to other body features. Examples of this include intersecting concave and convex surfaces and vertical sculpted features on the front fascia, which are balanced by the horizontal headlamps. The front-end's [...] "double concave architecture" [...] can also be characterised by its protruding bonnet crease line and deep grille. The same architecture is applied at the rear, with a deep bumper, a clamshell-shaped boot lid that envelops over the flanks, dual exhaust pipes and <b>tail</b> <b>lamps.</b> Design patents were filed on 27 December 2005 at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.|$|E
5000|$|The Prius Plug-in Hybrid shares many of {{the same}} {{exterior}} and interior design elements as the standard 2012 Prius, keeping the coefficient of drag at [...] Among the design features exclusive to the plug-in are: unique chrome grille and bumper trim, chrome door handles, unique 15-inch alloy wheels, blue-accented headlamps, a distinct <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> design, and a new Hybrid Synergy Drive Plug-in badge.|$|R
60|$|The throb of {{the engine}} quickened and struck a sharper note, and Foster felt the car leap forward up the hill. Turning in his seat, he watched the {{flickering}} gleam behind and saw it grow fainter and then gradually get bright. It {{looked as if the}} pursuers had lost sight of the front car's <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> and were increasing their speed.|$|R
2500|$|Between 2009 and 2010, {{development}} {{took place}} on further updates to the second generation S-197. In late 2010 design work (by Robert Gelardi) was frozen, with prototypes being first spotted in May 2011. On November 2, 2011, Ford unveiled the 2013 model year Mustang. The 2013 model year Mustang exterior was updated with a new front fascia featuring a larger grille, standard HID headlamps and two LED accent strips adjacent to the headlamp lens. Models equipped with the Pony Package offered LED lighting mounted on the sideview mirrors that produce a projection of a running horse on the ground, 18" [...] wheels, and lower valence foglamps. In the rear, LED <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> clusters included sequential turn signals (as with 2010-2012 Mustangs) and a reverse indicator light integrated within the brake light. The trunk lid included a black panel that united {{the left and right}} <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> clusters. Several new wheel designs were offered.|$|R
