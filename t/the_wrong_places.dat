They had a profitable and discreet business relationship, which was only visible in a few unusual and incomplete documents and contracts, most of which were undated, and some were signed in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>places.</b> Almost every document dealt with interest-free loans with no specified date of repayment. In 1999, Shaik wrote all the loans off without any explanation.|$|E
25|$|However, the cartographic {{evidence}} of before 1996 is so mixed {{that the only}} safe conclusion one can draw from it is that neither of the two governments ever bothered to enforce a consistent representation of whatever legal opinions they held with respect to these islands, {{in the work of}} their cartographic state agencies. It {{should also be noted that}} several of the maps cited as evidence by the two governments displayed confusion over what the geographic facts were in the first place (displaying some islets in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>places,</b> confusing the names of some islands, or even displaying islands that do not exist).|$|E
25|$|The task of 13th Corps was {{to cross}} the Straits and land in two small bays north of Reggio. The 1st Canadian Division, landing at Fox Beach, a short {{distance}} north of Reggio, were to capture {{the town and the}} airfield south of town, while 5th Division took San Giovanni, to the north, and the coastline to Canitello. The artillery barrage on the beach was planned {{to take advantage of the}} LCA's splinter-proof armoured protection. The barrage would lift from the beach only moments before touchdown for the LCAs. Apart from some craft landing in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>places,</b> and some mixing of the divisions, the assault troops landed without difficulty and with little hindrance from the enemy. Following the assault phase, the LCAs were used to ferry supplies. By the evening of D+1 the landing of supplies had gone so well that the build-up was 1½ days ahead of schedule.|$|E

500|$|In November 2008, Brunner became {{involved}} in a legal battle against two Steve Stivers supporters that relates to the validity of a 1000 provisional ballots {{in the race for}} Ohio's 15th congressional district {{that at the time of}} recounting had a 149-vote margin and 27,000 absentee ballots to be counted. [...] The case was consolidated with other cases in the United States District Court upon Brunner's request.

500|$|Some {{passages}} from the Classical authors Aeschylus, Diodorus, Herodotus and Plutarch are split over the movie to give it an authentic flavor. Aeschylus becomes a major source when the battle with the [...] "monstrous human herd" [...] of the Persians is narrated in the film. Diodorus' statement about Greek valor to preserve their liberty is inserted in the film, but his mention of Persian valor is omitted. Herodotus' fanciful numbers are used to populate the Persian army, and Plutarch's discussion of Greek women, specifically Spartan women, is inserted wrongly in the dialogue between the [...] "misogynist" [...] Persian ambassador and the Spartan king. Classical sources are certainly used, but exactly in all <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>places,</b> or quite naively. The Athenians were fighting a sea battle during this.|$|E

500|$|Stivers led Kilroy by a 129,852–129,703 margin with 100% of the Election Day precincts counted, {{but before}} the {{provisional}} ballots were counted. On November 25, 2008, Madison and Union counties concluded their absentee, military, and provisional ballot counting and Stivers claimed a net gain resulting in a 594-vote lead. On December 5, 2008, Stivers' supporters won a ruling in the Ohio Supreme Court that the 1,000 provisional ballots that lacked signatures or had names and signatures in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>places</b> be thrown out. On December 7, 2008, Franklin County Election Canvassers completed their final ballot count, which included absentee, military, and provisional ballots received within ten days of Election Day, giving Kilroy a victory margin of 2,311 votes over Stivers. This margin exceeds the automatic recount margin of 0.5%. Stivers conceded the race to Kilroy later on Sunday. [...] The late ballots that weighed on the election were of three types: military and overseas absentee ballots postmarked {{by the time the}} polls closed Tuesday November 4 and received by November 14; domestic absentee ballots postmarked by Monday November 3 that are received by November 14; absentee ballots with errors that voters correct by November 14.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} and head writer Russell T Davies {{came up with}} the concept of [...] "The Unquiet Dead". As the third episode of the revived series, it was designed to continue to show the range of the programme by exploring the past, after the contemporary [...] "Rose" [...] and far-future [...] "The End of the World". The episode also reintroduces the TARDIS' habit of taking the Doctor to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>places,</b> something that had not yet happened in the revived series. Davies felt that it was important for an episode to be set in Cardiff as that is where the new series is produced, and wanted the story to be set in Victorian times and feature Charles Dickens. Davies' original brief also included [...] "fake mediums", and Gatiss originally set it in a [...] "spiritualist hotel", which had fake mediums (such as a character named Mrs Plumchute) on the lower floors and Mr Sneed on the top, though he was unaware he was a true medium. However, Gwyneth became a more popular character with the production team, and she took on much of the medium role. Gatiss was also more interested in possession and zombies. Mrs Sneed was another character that was cut out of the episode; Gatiss believed she was unnecessary as Gwyneth was the [...] "heart" [...] of the story.|$|E

Jones wished to take his prizes to Dunkirk, but the French captains insisted on {{following}} the original orders from their government masters {{to head for the}} island of Texel in the neutral United Provinces (the Netherlands). They arrived safely on 3 October, while the British ships searched for them in all <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>places,</b> having ignored a correct preliminary estimate by observers in Yorkshire. Jones immediately wrote a report to his own government superior, Benjamin Franklin, one notable feature of which was, inevitably, the conduct of Captain Landais. Furious though he was, he wrote, [...] "I forbear to take any steps With him until I have the advice and approbation of your Excellency". Captain Cottineau, on the other hand, placed himself under no such obligation, and called Landais a coward to his face. Landais challenged him to a duel during which Landais ran his sword through Cottineau’s chest, just missing the heart. Landais’ later history is in the Alliance article.|$|E

The editor had a nervous breakdown and left. Early preview screenings did not go well as people laughed in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>places</b> and complained about a lack of a happy ending. Universal told Raimi that some people rated Darkman the worst film they had ever seen. According to executives, the film was one of the worst-scoring pictures in Universal's history. Then, two preview screenings, one with Danny Elfman's score, went well. Tapert remembers, [...] "the experience on Darkman was very difficult for Sam and me; it isn't the picture we thought it should be, based on the footage we shot and all that. The studio got nervous about some kind of wild things in it, and made us take them out, which was unfortunate." [...] However, Raimi did like the [...] "brilliant" [...] marketing campaign that the studio came up with, releasing posters in advance with a silhouette of the main character and the question, [...] "Who is Darkman?" [...] According to the director, [...] "the marketing made the film a money-maker." ...|$|E
