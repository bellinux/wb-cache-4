5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. <b>Tuberous</b> sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tuberous</b> sundews: These nearly 50 Australian species form an {{underground}} tuber {{to survive the}} extremely dry summers of their habitat, re-emerging in the autumn. These so-called <b>tuberous</b> sundews can be further divided into two groups, those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or scrambling stems. <b>Tuberous</b> sundews comprise the subgenus Ergaleium.|$|E
5|$|Advocates for {{the diet}} {{recommend}} {{that it be}} seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%. The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include Dravet syndrome, infantile spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy and <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis complex.|$|E
5|$|Vegetative {{reproduction}} occurs {{naturally in}} some species that produce stolons or when roots {{come close to}} the surface of the soil. Older leaves that touch the ground may sprout plantlets. Pygmy sundews reproduce asexually using specialized scale-like leaves called gemmae. <b>Tuberous</b> sundews can produce offsets from their corms.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} can manifest {{similarly to}} other diseases, {{which must be}} ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, <b>Tuberous</b> Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} sundews are self-fertile; their flowers will often self-pollinate upon closing. Often, {{numerous}} seeds are produced. The tiny black seeds germinate {{in response to}} moisture and light, while seeds of temperate species also require cold, damp, stratification to germinate. Seeds of the <b>tuberous</b> species require a hot, dry summer period followed by a cool, moist winter to germinate.|$|E
5|$|The corms of the <b>tuberous</b> sundews {{native to}} Australia are {{considered}} a delicacy by the Australian Aborigines. Some of these corms were also used to dye textiles, while another purple or yellow dye was traditionally prepared in the Scottish Highlands using D. rotundifolia. A sundew liqueur is also still produced using a recipe from the 14th century. It is made using fresh leaves from mainly D. capensis, D. spatulata, and D. rotundifolia.|$|E
5|$|Gasteroid {{fruit body}} types are either roughly spherical or <b>tuberous,</b> {{occasionally}} with stipes, and {{usually have a}} peridium that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to yellow or black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical or nearly so, and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, or sometimes with reticulations. Hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} <b>tuberous</b> {{sclerosis}} (TSC) research spans less than 200 years. TSC is a rare, multi-system genetic disease {{that can cause}} benign tumours to grow on the brain or other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, developmental delay, behavioural problems and skin abnormalities, as well as lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode for the proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as tumour growth suppressors and regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Originally regarded as a rare pathological curiosity, it is now an important focus of research into tumour formation and suppression.|$|E
5|$|The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root {{vegetable}} {{closely related to}} the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, <b>tuberous</b> root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Other tumors {{can include}} trichodiscomas (tumors {{of the hair}} disc, which may be {{identical}} to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas. However, angiofibromas are more common in <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis. Along with the tumors, other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (buccal mucosa), tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa-colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium. Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families. Many people with BHD have skin lesions {{that appear to be}} acrochordons (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in folds of skin. Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney tumors or spontaneous pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
25|$|Congenital ptosis and pseudoptosis, as {{observed}} in {{conditions such as}} <b>tuberous</b> breast deformity (constricted breast).|$|E
25|$|<b>Tuberous</b> roots: A {{portion of}} a root swells for food or water storage, e.g. sweet potato. A type of storage root {{distinct}} from taproot.|$|E
25|$|Storage roots: these {{roots are}} {{modified}} for storage of food or water, such as carrots and beets. They include some taproots and <b>tuberous</b> roots.|$|E
25|$|The {{electric}} eel also possesses high frequency-sensitive <b>tuberous</b> receptors, {{which are}} distributed in patches over its body. This feature is apparently useful for hunting other Gymnotiformes.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{utilized}} by the Plains Apache include: chokecherries, blackberries, grapes, prairie turnips, wild onions, and wild plums. Numerous other fruits, vegetables, and <b>tuberous</b> roots were also used.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the leaves}} and shoots are also edible, the starchy <b>tuberous</b> roots {{are by far the}} most {{important}} product. In some tropical areas, they are a staple food crop.|$|E
25|$|The {{first volume}} deals {{exclusively}} with <b>tuberous</b> sundews (genus Drosera). The second {{is devoted to}} pygmy sundews, but also includes three <b>tuberous</b> species described {{since the publication of}} the first volume, as well as two other sundews that do not fit elsewhere (D.glanduligera and D.hamiltonii). The final volume includes the remaining sundews of Australia, together with native species of Aldrovanda, Byblis, Cephalotus, Nepenthes, and Utricularia. Each species is given a four-page treatment, with one page for a botanical description, one for a line drawing of the author's creation, one for a distribution map, and one for assorted colour photographs.|$|E
25|$|Three-coloured Indian cress (Tropaeolum tricolor) {{is another}} <b>tuberous,</b> {{climbing}} species grown for its attractive red, purple and yellow tubular flowers. It comes from Chile and Bolivia {{and is a}} reliable winter-growing species.|$|E
25|$|HMB-45 is nonreactive {{with almost}} all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the {{exception}} of rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).|$|E
25|$|Slugs {{can feed}} {{on a wide}} variety of {{vegetables}} and herbs, including flowers such as petunias, chrysanthemums, daisies, lobelia, lilies, daffodils, narcissus, gentians, primroses, <b>tuberous</b> begonias, hollyhocks, irises, and fruits such as strawberries. They also feed on carrots, peas, apples, and cabbage that are offered as a sole food source.|$|E
25|$|Electric fishes {{generate}} {{discharge from}} electric organs {{located near the}} tail region. Electric organs are mostly derived from muscle cells (myogenic); except for one gymnotiform family has electric organ derived from neurons (neurogenic organs). To detect the electric signals, electric fish has two types of receptive cells- ampullary and <b>tuberous</b> electroreceptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tuberous</b> organs, {{the type}} of {{receptive}} organ used for electrocommunication, {{can be divided into}} two types, depending on the way information is encoded: time coders and amplitude coders. There are multiple forms of <b>tuberous</b> organs in each time and amplitude coders, and all weakly electric fish species possess at least one form of the two coders. Time coder fires phase-locked action potential (meaning, the waveform of the action potential is always the same) at a fixed delay time after each outside transient is formed. Therefore, time coders neglect information about waveform and amplitude but focus on frequency of the signal and fire action potentials on a 1:1 basis to the outside transient. Amplitude coders, on the contrary, fire according to the EOD amplitude. While both wave-type and pulse-type fishes have amplitude coders, they fire in different ways: Receptors of wave-type fishes continuously fire at a rate according to their own EOD amplitude; on the other hand, receptors of pulse-type fishes fire burst of spikes to each EOD detected, and the number of spikes in each burst is correlated to the amplitude of the EOD. <b>Tuberous</b> electroreceptors show a V-shaped threshold tuning curve (similar to auditory system), which means that they are tuned to a particular frequency. This particular tuned-in frequency is usually closely matched to their own EOD frequency.|$|E
25|$|During thelarche, the {{developing}} breasts are sometimes of unequal size, and usually the left breast is slightly larger. This condition of asymmetry is transitory and statistically normal in female {{physical and sexual}} development. Medical conditions can cause overdevelopment (e.g., virginal breast hypertrophy, macromastia) or underdevelopment (e.g., <b>tuberous</b> breast deformity, micromastia) in girls and women.|$|E
25|$|Breast {{problems}} - Includes gynecomastia (male breast development), macromastia (excessively large breasts), <b>tuberous</b> defects, {{and breast}} asymmetry. Often, {{not only do}} children with breast conditions suffer from physical problems, but psychological side effects as well. With this knowledge, current multi-disciplinary clinics have arisen including specialists from plastic surgery, nutrition, adolescent medicine, psychology, gynecology, and social work.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of LGS (70–78%) is {{symptomatic}} (secondary) - that is an identifiable underlying pathology is responsible. This includes encephalopathy (brain damage) or another disease and/or developmental disorder. Frequent causes include <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis, hereditary metabolic diseases, inflammatory brain disease such as encephalitis, meningitis, and toxoplasmosis; hypoxia–ischemia injury and other birth injuries; and lesions of the frontal lobe. These patients tend to have a worse prognosis than those with idiopathic (unknown cause) LGS.|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 2015, the FDA {{approved}} sirolimus {{to treat}} lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare, progressive lung disease that primarily affects {{women of childbearing}} age. This made sirolimus the first drug approved to treat this disease. LAM involves lung tissue infiltration with smooth muscle-like cells with mutations of the <b>tuberous</b> sclerosis complex gene (TSC2). Loss of TSC2 gene function activates the mTOR signaling pathway, resulting in the release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. Sirolimus blocks this pathway.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant is}} a {{herbaceous}} perennial vine, bearing alternate heart-shaped or palmately lobed leaves and medium-sized sympetalous flowers. The edible <b>tuberous</b> root {{is long and}} tapered, with a smooth skin whose color ranges between yellow, orange, red, brown, purple, and beige. Its flesh ranges from beige through white, red, pink, violet, yellow, orange, and purple. Sweet potato cultivars with white or pale yellow flesh are less sweet and moist than those with red, pink or orange flesh.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{carnivores}} {{shut down}} in some seasons. <b>Tuberous</b> sundews die back to tubers in the dry season, bladderworts to turions in winter, and non-carnivorous leaves are made by most butterworts and Cephalotus in the less favourable seasons. Utricularia macrorhiza varies the number of bladders it produces based on the expected density of prey. Part-time carnivory in Triphyophyllum peltatum {{may be due to}} an unusually high need for potassium at a certain point in the life cycle, just before flowering.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tuberous</b> {{sclerosis}} complex (TSC) {{is a rare}} multisystem {{genetic disease}} that causes benign tumors {{to grow in the}} brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, liver, eyes, lungs, and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mention of}} {{truffles}} {{appears in the}} inscriptions of the neo-Sumerians regarding their Amorite enemy's eating habits (Third Dynasty of Ur, 20th century BCE) and later in writings of Theophrastus {{in the fourth century}} BCE. In classical times, their origins were a mystery that challenged many; Plutarch and others thought them {{to be the result of}} lightning, warmth and water in the soil, while Juvenal thought thunder and rain to be instrumental in their origin. Cicero deemed them children of the earth, while Dioscorides thought they were <b>tuberous</b> roots.|$|E
