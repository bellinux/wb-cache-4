500|$|Stephen Hopkins {{was a slave}} owner, like {{several of}} the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and he {{mentioned}} five in his 1760 will. [...] His five slaves consisted of a negro man, woman, lad, and <b>two</b> <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> who were bequeathed to close {{members of his family}} with tender instructions for their care that were highly unusual coming from any slave owner. [...] His negro woman Fibbo (Phibo/Phebe) was to go to his wife Anne and be treated [...] "so that Servitude may not be a Burthen to her," [...] and his negro man Saint Jago was to go to his oldest son Rufus and be treated [...] "so that his Life may be rendered easy and comfortable." [...] The will was never proved because Hopkins lived another 25 years, and circumstances changed the instrument's provisions.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy Rain {{director}} David Cage {{described the}} game as [...] "a very dark film noir thriller with mature themes" [...] without any supernatural elements, and that [...] "the real message [...] is about how far you're {{willing to go to}} save someone you love." [...] In 2008, Cage gave a brief overview of the game's narrative and ambitions: [...] "Heavy Rain is about normal people who have landed in extraordinary situations. I wanted a much more personal story. The first thing that came to my mind, as a father of <b>two</b> <b>little</b> <b>boys,</b> was that the main theme should simply be a father's love for his son. This is not a game about saving the princess or the world. Its [...] purely about a father's love. The main story will revolve around four different characters, and we're putting the spotlight on their perceptions. The question 'what is good and what is evil' is the key here, that will be just a matter of viewpoint...I believe heavily in moral choices, I'm going to use them A LOT. They're not about being good or bad, but about finding the right balance." [...] Cage commented on the setting by saying, [...] "I don't want to do a big free-roaming city like GTA, because the flow of the story will then be hard to control. Nevertheless, I do want to incorporate big sets, with a crowd, heavy populated areas like a mall and a subway {{are going to be in}} there. Of course, the gameplay has got to make use of that aspect too." [...] Cage also stated that the game's storyline and themes was heavily influenced by the 2006-2010 science fiction psychological thriller television series, Heroes.|$|E
