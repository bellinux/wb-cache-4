50|$|The <b>troop</b> <b>density</b> has {{decreased}} through military history {{in proportion to}} the increase in lethality of weapons being use in combat. However, there is no accepted standard to calculate this value due to the large number of variables involved in the planning of combat operations.|$|E
50|$|Military {{history can}} be divided into three periods {{according}} to average <b>troop</b> <b>density</b> employed in combat: ancient armies with about 10 square metres per foot soldier, the age of close order formation armed with firearms encompassing the period from the 1650s to the Franco-Prussian War of 1871 that increased the average to 250 square meters per infantryman, and the Second World War when the density decreased to 27,500 square metres per infantryman. The Soviet Army has based much of its post-war doctrine on the war experience, and had devoted considerable resources to the analysis of <b>troop</b> <b>density,</b> including these in almost all considerations of wartime operations. By the end of the Cold War the density (in Europe) was estimated to be 50,000 square metres per infantryman due to widespread mechanisation of forces.|$|E
50|$|A <b>troop</b> <b>density</b> (Плотность войск) {{also known}} as the {{dispersion}} factor in military science is a statistical value assigned by commanders during the combat operations process in considering the ability of the Combat Arms to achieve military objectives during a military operation. It reflects combat readiness of the units to participate in engagements with consideration to the terrain and expected enemy strength.|$|E

5000|$|Panjwayi is {{continually}} {{the site of}} fighting and emplacements of improvised explosive devices (IED), with the bulk of Canadian Forces' casualties taken from this district. The recent increase in ISAF forces, brought on about by the U.S. surge, have increased <b>troop</b> <b>densities</b> in Panjwayi, resulting in a greater ability on behalf of Afghan government and international forces to conduct operations and penetrate into former Taliban strongholds, especially villages in the [...] "Horn of Panjwayi" [...] such as Mushan, Talokan, Sperwan Ghar and Zangabad. These villages are considered the [...] "Birthplace of the Taliban" [...] and currently {{is considered one of}} the most dangerous regions of Afghanistan for Nato Forces.

50|$|The unit of {{measurement}} is square metres per soldier, although this is modified for each combat arm to reflect their primary weapon performance in combat as weapon density (Плотность оружия); for example guns for artillery. <b>Troop</b> <b>density</b> {{is also used to}} estimate forces required to occupy a given populated territory in order to deny this population to being exploited by the enemy covert forces or insurgent troops.|$|E
50|$|<b>Troop</b> <b>density</b> was {{included}} in the doctrine of the First World War belligerents, based on the battalion per forward zone front calculation. The density of troops also affects the planning of close air support operations because of the higher rate of missions required to deliver adequate munitions to their targets. The increased dispersal of troops was the consideration behind the decision to develop nuclear bombs before effects of radiation were realised.|$|E

He ordered the attacks on the north and eastern flanks of the pocket stepped up. These attacks achieved little, and many fell on positions which had been abandoned as the German troops withdrew to Proskurov. Despite the attacks to the West, the Red Army kept increasing <b>troop</b> <b>density</b> to the southern flank of the pocket in anticipation of an attack that would never come.|$|E
40|$|The Blyde Canyon Nature reserve {{displays}} {{its natural}} beauty for most National and International visitors {{all over the}} World. The region is renowned for its high rainfall and misty weather, which enhances {{the natural beauty of}} the area. Because of the mist belt effect, the area {{is one of the largest}} commercial forestry areas in South Africa. Baboons also seek after the topography and vegetation type (Northeastern mountain sourveld) that is typical of this area and numerous baboon troops occur in this region. This combination is often the cause of conflict between baboons and humans. The need arise for these baboons to be studied and managed as a component of this very important ecosystem. The main aims of the study were firstly to identify a natural ranging baboon troop, to habituate them and gather data regarding home range sizes, <b>troop</b> sizes, <b>densities</b> and seasonal food selection and secondly to give a detailed habitat description and vegetation map of the troop's home range. The baboon activity data was collected in 15 -minute intervals over a one year period on a troop at Bourke's Luck. This included all activities such as walking, social, foraging, and resting. The food parts selected as well as the species foraged on was identified. Numerous statistical methods were used on the baboon data such as; the Shapiro Wilk test, Spearman rank-order correlation, ANOVA, and the Kolmogarov-Smirnov two sample test. There was a positive correlation between home range areas and troop sizes and the baboons preferred certain habitats above others during different seasons. To give a detailed habitat description of the troop's home range, 50 sample plots was stratified-randomly distributed in order to include all the different stratification units. a TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures was carried out on the Bourke's Luck section that included the baboons home range. 13 Plant communities, which can be grouped into 7 major community types were identified. This study resulted in the ecological interpretation of baboon activities related to the ecological interpretation of the vegetation in the baboon troop's home range.

50|$|Infantry {{operations}} were usually, if not always, within artillery range. Their depth was also {{affected by the}} threat of interception while withdrawing, greater when the Indonesian <b>troop</b> <b>density</b> was higher {{as it was in the}} areas south of Kuching. Another constraint was the limited range of man-pack VHF radios A41 & 42, (copies of AN/PRC 9 & 10) and mountainous terrain in some areas. However, A510, an Australian made small HF radio using continuous wave (i.e. Morse code) was used in some areas and new A13 HF radios appeared in early 1966.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} {{density of}} troops {{in the area of}} combat is not reflective of the average value for any given command because dispersion of troops tends to follow terrain and tactical considerations of the combat planning, and actual location of troops tends to be in clusters of positions. Low <b>troop</b> <b>density</b> is a particular problem as a period of vulnerability during air assault, air landing, amphibious assault and to some extent airborne assault operations, as well as during pre-combat concentration {{of troops in}} the staging area prior to their movement to the battle area, denying them operational mobility.|$|E
5000|$|LAR is not {{mechanized}} infantry. MCWP 3-14 states (page 2-1): “The LAR scouts are not {{employed the}} same way as infantry or mechanized infantry.” Again, MCWP 3-14 goes on to emphasize this distinction (page 2-4): “Operations requiring large numbers of infantry favor employing mechanized infantry units due to their higher troop density.” In addition to the requisite lack of “troop density” for traditional infantry tasks, the LAR is not equipped with either an armored personnel carrier or an infantry fighting vehicle, which a designation as either armored or mechanized infantry would require. MCWP 3-14 makes this clear (page 2-4): “The LAV should not be viewed as an infantry fighting vehicle or as an armored personnel carrier. This vehicle is an armored reconnaissance vehicle that lacks sufficient armor protection and <b>troop</b> <b>density</b> to perform missions normally assigned to a mechanized infantry unit.” ...|$|E
40|$|The {{papers of}} this {{dissertation}} explore two dimensions of wars of occupation. The first paper concerns {{the outcomes of}} such wars. It proposes a theory of democratic accountability that links the level of casualties suffered by an occupying force to its leadership’s decision {{to withdraw from the}} contested territory. I argue that war casualties act as the cost that drives patterns of domestic support in democratic states. Political elites seeking electoral gain will give meaning to those casualties, frequently arguing that the benefits that might come with continued fighting will not justify those costs, and that such wars are not necessary for the state’s survival. I suggest that once these divisions occur at the elite level, it becomes very difficult to maintain support among the population. This leads to the finding that while democracies may not win or lose any less than autocracies, they consistently abandon them at significantly lower levels of casualties. In the second paper, I use an experimental survey to determine if news of American casualties or elite opinion drives attitudes about the war in Afghanistan. Existing experiments in this area typically portray elite support as split along traditional partisan lines, and support or opposition among the subjects is usually driven by their partisan attachments. But this approach rarely reflects reality, where elite foreign policy and security opinions frequently cut across partisan divisions. The findings reveal that news of American casualties has little independent effect on attitudes towards the Afghanistan conflict. Instead, overall support for the conflict only declines when elite opinions in response to those deaths cut across standard partisan divisions. The final paper pivots to a discussion of the dynamics of violence in these wars. Here, I examine whether the factors that were effective in reducing attacks against counterinsurgents in Iraq had the same effect on patterns of selective and indiscriminate violence against civilians. I find that greater American <b>troop</b> <b>density</b> in a given district is associated with declines in targeted attacks on Iraqi civilians, but this has no effect on the rate of indiscriminate attacks...|$|E
