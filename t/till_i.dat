Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more <b>till</b> <b>I</b> could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
25|$|The song {{has been}} covered by various artists and musicians, most famously by Barbra Streisand for her studio album <b>Till</b> <b>I</b> Loved You (1988). It was {{released}} as the record's second single on 15 December 1988 by Columbia Records as a 7", 12", and CD. It was generally noted as a standout track on <b>Till</b> <b>I</b> Loved You and was commercially successful, entering the charts in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, {{and on the}} United States' Adult Contemporary chart.|$|E

25|$|Stewart grew up {{with both}} his mother and father, but his mother died {{while he was a}} {{teenager}} and his father remarried. His mother was part of the Dudgeon sept of the Noresmen. His mother was thought to be a major influence in Stewart’s life from whom he received his love and appreciation for beauty. He was a cab proprietor and later ran a farm called Pictstonhill. He was a very religious man and influenced Stewart towards missionary work. Stewart had a desire from a young age to go to Africa. He told his cousin, “I shall never be satisfied <b>till</b> <b>I</b> am in Africa with a Bible in my pocket, and a rifle on my shoulder to supply my wants.” From a very young age, James Stewart knew {{what he wanted to do}} with his life: be a missionary in Africa.|$|E
500|$|In preparation, Johnson wrote a Plan for the Dictionary. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, was {{the patron}} of the Plan, to Johnson's displeasure. Seven years after first meeting Johnson {{to go over the}} work, Chesterfield wrote two {{anonymous}} essays in The World recommending the Dictionary. He complained that the English language lacked structure and argued in support of the dictionary. Johnson did not like the tone of the essays, and he felt that Chesterfield had not fulfilled his obligations as the work's patron. In a letter to Chesterfield, Johnson expressed this view and harshly criticised Chesterfield, saying [...] "Is not a patron, my lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had been kind: but it has been delayed <b>till</b> <b>I</b> am indifferent and cannot enjoy it; <b>till</b> <b>I</b> am solitary and cannot impart it; <b>till</b> <b>I</b> am known and do not want it." [...] Chesterfield, impressed by the language, kept the letter displayed on a table for anyone to read.|$|E

500|$|According to Hubert Wellington, Delacroix—who {{would become}} the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after Géricault's death—wrote, [...] "Géricault allowed me to see his Raft of Medusa {{while he was still}} working on it.

500|$|As {{the debate}} continued, Thompson wrote, [...] "An {{industry}} {{that says a}} line cannot be drawn will be drawn and quartered." [...] He said of his campaign, [...] "I won't stop <b>till</b> <b>I</b> get {{the head of a}} record company or record chain in jail. Only then will they stop trafficking in obscenity". Bob Guccione, Jr., founder of Spin magazine, responded by calling Thompson [...] "a sort of latter-day Don Quixote, as equally at odds with his times as that mythical character was," [...] and argued that his campaign was achieving [...] "two things...: pissing everybody off and compounding his own celebrity". Thompson responded by noting, [...] "Law enforcement and I put 2 Live Crew's career back into the toilet where it began." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} Presley {{recorded}} [...] "I'm Moving On" [...] and [...] "Gentle on My Mind", leaving the studio {{while working on}} the latter to rest his throat. The following night, he did not appear, as his cold worsened, and on January 15 and 16 the house band recorded backing tracks for subsequent sessions. Presley returned on January 20, recording [...] "In the Ghetto" [...] in 23 takes and finishing the vocal track for [...] "Gentle on My Mind". On January 22, he recorded Eddy Arnold's [...] "I'll Hold You in My Heart (<b>Till</b> <b>I</b> Can Hold You in My Arms)" [...] and the non-album single [...] "Suspicious Minds". Presley then took a break from recording for a vacation trip to Aspen, Colorado to celebrate his daughter Lisa Marie's first birthday.|$|E

500|$|Michigan band Salem {{released}} a slowed-down {{version of the}} song, and made a music video featuring seemingly underage strippers and military footage. A remix featuring R. Kelly was leaked online on July 4, 2011. It features him singing the second verse, [...] "Slide up in this club / This beat's got me in love / <b>Till</b> <b>I</b> just don't care / It's like I'm walking on air / It's a party right here", and a new hook, where he repeats the line [...] "Party till the world ends". His vocals join those of Spears during the breakdown, and the song ends with Kelly doing runs over the chorus. A reporter from Idolator said, [...] "We'd much rather listen to Britney's original than this uninspired remix when doomsday comes." ...|$|E
500|$|Smart's {{behaviour}} {{was probably}} influenced by St Paul's command in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians to [...] "Pray without ceasing" [...] and William Law's The Spirit of Prayer, which {{argues that a}} constant state of prayer will establish a connection with God. Smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends' activities and call them into the street to pray with him. These calls for public prayer continued until an incident that Smart later described in Jubilate Agno: [...] "For I blessed God in St James's Park <b>till</b> <b>I</b> routed all the company... For the officers of the peace are at variance with me, and the watchman smites me with his staff" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 90–91).|$|E
500|$|On 11 November, he {{returned}} to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, also expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife. While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking [...] "So don't be ill any more my dear Charley <b>till</b> <b>I</b> can be with you to nurse you." [...] He found what they called [...] "Macaw Cottage" [...] (because of its gaudy interiors) in Gower Street, then moved his [...] "museum" [...] in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).|$|E

500|$|The Duke, [...] "much {{thinner and}} greatly altered", {{returned}} to England in November. His relationship with Anne had suffered further setbacks {{in recent months}} (she had refused to grant him his requested appointment of Captain-General for life, and had interfered in military appointments). The damage done to Marlborough's general standing was substantial {{because it was so}} visible. For now, though, the central issue was the Duchess whose growing resentment of Harley and Abigail had finally persuaded the Queen to be rid of her. Marlborough visited Anne on 17 January 1711 (O.S.) in a last attempt to save his wife, but she was not to be swayed, and demanded Sarah give up her Gold Key (the symbol of her office) within two days, warning, [...] "I will talk of no other business <b>till</b> <b>I</b> have the key".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{also took}} place in Manali and Film City in Mumbai. During filming of a flying stunt, one of the wires that was tied to Hrithik Roshan broke, causing him to fall 50 feet, though he landed safely on a shop's canopy. Hrithik {{described}} the incident as a [...] "freak accident", stating, [...] "I was skydiving to my death <b>till</b> <b>I</b> fell on a six-feet-long canopy of a shop that was out because of the slight drizzle. The canopy had iron rods. But I missed those rods too. What do I say? I guess the right word to describe the situation would be jadoo (magic)." [...] Roshan also suffered other injuries during the film's production. He tore the hamstring in his right leg during a circus scene, singed his hair while running through fire in another action scene, and broke his thumb and toe during strenuous training for the wirework.|$|E
500|$|Sunday, November 6 was a {{day when}} houses of worship in Honolulu offered prayers and thanks for the divine {{protection}} and safe return of their monarch. The Catholic Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu conducted the Te Deum hymn of praise. Attended by Kalākaua and Kapiolani, the King's ministry, {{and much of the}} Hawaiian government, thanks were given for divine protection during the royal journey. Former missionary Rev. Sereno E. Bishop of the Fort Street Church praised the King's historic journey, but condemned the Hawaiian culture for its [...] "decrepit paganism" [...] and [...] "bestialities of the hula hula". Kalākaua and Kapiolani attended the services at the Anglican Saint Andrew's Cathedral as private individuals, to hear a sermon on the Parable of the talents or minas based on the Gospel of Luke 19:13, [...] "And he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, 'Make use of it <b>till</b> <b>I</b> come.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{speaks about}} {{two women who}} chose not to end a {{friendship}} because {{of a man who}} has cheated both of them. Its theme is one of female independence. Beyoncé told MTV News that [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] is about female empowerment, in keeping with the theme of the album: [...] "It's about a guy who's kind of playing both of us, and instead of us arguing over the guy we say, 'Forget him. Let's stick together. He's a beautiful liar." [...] The chorus features the lines, [...] "Let's not kill the karma, let's not start a fight" [...] with the female protagonists bonding in their mutual betrayal. Beyoncé and Shakira sing with staccato, intense vocal approach throughout the song. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I didn't know about you then, <b>till</b> <b>I</b> saw you with him again" [...] earnestly while Shakira later adds [...] "I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing". In the end, the female protagonists conclude, [...] "we can live without him", referring to their cheating lover.|$|E
500|$|... "Just a Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Steve Robson, Claude Kelly and Wayne Hector, with {{production}} done by Robson. The song is a country pop ballad with elements of pop rock. The track is also Aguilera's first country song. It lasts for a duration of [...] (four minutes and 13 seconds). [...] "Just a Fool" [...] was composed in the key of G major, with a moderate slow tempo of 56 beats per minute. Many instruments were featured on the track, including keyboards, guitars and strings. It starts with a simple guitar riff and a toe-tapping mid-tempo drum beat. Chris Youne of 4Music described the song as a [...] "pop-meets-rock-meets-country" [...] song. Lyrically, [...] "Just a Fool" [...] talks about the pain of a break-up. Aguilera takes the first verse singing about sitting alone in a bar late at night, [...] "Another shot of whisky please bartender, keep it coming <b>till</b> <b>I</b> don't remember". At the second verse, Blake sings in his raspy country tones and the two unite for the chorus. Robert Cospey of Digital Spy described the chorus of the track as a [...] "sing-songy" [...] one.|$|E
500|$|Bene Viera of VH1 praised Brown [...] "for {{creating}} a video that fits perfectly with the song". Viera continued writing that the song [...] "wouldn't be [...] proper smoker's anthem" [...] without the cameo appearance by Snoop Dogg. Rob Markman of MTV News {{noted that the}} video was different from Brown's previous music videos for the Fortune album, writing that <b>Till</b> <b>I</b> Die' is a fun and welcomed departure from it all". A reviewer for Rap-Up described the video as [...] "wild" [...] and [...] "colorful", and noted {{that it seems to}} be inspired by the Beastie Boys' classic [...] "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" [...] (1987). Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "a weird one". Becky Bain of Idolator described it as [...] "the brats-on-parade clip", and wrote that the dedication to Yauch [...] "would be a nice sentiment if anything in this video resembled anything Yauch stood for". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice called it a [...] "dumb" [...] video and wrote that it reminded her of the [...] "Our Lips Are Sealed" [...] video by The Go-Go's.|$|E
