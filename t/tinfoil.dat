Both Mustaine and Ellefson had many phone conversations with Combat Records to get the cover artwork properly reproduced from a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover. However the studio lost the artwork, and instead made their own improvised and low-budget replacement, with which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified.|$|E
5|$|Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had {{starred in}} the title role of Roddenberry's earlier series on NBC, The Lieutenant; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes, which were {{produced}} by an expert contact lens fabricator who sandwiched wrinkled <b>tinfoil</b> between two sclera contact lenses which covered the entire eye. These were outdated even in the 1960s and dangerous {{to the health of the}} actors' eyes. Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them almost impossible to use. He needed to raise his face and sight along his nose in order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an arrogant and haughty demeanor.|$|E

50|$|Cyprinus is {{the genus}} of typical carps in family Cyprinidae. Most {{species in the}} genus are of East Asia origin with only the common carp (C. carpio) in Western Asia and Europe; this {{invasive}} species has also been introduced to many other regions around the world. Cyprinus {{are closely related to}} some more barb-like genera, such as Cyclocheilichthys and Barbonymus (<b>tinfoils).</b> The crucian carps (Carassius) of western Eurasia, which include the goldfish (C. auratus), are apparently not as closely related.|$|R
5|$|Szopka are {{traditional}} Polish nativity scenes dating to 19th century Kraków, Poland. Their modern construction incorporates elements of Kraków's historic architecture including Gothic spires, Renaissance facades, and Baroque domes, and utilizes everyday {{materials such as}} colored <b>tinfoils,</b> cardboard, and wood. Some are mechanized. Prizes are awarded for the most elaborately designed and decorated pieces in an annual competition held in Kraków's main square beside the statue of Adam Mickiewicz. Some of the best are then displayed in Kraków's Museum of History. Szopka were traditionally carried from door-to-door in the nativity plays (Jasełka) by performing groups.|$|R
40|$|A tin factory obtains its {{material}} from steel works. This consists of sheets of tinned iron {{which may have}} very diverging specifications with respect to length, width, thickness, and thicknesses of <b>tinfoils.</b> Prices per unit of volume vary with width and thickness. For large quantities {{of the same size}} discounts are given. As a consequence of the price structure it is often advantageous for the factory to order sheets of larger sizes than needed and to resell the leftover pieces as scarp. The question is which sizes and quantities one should order if one wishes to minimize total purchase cost. This problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem that is solved by Lagrangean relaxation and subgradient techniques...|$|R
25|$|Also {{important}} {{is the quality of}} the material: the earliest <b>tinfoil</b> recordings wore out fast. Once the <b>tinfoil</b> was removed from the cylinder it was nearly impossible to re-align in playable condition. The earliest soft wax recordings also wore out quite fast, although they have better fidelity than the early rubber discs.|$|E
25|$|Thomas A. Edison {{had invented}} the {{phonograph}} in 1877. But the fame bestowed on Edison for this invention (sometimes called his most original) was {{not due to}} its quality. Recording with his <b>tinfoil</b> phonograph was too difficult to be practical, as the <b>tinfoil</b> tore easily, and even when the stylus was properly adjusted, its reproduction of sound was distorted and squeaky, and good {{for only a few}} playbacks; nevertheless Edison had discovered the secret of sound recording. However he did not work to improve its quality, likely because of an agreement to spend the next five years developing the New York City electric light and power system.|$|E
25|$|The {{equipment}} most amateurs use to {{test the}} shape of the mirrors, a Foucault knife-edge test, is, like the tools used to create the surface, simple to fabricate. At its most basic it consists of a light bulb, a piece of <b>tinfoil</b> with a pinhole in it, and a razorblade.|$|E

25|$|Bell and Tainter {{developed}} wax-coated cardboard cylinders {{for their}} record cylinders instead of Edison's cast iron cylinder which {{was covered with}} a removable film of <b>tinfoil</b> (the actual recording media) that was prone to damage during installation or removal. Tainter received a separate patent for a tube assembly machine to automatically produce the coiled cardboard tubes which served as the foundation for the wax cylinder records.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of colored <b>tinfoil</b> to the pavilion (back) surfaces of gemstones was common practice during the Georgian and Victorian era; {{this was the}} first treatment—aside from cutting and polishing—applied to diamond. Foiled diamonds are mounted in closed-back jewelry settings, which may make their detection problematic. Under magnification, areas where the foil has flaked or lifted away are often seen; moisture that has entered between the stone and foil will also cause degradation and uneven color. Because of its antique status, the presence of foiled diamonds in older jewelry will not detract from its value.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Graham Bell died in 1922, {{and until}} {{recently}} no recordings of his voice were known to survive. On April 23, 2013, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, which houses a collection of Volta Laboratory materials, announced {{that one of its}} fragile Volta experimental sound recordings, a deteriorated wax-on-cardboard disc that can now be played safely by an optical scanning technology, had preserved the inventor's Scottish-tinged voice. Museum staff working with scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory had also revived the voice of his father, Alexander Melville Bell, from an 1881 recording in the wax-filled groove of a modified Edison <b>tinfoil</b> cylinder phonograph.|$|E

25|$|By 1881 the Volta Associates {{had succeeded}} in {{improving}} an Edison <b>tinfoil</b> phonograph significantly. They filled the groove of its heavy iron cylinder with wax, then instead of wrapping a sheet of foil around it and using a blunt stylus to indent the recording into the foil, as Edison did, they used a chisel-like stylus to engrave the recording into the wax. The result was a clearer recording. Rather than apply for a patent at that time, however, they sealed the machine into a metal box and deposited it at the Smithsonian, specifying {{that it was not}} to be opened without the consent of two of the three men. By 1937 Tainter was the only one of the Associates still living, and the box preserved at the Smithsonian was opened with his permission. For the occasion, descendants of Alexander Graham Bell gathered in Washington, but Tainter, who held a lifelong admiration of Bell, was too ill to attend and remained at home in San Diego.|$|E
500|$|After this setback, Colt {{turned his}} {{attention}} to perfecting <b>tinfoil</b> cartridges he had originally designed for use in his revolvers. The standard at the time was to have powder and ball contained in a paper or skin envelope or [...] "cartridge" [...] for ease of loading. However, if the paper got wet it would ruin the powder. Colt tried alternate materials such as rubber cement, but settled on a thin type of <b>tinfoil.</b> In 1841 he made samples of these cartridges for the army. During tests of the foil cartridges, 25 rounds were fired from a musket without cleaning. When the breech plug was removed from the barrel no fouling from the tin foil was evident. The reception was lukewarm and the army purchased a few thousand rounds for further testing. In 1843 the army returned to Colt with an order for 200,000 of the <b>tinfoil</b> cartridges packed 10 to a box for use in muskets.|$|E

[...] To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, {{but by the time}} they arrived in St. Louis they had only fifty cents. [...] Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; she thought he was joking, but did as he asked.

500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray {{had a more}} mixed reaction, {{giving the}} episode a rating of C+ and criticizing lead guest actor Cameron Monaghan, [...] "In this role, he was a drag, playing 'rebellious teen' in a stock, wooden way, with no extra layers. Also, nobody—not even Joshua Jackson, whom I've come to {{appreciate}} more as an actor over the run of this show—could make the 'My mind is being controlled!' scenes look anything other than goofy." [...] Murray also said, [...] "Yet for all my griping, I was quite taken with {{the theme of this}} episode, and the motifs that writers Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman and director Joe Chappelle used to support it. From the <b>tinfoil</b> Peter Pan hats that Walter and Astrid wear to Tyler popping the medication that grants him his powers out of a Pez dispenser, there's a lot in 'Of Human Action' about childish things." [...] Ramsey Isler from IGN graded the episode 8.0/10, explaining that despite it being a [...] "standalone" [...] episode, it was [...] "a high-intensity, action-filled tale that kept the adrenaline flowing. Fringe is usually more of a cerebral show, but there's nothing wrong with appealing to our love of action every now and then". Also positive was Chanel Reeder of Newsarama, who believed Fringe [...] "totally deliver in its most recent episode.

Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the clothes as mainly silvery, ranging from miniskirts to formal dresses, flesh-toned bodysuit to bikini to negligee. Pareles further noted that [...] "The wardrobe entices men, but it's also a means of self-assertion". J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the costumes during the show as [...] "spangly". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the costumes saying that [...] "every one [...] fabulously glamorous, most of them tailored to highlight the singer's ample cleavage {{and a pair of}} legs to rival Tina Turner's. At one point, when the legs were concealed by a long scarlet gown, wind blew from underneath to expose them." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe praised the floor-length gown but disliked the <b>tinfoil</b> mini worn by Knowles. Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised Knowles' look, saying that she was like a [...] "glittering goddess in a revealing outfit". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter also echoed her statements, [...] "to say that Beyonce looks terrific is probably redundant. Her fashion parade of form-fitting, eye-catching costumes -- most notably a belly dancer's get-up in which she demonstrated some hip-shaking moves that indicated Shakira better watch her back -- provided ample opportunities for shameless leering." [...] John Aizlewood of the Daily Mail described the fashion as [...] "majestic". Gordon Smart from the newspaper The Sun praised the [...] "sexy costumes" [...] like the silvery dresses worn by Knowles and added that [...] "her audiences certainly haven't had a bum deal".

2500|$|In 1877, Thomas Edison {{invented the}} phonograph. Unlike the phonautograph, it {{was capable of}} both {{recording}} and reproducing sound. Despite the similarity of name, there is no documentary evidence that Edison's phonograph was based on Scott's phonautograph. Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape, {{with the idea of}} creating a [...] "telephone repeater" [...] analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on. Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced, his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used <b>tinfoil</b> as a recording medium several months later. The <b>tinfoil</b> was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the <b>tinfoil</b> while the cylinder was rotated. The recording could be played back immediately. The Scientific American article that introduced the <b>tinfoil</b> phonograph to the public mentioned Marey, Rosapelly and Barlow as well as Scott as creators of devices for recording but, importantly, not reproducing sound. Edison also invented variations of the phonograph that used tape and disc formats. Numerous applications for the phonograph were envisioned, but although it enjoyed a brief vogue as a startling novelty at public demonstrations, the <b>tinfoil</b> phonograph proved too crude to be put to any practical use. A decade later, Edison developed a greatly improved phonograph that used a hollow wax cylinder instead of a foil sheet. This proved to be both a better-sounding and far more useful and durable device. The wax phonograph cylinder created the recorded sound market {{at the end of the}} 1880s and dominated it through the early years of the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|His first {{phonograph}} {{recorded on}} <b>tinfoil</b> around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality {{and that the}} recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences {{and one of the}} most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as [...] "the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other". In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes. The Washington Post described Edison as a [...] "genius" [...] and his presentation as [...] "a scene... that will live in history". Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878, he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, Bell {{received}} the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US$ in today's dollars) for {{the invention of}} the telephone from the Académie française, representing the French government. Among the luminaries who judged were Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. The Volta Prize was conceived by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, and named in honor of Alessandro Volta, with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history. Since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C.. These included the prestigious 'Volta Laboratory Association' (1880), also known as the Volta Laboratory and as the 'Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory', and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for <b>tinfoil</b> as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted. The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his [...] "proudest achievement", [...] "the photophone", the [...] "optical telephone" [...] which presaged fibre optical telecommunications while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.|$|E
