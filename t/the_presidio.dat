5|$|Del Valle {{was born}} in Jalisco, Mexico. His father, Antonio del Valle, was {{a soldier in the}} Spanish army who came to California in 1819 and was mayordomo (administrator and/or foreman) of Mission San Fernando Rey de España. Ygnacio joined the army as a cadet in 1825 at <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> of Santa Barbara. In 1828 he was {{promoted}} to second lieutenant and transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> of San Diego. In 1832, his commander became involved in a power struggle with the commandant of <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> of Monterey, where Antonio served. Ygnacio's side won the conflict on the battlefield, causing a rift between father and son, and they never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Presidio</b> {{was built}} to {{standard}} plans for a Spanish colonial military headquarters, using locally available materials, so the buildings forming the outer square were constructed with thick, solid adobe outer walls. The main gate opened into an open parade ground/plaza {{in the center of}} the square. The chapel stood at the center of the back of the square, facing the gate across the plaza. While it was never attacked by a strong military force during its sixty years of operation, <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> was subject to the assaults of nature. Several devastating earthquakes in the early 19th century destroyed much of the structure.|$|E

5|$|Indians {{confirmed}} in 1746 that French traders periodically arrived by sea {{to trade with}} tribes in the lower Trinity River region. Eight years later, the Spanish learned of rumors that the French had opened a trading post {{at the mouth of}} the Trinity River. In September 1754, the governor, Jacinto de Barrios y Jáuregui sent soldiers to investigate, and they captured five Frenchmen who had been living at an Indian village. To dissuade the French from returning, Spain built <b>the</b> <b>presidio</b> of San Agustín de Ahumada and the mission of Nuestra Señora de la Luz de Orcoquisac near the mouth of the Trinity at Galveston Bay. Conditions were awful at the new location, and both <b>the</b> <b>presidio</b> and the mission were closed in 1770.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Presidio</b> La Bahía {{was moved}} from the Guadalupe River to Goliad on the San Antonio River in 1749. Within five years, a new mission for the Karankawa tribes, Nuestra Señora del Rosario de los Cuhanes, was built {{upstream}} of <b>the</b> <b>presidio.</b> This mission survived for many years. Despite the new missions and presidios, Texas {{was one of the}} least populated provinces on the northern frontier of New Spain. By 1760, almost 1,200Hispanic people lived in Texas, with half in San Antonio, 350 at Los Adaes, and 260 at La Bahía. Other Spaniards lived in what is now the El Paso area, but that was considered part of New Mexico and not part of Texas.|$|E

5|$|Smith and Seguin {{confirmed}} {{the fate of}} the mission upon their return. Houston dispatched orders to Fannin to abandon Goliad, blow up <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> La Bahía fortress, and retreat to Victoria, but Fannin delayed acting on those orders. Believing the approach of Urrea's troops brought a greater urgency to local civilians, he sent 29 men under Captain Amon B. King to help evacuate nearby Refugio.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Presidio</b> Chapel and {{courtyard}} {{were also}} completed during {{the construction of}} the quadrangle.

25|$|To support <b>the</b> <b>presidios</b> and <b>the</b> missions, {{half a dozen}} towns (called pueblos) were {{established}} in California. The pueblos of Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, Villa de Branciforte (later abandoned before later becoming Santa Cruz, California) and the pueblo of San Jose, California were all established to support <b>the</b> Missions and <b>presidios</b> in California. These were the only towns (pueblos) in California.|$|R

5|$|Ygnacio {{then moved}} to the Monterey Presidio and {{was in charge of}} the {{secularization}} of Mission Santa Cruz and Mission San Francisco de Asís. He became a trusted officer, enough to be left in charge of <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> in José Figueroa's absence. For his service to the Mexican Army, del Valle received the Rancho El Tejon land grant in 1843. During this time, he married Maria de Los Angeles in 1842, who died in childbirth five years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1575, a Spanish {{exploration}} party led by Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeno {{landed in}} Drakes Bay near Point Reyes {{and was the}} first European settler to claim land in the Bay Area. He was soon followed in 1579 by Sir Francis Drake, who also landed in Drakes Bay and claimed the land for England. The San Francisco Bay itself remained undiscovered by Europeans until a Spanish expedition led by Gaspar de Portolà sailed through the Golden Gate Strait in 1769. Further expeditions by Spanish explorers in the following years include those led by Juan Bautista de Anza who colonized <b>the</b> <b>Presidio,</b> and Gabriel Moraga who started at <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> and led expedition parties to San Jose and over the Pacheco Pass, as well as reaching the San Joaquin Valley. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain and the Bay Area became part of the Mexican province of Alta California, a period characterized by ranch life and visiting American trappers. Mexico's control of the territory would be short-lived, however, and in 1846, a party of settlers occupied Sonoma Plaza and proclaimed the independence of the new Republic of California. That same year, the Mexican-American War began, and American captain John Berrien Montgomery sailed the USS Portsmouth into the bay and seized San Francisco, which was then known as Yerba Buena, and raised the American flag for the first time over Portsmouth Square.|$|E
5|$|In May 1769, Gaspar de Portolà {{established}} the Fort Presidio of San Diego {{on a hill}} near the San Diego River. It was the first settlement by Europeans {{in what is now}} the state of California. In July of the same year, Mission San Diego de Alcalá was founded by Franciscan friars under Junípero Serra. By 1797, the mission boasted the largest native population in Alta California, with over 1,400 neophytes living in and around the mission proper. Mission San Diego was the southern anchor in California of the historic mission trail El Camino Real. Both <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> and the Mission are National Historic Landmarks.|$|E
5000|$|However, after Mexican {{independence}} {{the resources}} and manpower devoted to <b>the</b> <b>presidios</b> declined. In Sonora, in 1833, the state government solicited public donations to bolster its defenses, and in 1834 briefly reduced salaries of all state officials by 10 to 33 percent to devote the money to enlisting more soldiers. [...] In Chihuahua, in 1832, to supplement <b>the</b> <b>presidios</b> all civilian men were ordered to carry weapons at all times, all occupied places were ordered to be fortified, and local defense forces were organized. By the early 1840s Chihuahua had 1.500 soldiers under arms in addition to local defense forces. However, much of this force was devoted to protecting {{the eastern part of}} the state against Comanches rather than fighting the Apache.|$|R
500|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{believed that}} settlers would defend their property, alleviating {{the need for}} some of <b>the</b> <b>presidios.</b> Texas was an unappealing prospect for most settlers, however, due to the armed nomadic tribes, high costs, and lack of precious metals. In 1731, the Spanish government resettled ...|$|R
50|$|The first Spanish {{missions}} to the Indians of Florida, {{starting with the}} foundation of St. Augustine in 1565, were attached to presidios. Between 1565 and 1567 ten presidios were established at major harbors from Port Royal Sound to Tampa Bay to prevent other European powers from establishing bases in the area. Most of <b>the</b> <b>presidios</b> were unsustainable. San Mateo was destroyed by the French, the entire garrison at Tocobago was wiped out, and most of <b>the</b> other <b>presidios</b> were abandoned because of the hostility of the local Indians {{and the difficulty of}} providing supplies. By 1573 <b>the</b> only remaining <b>presidios</b> in Florida were St. Augustine and Santa Elena, and Santa Elena was abandoned (for a second time) in 1587.|$|R
5|$|Norton {{spent his}} days {{inspecting}} San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, {{given to him by}} officers of the United States Army post at <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{learned of}} La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could {{threaten}} Spain's {{control over the}} Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate the settlement. The unsuccessful expeditions helped Spain {{to better understand the}} geography of the Gulf Coast region. When the Spanish finally discovered the remains of the French colony at the fort in 1689, they buried the cannons and burned the buildings. Years later, Spanish authorities built a presidio at the same location. When <b>the</b> <b>presidio</b> was abandoned, the site of the French settlement was lost to history.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area is {{presently}} {{home to a}} thriving computer animation industry led by Pixar Animation Studios and Industrial Light & Magic. Pixar, based in Emeryville, produced the first fully computer animated feature film, Toy Story, with software it designed in-house and whose computer animation films have since garnered 26 Academy Awardss and critical acclaim. Industrial Light & Magic, {{which is based in}} <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> in San Francisco, was created in 1975 to help create visual effects for the Star Wars series has since been involved with creating visual effects for over three hundred Hollywood films.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} of human habitation {{of the territory}} of the city of San Francisco dates to 3000BC. The Yelamu group of the Ohlone people resided in a few small villages when an overland Spanish exploration party, led by Don Gaspar de Portolà, arrived on November 2, 1769, the first documented European visit to San Francisco Bay. Seven years later, on March 28, 1776, the Spanish established <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> of San Francisco, followed by a mission, Mission San Francisco de Asís (Mission Dolores), established by the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months after}} his return from Korea, Dean was {{assigned}} as the Deputy Commanding General of the Sixth United States Army at <b>the</b> <b>Presidio</b> of San Francisco in California. Dean held this post for two years until he retired from active duty on the 31st of October in 1955. Upon retirement Dean was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge for his front line service in World War II and Korea; general officers are not usually eligible, since they are not usually participants in front line combat, and Dean was only the second general to receive the award.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to Cos, {{as early}} as September 18, several Texians, {{including}} James Fannin, Philip Dimmitt, and John Lin, had independently begun advocating a plan to seize Cos at either Copano or Goliad. As soon as Cos's warships were spotted approaching Copano Bay, Refugio colonists sent messengers to San Felipe de Austin and Matagorda to inform the other settlements of Cos's imminent arrival. Concerned {{that a lack of}} artillery would make <b>the</b> <b>presidio</b> at Goliad impossible to capture, the central committee chose not to order an assault.|$|E
