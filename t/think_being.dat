25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I <b>think</b> <b>being</b> a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E
500|$|Of the couple's relationship, Sharp has stated, [...] "Some guys might <b>think</b> <b>being</b> {{married to}} someone as famous as Rosie {{is a tough}} position, but I don't, I'm very proud of her." [...] Sharp and Napravnik split their time between homes in Louisville and New Orleans. [...] Besides working with horses, the pair also provide foster care to rescue dogs.|$|E
2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's I <b>think</b> <b>being</b> gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but I think {{it was such a}} time when you didn't talk about issues that were personal, and I think that made him much more secretive and reclusive, and I think that was {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|E

2500|$|On 18 June 2014, McIlroy {{declared}} that he would represent Ireland (if he qualified) at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games, where golf became an Olympic event {{for the first time}} since 1904. In 2012 he had expressed an interest in representing Great Britain as opposed to Ireland, however in January 2013 he was considering the options of playing for Britain or Ireland or not playing at all, stating; [...] "I just <b>think</b> <b>being</b> from where we're from, we're placed in a very difficult position. I feel Northern Irish and obviously being from Northern Ireland you have a connection to Ireland and a connection to the UK. If I could and there was a Northern Irish team I'd play for Northern Ireland. Play for one side or the other – or not play at all because I may upset too many people… Those are my three options I'm considering very carefully", before choosing Ireland in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Boston Herald reviewer Mark A. Perigard {{called the}} show a [...] "dismal effort" [...] {{and said the}} Bruce character was such an offensive gay stereotype that he [...] "would get shunned even on Bravo's Queer Eye". Perigard said of the episode, [...] "Go ahead and watch, but don't blame me when brain matter starts to dribble out your ears." [...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe called the show a [...] "relentless, mediocre spoofery that so desperately wants {{to remind us of}} Monty Python and the Holy Grail". However, Gilbert said the show might work better in half-hour increments, rather than in the one-hour premiere with [...] "Wench Trouble" [...] and [...] "Golden Powers". Reuters writer Daniel Carlson said the show was [...] "exactly as bad as you would fear". Carlson said the jokes were bad and that delivery from the actors is too exaggerated; he also said some of the dialogue, particularly from Bruce, is [...] "so head-shakingly bad that it evokes pity for Ray, who had to say it aloud." [...] Curt Wagner of RedEye said he did not enjoy or appreciate the gay jokes: [...] "Do the writers really <b>think</b> <b>being</b> gay is funny?" [...] However, Wagner said he enjoyed the episode as a whole and particularly liked Matt Lucas, who he said was [...] "just too entertaining as he calls for 'juice and muffins' after mistakenly killing someone".|$|E
2500|$|According to The Washington Post, [...] "some UN {{employees}} and delegates" [...] expressed resentment at Ban's perceived favoritism in {{the appointment of}} South Korean nationals in key posts. Previous UN chiefs such as Kurt Waldheim (Austria), Javier Pérez de Cuéllar (Peru), and Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their country's Foreign Ministry, and South Korean nationals have been historically underrepresented at the United Nations. Nonetheless, according to [...] "some officials" [...] in the Post story, Ban had allegedly gone further, boosting South Korea's presence in UN ranks by more than 20 percent during {{his first year in}} office. In response, Ban and his aides stated that the allegations of favoritism are wrong, and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of racism. He said that the South Korean nationals he had appointed—including Choi Young-jin, who had already served as a high-ranking official in the United Nations' peacekeeping department—are highly qualified for their positions. Others such as Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, said that the complaints were driven by envy: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>being</b> from South Korea, and people have growing respect for South Korea, that's a great enhancement for the secretary general. If he brings along talented people who he knows very well, I think that's also a plus." [...] UN records show that South Korea, the organization's eleventh-largest financial contributor, had only 54 South Korean nationals assigned to its mission six months before Ban took over the top UN post. By contrast, the Philippines, a significantly poorer country, had 759 nationals in its mission.|$|E

2500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Good for You" [...] {{was directed by}} Sophie Muller. In the video, Gomez wanted to represent her journey to womanhood and to promote female empowerment — which she felt strongly about and wanted to depict in a raw and vulnerable way. With the clip, she wanted to prove that young women should not be self-conscious of their sex appeal or be obliged to wear lingerie to feel attractive. [...] "I feel like people here, especially guys are like, 'Ah, lingerie and sexy.' I <b>think</b> <b>being</b> sexy {{as a young woman}} or girl, is not caring what other people think, wearing like casual things, feeling sexy". The singer felt it was important to collaborate with a female director as a means of female empowerment and wanted the visual to be raw and vulnerable. She was also drawn to jeans and T-shirt attire and believed it would prove to women that they need not dress in lingerie to feel attractive. She chose the video to be specifically about her, absent of a love interest or men, to reflect the song's meaning of female self-empowerment. She later said Muller [...] "created a beautiful and intimate visual representation" [...] of [...] "Good for You". Speaking of the music video's theme, Gomez stated, [...] "It's very jeans and a T-shirt, moments where a woman is deep in thought, or in a moment where she's in this crazy little rage. It just captures real things that women do. There {{are a lot of things}} that women do that are sexy that aren't just the typical, cheap way of being sexy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first eleven episodes {{were set}} {{primarily}} in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about the}} setting of the third season stating, [...] "Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It’s really allowing us, as writers, to dig deep into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I <b>think</b> <b>being</b> in Neverland {{is going to have a}} profound effect on each of the characters. It’s really fun to see these characters and dig deep this year and explore what it’s like for Emma to [...] her parents. Neverland is really a place where we can sit down and think about that." [...] The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more [...] "complicated" [...] version of the character, with Kitsis saying, [...] "We have not yet met Peter Pan and we have not yet seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!" [...] In a further interview, Horowitz stated, [...] "Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up there, you have to keep yourself amused. However long Peter Pan has been there and for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our take on that and on the legend of Peter Pan. We have a way that it intertwines with our Once Upon a Time mythology that we're really excited to unveil." [...] At Disney's D23 Expo event, the creators hinted at romantic sparks between Emma Swan and Captain Hook, and revelations about how Hook became a pirate. On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney. Later that month, it was announced that the season finale will air on May 11, 2014 and have a duration of two hours.|$|E

She looked almost stern, so that Mary, trying to smile at her, only succeeded in producing a silent stare of interrogation.|$|E

[...] "I really feared that I had spoken thoughtlessly. It is a terrible confession for a clergyman to make--but it is not the less true that I am one of the most indiscreet men living. It is my rock ahead in life that I say the first thing which comes uppermost, without stopping to <b>think.</b> <b>Being</b> well aware of my own defects, I naturally distrust myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>being</b> disgraced {{in school}} {{is a great deal}} tryinger than {{anything}} bad boys can do," [...] said Amy, shaking her head, as if her experience of life had been a deep one. [...] "Susie Perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted it dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might. Well, she drew a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, 'Young ladies, my eye is upon you!' coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing. We were laughing over it {{when all of a sudden}} his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring up her slate. She was parrylized with fright, but she went, and oh, what do you think he did? He took her by the ear--the ear! Just fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding the slate so everyone could see." ...|$|E
60|$|Necessarily, {{you might}} <b>think,</b> <b>being</b> full of monks' dresses. Not so. Was there {{any need for}} Giotto to have put the priest {{at the foot of}} the dead body, with the black banner stooped over it in the shape of a grave? Might he not, had he chosen, in either fresco, have made the {{celestial}} visions brighter? Might not St. Francis have appeared in the centre of a celestial glory to the dreaming Pope, or his soul been seen of the poor monk, rising through more radiant clouds? Look, however, how radiant, in the small space allowed out of the blue, they are in reality. You cannot anywhere see a lovelier piece of Giottesque colour, though here, you have to mourn over the smallness of the piece, and its isolation. For the face of St. Francis himself is repainted, and all the blue sky; but the clouds and four sustaining angels are hardly retouched at all, and their iridescent and exquisitely graceful wings are left with really very tender and delicate care by the restorer of the sky. And no one but Giotto or Turner could have painted them.|$|E
