40|$|The {{intake system}} {{is one of}} the {{components}} on the internal combustion engine most linked with the achievement of the high volumetric efficiency required of naturally aspirated engines. High performance racing engine intake systems have unusual geometry with separate intake pipes (often known as intake trumpets) housed in a common airbox. These intake trumpets are short pipes that are sometimes cylindrical but often conical. The flow within the intake system is very unsteady with high frequency wave action taking place. A carefully developed intake trumpet can use the wave action <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and therefore increase the performance distinctly. The intake tuning is strongly dependent on the acoustic properties of the intake system. Two important parameters are the pressure wave reflection coefficient at the open inflow end of the intake pipe (<b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> effectively) and the acoustic length of the intake pipe (<b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at the appropriate engine speed). Acoustic measurements show that the open inflow end reflection coefficient decreases with inflow but increases with external (coaxial) flow. CFD calculations show that the vena contract a which gets created at the open inflow to the pipe disappears with coaxial flow. A conical inflow shape decreases the reflection coefficient at certain frequencies and influences the phase angle of the acoustic waves. One dimensional prediction models for the wave transfer inside these conical intake pipes are validated against acoustic measurement results. 4 The airbox decreases the reflection coefficient distinctly due to three dimensional resonances inside the airbox and limits the use of one dimensional prediction models, but the acoustic length can still be predicted accurately. Fuelling inside the intake pipe decreases the speed of sound by 10 % and thus increases the acoustic pipe length. Therefore it influences the engine tuning and needs be considered when developing intake systems. A new acoustic measurement method is introduced which allows the measurement of the acoustic pipe length within the conical part of the intake pipe. Finally, the time varying nature of the intake flow and intake acoustics is explored on a running racing engine by means of hot-wire and pressure measurements and shows the influence of intake acoustics on the fluctuating intake airflow velocity especially during the period when the intake valves are closed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{step by step}} how held REPAIR AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION AND TUNING MOTOR VEHICLE DODGE DAKOTA 1995 The {{main objective}} of the project is to repair the automatic transmission, but it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> for then check the actual state of the case. When you mention tuning the engine some think only maintenance is performed {{but it should be}} emphasized that the engine had some significant flaws and that correction was necessary; to carry out it was put into practice knowledge acquired in college {{and with the help of}} manual and painstaking research the various engine problems were resolved. Once the engine tuning was completed it was found the actual state of automatic transmission and the diagnosis, transmission has its roots even before it had been repaired but was not a success, because of this the car passed without work near one year. Overall, this project some considerable problems were corrected and is not only limited to repair by replacing a part with a new one, but the analysis of the causes that produced damage, so bring a final solution to all problems...|$|E
40|$|A {{project was}} carried out in {{conjunction}} with an Australian dredging company and served the purpose of increasing their operational efficiency through advanced monitoring and control. A system consisting of wireless communications, PLCs, HMIs and SCADA was implemented to provide the dredge operator and management staff remote monitoring and control of the operation. The pre-existing dredging arrangement relied on frequent visits to the land-based engine-driven booster pump <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> speed for optimal pipeline flow. These visits were carried out by land-based staff, {{at the request of the}} offshore dredge operator who monitors the flow via a magnetic flowmeter. The dredge operator needed to control the booster pump remotely to save time and resources. For improved project supervision, it was also envisaged that management should have access to daily shift reports and live monitoring from the office. Electrical systems were implemented at the dredge and booster pump to accommodate wireless and wired industrial networks. The new arrangement allows the dredge operator to monitor and control operations via a HMI display mounted in the dredge cabin. From the cabin, the dredge operator can view data from both engines and process instrumentation such as pipeline flow. The booster pump also contains a HMI display from which it can be independently monitored and controlled. A SCADA system was installed on the dredge to generate daily reports and provide management with live access to operations from the office. The new system was a complete success increasing production efficiency and improving operations management. Eliminating visits to the booster pump and improved supervision of equipment significantly reduces dredging downtime. Access to daily reporting and live operations allows management to supervise operations without travelling to site resulting in cost and time savings. This project not only provides a solution to a gap in the dredging market, it provides a knowledge-base for future students or engineers to continue development of diesel engine monitoring and control using commercially available components...|$|E
40|$|As the {{semiconductor}} industry moves into the deep submicron range, {{the costs associated with}} wafer processing are increasing rapidly. This calls for improved simulation capabilities that provide information for meaningful “what-if ” analyses. This work proposes a common methodology for extracting information from Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Dissolu-tion Rate Monitor (DRM) and ellipsometry measurements, to be ultimately used for the calibration of commercial lithography simulation tools. Using global optimization techniques, this approach uses cross-section CD data available in fabs <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>the</b> simulation <b>engine,</b> thus giving it the predictive capabilities that could potentially improve yield ramp rates and hence reduce development costs.

In the noise cancellation mode, a maximum of 3 [*]dB bass enhancement can be achieved with significant noise suppression, while higher bass enhancement can be achieved in the bass enhance mode. The results show that the proposed system is effective for solving both the bass audio reproduction and the noise control problems in automobile cabins...|$|R

40|$|The first {{processing}} block {{within a}} Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receiver is <b>the</b> acquisition <b>engine.</b> As it {{may represent a}} bottleneck for subsequent blocks in the receiver chain, it is essential <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>the</b> acquisition <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> have any chance in designing an efficient receiver.

Moreover, the Mean Acquisition Time (MAT) is often used as a performance metric and usually derived using probability generating functions and flow graph diagrams based on Markov processes. In this paper, an intuitive technique based on acquisition time and MAT diagrams is presented and used to derive an expression of the MAT as well as to analyze its constitutive terms. The MAT of a standard acquisition engine is compared to that of a P 2 P engine with a thorough investigation of a Gaussian search order and zig-zag search strategy to assess the performance improvement brought about by P 2 P networks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In modern {{process control}} systems, Ethernet is {{achieving}} a leading position, proposing {{itself as a}} network capable of supporting all communication needs at all levels in the Computer Integrated Manufacturing hierarchy. The main obstacle to using Ethernet at the Field level is the nondeterminism of the Ethernet MAC protocol, which cannot provide real-time traffic with bounded channel access times. This paper focuses on industrial applications featuring soft real-time constraints, such as periodic control or industrial multimedia, which do not require deterministic guarantees on deadline meeting. To cope with this class of applications, Ethernet {{should be able to}} guarantee the timely delivery of real-time packets in statistical terms. The paper presents fuzzy traffic smoothing, a technique to perform adaptive traffic smoothing over Ethernet networks at the Field level thus enabling them to provide a statistical bound on packet delivery time. Previous work showed that the fuzzy smoother outperforms other adaptive smoothers proposed in the literature. This paper addresses fuzzy smoother optimization through genetic algorithms. The proposed optimization is applied <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>the</b> inference <b>engine</b> membership functions. <b>The</b> results obtained show the effectiveness of the approach. Index Terms—Ethernet, fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, realtime communication, traffic smoothing. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Modern {{automotive}} {{petrol engine}} performance is significantly affected by effective tune-up. Current practice of engine tune-up {{relies on the}} experience of the automotive engineer, and tune-up is usually done by trial-and-error method and then <b>the</b> vehicle <b>engine</b> is run on the dynamometer to show <b>the</b> actual <b>engine</b> performance. Obviously <b>the</b> current practice involves a large amount of time and money, and then may even fail <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> up <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> optimally because a formal performance model of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> has not been determined yet. With an emerging technique, Support Vector Machines (SVM), the approximate per-formance model of a petrol vehicle engine can be determined by training <b>the</b> sample <b>engine</b> performance data acquired from the dynamometer. The number of dynamometer tests for an engine tune-up can therefore be reduced because <b>the</b> estimated <b>engine</b> performance model can replace the dynamometer tests to a certain extent. In this paper, the construction, validation and accuracy of the model are discussed. The study showed that the predicted results agree well with the actual test results. To illustrate the significance of the SVM methodology, the results were also compared with that regressed using multilayer feedforward neural networks...|$|R
40|$|This {{innovation}} {{replaces the}} linear alternator presently used in Stirling engines with a continuous-gradient, impedance-matched, oscillating magnetostrictive transducer that eliminates all moving parts via compression, maintains high efficiency, costs less to manufacture, reduces mass, and {{eliminates the need}} for a bearing system. The key components of this new technology are the use of stacked magnetostrictive materials, such as Terfenol-D, under a biased magnetic and stress-induced compression, continuous-gradient impedance-matching material, coils, force-focusing metallic structure, and supports. The acoustic energy from <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> travels through an impedancematching layer that is physically connected to the magnetostrictive mass. Compression bolts keep the structure under compressive strain, allowing for the micron-scale compression of the magnetostrictive material and eliminating the need for bearings. The relatively large millimeter displacement of the pressure side of the impedance-matching material is reduced to micron motion, and undergoes stress amplification at the magnetostrictive interface. The alternating compression and expansion of the magnetostrictive material creates an alternating magnetic field that then induces an electric current in a coil that is wound around the stack. This produces electrical power from the acoustic pressure wave and, if the resonant frequency is <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> match <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> can replace <b>the</b> linear alternator that is commonly used...|$|R
40|$|Exhaust {{emissions}} from motor vehicles vary widely and depend on {{factors such as}} engine operating conditions, fuel, age, mileage and service history. A method has been devised to rapidly identify high-polluting vehicles as they travel on the road. The method is able to monitor {{emissions from}} a large number of vehicles in a short time and avoids the need to conduct expensive and time consuming tests on chassis dynamometers. A sample of the exhaust plume is captured as each vehicle passes a roadside monitoring station and the pollutant emission factors are calculated from the measured concentrations using carbon dioxide as a tracer. Although, similar methods have been used to monitor soot and gaseous mass emissions, to-date it has not been used to monitor particle number emissions from a large fleet of vehicles. This is particularly important as epidemiological studies have shown that particle number concentration is an important parameter in determining adverse health effects. The method was applied to measurements of particle number emissions from individual buses in the Brisbane City Council diesel fleet operating on the South-East Busway. Results indicate that the particle number emission factors are gamma- distributed, with a high proportion of the emissions being emitted by {{a small percentage of the}} buses. Although most of the high-emitters are the oldest buses in the fleet, there are clear exceptions, with some newer buses emitting as much. We attribute this to their recent service history, particularly pertaining <b>to</b> improper <b>tuning</b> of <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> We recommend that a targeted correction program would be a highly effective measure in mitigating urban environmental pollution...|$|R
40|$|NASA and Pratt & Whitney will {{collaborate}} under a Space Act Agreement {{to perform}} spin {{testing of the}} impact damper to verify damping effectiveness and durability. Pratt & Whitney will provide the turbine blade and damper hardware for the tests. NASA will provide the facility and perform the tests. Effectiveness and durability will be investigated during and after sustained sweeps of rotor speed through resonance. Tests of a platform wedge damper are also planned to compare its effectiveness {{with that of the}} impact damper. Results from baseline tests without dampers will be used to measure damping effectiveness. The self-tuning impact damper combines two damping methods-the tuned mass damper and the impact damper. It consists of a ball located within a cavity in the blade. This ball rolls back and forth on a spherical trough under centrifugal load (tuned mass damper) and can strike the walls of the cavity (impact damper). The ball s rolling natural frequency is proportional to the rotor speed and can be designed to follow an engine-order line (integer multiple of rotor speed). Aerodynamic forcing frequencies typically follow these engineorder lines, and a damper <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> order will most effectively reduce blade vibrations when the resonant frequency equals the engine-order forcing frequency. This damper has been tested in flat plates and turbine blades in the Dynamic Spin Facility. During testing, a pair of plates or blades rotates in vacuum. Excitation is provided by one of three methods [...] eddy-current engine-order excitation (ECE), electromechanical shakers, and magnetic bearing excitation. The eddy-current system consists of magnets located circumferentially around the rotor. As a blade passes a magnet, a force is imparted on the blade. The number of magnets used can be varied to change <b>the</b> desired <b>engine</b> order of <b>the</b> excitation. The magnets are remotely raised or lowered to change the magnitude of the force on the blades. The other two methods apply force to the rotating shaft itself at frequencies independent of the rotor speed. During testing, blade vibration is monitored with strain gauges and laser displacement probes...|$|R
