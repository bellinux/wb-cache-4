First, the thesis deals with evaluation of tax autonomy of Czech municipalities within international comparison and then it focuses on question how much municipalities use their <b>tax</b> <b>competence.</b> Therefore, municipalities are divided into size categories such as 0 [...] 500, 501 [...] 2 000, 2001 [...] 5 000, 5001 [...] 10 000, 10 001 [...] 20 000 and 20 001 [...] 50 000 inhabitants. One of the conclusion of my thesis is finding the high measure of aversion of particular municipalities with respect to the local taxation. Thus, municipalities are not willing to increase their responsibility for tax revenue not from the perspective of economic reason but primarily because of political reason. Elected representatives of municipalities have the feeling that the expansion of their <b>tax</b> <b>competence</b> is in conflict with the aim of their re-election. Therefore, these elected representatives insist on the central level responsibility for taxation and administrative security of tax administration. This attitude might be observed across all observed size categories of municipalities. The methodology for this thesis {{is going to be a}} questionnaire survey when for this purpose mayors of randomly selected municipalities have been joined, then the analysis of selected tax revenues and the following comparison of data among particular size categories of municipalities...|$|E

In Switzerland <b>tax</b> <b>competence</b> and spending decisions are highly decentralised. In order to make such as system operational an intergovernmental transfer system is needed. Today {{it does not work}} in a satisfactory manner, however. In particular, the autonomy of the cantons is in danger. Therefore, {{the federal government and the}} cantons have commonly decided to launch an ambitious reform programme. The so-called "new fiscal equalisation system "includes the decentralisation of public tasks, the reorganisation of the vertical and horizontal co-operation among jurisdictions and the equalisation of fiscal resources and burdens.

It results from the analysis of the EU legislation and case law that, in many respects, EU law not only restricts the exercise by regional and local authorities of the autonomous taxing powers that have been allocated to them in the internal legal order but also limits the autonomy of the MS to organize the allocation of taxing powers between different levels of power...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} existing <b>tax</b> <b>competences</b> in EU law, in {{the light}} of European and international obligations, and their evolution since the initial founding of the European Economic Community. It approaches this task not just from the perspective of competences, but examines values, objectives, obligations and actual governance capacities underpinning the implementation and realisation of these aims and duties in the field of taxation. The analysis is linked to discourses addressing sustainability gaps within EU taxation law and policy, in particular: a prevailing focus on economic growth; a lack of EU-level environmental taxation; an absence of tax measures that tackle, much less consider inequalities in income and wealth; and, persisting socio-economic inequalities between men and women. The concept of sustainable development features prominently in the objectives of the European Union and is closely linked to the function of the internal market. The implications of sustainability for legal obligations, however, remain unclear, and particularly so in the context of taxation. This paper provides an outline of the current legal framework for positive and negative integration of taxation, and considers the evolution of values, objectives and obligations in European and International law with a particular focus on the legal concept of sustainable development. From this basis, it examines legislative capacities to address the economic, ecological and social dimensions of sustainable development in the area of taxation and offers preliminary options for the amendment of hard and soft law mechanisms, so as fully to support European values and objectives in the field of taxation...|$|R

40|$|O imposto sobre produtos industrializados é um tributo de competência da União, nos termos do art. 153, IV da Constituição Federal, sendo objeto de estudos do presente trabalho. Considerando que o imposto sobre produtos industrializados teve sua origem no imposto sobre consumo, iniciamos o trabalho traçando a evolução histórica desse tributo nas Constituições Federais, para melhor compreensão de suas características, e de sua materialidade, que se apresenta com interpretações divergentes. As materialidades do IPI foram construídas a partir do texto constitucional que prescreveu a sua incidência sobre produto industrializado, bem como das disposições da lei complementar, que estabeleceu três hipóteses de incidência, mas, {{considerando que}} a lei ordinária instituiu apenas duas delas, o desenvolvimento do trabalho circunscreveu-se às construções das regras-matrizes de incidência de importação de produtos industrializados e industrialização de produtos para o mercado interno. Os critérios das regras-matrizes foram analisados e desenvolvidos, tendo sido abordados os critérios da hipótese material, espacial e temporal, bem como os critérios do consequente pessoal e quantitativo. Por meio do exame de alguns princípios constitucionais aplicados ao IPI, delinearam-se suas principais características, fundamentalmente, pela possibilidade de o Poder Executivo alterar as alíquotas por Decreto, mas dentro dos limites estabelecidos pela lei, o que releva afirmar a observância do princípio da legalidade. O princípio da anterioridade se aplica ao IPI somente quanto à anterioridade nonagesimal, não se lhe aplicando a anterioridade anual. Tratou-se do princípio da não cumulatividade, que objetiva salvaguardar o direito de {{abatimento}} entre as operações havidas e, consequentemente, tornar o produto final mais barato, e se realizou o exame do direito de crédito do contribuinte como repercussão do princípio da não cumulatividade. Por fim, a seletividade pela essencialidade foi analisada conjuntamente com a extrafiscalidade, resultando na conclusão de que a essencialidade é categoria autônoma, sendo fator determinante na fixação da carga tributária e política fiscal impositiva, onde as medidas atinentes aos produtos essenciais são peremptórias, não se confundindo com a extrafiscalidade, cujas medidas são desejadas pelo Estado, com liberdade de escolha e da forma de execução, podendo a seletividade ser aplicada na essencialidade e na extrafiscalidadeThe Tax on Industrialized Products (IPI) is a <b>tax</b> of Union <b>competence,</b> pursuant to art. 153, IV of the Federal Constitution, {{and it is}} the subject of study of this work. Whereas such a tax had its origin in the excise tax, we began this study by tracing the historical evolution of this tax in Federal Constitutions, for better understanding its characteristics, and of its materiality, which has varying interpretations. The materiality of the IPI were built from the Constitution which prescribed its impact on industrialized product {{as well as from the}} additional provisions of the law, which established three hypotheses incidence, but, considering that the ordinary law instituted only two of them, the work development is confined to the constructions of matrix rules of incidence of importing manufactured goods and industrialization of products for the domestic market. The criteria of the matrix-rules were developed and analyzed, by addressing the criteria of the material, spatial and temporal hypothesis, as well as the consequent quantitative and personal criteria. Through examination of some constitutional principles applied to IPI, its main features were outlined basically by the Executive Branch s ability to alter the rates by means of a Decree, but within the limits established by law, which allows stating the principle of legality. The principle of precedence is applied to the IPI only in relation to the 90 -day holding period, not being applied to the same tax year. The principle of non-cumulative tax, which aims to safeguard the right of rebate rate incurred among operations and therefore to make the end product more cheaply, was studied as well as the examination of the taxpayer s right to credit as repercussions of the principle of non-cumulative tax was held. Finally, the selectivity for essentiality was analyzed jointly with extrafiscality, resulting in the conclusion that the essentiality is an independent category and the determining factor in setting the tax burden and imposing fiscal policy, where the measures relating to essential commodities are peremptory, not mingling with extrafiscalidade, whose measures are desired by the State, with freedom for choosing and applying, in which selectivity can be applied in essentiality and extrafiscalit...|$|R
