5|$|Meksi's {{work was}} {{important}} {{for the development of}} written Albanian, and his endeavors strengthened <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> a stable Albanian alphabet had to be created. His translation served as the basis for Joseph Ritter von Xylander's studies of the Albanian language, which definitively refuted the thesis that the language had a Tatar origin. Von Xylander concluded that Albanian had an Indo-European root.|$|E
5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings {{in a number of}} towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the Polish-Soviet War served to heighten anti-Jewish sentiment.|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic {{authoritarianism}} was {{practiced in}} Brazil after 1964, in Argentina, and in Chile under Augusto Pinochet, in {{a response to}} harsh economic conditions. It rested on <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> no democracy could take the harsh measures to curb inflation, reassure investors, and quicken economic growth quickly and effectively. Though inflation fell sharply, industrial production dropped with the decline of official protection.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Anthony Howard {{wrote of}} Hitchens, [...] "the old revolutionary socialist has lost nothing of his passion and indignation {{as the years}} have passed us all by.

25|$|The Church of Scientology’s {{objection}} to secular ideas about mental health are religious in nature, based on <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> humans are essentially divine beings {{who have been}} marred by negative experiences acquired over several lifetimes. Scientology also purports that the secular perception of what is mentally normal are not based on science, a contradiction to the claims of psychiatry and psychology.|$|E
25|$|A craft unionist {{might argue}} the miners {{would have been}} better off {{sticking}} to their own business. After all, both the miner's union and the fledgling mill worker's unions had been destroyed. But Haywood took away from this experience <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> labor needed more, not less, industrial unionism. The miners had struck in sympathy with the smeltermen, but other unions—notably, craft unions—had not.|$|E
25|$|A primary {{motivation}} for paraconsistent logic is <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> {{it ought to}} be possible to reason with inconsistent information in a controlled and discriminating way. The principle of explosion precludes this, and so must be abandoned. In non-paraconsistent logics, there is only one inconsistent theory: the trivial theory that has every sentence as a theorem. Paraconsistent logic makes it possible to distinguish between inconsistent theories and to reason with them.|$|E

25|$|Fortescue {{remarked that}} the medieval {{explanations}} are interesting as showing with what reverence people studied {{the text of}} the Canon and how, when every one had forgotten the original reasons for its forms, they still kept <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> the Mass is full of venerable mysteries and that all its clauses mean more than common expressions. He added that in this conviction the sometimes naive medieval interpreters were eminently right.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, the pro-German {{policy was}} abandoned, having {{resulted}} in famine, rebellious opinions, and no tangible advantages. Once again, <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> strict neutrality was {{most suitable for}} Sweden dominated Swedish society. A new, less German-minded Conservative cabinet was appointed, and to calm the social unrest, democratic reforms were promptly initiated that cemented Sweden's neutralist policy and would soon lead to the political hegemony of Social Democrats lasting up to the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|All his {{scientific}} career, Changeux has been faithful {{to a handful}} of scientific questions, at molecular, cellular and brain levels. If one needs to seek a unifying theme to all of them, it is <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> selection is the basis of life processes, rather than instruction. While started as separate lines of investigations, all the research threads were tied in the recent decades within the study of allosteric mechanisms as a basis of for the involvement of nicotinic receptors in cognitive functions.|$|E

25|$|Although work in {{the field}} of health was {{conducted}} out of <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> western medicine was good for Africans, it was not an entirely altruistic programme. The missionaries were to reflect the emerging Victorian view of Africa and African peoples, that African thought and behaviour needed radical change if they were to be converted to western values. Like missionary work in other parts of Africa, it was viewed as a key means to prove the power and mystery of the Christian message.|$|E
25|$|The School of Humanities {{is founded}} on <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> the Humanities give purpose, {{direction}} and value to education and to life, {{and that they are}} no less important to society than scientific and technological disciplines. The School aims at providing a centre of common awareness and a sense of human responsibility, making the University more than a complex of specialist departments. In addition, it is committed to the achievement of academic and linguistic excellence, creativity and all-round development of students. The courses offered in the School reflect these objectives and concerns.|$|E
25|$|Arguably Lee's finest {{achievement}} was transforming a small, not particularly distinguished Latin academy into a forward-looking {{institution of higher}} education. He established the first journalism courses (which were limited and only lasted several years), and he added both engineering courses and a business school and a law school to the college curriculum, under <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> those occupations should be intimately and inextricably linked with the liberal arts. That was a radical idea: engineering, journalism, and law had always been considered technical crafts, not intellectual endeavors, {{and the study of}} business was viewed with skepticism.|$|E

25|$|The Geschichte der Halbinsel Morea set Fallmerayer at loggerheads {{with the}} European philhellenes in general, {{and with the}} Bavarian King Ludwig I in particular, a {{convinced}} philhellene who already in 1829 had begun to advance the candidacy of his son, Otto, for the Greek throne (Otto became King of Greece in 1832). Ludwig's philhellenism was in fact grounded in <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> the Greek revolt against Ottoman rule represented the return of antique Hellenic virtue. Ludwig's displeasure with Fallmerayer led to a long delay in the confirmation of Fallmerayer's election to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, the {{influence}} of Francis Bacon was profound. Bacon, and indeed Hobbes, held <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> mathematics and the senses must {{be the basis of}} all rational sciences. This passion for accuracy led Petty to famously declare that his form of science would only use measurable phenomena and would seek quantitative precision, rather than rely on comparatives or superlatives, yielding a new subject that he named political arithmetic. Petty thus carved a niche for himself as the first dedicated economic scientist, amidst the merchant-pamphleteers, such as Thomas Mun or Josiah Child, and philosopher-scientists occasionally discussing economics, such as John Locke.|$|E
25|$|A {{few months}} later, the South American Championship 1946 final again {{involved}} Argentina and Brazil. There {{was a large}} media coverage, and <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be a}} rough match. Twenty-eight minutes after the beginning, when both teams went for a free ball, Brazilian Jair Rosa Pinto fractured Argentine captain José Salomón's tibia and fibula. General disorder ensued, with Argentine and Brazilian players fighting on the pitch with the police. The public invaded the pitch and both teams {{had to go to the}} dressing rooms. After order was restored the game continued, and Argentina won the match 2–0. Salomón never recovered completely nor played professional football after the incident.|$|E

25|$|All three {{representatives from}} Nevis, {{including}} {{the leader of}} the opposition in the Nevis Island Assembly, objected to the introduction of these bills into the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, arguing that the bills would affect the ability of Nevis to develop its offshore financial services sector and that the bills would be detrimental to the Nevis economy. All the representatives in opposition in the National Assembly shared <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> the bills, if passed into law, would be unconstitutional and undermine the constitutional and legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration, as well as result in the destruction of the economy of Nevis.|$|E
25|$|The Royalists {{were now}} {{fighting}} with the courage of despair. Those who still fought against Charles did so with the full determination to ensure the triumph of their cause, and with <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> the only possible way was the annihilation of the enemy's armed forces. The majority, however, were so weary of the war that the Earl of Manchester's Presbyterian royalism, which contributed so materially to the prolongation of the struggle, {{would probably have been}} accepted by four-fifths of all England as the basis of a peace. It was, in fact, in the face of almost universal opposition, that Fairfax and Cromwell and their friends at Westminster guided the cause of their weaker comrades to complete victory.|$|E
25|$|One however {{needs to}} view these {{issues from the}} context within which Pozderac operated. Being part of the {{communist}} system Pozderac saw political ascendance possible only within the system. If one adds to this the patriarchic nature of the Balkans, his strong leadership was proven {{to be the only}} potent power that could make the difference in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the communist era. He was the follower of <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> political, legal, philosophical, religious, literary, artistic and other progress is based on the economic progress. He is credited for implementing processes that led the economic revitalization of Bosnia and Herzegovina that contributed to strengthening of the cultural independence and identity of Bosnia within Yugoslav federation.|$|E
