The Johnson filtration is a decreasing sequence of subgroups of the Torelli group of S, whose k-th term {{consists of the}} self-homeomorphisms of S that act trivially {{at the level of}} the k-th nilpotent quotient of P. Morita defined a homomorphism from the k-th term of the Johnson filtration to the third homology group of the k-th nilpotent quotient of P. In this paper, we replace groups by their Malcev Lie algebras and we study the "infinitesimal" version of the k-th Morita homomorphism, which corresponds to the original version by a canonical isomorphism. We give a diagrammatic description of the k-th infinitesimal Morita homomorphism and, given an expansion of the free group P which is "symplectic" in some sense, we show how to compute it from Kawazumi's total Johnson map. We also consider the diagrammatic representation of the Torelli group that we derived from the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki invariant of 3 -manifolds in a previous joint work with Cheptea and Habiro, and which we call the "LMO homomorphism. " We show that the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki invariant induces a symplectic expansion of P for which the total Johnson map <b>tantamounts</b> <b>to</b> the tree-reduction of the LMO homomorphism. We deduce that the k-th infinitesimal Morita homomorphism coincides with the degree [k, 2 k[part of the tree-reduction of the LMO homomorphism.

40|$|There is a {{class of}} {{statistical}} problems that arises in several contexts, the Lattice QCD problem of particle physics being one that has attracted the most attention. In essence, the problem boils down to the estimation of {{an infinite number of}} parameters from a finite number of equations, each equation being an infinite sum of exponential functions. By introducing a latent parameter into the QCD system, we are able to identify a pattern which <b>tantamounts</b> <b>to</b> reducing the system to a telescopic series. A statistical model is then endowed on the series, and inference about the unknown parameters done via a Bayesian approach. A computationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is invoked to implement the approach. The algorithm shares some parallels with that used in the particle Kalman filter. The approach is validated against simulated as well as data generated by a physics code pertaining to the quark masses of protons. The value of our approach is that we are now able to answer questions that could not be readily answered using some standard approaches in particle physics. The structure of the Lattice QCD equations is not unique to physics. Such architectures also appear in mathematical biology, nuclear magnetic imaging, network analysis, ultracentrifuge, {{and a host of other}} relaxation and time decay phenomena. Thus, the methodology of this paper should have an appeal that transcends the Lattice QCD scenario which motivated us.

Fieldwork was undertaken in a gay community in a small regional city of Queensland between the summers of 1998 and 2001.

According to the literature of small communities in rural sociology the conceptual scaffolding of ‘community’ was evident in this remote gay community. Qualitative data subjected to the grounded theoretical method generated five theoretical arguments. One theoretical insight is presented within the limitations of this paper. Resistances to, and escapisms from, the capitalist routinization of the heterosexual realities of everyday life are interpreted as pervasive in the social organization of the gay community studied in this small regional city. This discussion leads to the conclusion that gay men’s desire to elaborate their sociality in this place is <b>tantamount</b> in value <b>to</b> their sexual liaisons, challenging the hegemonic mythology that gay community is willed into everyday realities by the desire to increase access to homosexual hedonism...|$|R

While HDL acts to prevent cholesterol from building up in excess, the larger LDL particles may get stuck inside artery walls, fuse with other LDL particles and finally burst out from the wall, causing a stroke. The fusion of simpler systems has been studied for decades, but the details of lipoprotein fusion and the factors promoting fusion remain elusive. In this Thesis we studied the effect of varying surfactant composition to lipid droplet fusion, which form the core of lipoproteins. Pressure profiles have been suggested to give a quantitative picture of how properties of interfaces, such as interfacial tension arise. These profiles have been studied by physicists for a long time, but it was only relatively recently that a biological relevance was postulated and a new interest surged. While experimental techniques are still not refined enough to probe these biological systems because of their extremely small sizes, in the last few years it has become computationally feasible to carry out research in relevant length and time scales. Using pressure profile calculations, we vary the surfactant compositions of HDL/LDL based lipid droplets so as to keep some quantities constant while varying others. From simple systems, it is known that interfacial tension is the most important factor in fusion and phase separation. Using large-scale computers to run a steered molecular dynamics simulation method developed by us, we show that the fusion rates of lipid droplets are greatly affected by their lipid composition and that interfacial tension alone cannot explain this tendency. We explore alternative explanations and their feasibility. /Kir 1...|$|R

The utility of this approach is demonstrated through three exemplary embodiments. When the output is constrained to be discrete, a powerful set of algorithms for semi-supervised classification and segmentation result. When the output is constrained to follow Markovian dynamics, techniques for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and system identification are derived. Finally, when the output is constrained to be zero on a given set and non-zero everywhere else, a new algorithm for learning latent constraints in high-dimensional data is recovered. I apply the algorithms derived from this framework to a varied set of domains. The dissertation provides a new interpretation of the so-called Spectral Clustering algorithms for data segmentation and suggests how they may be improved. I demonstrate the tasks of tracking RFID tags from signal strength measurements, recovering the pose of rigid objects, deformable bodies, and articulated bodies from video sequences. Lastly, I discuss empirical methods to detect conserved quantities and learn constraints defining data sets. by Benjamin Recht. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{concepts}} {{of power and}} state - particularly embedded {{in the idea of}} the Great Power, with a geopolitical perspective and a profoundly aggressive character - are <b>tantamount</b> in importance <b>to</b> the Russia's elite political ideology. However, the existence of different emphases within such a political ideology, ranging from the active-obstructive to the passive stances, brings into question the factors of variation that might be responsible for the elite's level of determination to pursue these concepts over an internal or foreign policy development. In addressing this query, two tasks are set: descriptive - involving a survey of the content of Russian aggressive political ideology over different periods in history; and explanatory - determining circumstances that might account for the empowerment of one or other option of Russian aggressive political ideology. Therefore, the thesis includes a comparison of historical periods with similar relevance to the Russian state. The concern here is in relation to shifting factors of variations of aggressive political ideology acting in the space-frame of one state, but in different time-frame. Resting on these frames the thesis explores the shaping of the Russian elite's defining principles of state internal and foreign policy development and traces the factors of variation responsible for the empowerment of one or other particular form of the aggressive political ideology. The factors of variation discussed in the thesis are different in nature and intensity. The primary impetus for variation in the form that aggressive political ideology would take is determined by the factor of national distress. Other factors (regime volatility, political and economic motivations, information dissemination, and challenges within the international system) are responsible for the depth and extent to which aggressive ideology is going to resonate. No factor could create the variation by itself. The argument is that a specific set of factors is required to create the conditions for variations in the form the aggressive political ideology would take and to determine whether aggressive ideology would generate or not an obstructive political decision...|$|R
