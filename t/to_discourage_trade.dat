[...] Native Americans received rewards if they returned escaped slaves, and African Americans received rewards for fighting in Indian Wars. European colonists told the Cherokee that the smallpox epidemic of 1739 was due to disease brought by African slaves, to create tension between the groups. The British tried to restrict contact between Africans and Native Americans. They feared Native Americans taking enslaved Africans as spouses and tried <b>to</b> <b>discourage</b> <b>trade</b> between the groups. The British also passed laws prohibiting the carrying of slaves into the frontier of the Cherokee Nation's territory to restrict interactions between the two groups.

50|$|The first {{encounter}} with Europeans occurred with the visit of the French Canadian trader Sieur de la Verendrye in 1738. The Mandans carried him into their village, Menoken, east of the Missouri. It is estimated {{that at the time}} of his visit, 15,000 Mandan resided in the nine villages on the Heart River. Horses were acquired by the Mandan in the mid-18th century from the Apache and were used for transportation and hunting. The horses helped with the expansion of Mandan hunting territory on to the Plains. The encounter with the French in the 18th century created a trading link between the French and Native Americans of the region; the Mandan served as middlemen in the trade in furs, horses, guns, crops and buffalo products. Spanish merchants and officials in St. Louis explored the Missouri and strengthened relations with the Mandan (whom they called Mandanas) in an effort <b>to</b> <b>discourage</b> <b>trade</b> in the region by the English and the Americans. The Spanish sought to establish direct overland communication between Santa Fé and St. Louis.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{product market}} {{competition}} under a strategic transparency decision. Dominant investors can influence information {{collection in the}} financial market, and thereby corporate transparency, by affecting market liquidity or the cost of information collection. More transparency on a firm's competitive position has both strategic advantages and disadvantages: in general, transparency results in higher variability of profits and output. Thus lenders prefer less information revelation through stock market trading, since this protects firms when in a weak competitive position, while equityholders prefer more to make full use of the strategic advantage of a strong firm. We show that bank-controlled firms will tend <b>to</b> <b>discourage</b> <b>trading</b> <b>to</b> reduce price informativeness, while shareholder-run firms prefer more transparency. Our comparative statics show that bank control may fail to keep firms less transparent as global trading volumes rise...|$|R
40|$|Appropriate {{assessment}} of the social value of market access {{is at the core}} of a broad range of inquiries in trade research. A selection include: the appraisal of industry-level production and consumption distortions due to selective trade liberalization and partial tax reform; the construction of national-level quantity indicators of market access consistent with welfare change, and the use of international trade re-balancing as sanctions <b>to</b> <b>discourage</b> <b>trade</b> agreement violations, or as compensation in trade dispute settlement. In order to obtain shadow prices, we propose a new approach integrating the Luenberger benefit function and the directional output distance function. This yields a trade benefit function which represents trade preferences à la Meade in the context of a canonical general equilibrium model of trade. We first show that our approach is in keeping with well-established and commonly used measurement techniques of trade welfare, for the standard trade expenditure function is in fact dual to the trade benefit function. We then show that this dual relation allows for a direct retrieval of the shadow values of net imports from the trade benefit function. The usefulness and operationality of our approach is then demonstrated in a series of applications and simulations. International Relations/Trade, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|E

In both years, linguistic influence on trade is found to exist in export but not in import. The estimated results show a positive relation between religious similarity and international trade for the year 1985 {{but not for the}} year 1997. However, there is an indication that, for 1997, the religious dissimilarity tends <b>to</b> <b>discourage</b> international <b>trade</b> with low-income countries and regions and to encourage international trade with high-income countries. We also find that, for low-income trade partners, religious dissimilarity retards imports more than exports; by contrast, for high-income trade partners, it encourages exports more than imports...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{redemption}} policies affect daily fund flows in open-end mutual funds. Since short-term trading of fund shares, as manifested in daily fund flows, {{can have an}} adverse impact on returns to the fund’s shareholders, mutual funds might find it desirable <b>to</b> <b>discourage</b> short-term <b>trading</b> {{through the use of}} redemption fees. However, if daily fund flows are due to fund shareholders’ legitimate liquidity demands, the redemption fee would have little effect on daily fund flows and possibly adversely affect fund shareholders by imposing a liquidity cost on them. We find that the likelihood of a fund charging a redemption fee is largely a function of its overall fee structure. We also use a sample of funds that imposed redemption fees to examine whether the distribution of daily fund flows changes after the initiation of the redemption fee. We find that the redemption fee is an effective tool in controlling the volatility of fund flows...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{whether the}} implementation of a tax on short-term capital flows can make the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe less vulnerable to adverse external shocks and to sudden withdrawals of foreign capital. The following section outlines the main arguments which are advanced by the supporters and opponents of a transactions tax on foreign capital flows. We also develop a simple theoretical framework which allows us to study the effects of a tax on capital inflows. The model reveals {{that it is important to}} distinguish between two effects of a transactions tax. On the one hand, a transactions tax might be a useful tool <b>to</b> <b>discourage</b> destabilizing <b>trading</b> strategies on the foreign exchange market. On the other hand, it should be taken into account that a tax on foreign capital flows pushes the economy to a new steady state. This induces an overshooting of the exchange rate if super efficient financial markets react faster than goods markets. Thus, {{the implementation of}} a transactions tax by itself can be viewed as a source of additional (excess) volatility of the exchange rate. Section 3 briefly discusses the experience of Chile which maintains a deposit requirement for short-term capital inflows. Section 4 gives an account of the structure of capital flows of the transition economies and of the restrictions which currently pertain to the capital account of the balance of payments. We restrict our analysis to four of the more advanced reform countries – i. e., the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and Poland – because the policy issues of high capital inflows are most relevant for these countries. Section 5 concludes.

40|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) and {{its global}} health {{security}} treaty, the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) {{have lost the}} world 2 ̆ 7 s confidence after the West African Ebola epidemic. The epidemic led to several high-level reviews of the IHR and global health security more broadly. Here, we propose a series of recommendations for operational and legal reforms to enhance {{the functioning of the}} FCGH. It is critical that WHO act on them quickly, before the window of opportunity for fundamental reform closes. WHO should ensure that all states fulfill their obligations to develop national core surveillance and response capacities, including through funding, possibly through additional assessed contributions, and an independent peer-review assessment process, with assessments identifying gaps and strategies and financing to fill those gaps. Civil society could also participate in ensure the validity of assessments. Independent assessments will improve confidence in the IHR, as would increasing the transparency of Emergency Committees deliberations, supplemented by an independent body to review disease data and offer recommendations to the WHO Director-General. States might more promptly notify WHO of events that may constitute public health emergencies of international concern with enhanced training and if the IHR 2 ̆ 7 s decision instrument is amended to make more diseases automatically notifiable. WHO should also further encourage and facilitate reporting from non-governmental sources. A harmonized, gradient system for health emergencies would also bring greater clarity to disease response, while maintaining the power of a declaration of a public health emergency of international concern. To improve compliance with temporary recommendations and deter harmful additional measures, WHO could use public pressure, acknowledging compliance while publicly naming states parties and businesses that fail to comply, along with requesting justification for additional measures. States could use dispute mediation, arbitration, or other legal procedures, such as through the World <b>Trade</b> Organization, <b>to</b> <b>discourage</b> harmful <b>trade</b> and travel restrictions. And to advance a One Health approach, based on the links between human, animal, and environmental health, WHO should increase its use of cooperative agreements with other intergovernmental bodies, while integrating the Pandemic Influenza Pandemic Framework with the IHR to encourage equitable sharing of vaccines and therapies...|$|R
