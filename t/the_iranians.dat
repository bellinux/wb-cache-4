5|$|From 1994 to 1995 Tomlinson {{worked in}} the {{operational}} counter-proliferation department. His first posting in this capacity was to work as an undercover agent against Iran, where he succeeded in penetrating the Iranian Intelligence Service. He posed as a British businessman, and infiltrated a network of arms dealers that included Nahum Manbar. The British government supplied <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> with materials for chemical weapons {{in order to gain}} intelligence on Iran's military programme. Tomlinson's description of his Iranian activities are generally considered to be true, due to his personal involvement and knowledge of details that only an insider would know.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{she visited}} Iran at the {{invitation}} of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The British ambassador and his wife, Anthony and Sheila Parsons, noted how <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> were bemused by her habit of speaking to everyone regardless of status or importance, and hoped the Shah's entourage would learn from the visit {{to pay more attention to}} ordinary people. Between 1976 and 1984, she made annual summer visits to France, which were among 22 private trips to continental Europe between 1963 and 1992.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> struck {{south-east}} of Sulaymaniyah {{where they}} easily defeated {{most of the}} Iraqi defenders because Saddam Hussein left them to defend even the most exposed positions. After <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> had defeated the Iraqi forces at the front lines, they advanced quickly. However, the Iraqis launched a counter-attack during the Iranian advance. The Iraqi soldiers involved in the counter-attack were ambushed by <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> and most Iraqi troops were slaughtered. Victory {{seemed to be in}} the hands of Iranians as they reached Sulaymaniyah but they failed to capture it. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> also came dangerously close to Iraq's Darbandikhan reservoir. The Iraqis responded by launching 720 chemical artillery rockets and 200 chemical artillery shells which resulted in the Iranian 55th parachute division taking heavy losses and wiping out of the 84th infantry division, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> to call off the offensive.|$|E

25|$|The Indo-Iranian {{language}} and culture was further developed in the Andronovo culture (c. 1800–1400 BCE), and influenced by the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (c. 2300–1700 BCE). The Indo-Aryans split off around 1800–1600 BCE from <b>the</b> <b>Iranians,</b> whereafter Indo-Aryan groups moved to the Levant (Mitanni), northern India (Vedic people, c. 1500 BCE), and China (Wusun). Thereafter <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> migrated into Iran.|$|E
25|$|The Proto-Indo-Iranians, {{from which}} the Indo-Aryans and <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> developed, formed as a {{distinguishable}} culture at the Central Asian steppes north of the Caspian Sea as the Sintashta culture (2100–1800 BCE), present-day Kazakhstan, and developed further as the Andronovo culture (1800–1400 BCE), around the Aral Sea. The proto-Indo-Iranians then migrated southwards to the Bactria-Margiana Culture, {{from which the}}y borrowed their distinctive religious beliefs and practices. The Indo-Aryans split off around 1800-1600 BCE from <b>the</b> <b>Iranians,</b> whereafter the Indo-Aryans migrated into Anatolia and {{the northern part of}} the South Asia (modern Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Nepal), while <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> moved into Iran, both bringing with them the Indo-Aryan languages.|$|E
25|$|The main {{objective}} of the attack was to capture Iran's Caspian Sea port of Bandar Pahlavi. The Iranian forces in Gilan, led by General Iranpour, made their stand at the provincial capital of Rasht and Bandar Pahlavi and offered a stubborn resistance. The Iranian forces sank barges {{at the entrance to}} Pahlavi harbour, and lacking coastal artillery, moved a battery of 75mm guns to the area. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> fought desperately, and despite Soviet superiority, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> prevented them from landing. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> were careful to not fire their guns while Soviet aircraft flew overhead to prevent them from disclosing their location. Soviet aircraft were kept at bay by 47mm anti-aircraft artillery on Iranian barges.|$|E

25|$|After Iran's {{failure to}} capture Basra during the Second Battle of Basra (Operation Karbala-5), Iran's {{military}} entered {{a period of}} self-reflection, and possible decline. Iranian morale was decreasing, {{and many of their}} experienced infantry from the Revolutionary Guards (Pasdaran) became casualties. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> increasingly relied on their regular army to fight the war. In addition to the army being conscription based, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> became increasingly war-weary. The front in the south of Iraq had become a stalemate. Iran was unable to penetrate the massive Iraqi defenses. Meanwhile, Iraq for the time being remained unable to drive <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> back, but they had begun to rearm {{with the help of the}} United States and the west, and were practicing maneuvers in preparation for the upcoming operations against <b>the</b> <b>Iranians.</b> By 1988, Iraq grossly outnumbered Iran in men and military hardware. Nevertheless, Iranian commanders remained skilled and adept. They focused on tactics that would negate superior Iraqi firepower. Nevertheless, they were unable to capture cities in southern Iraq due to a combination of poor logistics, shortages of armor, and Iraqi firepower. Iran's leadership also announced that they would arm and support opposition groups inside of Iraq. One of those opponents was the Peshmerga, the Kurdistan resistance force, which primarily launch limited offensives of their own.|$|E

Although most agreed that Iraq was years away {{from being able to}} build a nuclear weapon, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> and the Israelis felt any raid must occur well before nuclear fuel was loaded to prevent nuclear fallout. The attack was regarded as being in breach of the United Nations Charter (S/RES/487) and international law and was widely condemned.|$|E
25|$|Whether the Iranian defence {{could have}} been {{successful}} is debatable and on 29 August, after some more sporadic fighting, word reached the Iranian commanders at Ahvaz that their government had accepted a ceasefire {{and they were not}} to fight any longer. The British and Iranians agreed as part of the ceasefire that <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> would not lay down their arms and remain at their posts but they would be joined by the British troops, who would carry out a parade in the city. In exchange, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> would safely evacuate British residents in the city to British troops. The British with their Indian troops paraded in the city, with full military honours given by the Iranian general.|$|E
25|$|In 1808 the Russians, now led {{by general}} Ivan Gudovich, {{attacked}} the city once again; this attempt was repelled as well. By the Treaty of Gulistan (1813), which ended the 1804-1813 war, Iran {{lost most of}} its Caucasus territories; Erivan and Tabriz were now the main headquarters of the Iranian efforts to regain the territories lost to Russia. During the next and final bout of hostilities between <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> and Russians, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> were initially successful in recovering many of the territories that were lost in 1813; however, the Russian offensive of 1827, in which the superior Russian artillery played a decisive role, resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> being defeated at Abbasabad, Sardarabad as well Erivan. Erivan {{was taken by the}} Russians on 2 October 1827. In February 1828, Iran was forced to sign the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which resulted in the cession of the khanate (as well as the other remaining territories {{to the north of the}} Aras River) to the Russians. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Aras River became and remained the border between Iran and the Republic of Armenia.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> {{had little}} time to organise a defence, as the Allies {{achieved}} a tactical surprise. The war {{began in the early}} morning hours of 25 August, when RAF aircraft entered Iranian airspace. They bombed targets in the cities of Tehran and Qazvin and various other towns and dropped leaflets urging <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> to surrender. The Soviets bombed targets in cities such as Tabriz, Ardabil and Rasht. Civilian and residential areas were hit, and several hundred people were killed and wounded. Reza Shah refused requests by his generals to destroy the road and transportation networks, largely because he did not want to damage the infrastructure that he had painstakingly built during his reign. That contributed to the speedy victory of the allies.|$|E
25|$|The ship {{supported}} Operation Earnest Will. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> and Iraqis escalated {{their attacks}} against ships sailing in the Persian Gulf during the Persian Gulf War {{between those two}} countries, and the U.S. launched Earnest Will to maintain freedom of navigation in the area. The Americans initially renamed and reflagged eleven Kuwaiti tankers. Klakring patrolled the Persian Gulf between Radar Picket Stations North and South. The ship repeatedly passed outbound through the Strait of Hormuz to refuel from underway replenishment ships, {{and then returned to}} the Persian Gulf. On 10 August, Klakring embarked a detachment of Army helicopters and helped coordinate the efforts of British tugs converted for mine sweeping. Klakring escorted —reflagged tanker Al Rekkah—outbound through the Strait of Hormuz on 30 August. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> mined Bridgeton on 24 July, but the tanker survived.|$|E
