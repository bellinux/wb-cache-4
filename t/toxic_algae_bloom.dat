40|$|Two {{prominent}} {{issues are}} affecting {{the vitality of}} regional settlements in the New Zealand context. Firstly, urbanisation has meant the migration of young workers and professionals to creative and economic urban centres, leaving demographic gaps in the regions and a dwindling population. Secondly, the exploitation of regional landscapes by cities has led to severe degradation of extensive wetland ecosystems. Wetlands drained for farming, large-scale deforestation and industrial settlements established to support agriculture and forestry contribute to the artificial landscape morphology. New Zealand’s waterways and lakes now suffer from eutrophication; an enrichment of nutrients caused by dairy run-off and increased sediments, characterised by a build-up of organic matter producing <b>toxic</b> <b>algae</b> <b>bloom.</b> Titled ‘Renewal of the Abject’, this project is a speculative design that aims to reconcile the problematic relationship between the dairy industry and the environment. Architectural infrastructure and landscape renewal present an opportunity to challenge current urban planning tendencies in the Horowhenua District. The project proposes to reinvigorate small towns with a self-sufficient and forward planning urban framework. Levin, a prominent industrial town at {{the centre of the}} Horowhenua District, clings to the vital transport connection between Wellington and Auckland, feeding off the economic lifeline of passing traffic. With the proposed changes by NZTA to create a State Highway One Bypass east of Levin, the CBD may suffer economically leading to population decline. Lake Horowhenua, west of the town centre, was once the heart of the District with an abundance of food and natural resources. It is now considered one of the worst lakes in New Zealand based on its poor condition. Integrating infrastructure and megastructure challenges modernist attempts to zone cities by function and aims to build clean infrastructure integrated into compact urban areas. Architecture as infrastructure challenges the public understanding of production and manufacturing and their natural consequences. A redefinition of industry for the twenty-first century could improve its detrimental relationship with the environment. Clean infrastructure eliminates the need to build industries on remote brown sites, focusing on the prevention of adverse effects on the landscape and the population’s health and wellbeing. The concept of using manure-loam composite as a structural building material provides new opportunities for cost-effective architecture for towns that are economically struggling. The material is renewable and easily accessed in New Zealand, while rammed earth construction enables future growth and expansion. Using an artistic approach in constructing manure-loam buildings has the potential to produce an aesthetic distinctive of rural New Zealand. ‘Renewal of the Abject’ proposes a Megastructure to enforce a powerful urban connection between the hills and the lake with a self-sufficient spine making use of dairy waste and sewage as a building material. The reimagining of this abject materiality forms a critical discourse throughout the project influencing additional design explorations. This thesis explores current thinking around urban planning, Material production and reuse, and architectural detailing through design-led research. Perhaps, presenting an issue of scope where design exploration entered different academic fields, touching upon charged lines of research, rather than solely interrogating the architectural discipline. Proposing a megastructure in the Horowhenua district would seem counterproductive in this degraded landscape. However, compacting urban sprawl into a dense core along the eastwest axis sets out a development framework that conserves land and maximises public activity at the centre of a currently sleepy town. The megastructure can expand along this line, servicing the functions of Levin in a self-sufficient manner, unlike a typical New Zealand strip town that feeds off services along the main highway. Integrating infrastructure and megastructure challenges modernist attempts to zone cities by function and aims to build clean infrastructure integrated into compact urban areas.

The leaching of agrochemicals from agricultural fields leads to contamination of drinking water resources and <b>toxic</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> and loss of biodiversity in surface waters. Water quality managers {{are responsible for the}} detection of water quality problems and for taking appropriate measures.

In addition, reactive nitrogen is associated with harmful human health effects caused by air pollution and drinking water contamination. Reactive nitrogen (hereafter referred to as Nr) includes all biologically active, chemically reactive, and radiatively active nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere and biosphere of the earth, in contrast to non-reactive gaseous N 2.

Similar research and technology can aid in the removal of toxic heavy metals in industrial waste water. Using a packed column with solid supported media, both phosphate and other selective anions were successfully removed from water. This was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma analysis. Constraints for this deliverable would include reagent cost as well as governmental regulations concerning substances in waste water. Another consideration was the ability to reuse spent columns through regeneration techniques. By creating a small scale column system, the team tested the effective removal of selective anions from water sources while keeping in mind the contact time and loading capacity of metals onto the media. Through design of experiment, optimal results were obtained. For removal, it was determined that, the higher the loading of the metal along with 4 minute contact times allowed for optimal removal. The most efficient media and regenerative were also determined. Future considerations should involve a real time controller to obtain instant analytical data allowing users to know when columns need to be regenerated. This ensures minimal waste of reagent during removal. This design is applicable to companies concerned with the environmental impact of their waste water. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Mass mortalities of Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas occur {{regularly}} when {{temperatures are}} high. Elevated temperatures facilitate the proliferation and spread of pathogens and simultaneously impose physiological {{stress on the}} host. Additionally, periods of high temperatures coincide with the oyster spawning season. Spawning is energetically costly and can further compromise oyster immunity. Most studies monitoring the underlying factors of oyster summer mortality in the field, point to the involvement of abiotic and biotic factors including low salinities, high temperatures, pollutants, <b>toxic</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms,</b> pathogen exposure and physical stress in conjunction with maturation. However, studies addressing more than two factors experi- mentally are missing thus far. Therefore, we investigated the combination of three main factors including abiotic as well as internal and external biotic stressors by conducting controlled infection experiments on pre-and post-spawning {{as well as on}} gravid oysters with opportunistic Vibrio sp. at two different tempera- tures. Based on mortality rates, infection intensity and cellular immune parameters, we provide experimental evidence that all three factors (i. e. reproductive investment, elevated temperatures and infection with oppor- tunistic Vibrio sp.) act additively to the phenomenon of oyster summer mortality, leaving post-spawning oyster more susceptible to SMS than pre-spawning and gravid oysters. While previous studies found that post-spawning oysters have a lower thermal tolerance and a reduced ability to withstand pathogen infec- tions, our study now allows to separate the relative contribution of different causative agents to oyster sum- mer mortality and pinpoint to infection with pathogenic Vibrio sp. being of highest importance. In addition we can add a mechanistic understanding for the higher losses after spawning during which the phagocytic ability of hemocytes was strongly impeded resulting in insufficient clearance of pathogens...|$|R

Planktothrix is a genus of filamentous alga comprising approximately 6 species, between these the P. rubescens is sadly famous since this organism produces microcystins which are powerful hepatotoxins. Firstly found in Europe in 1825 on Geneva lake, recently (2006) those algae has been find out in Pozzillo, Nicoletti e Ancipa reservoirs (Enna Province), as well as in Prizzi (Palermo Province) and Garcia reservoirs (Trapani Province). Toxins produced by those bacteria (usually called microcystine LR- 1 and LR- 2) are highly toxic since they can activate oncogenes cells causing cancer pathologies on liver and gastrointestinal tract. Even if water treatment plants should ensure the provision of safe drinking water from surface waters contaminated with those <b>toxic</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms,</b> the contamination of reservoirs used for civil and agricultural supply highlights human healthy risks.
