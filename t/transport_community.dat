In 2008, they helped to renovate and repaint the station building. It was decorated in 2009 by students from Fairfield School, who created a mural of Victorian characters with incongruous details such as mobile phones, sunglasses and funny hats. The work won a Community Rail Award.|$|E

The work won a Department for <b>Transport</b> <b>Community</b> Rail Marketing Award in 2007. The Severnside CRP also formed {{a support group for}} the station, and improved the provision of timetabling information through the use of simplified departure timetable posters. In 2009, they painted a large station sign on the road bridge over the line, and in 2010 they collaborated with Redland Green School to decorate the bricked-up windows and doors of the station building with animal artwork to brighten up the station and promote Bristol Zoo. The work won a Community Rail Award. Customer help points with next train information screens were installed during 2008/09, paid for by money from the Department for Transport's [...] "Access for All" [...] fund and local councils. Ticket machines were installed in early 2011, following complaints that passengers were unable to pay their fares. The station building was again renamed in 2016, and is now the Steam Bristol beer hall and rotisserie.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this accident, the AAIB issued safety {{recommendation}} 2006-101 (regarding shoulder harnesses) and a copy of their earlier study to the JAA and to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which would take over from the JAA as the primary European regulatory body {{over a period of several}} years, beginning before the accident. While considering this recommendation, the EASA took the interim step of issuing its own Safety Information Bulletin (SIB 2008-24), which advised the air <b>transport</b> <b>community</b> of the CAA's earlier study and of the benefits of shoulder harnesses. In 2011, the EASA published its opinion that the requirement recommended by the AAIB following the Loganair accident that shoulder harnesses should be mandatory for each passenger seat in all commercial air transport aircraft weighing less than 5,700kg, regardless of when the aircraft was first registered. The European Commission accepted the EASA opinion, and [...] new regulations requiring shoulder harnesses as described in the AAIB's safety recommendation 2006-101 became law for commercial air transport operators in Europe.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCommunity {{transport}} (CT) services play {{a unique}} role in filling the accessibility gap which conventional public transport cannot fill {{as a result}} of funding, accessibility or spatial constraints. In England alone there are approximately 1, 700 <b>community</b> <b>transport</b> organisations, with over 60, 000 volunteers and 10, 000 employees. Over 15 -million trips were provided by <b>community</b> <b>transport</b> (CT) groups in 2010 and many of these services were tailored to the needs of groups and individuals, providing both efficient and effective <b>community</b> based <b>transport.</b> In Australia, <b>Community</b> <b>Transport</b> is organised on a State basis, with different models of operation, and so it is difficult to estimate the national impact in terms of numbers. However, in contrast to British and American models, <b>Community</b> <b>Transport</b> in Australia is more targeted at the disabled and frail members of society as funding limits the ability of <b>community</b> <b>transport</b> groups to meet the spatial gaps inherent in the lower density land use of Australia. This paper will highlight, with illustrated examples, the benefits of <b>community</b> <b>transport</b> and illustrate recent developments within the sector in both Britain and Australia. In the case of Britain the move towards partnership-working with local authority is the hallmark of current Government policy. Wide scale adoption of ICT is also enabling CT operators to diversify their activities and this is illustrated by a case-study from Glasgow. In Australia, the sector is at an important milestone: the Federal Government is about to change the rules of the funding process and it is anticipated that Australian <b>community</b> <b>transport</b> groups will be looking world-wide for inspiration as to how to confront this step change...|$|R
