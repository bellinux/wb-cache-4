5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, I <b>think</b> <b>maybe,</b> the most passionate {{one on the}} record. I mean, I'm really proud of it because that's really one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has really very good sexual images, images of cars - which I always like.|$|E
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
500|$|Vulović {{told reporters}} {{that she did not}} think of her fall every day, but {{admitted}} to struggling with survivor's guilt. [...] "Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry... Then I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> I should not have survived at all." [...] Vulović declined therapy to help her cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. [...] "If you can survive what I survived," [...] she said, [...] "you can survive anything." ...|$|E

500|$|The writers {{started to}} work for [...] "Band Geeks" [...] {{with the idea of}} a rival. Williams said, [...] "We always wanted to do a rival show, and I think we tried to do a rival show for SpongeBob, and it wasn't working. So we came up {{with the idea of a}} rival for Squidward and, in some ways it's Squidward's story, and SpongeBob and Patrick are just kind of around." [...] The idea of having a band was unspecified. Williams remarked, [...] "I forget who was in band. I was not in a band, but I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> Doug [...] was in a band. I think Steve [...] was in a band, too." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{on his own}} Lock Up the Wolves US tour in August 1990, former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio {{was joined}} on stage at the Roy Wilkins Auditorium by former Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler to perform [...] "Neon Knights". Following the show, the two {{expressed}} interest in rejoining Black Sabbath. Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current line-up, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. [...] "I do regret that {{in a lot of}} ways", Iommi said. [...] "We were at a good point then. We decided to [...] and I don't even know why, really. There's the financial aspect, but that wasn't it. I seemed to <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> we could recapture something we had".|$|E
500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> I am more attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira is much more aggressive. He makes more of a physical impact in a game, in midfield. He is amazing. I don’t think I have this quality yet. I think I can develop in that way but he is much stronger." [...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira was more of a passer of the ball. Diaby is more of a dribbler, more offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira was more of a constructor. They have a similar elegance and type of play but are not completely comparable".|$|E
5000|$|... ==Analysis== The song is {{told from}} the first person {{point of view of}} someone who is grieving the end of a relationship. The second verse carries a hopeful tone, in which the narrator <b>thinks</b> <b>maybe</b> [...] "the spark of love again will grow." ...|$|R
6000|$|Babbitt galloped desperately up-stairs. He {{sent the}} frightened Tinka {{out of the}} room. He said gaily to his wife, [...] "Well, old thing, the doc <b>thinks</b> <b>maybe</b> we better have a little {{operation}} and get it over. Just take a few minutes--not half as serious as a confinement--and you'll be all right in a jiffy." ...|$|R

500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it was very hard to make people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people <b>think,</b> <b>maybe</b> I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{and writers}} were {{critical}} of {{the manner in which}} Patrick Hemingway edited the work. Paul Gray [...] titled his review of the book [...] "Where's Papa?", answering with the opening sentence, [...] "He's hard to find in his fifth posthumous work", pointing directly to Patrick Hemingway's editing of the manuscript. Lynn thinks Hemingway would have been [...] "outraged by his sons' refusal to honor his judgment that the manuscript was unworthy of publication" [...] and was outraged that [...] "Patrick Hemingway declares that his two brothers, Jack and Gregory, share his belief that 'this job was worth doing'". [...] Burwell also wonders [...] whether Hemingway wanted the Africa book published, pointing to [...] his statement, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> {{it would be better to}} wait until I'm dead to publish it", although she concedes that works by Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Kafka were unfinished and published posthumously. During the final two decades of his life, Hemingway had published two novels but since his death, works continue to be published. Writing in The New Yorker in 1998, Joan Didion was extremely {{critical of the}} Hemingway family and estate for [...] commercializing and profiting from his reputation and writing rather than protecting his legacy. [...] "The publication of unfinished work is a denial of the idea that the role of the writer in his or her work is to make it", she wrote, adding that True at First Light should not have been [...] "molded" [...] and published.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

Simon believes that Cross is a violent separatist, a man who believes that whites and Mexicans shouldn't mix. Simon says he's been after Cross for years, but nobody is {{willing to talk about}} him. Simon <b>thinks</b> <b>maybe</b> he and Roland can help each other.|$|R
5000|$|Bombshell's {{publicist}} Agnes (Daphne Rubin-Vega) tells Eileen, who {{had been}} considering asking Tom and Julia to reduce their royalties from Bombshell, that due to the extra publicity, ticket sales are up. Karen sits with Derek at the bar as the party has wound down. He <b>thinks</b> <b>maybe</b> he should call it a night, but Karen orders more drinks. She's somewhat flirty with him and asks him to walk her home, and they go off together, both somewhat drunk.|$|R
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the tracks on She Wolf, {{according}} to Shakira, have been written from a [...] "very feminine perspective". She attributed this to her growing maturity, noting [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> because I feel more like a woman today". Many of the songs focus on [...] "emotions that a woman experiments when you're in love or out of love— jealousy, fantasies, daydreams", which the singer said were based on her conversations with girlfriends who are [...] "struggling with their own romantic lives". This issue is prominently covered in the track [...] "Men in This Town", in which Shakira sings {{about the lack of}} eligible bachelors in Los Angeles. The song contains references to American actors Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon, the latter of whom Shakira knows personally, and popular destinations like the SkyBar. [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV commented that [...] "Shakira wasn't afraid to get a little wacky {{when it came to the}} lyrics on She Wolf". In an interview with Jim Cantiello, the singer was asked for the reason behind lyrics like [...] "I'm so happy I should get sued" [...] (in the track [...] "Long Time"), to which Shakira replied [...] "Maybe it rhymed. It's hard to explain your own lyrics, you know". In [...] "Mon Amour", she wishes that her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend have a terrible vacation in Paris and are eaten alive by [...] "French fleas". Other themes the album touches upon include night-life, sex, and seduction, in songs like [...] "Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Spy". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen labelled the latter [...] "a meditation on masturbation".|$|E

She and Jack decide that Domnic can be useful to them, so she is going to look for him.

2500|$|Duke coach Bill Foster wasn't {{amused by}} Smith's tactics {{in the first}} half and the next day said, [...] "I've been doing this a long time, but during the first half last night I began to <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> I've been doing it for too long."

2500|$|People think I asked Ellar, [...] "What {{did you do}} {{in school}} the other day? Let's make a scene about that!" [...] That never happened.

Then I would <b>think,</b> <b>maybe</b> we could move the camping trip up, and we can do this or that.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least two}} {{variants}} {{of a conspiracy}} theory about the massacre have been promoted. Interviewed in 2006, Tony Rundle, Premier of Tasmania from 1996 to 1998, admitted that, {{because there was no}} trial, the evidence made public was possibly insufficient to support that Bryant had been the gunman: [...] "At the time, the view was that a trial could do no good for the victims and their families. Now I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> that wasn't the case. If all the evidence was heard, then maybe it would have provided some closure and stopped the proliferation of conspiracy theories that sprang up over the years." ...|$|E

From 2008 to 2010 he co-wrote and starred in three series of the CBBC sketch show Sorry, I've Got No Head, appearing as some of the shows most popular characters including Ross, the only boy in the North Barrasay school, Mark, the record breaker, Prudith, who with her friend Jasmine thinks everything costs a thousand pounds, and the beekeeper who <b>thinks</b> <b>maybe</b> his bees can help.|$|R
2500|$|On April 4, 2004, Kean again {{stated that}} the September 11 attacks could have been prevented, saying that the United States {{government}} should have acted sooner to dismantle al-Qaeda and responded more quickly to other terrorist threats. [...] "When we actually saw bin Laden on the ground, using the Predator or other means, did we have...actionable intelligence? Should we have sent a cruise missile into a site where he was at that point? I think those early opportunities are clear. We had him. We saw him. I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> {{we could have done}} something about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{recording}} {{took place}} at Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville in February 2014, including all of Auerbach's vocals. According to the band, they wrote 30 songs while recording the album, but were unable to complete all of them. Carney spent about three-to-four days sequencing the album at his studio before soliciting Auerbach's input. The only change made to the running order was the addition of [...] "Gotta Get Away" [...] to the end; Carney had wanted [...] "In Our Prime" [...] to close the record, but Auerbach thought the song was too sad and preferred a catchy, upbeat track to conclude the album. Carney agreed with the change, saying, [...] "Actually, I think it works well at the end, too. It erases your brain from whatever heavy elements {{there are in the}} record. I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> it encourages you to go back and listen to the record again." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "He {{has that}} wall up, and it's not {{necessarily}} his fault; it's his past that has built the wall.

Well, it's their second marriage {{and they have}} a child together and it still has not changed. That wall is not budging." [...] Havins continued, [...] "Babe can only take so much. Plus, her husband tried to kill her. I honestly think, in a way, this is a hint of a delayed reaction, emotionally, to that." [...] Havins felt that JR's murder attempt on Babe seemingly came out of nowhere: It happened so fast, and the resolve was {{in the blink of an}} eye. I would walk away for a lot less! I think she was so wanting to get that family unit back on track that she didn't allow herself the proper time to heal. Then, on top of it, here's Josh. Everything she wants to feel with her husband she's feeling with Josh, and that's what's missing, because JR doesn't talk.|$|E

Betty starts having doubts and <b>thinks</b> <b>maybe</b> it's better to just bow out, but Matt, furious over his mother's dislike for Betty, gives Victoria {{a piece of his}} mind and says that he is {{standing}} by his girlfriend Betty. A stunned Betty didn't want to be labelled by Matt as his girlfriend, but apparently he does. Eventually, Betty is convinced as well, even though as she meets Matt the following day, Victoria still has a dislike for Betty after they run into each other on the street. However, Victoria has realised that she wants him to be happy, so she and Betty agree to be civil.|$|R
