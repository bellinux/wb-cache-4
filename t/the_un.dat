With Ridgway leading the Eighth Army, MacArthur started to regain confidence in UN forces' ability to hold Korea, and <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> evacuation plan was abandoned on January 17.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1960, in {{response}} to requests by Prime Minister Lumumba, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Security Council adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 143. This called upon Belgium to remove its troops and for <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> to provide 'military assistance' to the Congolese forces to allow them 'to meet fully their tasks'. Lumumba demanded that Belgium remove its troops immediately, threatening to seek help from the Soviet Union {{if they did not}} leave within two days. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> reacted quickly and established the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC). The first UN troops arrived the next day but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> over the new force's mandate. Because the Congolese army had been in disarray since the mutiny, Lumumba wanted to use <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> troops to subdue Katanga by force. Referring to the resolution, Lumumba wrote to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, 'From these texts it is clear that, contrary to your personal interpretation, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> force may be used to subdue the rebel government of Katanga.' Secretary General Hammarskjöld refused. To Hammarskjöld, the secession of Katanga was an internal Congolese matter and <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> was forbidden to intervene by Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. Disagreements over what <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{agencies}} and individuals associated with <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> {{have won the}} Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag Hammarskjöld and Kofi Annan, were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were Ralph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, René Cassin (1968), {{a contributor to the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull (1945), the latter {{for his role in the}} organization's founding. Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the International Atomic Energy Agency (which reports to <b>the</b> <b>UN)</b> in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts.

Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
