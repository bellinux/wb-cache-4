5|$|While {{acting as}} {{administrator}} of Nanyang in 31 CE, Du Shi (d. 38 CE) invented a water-powered reciprocator which worked <b>the</b> <b>bellows</b> {{of the blast}} furnace and cupola furnace in smelting iron; before this invention, intensive manual labor was required to work <b>the</b> <b>bellows.</b>|$|E

A scissor {{mechanism}} held <b>the</b> <b>bellows</b> in its expanded state until {{the photo was}} taken, but condensed it immediately afterwards. This allowed one exposure of size 6cm×9cm on a photographic plate, at a focal length of 85mm.|$|E
5|$|November 2010 saw {{the first}} {{performances}} on the organ after an 18-month renovation by its original builders Harrison & Harrison, costing around £800,000. The organ had been disassembled {{and some of it}} taken away to the builders' workshop in Durham. The pipes were cleaned and the leather of <b>the</b> <b>bellows</b> was replaced. The manuals were also fitted with an electronic panel for storing combinations of stop settings.|$|E
30|$|The {{compression}} {{coil spring}} was set {{on the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>bellow.</b> This spring was made from oil tempered SiCr-alloyed valve spring wire (SWOSC-V). When the actuator is driven, <b>the</b> <b>bellow</b> extends, and <b>the</b> spring is compressed. Consequently, the spring constant of the actuator is calculated by summing those of <b>the</b> <b>bellow</b> and <b>the</b> spring.|$|R

5|$|Bellows, hydraulic-powered: Although it {{is unknown}} if metallurgic bellows (i.e. air-blowing device) in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) were of the leather bag type or the wooden fan type found in the later Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368), the Eastern Han {{politician}} Du Shi (d. 38 AD) applied the use of rotating waterwheels to power <b>the</b> <b>bellows</b> of his blast furnace smelting iron, a method which continued in use in China thereafter, as evidenced by subsequent records; it is a significant invention in that iron production yields were increased and it employed all the necessary components for converting rotary motion into reciprocating motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{waterwheel}} {{appeared in}} Chinese records during the Han. As mentioned by Huan Tan in about 20 AD, {{they were used}} to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers, and were used in pounding, threshing and polishing grain. However, there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in China until about the 5th century. The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and mechanical engineer Du Shi (d.38 AD) created a waterwheel-powered reciprocator that worked <b>the</b> <b>bellows</b> for the smelting of iron. Waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches. The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century-AD Balanced Discourse.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{the organ}} before {{electricity}} required {{at least one}} person to operate <b>the</b> <b>bellows.</b> When signaled by the organist, a calcant would operate a set of bellows, supplying the organ with air. Because calcants were expensive, organists would usually practise on other instruments such as the clavichord or harpsichord. By the mid-19th-century bellows were also being operated by water engines, steam engines or gasoline engines. Starting in the 1860s bellows were gradually replaced by wind turbines which were later directly connected to electrical motors. This made it possible for organists to practice regularly on the organ. Most organs, both new and historic, have electric blowers, although others can still be operated manually. The wind supplied is stored in one or more regulators to maintain a constant pressure in the windchests until the action allows it to flow into the pipes.|$|E

5|$|Como {{was born}} in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. He was the seventh of ten {{children}} and the first American-born child of Pietro Como and Lucia Travaglini, who both emigrated to the US in 1910 from the Abruzzese town of Palena, Italy. He did not begin speaking English until he entered school, since the Comos spoke Italian at home. The family had a second-hand organ his father had bought for $3; as soon as Como was able to toddle, he would head to the instrument, pump <b>the</b> <b>bellows,</b> and play music he had heard by ear. Pietro, a mill hand and an amateur baritone, had all his children attend music lessons {{even if he could}} barely afford them. In a rare 1957 interview, Como's mother, Lucia, described how her young son also took on other jobs to pay for more music lessons; Como learned to play many different instruments, but never had a voice lesson. He showed more musical talent in his teenage years as a trombone player in the town's brass band, playing guitar, singing at weddings, and as an organist at church. Como {{was a member of the}} Canonsburg Italian Band along with the father of singer Bobby Vinton, bandleader Stan Vinton, who was often a customer at his barber shop.|$|E
5|$|Koalas are {{seasonal}} breeders, and births {{take place}} {{from the middle}} of spring through the summer to early autumn, from October to May. Females in oestrus tend to hold their heads further back than usual and commonly display tremors and spasms. However, males do not appear to recognise these signs, and have been observed to mount non-oestrous females. Because of his much larger size, a male can usually force himself on a female, mounting her from behind, and in extreme cases, the male may pull the female out of the tree. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors, but will submit to one that is dominant or is more familiar. <b>The</b> <b>bellows</b> and screams that accompany matings can attract other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders. These fights may allow the female to assess which is dominant. Older males usually have accumulated scratches, scars, and cuts on the exposed parts of their noses and on their eyelids.|$|E
25|$|Other accordions, {{such as the}} {{diatonic}} button accordion, {{have only}} a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing <b>the</b> <b>bellows.</b> There are also straps above and below <b>the</b> <b>bellows</b> to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.|$|E

25|$|Although {{birds have}} lungs, these are fairly rigid structures, which do do not expand and {{contract}} {{as they do in}} mammals, reptiles and many amphibians. The structures that act as <b>the</b> <b>bellows</b> which ventilate the lungs, are the air sacs distributed throughout much of the birds' bodies. Although the bird lungs are smaller than those in mammals of comparable size, the air sacs account for 15% of the total body volume, compared to the 7% devoted to the alveoli which act as <b>the</b> <b>bellows</b> in mammals.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bellows</b> is {{the most}} {{recognizable}} part of the instrument, and the primary means of articulation. Similar to a violin's bow, the production of sound in an accordion is {{in direct proportion to}} the motion of the player. <b>The</b> <b>bellows</b> is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from pleated layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal. It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal reeds and producing sound by their vibration, applied pressure increasing the volume.|$|E

25|$|Demian's {{instrument}} bore {{little resemblance}} to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating <b>the</b> <b>bellows.</b> One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key; one for each bellows direction (a bisonoric action).|$|E
25|$|Jeune's flutina resembles Wheatstone's {{concertina}} {{in internal}} construction and tone color, {{but it appears}} to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while <b>the</b> <b>bellows</b> is operated with the left.

The volume of a flexible polyhedron must remain constant as it flexes; this result is known as <b>the</b> <b>bellows</b> theorem.|$|E
