5|$|To {{cope with}} the ongoing war situation, Charles had {{introduced}} martial law to large swathes of the country; he extended this during 1626 and 1627, as the financial constraints imposed by Parliament began to cut into pay, leading to soldiers rioting. Under {{the law of the}} time, martial law was declared by the local military commander, at which point a group of Commissioners would be empowered to decide on the facts of offences, before passing the case to the commander, who would pass judgment. In practice, <b>things</b> <b>worked</b> completely differently. In Dover, the forces were commanded by Lord Conway, who declared martial law. Not only were commissioners authorised to decide on the facts, they were also permitted to authorise summary judgments, including the execution of people they deemed to be guilty. In addition, the commissioners were given the power not only to resolve billeting disputes between soldiers and civilians, but to order civilians to provide quarters for the troops. A later declaration of martial law in Portsmouth extended the commission's remit yet again, allowing for civilians to be tried under martial law and, if necessary, sentenced to death. Even this did not solve the problems, as soldiers would often wander outside the jurisdiction of the commissioners; to deal with this, February 1627 saw a Provost Marshal introduced to each county, bringing the entire nation under martial law.|$|E

25|$|The young Mueller enjoyed reading {{science fiction}} and, helped by his grandfather, {{woodworking}} – although his first model ship capsized. When he was aged 11 or 12 Mueller also built and raced model aircraft – such as gliders and rubber band model airplanes. Always curious about how <b>things</b> <b>worked,</b> he also built radios, {{following in the}} footsteps of his father. Interested in these activities, the teenage Mueller wanted to be an aeronautical engineer but discovered that where he could afford to go to school, the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy (now Missouri University of Science and Technology) in Rolla, Missouri, there was no aeronautical engineering department. They did offer mechanical engineering, so he enrolled in that program but found it discouraging and switched to electrical engineering.|$|E

Clint Weinrich married {{in the spring of}} 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve [...] "Stever" [...] Rapp, a college friend of Nunn’s who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. <b>Things</b> <b>worked</b> out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band’s permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album Teri Yakimoto. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song [...] "Whiskey." [...] With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released Full Length in CD format with bonus tracks under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP.|$|E

2500|$|Sometime during 1965 Ibárruri {{flew from}} Paris to Dubrovnik to {{apologize}} {{as president of}} the PCE to Josip Broz Tito. On May 17, 1948, the Cominform, successor to the ECCI, had expelled Yugoslavia from the community of Socialist countries and Ibárruri had lent her voice and pen to his censure. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held February 14–26, 1956, repudiated the charges against Yugoslavia. Now Ibárruri {{came face to face with}} the man she had slandered. She started to apologize profusely, but Tito cut her short and said, [...] "Do not vex yourself, Dolores, do not worry. I know very well how <b>things</b> <b>worked</b> in those days. I know it perfectly. Furthermore, believe me, I most likely would have done what you did had I been in your situation." [...] Ibárruri returned to visit Yugoslavia several times thereafter. In late December 1965 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR decorated Ibárruri with an Order of Lenin medal. A total of 431,418 decorations were given out between 1930 and 1991, but only seventeen went to foreigners.|$|E

60|$|I was at {{that time}} {{eighteen}} years of age, and had a natural love of justice and good neighborhood. I had also a little education, and knew something of history, so as to be able to judge a little of men and their actions. All this inspired me with hatred for this paltry despot. My own family, also, became the object of his suspicion or dislike, and felt more than once the arbitrary abuse of his power. These <b>things</b> <b>worked</b> together on my mind, and I gasped after vengeance. My character was always ardent and energetic; and acted upon by my love of justice, determined me by one blow to rid the country of the tyrant.|$|E
60|$|That day, {{like its}} predecessor, passed swiftly by {{and left her}} well out upon the huge, billowy bosom of the plains. Again she sought a hiding-place, but none offered. There was no warmth in the sand, and the night wind arose, cold and moaning. She could not sleep. The whole empty world seemed haunted. Rustlings of the sage, seepings of the sand, gusts of the wind, the night, the loneliness, the faithless stars and a treacherous moon that sank, the wailing of wolves--all these <b>things</b> <b>worked</b> upon her mind and spirit until she lost her courage. She feared to shut her eyes or cover her face, for then {{she could not see}} the {{stealthy}} forms stalking her out of the gloom. She prayed no more to her star.|$|E

60|$|There was a pause. Then, with {{a sudden}} impulse, he began to fumble in his breast-pocket. Rummy how <b>things</b> <b>worked</b> out for the best, however scaly they might seem at the moment. Only {{an hour or so}} ago he had been kicking himself for not having remembered that fifty-pound note, tacked on to the lining of his coat, when it would have come in handy at the police-station. He now saw that Providence had had the matter well in hand. If he had remembered it and coughed it up to the constabulary then, he wouldn't have had it now. And he needed it now. A mood of quixotic {{generosity}} had surged upon him. With swift fingers he jerked the note free from its moorings and displayed it like a conjurer exhibiting a rabbit.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} our captain, a bold and {{reckless}} man, carried us through to Wrangell by walking his boat over the sand bars on its paddle-wheel. I was exceedingly nervous, because if {{for any reason}} we had become stuck in mid river, {{it would have been}} impossible to feed Ladrone or to take him ashore except by means of another steamer. However, all <b>things</b> <b>worked</b> together to bring us safely through, and in the afternoon of the second day we entered an utterly different world--the warm, wet coast country. The air was moist, the grasses and tall ferns were luxuriant, and the forest trees immense. Out into a sun-bright bay we swept with a feeling of being in safe waters once more, and rounded-to about sunset at a point on the island just above a frowzy little town. This was Wrangell Island and the town was Fort Wrangell, one of the oldest stations on the coast.|$|E
60|$|The {{strain of}} {{listening}} {{and the effort}} of making practical arrangements and seeing that <b>things</b> <b>worked</b> smoothly, absorbed all Terence's power. Involved in this long dreary nightmare, he {{did not attempt to}} think what it amounted to. Rachel was ill; that was all; he must see that there was medicine and milk, and that things were ready when they were wanted. Thought had ceased; life itself had come to a standstill. Sunday was rather worse than Saturday had been, simply because the strain was a little greater every day, although nothing else had changed. The separate feelings of pleasure, interest, and pain, which combine to make up the ordinary day, were merged in one long-drawn sensation of sordid misery and profound boredom. He had never been so bored since he was shut up in the nursery alone as a child. The vision of Rachel as she was now, confused and heedless, had almost obliterated the vision of her as she had been once long ago; he could hardly believe that they had ever been happy, or engaged to be married, for what were feelings, what was there to be felt? Confusion covered every sight and person, and he seemed to see St. John, Ridley, and the stray people who came up now and then from the hotel to enquire, through a mist; the only people who were not hidden in this mist were Helen and Rodriguez, because they could tell him something definite about Rachel.|$|E

6000|$|After all, {{those other}} fellows who took high {{places in the}} College {{examinations}} and were the professor's model boys haven't done so amazingly. Some are professors themselves, some technical experts; not one can show things done such as I, following my own interest, have achieved. For I have built boats that smack across the water like whiplashes; no one ever dreamt of such boats until I built them; and I have surprised three secrets that are more than technical discoveries, in the unexpected hiding-places of Nature. I have come nearer flying than any man has done. Could I have done as much if I had had a turn for obeying those rather mediocre professors at the college who proposed to train my mind? If I had been trained in research--that ridiculous contradiction in terms--should I have done more than produce additions to the existing store of little papers with blunted conclusions, {{of which there are}} already too many? I see no sense in mock modesty upon this matter. Even by the standards of worldly success I am, by the side of my fellow-students, no failure. I had my F.R.S. by the time I was thirty-seven, and if I am not very wealthy poverty is as far from me as the Spanish Inquisition. Suppose I had stamped down on the head of my wandering curiosity, locked my imagination in a box just when it wanted to grow out to <b>things,</b> <b>worked</b> by so-and-so's excellent method and so-and-so's indications, where should I be now? ...|$|E
