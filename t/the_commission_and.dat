5|$|During {{the setting}} {{up of the}} European External Action Service (EEAS), Parliament used its control over the EU budget to {{influence}} {{the shape of the}} EEAS. MEPs had aimed at getting greater oversight over the EEAS by linking it to <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>and</b> having political deputies to the High Representative. MEPs didn't manage to get everything they demanded. However, they got broader financial control over the new body.|$|E
5|$|On 5 January 2011, the European Union {{created the}} European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), an {{emergency}} funding programme reliant upon funds {{raised on the}} financial markets and guaranteed by the European Commission using {{the budget of the}} European Union as collateral.

5|$|The {{institutions}} are not concentrated {{in a single}} capital city: instead, their headquarters are spread across four cities, Brussels, Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Frankfurt. The current arrangement was approved in 1992 and attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The treaty states that <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>and</b> Council would be based in Brussels, the Courts in Luxembourg and the Parliament in Strasbourg. However some departments of <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>and</b> meetings of the Council take place in Luxembourg, while the Parliament has its committees and some sessions in Brussels and its secretariat in Luxembourg. Of the new institutions, the Central Bank is based in Frankfurt while the European Council is based in Brussels (but has some extraordinary meetings elsewhere).|$|E

5|$|To {{compensate}} Luxembourg for {{the loss}} of <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>and</b> Council, a number of provisions were laid out. Firstly, the Court of Justice would remain in the city. Some departments of <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>and</b> the Assembly, including the Secretariat of the Assembly would remain along with European Investment Bank (further, particularly financial, institutions would also be prioritised for Luxembourg). The Council would also have to hold sessions in Luxembourg during April, June and October. It also confirmed Strasbourg as the seat of the Parliament. With the prioritisation of Luxembourg for future institutions, in 1977 the Court of Auditors became provisionally located in Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|According to Article 45 of the {{protocol}} to the Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania, the {{new members of}} the Commission representing the acceding member states were appointed by the Council of the European Union in common accord with the President of <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>and</b> after consultation with the European Parliament. Compared to former enlargements of the European Union, the Accession Treaty for Bulgaria and Romania, for the first time, contains an explicit acknowledgement of the Parliament’s role and constitutes the formal legal basis for the new Commissioners’ appointment procedure.|$|E
5|$|After college he {{rejoined the}} Naval Reserve {{with the aim}} of {{becoming}} an officer. Shortly after receiving his commission acceptance letter, his local bishop asked him to serve as a counselor in the bishopric. Time conflicts with bishopric meetings would have made Navy service impossible. After discussion with church apostle Harold B. Lee (his former stake president), Monson declined <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>and</b> applied for a discharge. The Navy granted his discharge in the last group processed before the Korean War. Lee set him apart six months later as a bishop—mentioning in the blessing that he likely would not have been called if he had accepted the commission.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, President Herbert Hoover {{appointed}} Stanley to the International Joint Commission, a body {{charged with}} settling boundary disputes between the United States and Canada.

5|$|In 1957 the Treaties of Rome {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The {{reason for this is}} the different relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>and</b> Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not invited}} to {{participate}} in the presidential debates because he did not meet the criteria of 15% support in five polls set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2015, Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein filed a lawsuit against the commission, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>and</b> its rules violated antitrust law and the First Amendment. In August 2016, the lawsuit was dismissed. Johnson's poll numbers have been averaging between 7 and 9 percent. Johnson's campaign manager Ron Nielson argued for Johnson's inclusion, citing Ross Perot's admission to the debates in the 1992 debates, when Perot was polling at 8 percent.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} institutions, the Parliament's seat {{was not yet}} fixed. The {{provisional}} arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>and</b> Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing {{to be closer to}} these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti {{accepted}} <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>and</b> created plaster {{models of}} the reliefs. He installed one of the models in his château in France, where it remains today, while the other was set into {{the wall of a}} gardener's cottage adjoining his French estate. The bronze relief of the deathbed scene was added to the pedestal in August 1866, while the Taking of Ascalon was installed in March 1867. The Art Journal criticised the deathbed scene as being excessively stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in the Houses of Parliament, created by John Cross, that depicted the same subject.|$|E

5|$|The Collegium of the Commission is the {{executive}} body of the Commission. It convenes once every week at least, and {{is responsible for the}} day-to-day running of the Eurasian Economic Union. It has a wide range of activities, including monitoring the implementation of treaties, submitting annual progress reports and making recommendations. The board of the commission also assists member states in the settlement of disputes, and carries out the draft of the union's budget. Part of its activities include being the intermediary between the departments of <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>and</b> the heads of state of the member states.|$|E
5|$|The Dardanelles Commission, {{including}} Fisher, interviewed {{witnesses in}} 1916 and 1917 and issued its final report in 1919. It {{concluded that the}} expedition was poorly planned and executed and that difficulties had been underestimated, problems which were exacerbated by supply shortages and by personality clashes and procrastination at high levels. Some 480,000 Allied troops had been dedicated to the failed campaign, with around half in casualties. The report's conclusions were regarded as insipid with no figures (political or military) heavily censured. The report of <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>and</b> information gathered by the inquiry remain a key source of documents on the campaign.|$|E

Dr. John Baer Stoudt, planned an observance for the 300th anniversary of the Nieuw Nederlandt voyage, and sought the issuance of commemorative stamps and coins. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium.|$|E

5|$|War {{memorials}} {{became a}} common sight in British towns and cities following the First World War (1914–1918). Almost one million men from Britain {{were killed in the}} conflict, and monuments were erected in virtually every settlement in the country. The memorial raised in Spalding, a town in southern Lincolnshire in eastern England, was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who had previously established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy clients. From 1917 onwards, Lutyens dedicated much of his time to the memorialisation of the war dead, first advising the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) and later designing war memorials both for <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>and</b> through his own practice. Spalding was one of his first war memorial commissions.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the Simon Commission {{which was}} {{appointed}} {{to report on the}} working of the progress of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms landed in India. The Swarajya Party moved a resolution to boycott <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>and</b> this was passed 61 to 50 with 12 remaining neutral. The Justice Party and the Swarajists supported the resolution while the Chief Minister P. Subbarayan opposed it and requested his ministers to resign. However, Lord Goschen, the Governor, was able to obtain the support of the Raja of Panagal by making a Justice Party member, M. Krishnan Nair, a Cabinet minister. Led by the Raja of Panagal, the Justice Party switched sides and lent its support to the Subbarayan government. Soon afterwards, the Justice Party passed a resolution welcoming the Simon Commission. The Simon Commission visited Madras on 28 February 1928 and 18 February 1929 and was boycotted by the Swarajya Party and the Indian National Congress. However, the Justicites and the Subbarayan Government accorded the Commission a warm reception.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi was, {{at least}} initially, much {{taken with the}} {{potential}} of the plot, and the opportunities the libretto provided for a variety of musical effects. Monteverdi stressed to Striggio the importance of finding a singer with real acting ability {{to play the role of}} Licori, someone capable of playing a man and a woman with appropriate emotions and gestures. Later he enthused about the chance to write a ballet for each of the five acts, all in different styles. Monteverdi's letters continued throughout the summer, but his attitude slowly changed, from one of evident commitment to frustration at the delays in getting the libretto copied. The musicologist Gary Tomlinson, in his analysis of the opera's genesis, suggests that Monteverdi may have been stalling. In September Striggio, having received, read and presumably not liked the expanded libretto, abruptly cancelled <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>and</b> the work is heard of no more. Monteverdi was told instead to work on the Armida setting.|$|E
25|$|Before 1882, {{municipal}} expenditures {{were covered}} with several types of taxes. Taxes were paid directly to the various funds that were responsible for financing and operating various types of municipal services. In the cities there were two main taxes: the city tax and the poor tax. The City Tax was originally imposed on real estate and businesses, but during the 19th century it evolved into a property tax. In the countryside there were more funds than in cities. The most important was the poor relief fund and the school fund. The taxes to these funds were determined, respectively by <b>the</b> poor <b>commission</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> school <b>commission</b> <b>and</b> were assessed on income, wealth {{and the value of}} the property. After the municipal self-government was introduced in 1837, the influence of elected representatives in <b>the</b> <b>commissions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>commissions</b> increased, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> taxes were soon {{under the control of the}} municipal council.|$|R
