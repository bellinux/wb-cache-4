This paper presents an improved scheme and its CORBA-based implementation based on our previous work [1]. This scheme can be used to simultaneously locate relevant <b>traffic</b> <b>monitors</b> along the path of a certain real-time flow and retrieve traffic information from them. By consolidating traffic information from these monitors embedded in different network segments, it is easy to derive quality of service (QoS) related parameters, such as delay jitter and loss ratio of this flow in different network segments. The improvement of the new scheme over the scheme in [1] is that the new scheme can be performed in multiple network management domains. ...|$|R

40|$|Flow-level traffic {{measurement}} {{is important for}} network management. The widely used centralized per-flow measurement faces a great challenge due to the demanding requirement on both memory bandwidth and memory size within a single <b>traffic</b> <b>monitor.</b> This paper addresses the issue of deploying a Distributed Passive Measurement System (DPMS) {{in a large scale}} network; specifically, we study how to optimally place <b>traffic</b> <b>monitors</b> and sample stochastic traffic flows, so that the probability of a packet being sampled (a. k. a. measurement coverage) is maximized. We formulate this problem as a Stochastic Chance Constrained Optimization (SCCO) problem; and we propose a Hybrid Intelligent (HI) algorithm to solve this problem. The HI algorithm consists of two major components, namely, uncertain function approximation and genetic algorithm. Equipped with the HI algorithm, we are able to address the optimal tradeoff between measurement coverage and deployment cost for networks with random traffic, which has not been studied before. Our simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, i. e., a small deployment cost or a small number of monitors are sufficient to maintain a high level of measurement coverage...|$|R
