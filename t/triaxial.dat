5|$|Vesta, the next-most-massive {{body in the}} {{asteroid}} belt after Ceres, is roughly spherical, deviating mainly because of massive impacts that formed Rheasilvia and Veneneia crater after it solidified. Furthermore, its <b>triaxial</b> dimensions are not consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Haumea {{displays}} large {{fluctuations in}} brightness {{over a period}} of 3.9 hours, which can only be explained by a rotational period of this length. This is faster than any other known equilibrium body in the Solar System, and indeed faster than any other known body larger than 100 km in diameter. While most rotating bodies in equilibrium are flattened into oblate spheroids, Haumea rotates so quickly that it is distorted into a <b>triaxial</b> ellipsoid. If Haumea were to rotate much more rapidly, it would distort itself into a dumbbell shape and split in two. This rapid rotation is thought to have been caused by the impact that created its satellites and collisional family.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} Solar System object can be deduced {{from its}} optical magnitude, its distance, and its albedo. Objects appear bright to Earth {{observers}} either because they are large or because they are highly reflective. If their reflectivity (albedo) can be ascertained, then a rough estimate can be made of their size. For most distant objects, the albedo is unknown, but Haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured, which has given an approximate value for its albedo and thus its size. However, the calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation. The rotational physics of deformable bodies predicts that over {{as little as a}} hundred days, a body rotating as rapidly as Haumea will have been distorted into the equilibrium form of a <b>triaxial</b> ellipsoid. It is thought that most of the fluctuation in Haumea's brightness is caused not by local differences in albedo but by the alternation of the side view and end view as seen from Earth.|$|E
25|$|Nuclei can be spherical, rugby ball-shaped (prolate deformation), discus-shaped (oblate deformation), <b>triaxial</b> (a {{combination}} of oblate and prolate deformation) or pear-shaped.|$|E

25|$|Strength {{parameters}} can {{be measured}} in the laboratory using direct shear test, <b>triaxial</b> shear test, simple shear test, fall cone test and (hand) shear vane test; there are numerous other devices and variations on these devices used in practice today. Tests conducted to characterize the strength and stiffness of the soils in the ground include the Cone penetration test and the Standard penetration test.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} whether Tethys is {{differentiated}} into a rocky core and ice mantle. However, if it is differentiated, the radius of the core does not exceed 145km, and its mass is below 6% of the total mass. Due to the action of tidal and rotational forces, Tethys has the shape of <b>triaxial</b> ellipsoid. The dimensions of this ellipsoid are consistent with it having a homogeneous interior. The existence of a subsurface ocean—a layer of liquid water {{in the interior of}} Tethys—is considered unlikely.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} Proteus {{is close to}} a sphere with a radius of about 210km, {{although}} deviations from the spherical shape are large—up to 20km; scientists believe it is about {{as large as a}} body of its density can be without being pulled into a perfect spherical shape by its own gravity. Saturn's moon Mimas has an ellipsoidal shape despite being slightly less massive than Proteus, perhaps due to the higher temperature near Saturn or tidal heating. Proteus is slightly elongated in the direction of Neptune, although its overall shape is closer to an irregular polyhedron than to a <b>triaxial</b> ellipsoid. The surface of Proteus shows several flat or slightly concave facets measuring from 150 to 200km in diameter. They are probably degraded impact craters.|$|E
500|$|Haumea's mass {{is about}} one-third that of Pluto, and 1/1400 that of Earth. Although its shape {{has not been}} {{directly}} observed, calculations from its light curve indicate {{that it is a}} <b>triaxial</b> ellipsoid, with its major axis twice as long as its minor. Its gravity is thought to be sufficient for it to have relaxed into hydrostatic equilibrium, making it a dwarf planet. [...] Haumea's elongated shape together with its rapid rotation, high density, and high albedo (from a surface of crystalline water ice), are thought to be the consequences of a giant collision, which left Haumea the largest member of a collisional family that includes several large trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and Haumea's two known moons, Hiʻiaka and Namaka.|$|E
500|$|Several ellipsoid-model {{calculations}} of Haumea's dimensions have been made. The first model produced after Haumea's discovery was calculated from ground-based observations of Haumea's light curve at optical wavelengths: {{it provided a}} total length of 1,960 to 2,500 km and a visual albedo (pv) greater than 0.6. The most likely shape is a <b>triaxial</b> ellipsoid with approximate dimensions of 2,000 × 1,500 × 1,000 km, with an albedo of 0.71. Observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope give a diameter of [...] and an albedo of , from photometry at infrared wavelengths of 70 μm. Subsequent light-curve analyses have suggested an equivalent circular diameter of 1,450 km. In 2010 an analysis of measurements taken by Herschel Space Telescope together with the older Spitzer Telescope measurements yielded a new estimate of the equivalent diameter of Haumea—about 1300 km. These independent size estimates overlap at an average geometric mean diameter of roughly 1,400 km.|$|E
500|$|Close-in {{anti-aircraft}} {{defense would}} have been provided by 40mm and 20mm guns. Arguably the best light anti-aircraft gun of the Second World War, the 40mm Bofors was used for air defense both on land and at sea {{by many of the}} countries involved, including the Americans, British, Dutch, Japanese, and Swedish. Produced in the early 1930s, it first entered service with the Royal Netherlands Navy when the cruisers Java and Sumatra were refitted in 1934–35. Before the Second World War, Hazemeyer, a Dutch subsidiary of the German company Siemens & Halske, had devised [...] "a very advanced <b>triaxial</b> mounting together with a tachymetric control system" [...] for the 40mm gun. When the Netherlands fell in 1940, this was brought to the U.K. aboard the minesweeper Willem van der Zaan, where it was copied and put into service as the British MarkIV twin mount. The description of the proposed fire control mechanism for the 1047s, discussed on 6 November 1939, mentions that the 40mm weapons were [...] "to be controlled autonomously from the gun positions"; this seems to describe Hazemeyer's system, but no direct link is made in sources.|$|E
500|$|The Imperial County Services building, a six-story {{reinforced}} concrete building located [...] {{northwest of the}} epicenter in El Centro, was built in 1971 when there were few other tall buildings in the area. The decision to equip the building with nine strong motion sensors in May 1976 was based on its size, structural attributes, and location in a seismically active area. Unusually detailed structural analysis was possible {{as a result of}} the building having been outfitted with the instrumentation. The initial configuration was tested shortly after its installation when a relatively small (4.9 local magnitude) earthquake occurred [...] northwest of the building on November 4, 1976. The accelerations recorded on the equipment during the event proved to be of very low amplitude and, as a result, the instrumentation was upgraded to include a 13 channel configuration in the building along with a Kinemetrics <b>triaxial</b> (3 channel) accelerograph located [...] east of the building at ground level. The full 16 channel system was managed by the California Division of Mines and Geology Office of Ground Motion Studies and provided almost 60 seconds worth of high resolution data during the 1979 event.|$|E

The observed oblateness corresponds to a rotation period of 10 hours, not to the 79 days observed. A possible explanation for this is that the shape of Iapetus was frozen by formation of a thick crust shortly after its formation, while its rotation continued to slow afterwards due to tidal dissipation, until it became tidally locked.|$|E
2500|$|The term 'cyclic liquefaction' {{refers to}} the {{occurrence}} {{of a state of}} soil when large shear strains have accumulated in response to cyclic loading. A typical reference strain for the approximate occurrence of zero effective stress is 5% double amplitude shear strain. [...] This is a soil test based definition, usually performed via cyclic <b>triaxial,</b> cyclic direct simple shear, or cyclic torsional shear type apparatus. These tests are performed to determine a soil's resistance to liquefaction by observing the number of cycles of loading at a particular shear stress amplitude before it 'fails'. Failure here is defined by the aforementioned shear strain criteria.|$|E
