5|$|A {{cervical}} mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. <b>This</b> <b>provides</b> a protective seal for the uterus against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E

5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. <b>This</b> <b>provides</b> information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. They are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E
5|$|As {{the desert}} {{mountains}} decay, {{large areas of}} shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues and the end products are either dust or sand. Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites, limestone and sandstone. There is a certain critical size (about 0.5mm) below which further temperature-induced weathering of rocks does not occur and <b>this</b> <b>provides</b> a minimum size for sand grains.|$|E
5|$|Friendship {{is another}} {{prominent}} element of Live and Let Die, where {{the importance of}} male friends and allies shows through in Bond's relationships with Leiter and Quarrel. The more complete characters profiles in the novel clearly showed the strong relationship between Bond and Leiter. In turn <b>this</b> <b>provides</b> a strengthened motive for Bond to chase Mr Big as revenge for the shark attack on Leiter.|$|E

5|$|If {{someone is}} {{found guilty of}} an attempt, they are sentenced under section 4(1) of the 1981 Act. <b>This</b> <b>provides</b> that anyone who {{attempts}} to commit an offence will be punished with {{the same period in}} prison as if they had succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, for example, someone convicted of attempted theft would also find themselves sentenced to a maximum of seven years.|$|E
5|$|In {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, {{cells in}} different organs and tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have {{different sets of}} enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. <b>This</b> <b>provides</b> a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. <b>This</b> <b>provides</b> redundancy in case one component should fail, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E

And a reference setup is also presented to determine the system efficiency factor of the phased array system. Furthermore, the accuracy of <b>this</b> <b>provided</b> model will be certified by comparing with the experimental testing...|$|R

Together with the Kennet Navigation which joins the River Thames at Reading, <b>this</b> <b>provides</b> a through route for canal boats from Bristol to London. From this point {{downstream}} {{the river is}} known as the Avon Navigation.|$|E
5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. <b>This</b> <b>provides</b> a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Susan Hall {{wrote that}} there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic {{officials}} are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. <b>This</b> <b>provides</b> an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.|$|E

5|$|The {{recognition}} of pneumatic foramina in Majungasaurus, besides providing {{an understanding of}} its respiratory biology, also has larger-scale implications for evolutionary biology. The split between the ceratosaur line, which led to Majungasaurus, and the tetanuran line, to which birds belong, occurred {{very early in the}} history of theropods. The avian respiratory system, present in both lines, must therefore have evolved before the split, and well before the evolution of birds themselves. <b>This</b> <b>provides</b> further evidence of the dinosaurian origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>provides</b> a {{definition}} {{for the moment}} of inertia, which is the rotational equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of inertia must be substituted by the tensor that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of rotations including precession and nutation.|$|E

In 2006 a new freight park, known as the 3MG Mersey Multimodal Gateway, was opened in the West Bank area of the town. <b>This</b> <b>provides</b> a link for freight arriving by road, air or sea to be transferred to the rail network. It is expected to create up to 5,000 new jobs.|$|E

5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. <b>This</b> <b>provides</b> camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
