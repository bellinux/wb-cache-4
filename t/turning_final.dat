500|$|Sequels to Final Fantasy XV were {{hinted at}} {{with the line}} [...] "A World of the Versus Epic" [...] in the E3 2013 trailer. Nomura {{explained}} that the game had a self-contained climax {{and that it was}} the first part of an intended continued epic. He said that Square Enix was considering using online elements and developing shorter stand-alone titles to keep players interested and to avoid long waiting times for them. This was interpreted as a move of the company towards a digitally distributed episodic format for possible sequels. Nomura later clarified at the Japan Expo 2013 that no plans for sequels had been finalized. Later, Tabata stated in interviews that Final Fantasy XV would be released as a single complete experience, and that no sequel was planned. In addition, there were no plans for multiple endings or a cliffhanger ending, with Tabata citing the XIII trilogy as a video game narrative style they were trying not to emulate. Despite this wish, the scale of XVs world and story would have needed multiple games to tell the entire story. To avoid <b>turning</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy XV into a series of games, the team instead produced additional media surrounding XV, turning it into a multimedia project: while the main game could be enjoyed on its own, the other media could be used as introductions to the setting for newcomers. This project is being referred by Square Enix as the [...] "Final Fantasy XV Universe". According to Tabata, the Universe is split into two halves; media designed to reach a wider audience than the game might manage alone, and additional game-related content such as ports to other hardware and downloadable content (DLC).|$|E
50|$|On November 14, 1956 a Capital pilot {{reported}} seeing a blue-white {{ball in the}} sky. The pilot, Captain William J. Hull, was a senior captain who was hired by Pennsylvania-Central in April 1941. He was the captain of Capital Flight 67 which crashed <b>turning</b> <b>final</b> to Tri-City Airport, Freeland, Michigan on April 6, 1958. At {{the time he had}} a total flight time of 16,050 hours, of which 1,702 were in the Viscount.|$|E
40|$|Several studies {{report that}} basic motor abilities, {{including}} muscular strength and static and dynamic balance influence {{the risk of}} falls in elderly people. However, {{the relationship between these}} features is not fully clear. In this study, we measured static posturography and TUG (performed using force platform and wearable inertial sensors) with handgrip strength (HSG) and determined the correlation between balance and HSG performances. Twenty-two healthy individuals (10 M, 12 F, age 68. 0 SD 8. 3) underwent a 30 s static posturography and instrumented TUG using an inertial sensor attached at the lower lumbar level. The center-of-pressure (COP) time series acquired with the force platform were processed to calculate: sway area, COP path length, maximum COP displacements and velocities in AP and ML directions. For the TUG, acceleration data allows calculating: duration of the trial, duration of sit-to-stand, intermediate <b>turning,</b> <b>final</b> turning and stand-to-sit phases. HSG was measured using a validated dynamometer. Pearson’s product-moment correlations was calculated by setting the significance level at p= 0. 05. We found significant positive correlations of HSG with sway area (r= 0. 462), path length (r= 0. 510) COP displacements and velocities in AP and ML direction (r= 0. 576 and 0. 422 for displacements, r= 0. 563 and 0. 414 for velocities). Moreover HSG is negatively correlated with TUG duration (r=- 0. 604) and final rotation phase (r= - 0. 509). Such results suggest that HSG is a good predictor of static balance, while muscular strength seems to be less of an influence in dynamic balance tasks like TUG...|$|E
