40|$|Corrosion {{of metals}} and metal alloys in a {{recirculating}} power plant cooling {{system is a}} major operational concern and is exacerbated when using treated municipal wastewater as makeup water, due to the degraded water quality. In this study different treated municipal wastewaters were used in a bench-scale water recirculation system, simulating cooling water conditions in power plant cooling systems. The treated municipal wastewaters used were: secondary treated municipal wastewater (SMW) with pH reduction, SMW with nitrification-filtration, and SMW with nitrification-filtration-granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorbtion. The corrosiveness of these treated municipal wastewaters to mild steel, copper and cupronickel alloys were analyzed. The efficacy of <b>Tolyltriazole</b> (a corrosion inhibitor) was also analyzed in this study.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} is {{discussed}} the possible application of surface analytical chemistry techniques {{to the study}} of copper corrosion and its inhibition in insulating oils. In particular, the techniques investigated were X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS). XPS was used, in combination with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), to study the formation and migration of the corrosion by-product copper sulfide on both copper conductors and paper insulation, as a consequence of their exposure to corrosive insulating oils. Its surface atomic sensitivity allowed the study of the influence of variables such as concentration of corrosive species, oxygen, time and copper-paper proximity on the corrosion process. This ultimately led to the formulation of a new bifurcated mechanism to explain how copper sulfide might contaminate the insulating system of power transformers filled with corrosive oils. Additionally, XPS could also be used to study the inhibitor layer formed by the benzotriazole derivative Irgamet® 39 on copper immersed in oil. The corrosion inhibitor was detected as a local enrichment of nitrogen on copper substrates, solely induced by the presence of its surface-active <b>tolyltriazole</b> moiety. Remarkably, it was possible to identify a correlation between the amount of corrosion inhibitor present in the oil and that effectively protecting copper, while estimating the thickness of the protection layer and the optimal amount of corrosion inhibitor to be used in real-life applications. SSIMS was used to increase the understanding of the copper inhibition process in oil by means of <b>tolyltriazole.</b> Thanks to its surface molecular sensitivity it was possible to obtain a new insight on the surface chemistry of the inhibitor, while investigating the effect of local temperature changes on the metal coverage and its stability under vacuum with the help of ion imaging. Moreover, it was also possible to estimate the energy of desorption of the <b>tolyltriazole</b> molecules from the copper surface. Finally, SSIMS ion imaging was shown to be a potentially valuable asset in forensic investigations, being able to track the distribution of corrosion inhibitor and by-products in decommissioned or failed power transformers...|$|E

The report includes all details on sampling stations, performance of analytical methods as well as the results of the analyses of all samples with regard to the occurrence and levels of 20 compounds of concern. In total, 219 whole water samples originating from 25 EU Member States and 2 other European countries, were assessed for contents of acesulfame, glyphosate and its metabolite AMPA, 1 H-Benzotriazole and <b>tolyltriazoles,</b> bisphenol A, triclosan and triclocarban, carbamazepine and its metabolite 10, 11 -dihydro- 10, 11 -dihydroxycarbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, perfluoropropionic acid, tris- 2 -chloropropyl phosphate, methyl tert-butyl ether, silver, boron and chloride (Cl-) in water. Furthermore, 23 sediment samples were analysed for decabromodiphenylethane and decabromodiphenyl ether. The underlying analytical methods are carefully documented with regards to their performance characteristics. Obtained results are assessed statistically and where possible compared to other findings. Although the analysed single samples are insufficient to make any statement on the performance of the treatment processes leading to the compost, the collective of data allows having a glance at the pan-European situation as regards the studies compounds. Background information from literature describing the situation before the survey is included, too. The report is divided into a core part and two annexes.

The compounds 1 H-benzotriazole (BTZ) and two <b>tolyltriazoles</b> (TTZs), 4 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole (4 -MBTZ) and 5 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole (5 -MBTZ), {{were present in the}} reverse osmosis concentrate at the highest concentrations (7. 4 and 12. 8 μg L − 1, respectively) and were partially removed by the fungal treatment under sterile conditions (58 % for BTZ and 92 % for TTZs) and non-sterile conditions, although to lesser extents (32 % for BTZ and 50 % for TTZs). Individual biotransformation studies of BTZ and the TTZs by T. versicolor in a synthetic medium and further analysis via on-line turbulent flow chromatography coupled to an HRMS-Orbitrap allowed the tentative identification of the transformation products (TPs). Six TPs were postulated for BTZ, two TPs were postulated for 4 -MBTZ, and four TPs were postulated for 5 -MBTZ.

40|$|Pharmaceuticals compounds, {{personal}} care products, and industrial chemicals {{in addition to}} their metabolites belong to the group of emerging contaminants (ECs) frequently detected in effluents discharged in the receiving environment, thus contaminating surface waters and causing potential ecological and human health disruptions. In case of reuse of reclaimed water for irrigation or aquifer recharge, some ECs may contaminate the soil and the ground water. In Tunisia, very few research work exist on the occurrence of ECs in reclaimed and surface waters. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the existence of some pharmaceuticals (ibuprofene, ketoprofene, naproxene and dichlophenac, trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole, furosemide, fenofibric acid, benzafibrate and gemfibrozil, atenolol and metoprolol and carbamazepine) as parent compounds, and transformation products (o-desmethyl-naproxene, 1 -OH-ibuprofene, 2 -OH-ibuprofene), biocides (trichlocarban and triclosan), and industrial compounds, (parabens, benzotriazoles, bisphenol A) and caffeine in reclaimed waters reused for irrigation and for aquifer recharge, and surface water in Tunisia. Water samples were taken from 3 sites: i) Nabeul (effluents from WTP and storage basin used for agricultural irrigation), ii) Korba (effluents from WTP and from infiltration basins used for aquifer recharge), and iii) Meliane River (estuary, discharge point of effluent). The results demonstrate the presence of ibuprofene and its metabolite 2 -OH-ibuprofene, diclofenac, oxazepam, atenolol, sulphamethoxazole and carbamazepine in all samples with the highest concentrations at the discharge point of the WTP in the river (1770 ng/L for atenolol). Concentrations in effluents and in water from storage basin were rather similar indicating their likely persistence. Naproxene, trimethoprim, fenofibric acid, ketoprofene and 1 -OH-ibuprofene were detected at the discharge point in the river, the effluent and the storage basin in Nabeul. In the latter, the concentrations were lower than in the effluent indicating either dilution or degradation. Except o-desmethyl-naproxene, benzafibrate and gemfibrozil, all other pharmaceuticals as well as methylparabene, propylparabene, <b>tolyltriazoles,</b> bisphenol A, trichlocarban, triclosan and caffeine were detected in the river water samples at concentrations ranging between 12 ng/L (trimethoprim) and 20, 000 ng/L (caffeine). These results show that effluents represent important point and diffuse source for ECs in river water in Tunisia. During reuse (irrigation or aquifer recharge) detected ECs will be discharged onto soil and may infiltrate to groundwater, if not degraded in the meantime.

Only the dissolved (liquid) water phase, and not the suspend material was investigated. Around 40 laboratories actively participated in this sampling and monitoring exercise organised by the Joint Research Centre¿s Institute for Environment and Sustainability (JRC-IES) of the European Commission (EC) in autumn 2007. The selection of sampling sites {{was done by the}} participating EU Member States. The most frequently and at the highest concentration levels detected compounds were benzotriazole, caffeine, carbamazepine, <b>tolyltriazole,</b> and nonylphenoxy acetic acid (NPE 1 C). Other important substances identified were naproxen, bezafibrate, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, PFOS, PFOA, sulfamethoxazole, isoproturon, diuron, and nonylphenol. The highest median concentrations of all samples were measured for benzotriazole (226 ng/L), caffeine (72 ng/L), carbamazepine (75 ng/L), <b>tolyltriazole</b> (140 ng/L), and NPE 1 C (233 ng/L). Relatively high perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) levels were detected in the Rivers Danube, Scheldt, Rhone, and Wyre, and ¿elevated¿ perfluorooctansulfonate (PFOS) concentrations in the Rivers Scheldt, Seine, Krka, Severn, Rhine, and Llobregat. A higher median concentration for all river samples was found for PFOS (6 ng/L), compared to PFOA (3 ng/L). Only about 10 % of the river water samples analysed could be classified as ¿very clean¿ in terms of chemical pollution, since they contained only a few compounds in very low concentrations.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Over the past decade, the occurrence and removal of emerging contaminants in the environment has received much attention. Both natural and synthetic progestogens, which are hormones, and also benzotriazoles are two examples of such emerging contaminants. Sewage treatment works are recognised {{as one of the}} main routes of these compounds to the environment. Low concentrations (nanograms per litre) of biologically active chemicals may exhibit an impact on aquatic organisms and human health. This study was undertaken to determine the occurrence and removal of these two classes of chemicals at sewage treatment works, along with an evaluation of the performance of advanced treatment and also to investigate their fate in the aquatic environment. Therefore, field-based sampling campaigns were undertaken at a sewage treatment works, rivers and potable water to achieve these aims. Solid phase extraction and LC/MS/MS were used in order to analyse the samples from these different locations, along with catchment modelling and assessment of how the use of benzotriazoles may contribute to their presence in the environment. The results have demonstrated that progestogens and benzotriazoles are in the sewage system; the natural hormone (progesterone) was the most predominant compound entering the sewage treatment work (46. 9 ng/l) among the progestogens while concentrations of the benzotriazoles were two orders of magnitude higher than the progestogens. The conventional sewage treatment works were, to some extent, able to remove these compounds from wastewaters. However, this may not be adequate to afford protection to the environment. The investigation of advanced treatments, ozone, granular activated carbon and chlorine dioxide, indicated no further significant removal of progestogens, probably as a result of concentrations being close to method detection limits. However, there were indications that benzotriazoles were removed. A degradation study demonstrated that the natural hormone (progesterone) was degraded rapidly while benzotriazoles were not degraded. Catchment modelling indicated that high (up to 2, 000 ng/l) concentrations of benzotriazoles would be present in surface waters used for potable supply, and consequently benzotriazoles were found in the tap water with mean concentrations of 30. 9 ng/l (benzotriazole) and 15. 1 ng/l for <b>tolyltriazole.</b> It is therefore apparent that although conventional treatment may be seen as effective, achieving over 90...|$|E
30|$|The {{xenobiotic}} compounds benzotriazole (BTri), 5 -tolyltriazole (5 -TTri), and 4 -tolyltriazole (4 -TTri) are polar micropollutants {{commonly used}} as corrosion inhibitors. 4 - and 5 -TTri are commercially available as <b>tolyltriazole</b> mixture (TTri) that {{is widely used}} in metal finishing and as corrosion protection in cooling systems [1, 2]. Among other applications, these three benzotriazole species are mainly used as anticorrosives in aircraft deicing or breaking fluids [3], in household dishwashing detergents for silver protection [4], and as UV stabilizers [5, 6]. Due to an annual production volume of around 9, 000 tons in the USA and probably a much higher global production [7, 8], their widespread usage, high polarity (logP 1.26 and 1.78 for BTri and TTri, respectively), high water solubility, and poor biodegradability, these compounds occur in nearly all aquatic compartments [9 – 12]. This includes ground water with up to 1, 548  ng/L (all three compounds) [13], river systems with up to 7, 997  ng/L for BTri, and 19, 396  ng/L for TTri [14], and the North Sea (up to 40  ng/L, all three benzotriazoles) [15, 16]. Highest concentrations of 128 and 198  mg/L for BTri and TTri, respectively, were detected at a perched water monitoring well at an international airport [17]. Concentrations above 40  mg/L for BTri and 6  mg/L for 5 -TTri show toxic effects in Microtox® tests (Vibrio fischeri light emission as toxicity test system, Azur Environmental, Oceanside, CA, USA) and other organisms [18 – 20]. Thus, benzotriazoles might exhibit detrimental effects on aquatic systems [21]. However, due to their high efficiency in protecting metal surfaces from corrosion, their low costs, and a general low toxicity, these chemicals are frequently used in industrial and household applications [7, 22]. As wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are incapable of completely removing these compounds during the treatment process [6, 23 – 25], WWTP effluents constitute a major point source for benzotriazoles in the receiving rivers. Several workgroups reported different removal efficiencies in conventional WWTP ranging from 13 % to 62 % for BTri, 11 % to 74 % for 5 -TTri, and far less for 4 -TTri [26 – 29]. At laboratory conditions, biological removal of BTri is also incomplete while one study with 5 -TTri showed its biodegradation under aerobic conditions within 91  days [9]. Reported half-lives of BTri and 5 -TTri with 114 and 14  days [9], respectively, are not applicable in WWTP where hydraulic retention times (HRT) are often below 15  h during biological treatment [9]. Therefore, these three compounds are ubiquitous in river water across Europe receiving WWTP effluents [14].|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the {{occurrence}} and removal of emerging contaminants {{in the environment}} has received much attention. Both natural and synthetic progestogens, which are hormones, and also benzotriazoles are two examples of such emerging contaminants. Sewage treatment works are recognised {{as one of the}} main routes of these compounds to the environment. Low concentrations (nanograms per litre) of biologically active chemicals may exhibit an impact on aquatic organisms and human health. This study was undertaken to determine the occurrence and removal of these two classes of chemicals at sewage treatment works, along with an evaluation of the performance of advanced treatment and also to investigate their fate in the aquatic environment. Therefore, field-based sampling campaigns were undertaken at a sewage treatment works, rivers and potable water to achieve these aims. Solid phase extraction and LC/MS/MS were used in order to analyse the samples from these different locations, along with catchment modelling and assessment of how the use of benzotriazoles may contribute to their presence in the environment. The results have demonstrated that progestogens and benzotriazoles are in the sewage system; the natural hormone (progesterone) was the most predominant compound entering the sewage treatment work (46. 9 ng/l) among the progestogens while concentrations of the benzotriazoles were two orders of magnitude higher than the progestogens. The conventional sewage treatment works were, to some extent, able to remove these compounds from wastewaters. However, this may not be adequate to afford protection to the environment. The investigation of advanced treatments, ozone, granular activated carbon and chlorine dioxide, indicated no further significant removal of progestogens, probably as a result of concentrations being close to method detection limits. However, there were indications that benzotriazoles were removed. A degradation study demonstrated that the natural hormone (progesterone) was degraded rapidly while benzotriazoles were not degraded. Catchment modelling indicated that high (up to 2, 000 ng/l) concentrations of benzotriazoles would be present in surface waters used for potable supply, and consequently benzotriazoles were found in the tap water with mean concentrations of 30. 9 ng/l (benzotriazole) and 15. 1 ng/l for <b>tolyltriazole.</b> It is therefore apparent that although conventional treatment may be seen as effective, achieving over 90 % removal, this may not be good enough. However, before investing in tertiary treatment, a number of factors, such as the effectiveness at different sites, the presence of degradation products and costs, both financial and in relation to energy use, need to be considered.
