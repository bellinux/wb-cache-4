5|$|Frances Mary McConnell-Mills (July 9, 1900 – December 28, 1975) was an American <b>toxicologist.</b> She was {{the first}} woman to be {{appointed}} Denver's city <b>toxicologist,</b> the first female <b>toxicologist</b> in the Rocky Mountains, and probably the first female forensic pathologist in the United States.|$|E
5|$|McConnell {{graduated}} from the University of Colorado as a Doctor of Medicine in 1925 and completed an internship at Denver General Hospital. She subsequently took on a position as a <b>toxicologist</b> in the coroner's offices at the same hospital, making her the first female <b>toxicologist</b> in the Rocky Mountains area. She was appointed Denver's city <b>toxicologist</b> in 1926 and became an assistant pathologist in 1927, working alongside deputy coroner George Bostwick and city pathologist W. S. Dennis. Her appointment to city <b>toxicologist</b> made her {{the first woman to}} hold the position.|$|E

50|$|<b>Toxicologists</b> perform {{many more}} duties {{including}} {{research in the}} academic, nonprofit and industrial fields, product safety evaluation, consulting, public service and legal regulation. In order to research and assess the effects of chemicals, <b>toxicologists</b> perform carefully designed studies and experiments. These experiments help identify the specific amount of a chemical that may cause harm and potential risks of being near or using products that contain certain chemicals. Research projects may range from assessing the effects of toxic pollutants on the environment to evaluating how the human immune system responds to chemical compounds within pharmaceutical drugs. While the basic duties of <b>toxicologists</b> are {{to determine the effects}} of chemicals on organisms and their surroundings, specific job duties may vary based on industry and employment. For example, forensic <b>toxicologists</b> may look for toxic substances in a crime scene, whereas aquatic <b>toxicologists</b> may analyze the toxicity level of wastewater.|$|R

5|$|The {{cause of}} death in the 2006 murder of Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian KGB agent who had {{defected}} to the British MI6 intelligence agency, was determined to be 210Po poisoning. According to Prof. Nick Priest of Middlesex University, an environmental <b>toxicologist</b> and radiation expert, speaking on Sky News on December 3, 2006, Litvinenko was probably the first person to die of the acute α-radiation effects of 210Po.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Scottish <b>toxicologist</b> John Duffus {{reviewed}} the definitions used {{over the previous}} 60 years and concluded they were so diverse as to effectively render the term meaningless. Along with this finding, the heavy metal status of some metals is occasionally challenged {{on the grounds that}} they are too light, or are involved in biological processes, or rarely constitute environmental hazards. Examples include scandium (too light); vanadium to zinc (biological processes); and rhodium, indium, and osmium (too rare).|$|E

5|$|There is no {{laboratory}} test for serotonin syndrome. Therefore, diagnosis is by symptom observation and {{investigation of the}} patient's history. Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The first rigorously evaluated criteria were introduced in 1991 by Harvey Sternbach, a {{professor of psychiatry at}} UCLA. Researchers in Australia later developed the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules, which have better sensitivity and specificity, 84% and 97%, respectively, when compared with the gold standard of diagnosis by a medical <b>toxicologist.</b> As of 2007, Sternbach's criteria were still the most commonly used.|$|E
5|$|They {{maintained}} that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was {{a symptom of the}} poison. Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to <b>toxicologist</b> Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E
5|$|A mass murder–suicide occurs among {{a team of}} geophysicists at an outpost in Icy Cape, Alaska.

With the scientists' bodies the group finds a dog, who attacks Mulder and Bear. Scully notices black nodules on its skin, and suspects {{that it may be}} infected with bubonic plague; she also notices movement beneath its skin. Although Bear (who was bitten by the dog) becomes ill and develops similar nodules on his body, autopsies reveal no such nodules on the bodies of the scientists.|$|E

5|$|McConnell {{was raised}} in Colorado and after {{studying}} chemistry she became a high school teacher. She later attended medical school at the University of Colorado Denver, graduating in 1925. She specialized {{in the fields of}} toxicology and forensic pathology, which led her to testify in many high-profile criminal cases throughout her career. In addition to working as Denver's city <b>toxicologist,</b> she held positions in multiple hospitals and administrative boards. After battling lifelong health problems, including rheumatic heart disease and a leg amputation, McConnell died in 1975. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E

Other experts who testified {{on behalf of}} the state included Edwin Cook, a psychiatrist, Diane Griffin, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University, Stephen Hanauer, a gastroenterologist, Christine McCusker, a pediatric immunologist, Brian Ward, a virologist who, along with Fombonne, published some research which failed to replicate the Unigenetics lab's results, and Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist.|$|E
5|$|Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 – February 16, 1998) was an American <b>toxicologist</b> {{and public}} health {{researcher}} who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying {{the effects of the}} 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs. Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her being threatened, to her funding being pulled, and to her losing her job at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1953. Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard, and subsequently at MIT and New York University. Despite the early controversy related to her work, it was used in the creation of standards in air pollution, and towards {{the end of her life}} she received numerous awards and accolades.|$|E

Orfila then submitted an affidavit stating that the tests were conducted so ignorantly that they meant nothing. As soon as the Brive doctors testified that arsenic was present in Lafarge's body, Paillet read the affidavit aloud, told the court about the Marsh test, and demanded that Orfila be called.|$|E
40|$|Editor’s Note: Risk {{perception}} {{is a critical}} interface between scientific facts and personal opinions and values. As a science that generates data to identify potential hazards to human and environmental health, <b>toxicologists</b> find themselves integrally and intricately engaged in translating the concepts of risk to the general public. However, the underlying, innate and individual reaction to information about hazard or risk {{is an area that}} <b>toxicologists</b> may not readily appreciate or understand. In this two-part article for this month’s 50 th anniversary review, David Ropeik provides an overview of risk perception and challenges <b>toxicologists</b> to think beyond rational instincts to improve how we engage in communicating risks to the general public. The second part of the article is a response to this challenge by Dr. Heather Wallace. In tandem, the articles are designed to help <b>toxicologists</b> understand the scope and gravity of issues surrounding the psychology of risk perception so as to stimulate ideas and strategies on how to improve this important interface. With better understanding and recognition of these issues, we can strive for more effective risk assessment and risk communication...|$|R
