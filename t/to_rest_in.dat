5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, the codex was brought to Florence by an émigré scholar. It belonged to Niccolo Ridolpho († 1550) Cardinal of Florence.

Catherine brought it to France {{as part of her}} dowry, and from the Bourbon royal library it came <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris.

5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} {{approached in}} 1939, Beecham was advised by his doctors {{to take a}} year's break from conducting, and he planned to go abroad <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> a warm climate, leaving the orchestra in other hands. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, while he strove to secure {{the future of the}} orchestra, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. The original LPO company was liquidated and Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra, helping its members to form themselves into a self-governing body.|$|E

The Australian Broadcasting Commission had been seeking for several years {{to get him to}} conduct in Australia. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. Before leaving, Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra and helped its members to form themselves into a self-governing company.|$|E
5|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Ny-Ålesund saw four air {{expeditions to}} the North Pole, {{two of which}} {{required}} {{the construction of an}} airship hangar and mast. The first proposal for an airport in Ny-Ålesund was launched in 1956 by Norsk Polar Navigasjon, who proposed an airport at Kvadehuksletta. Soviet protests against the airport caused the Norwegian authorities to oppose the plans, which were laid <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> the early 1960s. Construction at Hamnerabben started in 1965 following the decision to build Kongsfjord Telemetry Station. The airport first hosted service to temporary landing strips near Longyearbyen, but from 1975 served Svalbard Airport. Lufttransport started flights with helicopters in the 1980s, but from 1989 has flown with fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Ceremonies, {{masses and}} an {{enormous}} funeral were held; a funeral train toured Poland. A series of postcards, stamps and postmarks was also released.

5|$|Despite republicanism in Greece, Olga {{was still}} held in high esteem {{and the republican}} {{government}} in Athens offered {{to pay for her}} funeral and repatriate her remains to Greece. Nonetheless, her children declined the offer, preferring to bury her in Italy beside her son, Constantine I, whose body Greece had refused to accept. Her funeral was held on 22 June 1926 at the Orthodox Church in Rome and the next day she was laid <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> the crypt of the Russian church in Florence. After the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935 she was re-interred at Tatoi on 17 November 1936.|$|E
5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{new types}} of burials and more {{imposing}} ones have been unearthed, which display {{a great variety of}} luxurious objects. Among the various burial types, the shaft grave became {{the most common form of}} elite burial, a feature that gave the name to the early period of Mycenaean Greece. Among the Mycenaean elite, deceased men were usually laid <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> gold masks and funerary armor, and women in gold crowns and clothes gleaming with gold ornaments. The royal shaft graves next to the acropolis of Mycenae, in particular the Grave Circles A and B signified the elevation of a native Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Wilis have cornered {{a terrified}} Hilarion. They use their magic {{to force him}} to dance until he is nearly dead, and then drown him in a nearby lake. Then they turn on Albrecht, {{sentencing}} him to death as well. He pleads to Myrtha for his life, but she coldly refuses. Giselle's pleas are also dismissed and Albrecht is forced to dance until sunrise. However, the power of Giselle's love counters the Wilis' magic and spares his life. The other spirits return to their graves at daybreak, but Giselle has broken through the chains of hatred and vengeance that control the Wilis, and is thus released from their powers. After bidding a tender farewell to Albrecht, Giselle returns to her grave <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> peace.|$|E
5|$|Medieval Spanish explorers {{arriving}} in the islands during the 14th century reported the Guanche buried individuals of low social status in sandy graves, while upper class members were mummified and laid <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> secluded caves. One of these mortuary caves may have held up to 1,000 mummies, however, many of these have disappeared with only 20 complete mummies left on the islands. The loss of such {{a large amount of}} mummies is generally attributed to the popularity of mummia, a pharmaceutical substance created out of pulverized mummies.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 1973, {{a private}} Learjet 24 crashed shortly after {{take-off}} from DeKalb–Peachtree Airport in Chamblee, Georgia, United States. The aircraft, registration N454RN, {{owned by a}} private corporation, struck birds shortly after lifting off. Air traffic control advised the flight crew of smoke trailing from their left engine; the crew {{said they would not}} be able to return to the airport.
