In an interview with Guitar World magazine to promote the reissue, he also revealed that McCartney had [...] "long since" [...] apologised for his behaviour towards him during the Beatles years. In the 2000 book The Beatles Anthology, Harrison comments: [...] "It's important to state that a lot of water has gone under the bridge... But talking about what was happening at that <b>time</b> , <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see it was strange." ...|$|E

In this format each player {{constructs}} a 100 singleton deck that has a legendary creature {{that acts as a}} commander. The deck construction is limited to the colors that are represented by the chosen commander and there cannot be two or more cards with the same name with the exception of basic lands. The legendary creature chosen as commander is kept in a special [...] "command zone" [...] and may be cast at any <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> afford to cast the creature.

500|$|A cover {{version of}} [...] "September Gurls" [...] {{appeared}} on the Bangles' 1986 triple platinum album Different Light. [...] "September Gurls", Borack wrote, [...] "was and is {{the sine qua non}} of power pop, a glorious, glittering jewel with every facet cut and shined to absolute perfection.... a peerless, aching distillation of love and longing. 'September Gurls' may not actually be the greatest song ever recorded, but for the duration of its 2:47 running <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be forgiven for believing it is." [...] The 1987 tribute song [...] "Alex Chilton", co-written by three members of the Replacements, was released as a single from the album Pleased to Meet Me and contains the lyric [...] "I never travel far without a little Big Star." [...] "I'm In Love With A Girl" [...] from Radio City features in the soundtrack of the 2009 film Adventureland. In 1998, an ad hoc, shortened version of #1 Records [...] "In the Street" [...] (recorded by Todd Griffin) was used as the theme song for the sitcom That '70s Show, and in 1999, a new version titled [...] "That '70s Song (In the Street)" [...] was recorded by Cheap Trick also specifically for the show. [...] "That '70s Song" [...] and Big Star's own [...] "September Gurls" [...] are included on the 1999 album That '70s Album (Rockin') released by the television program's producers. The 2006 tribute album Big Star, Small World includes Big Star covers by the Posies, Teenage Fanclub, Gin Blossoms, Wilco, the Afghan Whigs, and Whiskeytown, among others. Lucero, a Memphis, Tennessee-based alternative country band, covered [...] "I'm In Love With a Girl" [...] on their 2015 release All a Man Should Do, an album which takes its title from a lyric in the song. Founding member Jody Stephens, and later additions to Big Star, provide backup on the track.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1920s, the Marx Brothers {{had become}} one of America's {{favorite}} theatrical acts, with their sharp and bizarre sense of humor. They satirized high society and human hypocrisy, and they became famous for their improvisational comedy in free-form scenarios. A famous early instance was when Harpo arranged to chase a fleeing chorus girl across the stage during the middle of a Groucho monologue to see if Groucho would be thrown off. However, to the audience's delight, Groucho merely reacted by commenting, [...] "First time I ever saw a taxi hail a passenger". When Harpo chased the girl back in the other direction, Groucho calmly checked his watch and ad-libbed, [...] "The 9:20's right on <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> set your watch by the Lehigh Valley." ...|$|E

His record is unbelievable and he {{is probably the best}} horse I have ridden". Gosden, who was winning the race for the first time said [...] "It's great to win the Arc in France and the Derby in England - that's what it's about. When you're drawn wide, if you stay wide for a long <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> run your own little race and not be bothered by anyone and then slot across. It was perfect as we sat behind the pacemaker and then kicked because as Frankie says, if you don't kick at a certain time here they come like arrows at your back". He also suggested that the horse might make a final appearance in the Breeders' Cup Turf, saying [...] "The owner is keen on the Breeders' Cup. It's a month away. If he's in good order, there's no reason we couldn't go there".|$|E

2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "an extravagant and witty follow-up, {{made with the}} same {{friendly}} virtuosic dazzle… and just obligatory enough {{to be too much}} of a good thing." [...] He cautioned that [...] "this <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sense just how hard [...] is working to entertain you. Maybe a little too hard." [...] Mike Ryan at Uproxx noted the continued sense of humor and tone from the first film, and appreciated Gunn's difference in overall structure in the sequel (which he compared to The Empire Strikes Back). Ryan was positive of the cast, particularly Rooker in his expanded role as [...] "the heart" [...] of the film. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers called the film a [...] "blast" [...] and gave it three stars out of four, praising the film for its tone and fun, soundtrack, and characters. He noted that [...] "Vol. 2 can't match the sneak-attack surprise of its predecessor… the followup, while taking on some CGI bloat and sequel slickness, hasn't lost its love for inspired lunacy. Chicago Sun-Timess Richard Roeper also gave the film three stars, writing, [...] "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original—but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch." [...] Roeper continued that [...] "even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat", and praised the cast, especially Rooker, with [...] "one of the best roles in the movie".|$|E
2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E
