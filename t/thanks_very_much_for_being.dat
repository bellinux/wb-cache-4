It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|R

I wish to {{take this}} {{opportunity}} to inform you of a change of address. From Boston, I have moved to Washington D. C. and am now working in the Bureau of Personnel. Here is the new address: George A. Bunnell, Jr. 3516 10 th Street N. W. Washington, D. C. 2. 		I am a little late in doing this, but <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the Christmas present. The sweater which you sent me came in very handy during guard duty on cold nights in Boston. From the weather we have been getting here in Washington I am going to have to use it again soon. 3. 		You have received many letters from other Bryant graduates saying that they had found no other schools with a service club like yours. I will echo their statements. I have met many fellows who have attended many different business schools and collegs [sic], and none of them have attended schools that have service clubs like Bryant’s. 4. 		A word of advice to those of you studying typing. Learn how to use carbon. If you ever have to do any work for the Army, Navy, or any governmental agency you will use carbon, carbon, and more carbon. George A. Bunnell, Jr. [Transcription ends...|$|R

I simply came to feel that the editorial needs of comics.com and those of “Pibgorn” were becoming more and more divergent and incompatible. For this reason I asked to be released from my contract with United Media in order to secure a new online home for “Pibgorn.” United Media most graciously, and reluctantly, agreed. In short order I hope to get Pib back up and flying.Meanwhile, you have seen the most current installments of '"Pibgorn." [...] Hold that thought. We’ll be back.All best wishes, and <b>thanks</b> so <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> writing.|$|R
