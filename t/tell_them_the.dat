5|$|In 2013, Todd {{returns to}} Llanview {{to check on}} Dani, who had {{previously}} phoned him several times. He witnesses Dani collapse from a drug overdose due to her abuse of oxycodone. While she is recovering at the hospital, an alive Victor arrives. A surprised Téa, Dani, and Jack welcome Victor back, while Todd tries to bond with his children. Todd remains concerned about Jack and Dani, attempting to buy their affections with money and deciding {{the best way to}} win them over is to call a truce with Victor. He also tries to win back Blair's affections. He eventually admits he only pretended to get along with Victor to lure him into a false sense of security. Victor admits that he poisoned Todd's scotch with arsenic and then tried to strangle him. Jack takes Todd to the hospital, where he recovers but is frustrated when his family continues to defend Victor. Victor realizes he must leave town and says goodbye to his family. Todd shows Blair a threatening note he received with the names of all his loved ones on it. The mysterious Tattoo Organization that held Victor demands that Todd find and kill Victor. Todd, Blair and Téa devise a scheme to fool this organization into believing Victor is dead. Feeling secure that their scheme has worked, they plan for a future.

5|$|The season {{introduces}} Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) in {{the year}} 2030 as he sits his daughter and son down to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> story of how he met their mother. The story begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living in Manhattan with his two best friends from college: Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris). Ted begins his search for his perfect mate and meets an ambitious young reporter, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), whom he quickly falls in love with. Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Ted begins dating a baker, Victoria, but when she moves to Germany for a culinary fellowship, Ted leads Robin {{to believe that she}} broke up with him. As a result, Victoria breaks up with Ted and Robin begins to distance herself from him, though they eventually reconcile. As her wedding date approaches, Lily begins to wonder if she's missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking her engagement in the process. At the end of the season, Marshall is seen looking desolate and miserable, while Ted and Robin agree to pursue a relationship.|$|E
25|$|Barbary slaves {{could hope}} to be freed through payment of a ransom. Despite the efforts of {{middlemen}} and charities {{to raise money to}} provide ransoms, they were still very difficult to come by. As European communities increased their charity funding for ransoming slaves, North African states increased the amount of ransom required. Lack of money to pay a ransom was not the only problem. Persons taken captive needed to notify their families of their status and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> ransom price. Mail charges were often beyond the reach of ordinary captive slaves, and it could take several months for the mail to be delivered.|$|E

Morbus remains in a petrified state in {{territory}} now controlled by the Trojans, who are unaware of the other races, of Morbus's identity, or of the war against the Dark Tribe. The story begins when Morbus's assistant, Q'nqüra, spreads shadow-weed around the statue, releasing him. When the Trojans discover the statue gone and the effects of shadow-weed spreading, they elect to abandon the area. Landing on a new island, they encounter friendly Romans and hostile Mayans. Allying with the Romans, the Trojans tell them of the disappearance of Morbus's statue, and the Romans <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> history of the war, and call a meeting of all four races. They are all shocked, however, when they learn the Dark Tribe are now using aerial vehicles, dubbed manacopters, to easily infiltrate their lines and inflict huge losses.|$|E

During a series of interviews, Diehl-Armstrong admitted to providing the kitchen timers used for the bomb and said that Rothstein was the mastermind of the plot and that Wells had been {{directly involved in the}} plan. In late 2005, Kenneth Barnes, an ex-television repairman in jail on unrelated drug charges and friend of Diehl-Armstrong, was turned in by his brother-in-law after revealing details of the crime to him. Barnes told investigators that would <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> whole story in return for a reduced sentence.

Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) takes it upon herself to protect the office and their clients from Creed's haphazard and potentially catastrophic managerial style (he keeps trying to call major clients and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> office is about to go out of business) by distracting him with activities and posing as various clients when Creed has Jordan Garfield (Cody Horn) contact them.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Mason's {{amalgam of}} tales and {{teaching}} excursions dominates the text; although the text emphasizes the girls' moral progress, the reader learns {{very little about}} the girls themselves. The work consists largely of personal histories of people known to Mrs. Mason and of moral tales for the edification of Mary and Caroline and the reader. For example, [...] "The History of Charles Townley" [...] illustrates the fatal consequences of procrastination. Mrs. Mason takes the girls to Charles Townley's ruined mansion to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> cautionary tale of a [...] "boy of uncommon abilities, and strong feelings"; unfortunately, [...] "he ever permitted those feelings to direct his conduct, without submitting to the direction of reason; I mean, the present emotion governed him ... He always indeed intended to act right in every particular to-morrow; but to-day he followed the prevailing whim" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). Charles wants to help those in need, but he is easily distracted by novels and plays. He eventually loses all of his money but his one remaining friend helps him regain his fortune in India. Yet even when this friend needs assistance, Charles cannot act quickly enough and, tragically, his friend is imprisoned and dies and his friend's daughter is forced to marry a rake. When Charles returns to England, he is overcome with guilt. He rescues the daughter from her unhappy marriage, but both she and he have gone slightly insane {{by the end of the}} story, she from her marriage and he from guilt.|$|E

500|$|The Ozians are cheering at {{the news}} that the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba, is dead ("No One Mourns the Wicked"). Glinda arrives and an Ozian asks her if she and Elphaba were friends. She admits that they were, leading Glinda to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> story of how they became best friends. She also tells them her name was Galinda before she changed it. A {{flashback}} starts with a scene in a school, Shiz, where Elphaba arrives. Elphaba was the daughter of the governor of Munchkinland - but it is heavily implied that she is the product of an affair between the governor's wife and a mysterious stranger and his bottle of [...] "green elixir." [...] Elphaba was born with green skin as a result. Her father despised her and showered his affection on her younger sister, Nessarose, who is disabled and uses a wheelchair. The two sisters both go to Shiz University, where the pretty and popular Galinda is also in their class ("Dear Old Shiz"). As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of silver slippers. The headmistress, Madame Morrible, decides to take Nessarose under her protection, despite Elphaba's objections, now without a roommate and ends up with Galinda, to the disgust of both. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister as she is wheeled away, and her frustration manifests itself physically in an explosion. Madame Morrible recognizes that she has special powers and decides to teach her sorcery - and to teach no one else, even though Galinda had her heart set on studying magic at school. She even tells Elphaba that her powers might allow her to work with the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, something which Elphaba has dreamed of ("The Wizard and I").|$|E
500|$|Ashman {{first met}} American actress and singer Jodi Benson {{while he was}} {{directing}} her in Smile. After the production closed prematurely, Ashman invited Smiles entire female cast to audition for The Little Mermaid using [...] "Part of Your World", {{although he did not}} <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> name of the project they were auditioning for. Ashman mailed a copy of his demo of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to Benson, to which she listened in preparation for her audition. Benson then recorded a brief sample of the song on a reel-to-reel tape, which she mailed to Disney. All audition tapes were left unidentified so that the candidates would remain anonymous to Musker and Clements, delighting Ashman when the directors ultimately selected Benson's tape to be the voice of Ariel. Her first voice acting role, for which she had to be carefully trained on properly projecting into the studio microphone, Benson found the process of recording [...] "Part of Your World" [...] somewhat difficult after Ashman instructed her to approach it as though she was reciting a monologue as opposed to singing a song, although she found Ashman telling her exactly how he wanted her to perform its lyrics helpful with benefiting her entire performance. Ashman remained in the recording booth with Benson during the entire recording process, advising her on performing the song with intensity as opposed to belting it and whispering lines to her as she sang them. It was rare for a filmmaker to direct a performer from within the booth, requiring Ashman to move carefully to prevent his gestures from being recorded by the microphone. Initially struggling to capture Ariel's [...] "tomboyish-ness and yearning", Benson requested that the studio's lights be dimmed to simulate the feeling of being underwater. Menken and Ashman deliberately selected segments from Benson's recording session that [...] "are not perfectly sung" [...] to include in the final version, ranging from unsustained, incorrect notes lacking in vibrato to spoken words, because the songwriters wanted her performance to sound as [...] "real" [...] as possible.|$|E
