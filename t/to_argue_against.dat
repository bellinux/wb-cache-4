5|$|Along {{with the}} loss of their land, local {{residents}} discovered that they had been disenfranchised. Now a part of the ACT, they had lost their vote in the New South Wales government, and their numbers were too small to warrant a seat in the new federal parliament.

5|$|As {{a part of}} Las Casas's defense by offense, he had <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>against</b> Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. Sepúlveda was {{a doctor}} of {{theology}} and law who, in his book Democrates Alter, sive de justis causis apud Indos (Another Democrates /or A New Democrates, or on the Just Causes of War against the Indians) had argued that some native peoples were incapable of ruling themselves and should be pacified forcefully. The book was deemed unsound for publication by the theologians of Salamanca and Alcalá for containing unsound doctrine, but the pro-encomendero faction seized on Sepúlveda as their intellectual champion.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, {{the most}} {{prominent}} fight was over {{the need for a}} strong protective tariff, which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing. Payne supported a high tariff, but thought some small reductions would be prudent {{in order to reduce the}} federal government's surplus. He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the debate was <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>against</b> a reduction in the tariff on steel and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to pass in the House, which was controlled by Democrats.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded supernova, SN 185, {{was viewed}} by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD. The brightest recorded supernova was SN 1006, which occurred in 1006 AD and {{was described in}} detail by Chinese and Islamic astronomers. The widely observed supernova SN 1054 produced the Crab Nebula. Supernovae SN 1572 and SN 1604, the latest to be observed {{with the naked eye}} in the Milky Way galaxy, had notable effects on the development of astronomy in Europe because they were used <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>against</b> the Aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the Moon and planets was static and unchanging. Johannes Kepler began observing SN 1604 at its peak on October 17, 1604, and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later. It was the second supernova to be observed in a generation (after SN 1572 seen by Tycho Brahe in Cassiopeia).|$|E

40|$|The {{publication}} of my recent book, Did the Saviour See the Father? Christ, Salvation and the Vision of God, led to me {{being asked to}} speak about the contemporary defensibility of the thesis of Christ’s beatific knowledge. To illustrate something of the defensibility of the thesis, I spoke about how and why I came to write the book, and how and why I came to write it the way I did. I was initially motivated to write on the topic because it was controversial. From unanimity in favour of Christ’s beatific vision among Catholic theologians {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, there was a shift to a similar consensus against the thesis in the second half of the century. My book deals with reasons standardly given against the thesis, behind which is a general feeling that it makes Christ’s humanity somehow unreal, including objections based on limitations in Christ’s knowledge, his freedom, and suffering. Two objections which surprised me by their significance were the lack of biblical evidence and the idea that Christ had faith, both of which influenced the shape of the argument of my book in unexpected ways. I conclude that there has been a shift in what is required to defend the thesis of Christ’s beatific vision, from <b>arguing</b> <b>against</b> the view that it makes Christ’s humanity unreal, <b>to</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>against</b> the view that it makes him exceptional, <b>to</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>against</b> the view that Christ had faith...|$|R

50|$|The First Apology was {{an early}} work of Christian apologetics {{addressed}} by Justin Martyr to the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius.

This work, along with the Second Apology, has been cited {{as one of the}} earliest examples of Christian apology, and many scholars attribute this work to creating a new genre of apology out of what was a typical Roman administrative procedure.|$|R

25|$|The first {{field to}} claim descent from Kuhn’s ideas was the {{sociology}} of scientific knowledge. Sociologists working within this new field, including Harry Collins and Steven Shapin, used Kuhn’s emphasis {{on the role of}} non-evidential community factors in scientific development <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>against</b> logical empiricism, which discouraged inquiry into the social aspects of scientific communities. These sociologists expanded upon Kuhn’s ideas, arguing that scientific judgment is determined by social factors, such as professional interests and political ideologies.|$|E

40|$|In {{his recent}} book, Death, Posthumous Harm, and Bioethics (Routeledge 2012), James Stacey Taylor {{challenges}} two ideas whose provenance may be traced {{all the way}} back to Aristotle. The first of these is the thought that death (typically) harms the one who dies (mortal harm thesis). The second is the idea that one can be harmed (and wronged) by events that occur after one’s death (posthumous harm thesis). Taylor devotes two-thirds of the book <b>to</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>against</b> both theses and the remainder to working out the implications of their falsity for various bioethical concerns, including euthanasia, suicide, organ procurement, etc. In this brief article, I concentrate on Taylor’s case against the mortal harm thesis and suggest that his main argument against this claim begs the question...|$|R

25|$|Froudacity {{is split}} into four books, each {{addressing}} specific topics that Froude brings.

25|$|Appeals to {{simplicity}} {{were used}} <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>against</b> the phenomena of meteorites, ball lightning, continental drift, and reverse transcriptase. One can argue for atomic {{building blocks for}} matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the atomic theory was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles {{that had not been}} directly detected. Ernst Mach and the logical positivists rejected John Dalton's atomic theory until the reality of atoms was more evident in Brownian motion, as shown by Albert Einstein.|$|E
25|$|He made {{it clear}} that he also {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>against</b> the suppression of the American Communist Party, and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform World War II into a world revolution.

When the committee learned the nature of the testimony Trotsky intended to present, it refused to hear him, and he was denied a visa to enter the United States. On hearing about it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately accused Trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1908, Sir George Greenwood {{engaged in}} a series of well-publicised debates with Shakespearean biographer Sir Sidney Lee and author J. M. Robertson. Throughout his {{numerous}} books on the authorship question, Greenwood limited himself <b>to</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>against</b> the traditional attribution, without supporting any [...] alternative candidate. Mark Twain, commenting in 1908 on the lack of a literary paper trail linking Shakespeare of Stratford to the works, said, [...] "Many poets die poor, but this is the only one in history that has died THIS poor; the others all left literary remains behind. Also a book. Maybe two." [...] Twain strongly suspected, as a 'Brontosaurian', that Bacon wrote the works. H. L. Mencken wrote a withering review of the work, concluding that it makes sorry reading for those who revered Twain.|$|R
