There {{is no evidence that}} Aldisio and Vizzini ever met to discuss the issue. Aldiso did, however, invite , a fellow Christian Democrat and Mafia member befriended by Vizzini, to secret gatherings with Christian Democrats. The meetings were seen as a first step in a government alliance with the Mafia. Aldisio’s appointment was perceived by Mafia chieftains as a first indication of the government’s determination to subdue the separatist movement. They were now forced to reconsider their support.|$|E

Parish and town councils in England have no direct <b>power</b> <b>to</b> designate nature reserves, {{but they can}} have <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so delegated <b>to</b> them by their principal local authority using section 101 of the Local Government Act 1972.|$|R

25|$|In colonial times, the {{government}} attempted {{to control the}} outbreak of wildfires by legislating against the careless use of fire. This began with the 1847 ordinance against reckless burn-offs of stubble and grass. The challenge of fire suppression was left to local residents who would band together to fight fires without any formal organisation or authority. In 1913, district councils were given the right to appoint fire control officers given <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything 'necessary or expedient and practicable' to prevent fires or to protect life and property.|$|E

25|$|Presidential {{candidates}} and parliamentary candidates {{must be approved}} by the Guardian Council (all members of which are directly or indirectly elected by the Leader) or the Leader before running, in order to ensure their allegiance to the Supreme Leader. The Leader very rarely does the vetting himself directly, but has <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, in which case additional approval of the Guardian Council would not be needed. The Leader can also revert the decisions of the Guardian Council. The Guardian Council can, and has dismissed some elected members of the Iranian parliament in the past. For example, Minoo Khaleghi was disqualified by Guardian Council even after winning election, as she had been photographed in a meeting without wearing headscarf.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{petitions}} by {{the company}} or creditors, an administrator {{has the power to}} move a company into liquidation, carrying out an asset sale, if its attempts at rescue come to an end. If the liquidator is not an administrator, he is appointed by the court usually on the nomination of the majority of creditors. The liquidator can be removed by the same groups. Once in place, the liquidator has <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything set out in sections 160, 165 and Schedule 4 for the purpose of its main duty. This includes bringing legal claims that belonged to the company. This is to realise the value of the company, and distribute the assets. Assets must always be distributed in the order of statutory priority: releasing the claims of fixed security interest holders, paying preferential creditors (the liquidator's expenses, employees and pensions, and the ring fenced fund for unsecured creditors), the floating charge holder, unsecured creditors, deferred debts, and finally shareholders. In the performance of these basic tasks, the liquidator owes its duties to the company, not individual creditors or shareholders. They can be liable for breach of duty by exercising powers for improper purposes (e.g. not distributing money to creditors in the right order,) and may be sued additionally for negligence. As a person in a fiduciary position, he may have no conflict of interest or make secret profits. Nevertheless, liquidators (like administrators and some receivers) can generally be said to have a broad degree of discretion about the conduct of liquidation. They must realise assets to distribute to creditors, and they may attempt to maximise these by bringing new litigation, either to avoid transactions entered into by the insolvent company, or by suing the former directors.|$|E

500|$|Some texts {{state that}} Kalmashapada's birth name was Mitrasaha, {{but he was}} known by his patronymic Saudasa.

The king restrains (saha) himself from retaliation against his friend (mitra) Vashishtha's curse, though he possesses <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.

500|$|The {{technology}} that became available to Rockstar inspired them to begin development. The potential {{power of the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 experienced through the development kits motivated the team to create a game that could fully render the countryside, which was difficult to achieve on previous hardware. Houser felt that primitive technology prevented game developers from creating a game that [...] "really did justice" [...] to the Wild West. As an example, {{he referred to the}} animation of a lasso. [...] "t seems easy but we've only now got <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that kind of stuff," [...] he said. Houser felt that previous Western games represented one specific aspect of the period, while Redemption attempts to represent all features. In developing the objects and surfaces of the game's world, the team utilized a variety of textures and lighting effects. They also found difficulty in creating a realistic representation of nature; [...] " [...] don't draw curves, but nature is all about curves", Houser explained.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the federation in 1964, Southern Rhodesia then started calling itself Rhodesia and adopted a new flag {{at the behest of the}} Prime Minister of Rhodesia as a protest against the federation and the British government. The new flag used the same details as the previous one, but instead used a sky-blue background rather than the traditional dark blue. The new flag used the same colour as the Royal Air Force Ensign because the government wanted to make the Rhodesian flag more recognisable and it was chosen as a way to protest against the British government's treatment of Southern Rhodesia during their time as part of the Federation. After the breakup of the federation, black Rhodesians viewed the new flag as a symbol of white supremacy as it was created by Prime Minister Ian Smith's minority government and the British government did not veto the change despite having <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965, Rhodesia continued to use the flag of Southern Rhodesia as a symbol of loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II, despite the British government not recognising UDI. Smith said: [...] "Let there be no doubt that we in this country stand second to none in our loyalty to the Queen, and whatever else other countries may have done or may yet do, it is our intention that the Union Jack will continue to fly in Rhodesia and the national anthem continue to be sung." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story.
