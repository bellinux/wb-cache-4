5|$|Against this {{economic}} backdrop {{a new generation}} of venture capitalist owners had emerged. They took the place of the community groups, local consortiums, or philanthropists that typically had owned the teams and operated <b>them</b> <b>without</b> any serious profit motive. They were led by McNall in Toronto, Larry Ryckman in Calgary, and Glieberman in Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, is an {{efficient}} method for computing the {{greatest common divisor}} (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of <b>them</b> <b>without</b> leaving a remainder.

5|$|Some of his chansons were doubtless {{designed}} to be performed instrumentally. That Petrucci published many of <b>them</b> <b>without</b> text is strong evidence of this; additionally, some of the pieces (for example, the fanfare-like Vive le roy) contain writing more idiomatic for instruments than voices.|$|E

5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were within range of escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy casualties attempting to attack factories further north in daylight. Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy <b>them</b> <b>without</b> sustaining heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tampere and the German army invasion, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Viipuri on 8 April. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April 1918 (Edvard Gylling alone stood by his warriors). The escape of the Red {{leadership}} imbittered the Red troopers. Thousands of <b>them,</b> <b>without</b> true leadership, tried {{to flee to}} Russia, but most the refugees were besieged by the White and the German troops.

5|$|Finding himself totally {{alone in}} a {{shattered}} world with food to last him a lifetime but no one to share it with, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance.

5|$|However, {{the premium}} tax credits are {{mandatory}} spending, meaning all those eligible under the ACA receive <b>them</b> <b>without</b> Congressional appropriation. These adjust with premium increases to limit after-subsidy premium payments by ACA enrollees to a fixed percentage of income. Based on President Trump's threats {{to end the}} CSR payments during early 2017, several insurers and actuarial groups estimated {{this resulted in a}} 20 percentage point or more increase in premiums for the 2018 plan year. In other words, premium increases expected to be 10% or less in 2018 became 28-40% instead.|$|E
5|$|On {{the issue}} of slavery, Smith took {{different}} positions. Initially he opposed it, but during the mid-1830s when the Mormons were settling in Missouri (a slave state), Smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly anti-abolitionist essay. Then in the early 1840s, after Mormons had been expelled from Missouri, he once again opposed slavery. During his presidential campaign of 1844, he proposed ending slavery by 1850 and compensating slaveholders for their loss. Smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites, and he welcomed slaves into the church. However, he opposed baptizing <b>them</b> <b>without</b> permission of their masters, and he opposed interracial marriage.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} concerns facing the government in exile in 1940 was the situation of Belgian refugees in the United Kingdom.

The refugees had originally been dealt with by the British government, however in September 1940, the government established a Central Service of Refugees to provide material assistance and employment for Belgians in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Simple {{versions}} are prepared by slicing vegetables and drying <b>them,</b> <b>without</b> any cooking involved. Sometimes a mandoline {{is used to}} slice vegetables for vegetable chips, which can accommodate thin slicing and enhance size consistency. Vegetable chips may be flavored with spices such as salt, sea salt, pepper, cajun spice, curry, allspice, chipotle powder, sweet or smoked paprika, adobo seasoning, dried chives and many others. Mass-produced varieties may contain food preservatives or monosodium glutamate. Vegetable chips can be homemade using various recipes and preparation processes.|$|E
5|$|This planned {{attack against}} Hill 518 {{coincided with the}} {{defection}} of Major Kim Song Jun of the NK 19th Regiment, NK 13th Division.

The NK 13th Division, he said, had just taken in 4,000 replacements, 2,000 of <b>them</b> <b>without</b> weapons, and was now back to a strength of approximately 9,000 men.

5|$|When cricket resumed {{after the}} war, few bowlers {{maintained}} the tactic, which was unpopular with spectators owing to its negativity.
