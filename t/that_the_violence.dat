5|$|A {{number of}} {{children}} were killed, injured or orphaned by the violence. Organisations such as Citizens' Initiative reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> resulted in the disturbance of children's studies {{and that there was}} a lack of counselling. Students at Gujarat University were unable to take examinations, which were cancelled due to the chances of disruption. While other schools in the state had to postpone or cancel exams, it was reported that some schools held examinations under police protection. It was also reported that many students were forced to leave their studies due to lack of funds or to earn a livelihood because they had lost income-earning members of their families.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{government}} {{agreed to}} pay compensation for the damaged property {{but not for the}} actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a personal view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to cultural assimilation, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated indemnity. At Bayard's urging, the U.S. Congress provided US$147,748.74 as an indemnity. The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree of responsibility for the massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{views of}} the {{phenomenon}} have emerged. Members generally believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> channeling was legitimate at first, pointing to the endorsement by Sun Myung Moon. Some critics do not believe there ever was genuine channeling. [...] Church members do not believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> worst <b>violence</b> was committed by the spirit of Heung Jin Moon: To me, the evidence clearly supports <b>the</b> view <b>that</b> Mr. Sudo currently teaches at Chung Pyung, namely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> serious <b>violence</b> was NOT done by Heung Jin.|$|R
50|$|The modern view {{in industrialized}} {{countries}} is that domestic violence {{should be viewed}} as a public matter and all criminal authority should be involved; <b>that</b> once <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> is reported it should be taken seriously.|$|R
25|$|Some {{critics have}} stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> and shock of this home movie {{led to a}} new way of {{representing}} violence in 1970s American cinema, both in mainstream films, and particularly in indie and underground horror movies.|$|E
25|$|The {{massacre}} at Talheim supports this idea by giving evidence of habitual warfare between Linearbandkeramik settlements. It {{is most likely}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> occurred amongst LBK populations since the head wounds indicate the use of weapons from LBK cultures and all skeletons found resemble those of LBK settlers.|$|E
25|$|On 14 March 2016, the United States House of Representatives voted {{unanimously}} 393-0 that violent actions performed against Yazidis, Christians, Shia {{and other groups}} by ISIL were acts of genocide.

25|$|On July 18, {{a federal}} judge {{significantly}} restricted union picketing at Remington Rand's plants in New York. The union was limited to only four picketing workers at a time, and all picketers had to wear large badges identifying themselves as union members. Federal officials later determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> which led the court to impose the injunction had been instigated by Remington Rand.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, government, academics and the media began to revise the country's militant past, and particularly the Easter Rising. The coalition government of 1973–77, in particular the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Conor Cruise O'Brien, began to promote the view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of 1916 was essentially no different from the violence then taking place in the streets of Belfast and Derry.|$|E
25|$|On November 21 , state policemen killed six pickets {{and injured}} dozens more... Despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> was {{the fault of}} the state police, Governor Adams used the {{so-called}} Columbine Massacre as an excuse to call out the National Guard to restore order throughout the state. With soldiers on guard at mine gates, mass picketing ceased and more and more miners returned to their jobs. The strike continued, but it lost considerable momentum.|$|E

25|$|During the riots, Chinese {{authorities}} prohibited {{foreign and}} Hong Kong media {{from entering the}} region. Domestic media initially downplayed the riots, but this changed relatively quickly. Only James Miles, a correspondent from The Economist, gained approval for a week-long trip which happened {{to coincide with the}} increase in tensions. According to Miles, the riot police response was tame. Western media speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> might affect attendance at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but by and large it did not.|$|E
25|$|There {{were reports}} of {{isolated}} cases of violence, including two accidental killings by security forces, {{but there was}} no evidence to suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> was intended to prevent, or that it prevented, citizens from voting. However, there were also reports of interference with voting rights. For example, some members of the security forces in the provinces of Katanga and North Kivu allegedly confiscated electoral cards and demanded cash for their return before the July 30 elections.|$|E
25|$|He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> {{was due to}} {{the hostile}} {{attitude}} of whites, who had ravaged Paiute women and killed their men without cause. He disclaimed responsibility for the Williams Station incident, which he blamed on a group of Bannocks over whom he had no authority. However, he said that if the whites had come to him afterwards to discuss the problem, as had been agreed by treaty, {{there would have been no}} need for fighting.|$|E

25|$|By 13 August, {{media reports}} {{indicated}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> {{had begun to}} wane, seemingly due to exhaustion {{on the part of}} the IRA and security forces. On 15 August, the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) announced that it was starting a campaign of civil disobedience in response to the introduction of internment. By 17 October, it was estimated that about 16,000 households were withholding rent and rates for council houses as part of the campaign of civil disobedience.|$|E
25|$|In late 2004, the People's Education Publishing House (人民教育出版社) of the People's Republic of China sparked off {{controversy}} {{by including}} {{an excerpt from}} Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils in a new senior high school Chinese textbook. While some praised the inclusion of popular literature, others feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> and unrealistic martial arts described in Cha's works were unsuitable for high school students. At about the same time, Singapore's Ministry of Education announced a similar move for Chinese-learning students at secondary and junior college levels.|$|E
25|$|In {{his public}} {{statements}} during the riots, {{civil rights activist}} and Baptist minister Jesse Jackson sympathized with the anger experienced by African-Americans regarding the verdicts in the King trial, and pointed to certain root causes of the disturbances. Although he suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> was not justified, he repeatedly emphasized that the riots were an inevitable result of the continuing patterns of racism, police brutality and economic despair suffered by inner-city residents—a tinderbox of seething frustrations which was eventually set off by the verdicts.|$|E

25|$|The {{security}} policy of Peña Nieto has prioritized {{the reduction of}} violence rather than attacking Mexico's drug-trafficking organizations head-on, marking {{a departure from the}} strategy of the previous six years during Felipe Calderón's administration. One of the biggest contrasts is the focus on lowering murder rates, kidnappings, and extortions, as opposed to arresting or killing the country's most-wanted drug lords and intercepting their drug shipments. The government of Calderón justified its position by stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> in the country was a necessary stage in Mexico's drug war, as weakening criminal groups fought for territorial control against one another and the government.|$|E
25|$|Estonia's {{authorities}} report <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> started around 9:20 p.m. (EEST, UTC+3), as {{the protesters}} started to assault the policemen. Riot police responded by using water cannon and, according to BBC, firing tear gas to disperse the crowd. However, the crowd did not disperse and started committing acts of vandalism and rampant looting of nearby shops and buildings. By midnight the riots had {{spread around the}} centre of Tallinn, with massive damage to property—a total number of 99 cases of vandalism, including cars that had been turned upside down, broken and looted shop windows, pillaged bars and kiosks.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} this {{violence}} against Muslims are varied. The roots {{are thought to}} lie in India's history– resentment toward the Islamic domination of India during the Middle Ages, policies established by the country's British colonizers, and the violent partition of India into a Muslim-majority Pakistan and a secular India with a Muslim minority. Many scholars believe that incidents of anti-Muslim violence are politically motivated {{and a part of}} the electoral strategy of mainstream political parties who are associated with Hindu nationalism like the Bharatiya Janata Party. Other scholars believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> is not widespread but that it is restricted to certain urban areas because of local socio-political conditions.|$|E
