5000|$|Spiced {{wine was}} {{popular in the}} Roman Empire, {{as seen in the}} {{writings}} of Pliny the Elder and Apicius. In the 12th century, a spiced wine named [...] "pimen" [...] or [...] "piment" [...] was mentioned by Chrétien de Troyes. During the 13th century, the city of Montpellier had a reputation for trading spiced wines with England. <b>The</b> first <b>recipes</b> <b>for</b> spiced wine appeared at the end of <b>the</b> 13th century (<b>recipes</b> <b>for</b> claret and piment found in the Tractatus de Modo) or at the beginning of <b>the</b> 14th century (<b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> piment in <b>the</b> Regiment de Sanitat of Arnaldus de Villa Nova).

The secret that it was made from urine leaked out and first Johann Kunckel (1630–1703) in Sweden (1678) and later Boyle in London (1680) also managed to make phosphorus, possibly with the aid of his assistant, Ambrose Godfrey-Hanckwitz, who later made a business of the manufacture of phosphorus.|$|E

The conspiracy was revealed by PepsiCo, which notified the authorities when they were approached by the conspirators.|$|E

So, in 1906, Will started his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, which eventually became the Kellogg Company, triggering a decades-long feud.

25|$|The fly {{pattern is}} <b>the</b> <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> any {{particularly}} named fly. In older literature, especially {{prior to the}} 20th century, fly patterns were referred to as dressings. The pattern specifies the size range and type of hook to be used, materials including type, color and size, {{and in some cases}} specific instructions to achieve a particular effect or configuration. Fly patterns allow tyers to consistently reproduce any given fly over time. A Light Cahill dry fly produced by one tyer will look remarkably similar to the same fly produced by a completely different tyer if the pattern is followed with reasonable accuracy and with comparable materials. Patterns may also lay out alternatives for different materials and variations.|$|E

25|$|Lisch's {{production}} {{dropped off}} as the 2016–17 season came to a close, with the Kings management putting {{it down to a}} mixture of niggling injuries, his workload, and the fact that he'd just come off an Olympic campaign with the Australian Boomers in August 2016. Aimed at resolving a nagging injury that curtailed his performance in 2016–17, Lisch underwent minor knee surgery during the off-season, with a healthy Kevin Lisch being <b>the</b> <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> Sydney Kings success in 2017–18 according to Kings Managing Director Jeff Van Groningen. The Kings front office remained confident during the 2017 off-season that Lisch was the man for the job, despite calls for the Kings to go after the likes of Jerome Randle or Casper Ware. After an off-season of rest and a training schedule refinement, Lisch entered the 2017–18 season ready to redeem himself.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} {{differences between the}} original manuscripts and Mathers' edition. First, {{one of the four}} books was missing entirely from the French manuscript with which he worked. Second, Mathers gave the duration of the operation as six months, whereas all other sources specify eighteen months. Third, possibly due to a mistranslation, Mathers changed one of the ingredients within <b>the</b> <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> Abramelin oil, specifying galangal instead of the original herb calamus. The oil in the German manuscript sources also contains cassia and is nearly identical to the biblical recipe for Holy anointing oil. The differences between the recipes cause several notable changes in the oil's characteristics, including edibility, fragrance, dermal sensation, and spiritual symbolism. Fourth, there are 242 word squares in Mathers' translation, while the original German has 251. Most of the squares in Mathers are not completely filled in, and those that are differ markedly from the German sources.|$|E
