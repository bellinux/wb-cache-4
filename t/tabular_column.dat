40|$|Abstract- The Z-Source {{concept has}} many {{advantages}} {{and can be}} applied for any type of power conversion. Both boosting and modulation index can be controlled in inverter operation itself, by inserting proper shoot through states. This paper presents procedure for implementing, space vector modulated REC Z-source inverter in MATLAB SIMULINK by inserting shoot through states. It also explains a clear procedure of selection of shoot through states at required time and presents an overall <b>tabular</b> <b>column</b> of the sequence of switching states for three level space vector modulation. The proposed techniques are demonstrated in MATLAB and have achieved good performance results. Index Terms- MATLAB SIMULINK, REC Z-Source inverter, Space vector modulation (SVM...|$|E

In this paper we present the usage of a recently proposed array logic based technique for designing the autopilot mode transition logic for a commercial aircraft in the lateral direction. This designing technique helps to reduce the design effort in the development of an autopilot. Ease to understand and very concise way to specify a large number of transitions in simple <b>tabular</b> <b>column</b> is one the highlight of this method. This paper provides some observations about lateral modes and logic concerning lateral mode transition in a less complex way compared to the prevailing methods for autopilot design. Here various mode possibilities of lateral mode transition in an autopilot is mentioned along with specification criteria’s that bound these transition and these possible transitions were given a frame work using MATLAB software...|$|E

In other words, family life and social life should not be strained by working hours including over time, work during inconvenient hours, business travel, transfers, vacations etc. This report is formulated after through research {{and is based on}} the information given by the company personal and through questionnaire filled by the employees. The opinions of the employees are qualitative in nature. Descriptive research was used for the study. Primary data and secondary data were used for the study. Primary data was collected through questionnaire. Secondary data was collected to know the number and other details of employees working in the organization. The sample size consist of 50 respondents. The statistical tools used are percentage analysis, chi-square analysis and correlation to formulate the <b>tabular</b> <b>columns.</b> From the observation findings of the study, suggestions and recommendations have been submitted to the management and is hoped that the management will look into these recommendations and try to implement them in future. In due course of our project we have visited the company and interacted with the people concerned. Here I also got the opportunity to learn about work-life balance policies provided to the employees by an organization...|$|R

The GC fitted with PONA 50  m glass open <b>tabular</b> capillary <b>column.</b> The column temperature was programmed as an initial temperature of 30  °C for 15  min, then 60  °C for 20  min (heating rate 1  °C/min) and finally 200  °C for 20  min (heating rate 2  °C/min). The injector temperature was 250  °C. Flow rate of He (13  kPa, 155  ml/min) was applied: Ion source temperature 200  °C, interface temperature 250  °C and detector voltage 0.7  kV.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Forecasting is a {{necessity}} of human life and a common problem in all branches of learning. Financial and economic problems are domains in which forecasting is of major importance. The basic goal of market participants is {{to predict the future}} trends of stock price and determine the best time to execute transactions in order to optimize investment decisions. This paper proposes a model to forecast the daily financial stock price of a company taking into account the leading indicator such as closing stock price. In this project the stock price of Intel along with its customer’s and competitor’s for the year 2000 is considered, and the increase, decrease or no-change pattern is examined. The Binomial upper tailed test is applied at a significance level of 0. 01 and the results are analyzed. The true and predicted performance of Intel is examined at different threshold levels for the year 2000 and is optimized to forecast the daily stock price for the year 2001. The rate of sensitivity examined for the year 2001 at the optimum threshold levels tends to be too low to be useful. So there is no discernable statistical significance between the closing stock price of the leading indicator and Intel’s stock price on the next day. These results are delivered in the form of <b>tabular</b> <b>columns</b> as well as time series graphs...|$|R

For example, if an identifier {{with a long}} name {{is added}} to a <b>tabular</b> layout, the <b>column</b> width {{may have to be}} increased to accommodate it. This forces a bigger change to the source code than necessary, and the essential change may be lost in the noise. This is detrimental to Revision control where inspecting differences between versions is essential.|$|R
40|$|Improvements of {{entity-relationship}} (E-R) search {{techniques have}} been hampered {{by a lack}} of test collections, particularly for complex queries involving multiple entities and relationships. In this paper we describe a method for generating E-R test queries to support comprehensive E-R search experiments. Queries and relevance judgments are created from content that exists in a <b>tabular</b> form where <b>columns</b> represent entity types and the table structure implies one or more relationships among the entities. Editorial work involves creating natural language queries based on relationships represented by the entries in the table. We have publicly released the RELink test collection comprising 600 queries and relevance judgments obtained from a sample of Wikipedia List-of-lists-of-lists tables. The latter comprise tuples of entities that are extracted from columns and labelled by corresponding entity types and relationships they represent. In order to facilitate research in complex E-R retrieval, we have created and released as open source the RELink Framework that includes Apache Lucene indexing and search specifically tailored to E-R retrieval. RELink includes entity and relationship indexing based on the ClueWeb- 09 -B Web collection with FACC 1 text span annotations linked to Wikipedia entities. With ready to use search resources and a comprehensive test collection, we support community in pursuing E-R research at scale. Comment: SIGIR 17 (resource...|$|R
40|$|The SDDS-compliant EPICS toolkit {{is a set}} of {{software}} applications for the collection or writing of data in Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) database records. Though most of the applications essentially do rather simple operations, the combination of these and others from the SDDS postprocessing toolkit allow arbitrarily complicated analysis of data and control of the accelerators at the Advanced Photon Source. These tools are general and can be applied to devices other than accelerators under control of EPICS. The EPICS tools presented here read and store data to SDDS-protocol files. SDDS (Self-Describing Data Set) [1] refers to a particular implementation of a self-describing file protocol used at APS. Self-describing means that the data is refered to and accessed by name. Thus, a user doesn’t need to know, say, in which column a piece of tabular data is located. An ASCII header contains information about the file’s data structure, i. e. definitions of structure elements such as <b>columns</b> (<b>tabular</b> data) and parameters (single values). Initially adopted for complex physics simulation programs, {{it was clear that the}} SDDS file protocol would excel in data-collecting software as well. Typically, an EPICS tool would write EPICS data to an SDDS file with each readback written to a column of name corresponding to the EPICS database record name. Single value data that describe the experimental conditions might be written to the file as parameters. Once collected, the EPICS data can be further analyzed and plotted with any of the SDDS tools described in [1]. One can regard the EPICS tools as the layer between the EPICS control system and more functional analyzing tools and scripts, with SDDS protocol files as an intermediary. Following conventional usage, EPICS database records will be refered to as “process variables” or PVs in this manual...|$|R
