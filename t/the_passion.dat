40|$|The {{conversation}} {{surrounding the}} importance, significance, {{and use of}} <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> reached a kind of fevered pitch in the eighteenth century, the supposed Age of Reason. By the early eighteenth century, <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> were generally understood as something to be governed by reason. Another philosophy of thought on controlling <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> existed: ordering <b>the</b> emotions through emotional organization rather than “reasonable” control. The work of Eliza Haywood—a prolific eighteenth-century author, actress, playwright, translator, and publisher—is a particularly fertile place to examine feeling in fictional form. Haywood provides a different framework for understanding <b>the</b> passions—that <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> themselves, rather than reason, bring order to <b>the</b> <b>passions.</b> This understanding of <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> places reason and feeling in slightly different terms, terms that are far less hierarchical than has been assumed. This chapter argues that Eliza Haywood’s discussions of emotion in her fiction theorizes a particular mode of ordering <b>the</b> <b>passions,</b> not through reason, but through emotion, a dialogue that is in conversation with the sustained emotional discourse of how to shape emotion in the eighteenth century.

DePreist conducted the National Symphony Orchestra's first {{performance of the}} work at the Kennedy Center on February 19, 1974. Music critics drew comparisons to Johann Sebastian Bach's Passions, which recounts Jesus' death. The Oregon Symphony album was the first published recording of the work. Bazemore provided bass vocals, with additional vocals by the Portland Symphonic Choir, directed by Bruce Browne. The nine sections of the work are performed with a brief pause in between.|$|E
50|$|Seneca's {{thoughts}} {{of the relationship of}} <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> to reason, are that <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> arise in a rational mind {{as a result of a}} mis-perceiving or misunderstanding of reality.

5000|$|The {{subject of}} <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> {{has long been}} a {{consideration}} in Western philosophy.

5|$|Gibson directed, co-wrote and {{produced}} <b>The</b> <b>Passion</b> of the Christ in 2004, a Biblical epic drama which chronicled <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> of Jesus. On its release, the film garnered mixed reviews {{as well as}} notoriety for its graphic violence and alleged undertones of antisemitism from critics. Nevertheless, it grossed $370.3 million in the United States and $611.4 million worldwide, making it Gibson's highest-grossing film to date. Two years later he directed, co-wrote {{and produced}} Apocalypto, an epic adventure set in Central America depicting {{the last days of}} Mayan civilization before Spanish arrival in the 16th century. Gibson then took a ten-year hiatus from directing during which time he landed roles in Edge of Darkness (2010), Machete Kills (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Blood Father (2016). He directed Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, a biographical war drama focusing on American World War II veteran Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor. The film garnered praise from critics and audiences alike, as well as various accolades.|$|E

40|$|During the Middle Ages, Europe {{experienced}} {{a period when}} philosophers attempted to separate and analyze the passionate and rational elements of the soul.

Geoffrey Chaucer’s “The Knight’s Tale” portrays this conflict between reason and <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> through <b>the</b> depicted relationship between Mars and Venus and <b>the</b> uncontrolled <b>passions</b> of Arcite and Palamon. Determining that a world controlled by passions results in chaos, Chaucer offers three different solutions—negating <b>the</b> <b>passions,</b> subjugating <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> to reason, and a balance between passion and reason. He ultimately determines that only the third option will result in true order within nature and the human soul...|$|R

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to understand how}} Thomas Wright’s 1604 work, <b>The</b> <b>Passions</b> of <b>the</b> Minde in Generall, might have fitted into his overall mission as an English Catholic preacher, particularly when read via Wright’s understanding of Thomas Aquinas’s passion of fuga seu abominatio. Some historians claim that Wright was a controversialist, previously describing <b>The</b> <b>Passions</b> as either {{a radical departure from}} Wright’s mission, or the work of a different Thomas Wright. Earlier {{attempts to}} find a missionary element within <b>The</b> <b>Passions</b> have been inadequate. Through a close reading of <b>The</b> <b>Passions,</b> specifically analysing Wright'ʹs interpretation of fuga seu abominatio within the context of Wright’s intended readership, the main message of <b>The</b> <b>Passions,</b> and his background, this article suggests a possible reading of the text as a work aimed specifically at fellow English Catholics. To Wright, <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> of hatred of abomination and flight or detestation, derived primarily from Aquinas’s fuga seu abominatio, were not simply a form of disgust, as often assumed, but the potential worldly or otherworldly harm that someone we love, such as a neighbour, might face from the abominable evil of sin and damnation. By linking hatred of abomination, flight or detestation, and Wright’s particular view of sin together, Wright was teaching English Catholics how these passions might be used to cure diseased souls, turning the work into a guide for preaching...|$|R
