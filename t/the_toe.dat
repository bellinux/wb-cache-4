5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus {{walked with}} an erect posture, {{although}} the limbs were not located {{directly under the}} trunk. The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. <b>The</b> <b>toe</b> bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved and the only well known bone is a fifth metatarsal (bone in hindlimbs attached to <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E

50|$|Sensation to {{the skin}} of <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> is {{provided}} by five nerves. The superficial fibular nerve supplies sensation {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>toes,</b> except between <b>the</b> hallux and second toe, which is supplied by the deep fibular nerve, and the outer surface of <b>the</b> fifth <b>toe,</b> supplied by <b>the</b> sural nerve. Sensation to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> is supplied by the medial plantar nerve, which supplies sensation to <b>the</b> great <b>toe</b> and inner three-and-a-half <b>toes,</b> and <b>the</b> lateral plantar nerve, which supplies sensation to <b>the</b> little <b>toe</b> and half of the sensation of <b>the</b> fourth <b>toe.</b>|$|R

5|$|Hester {{missed a}} {{majority}} of the 2015 NFL season due to a turf toe injury. The Falcons activated him from the injury reserve for the final five games of the season, but only used Hester on special teams. He tallied 235 yards kick return yards and 34 punt return yards, but failed to record a touchdown. Hester underwent foot surgery in January 2016 to repair <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> injury he sustained earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|E
50|$|Medieval {{boots were}} built {{according}} to {{a wide array of}} architectures. One commonly encountered boot consisted fundamentally of a pair of upright parallel boards that splinted <b>the</b> <b>toes.</b> Turning <b>the</b> screw squeezes <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> between <b>the</b> boards, inflicting untold lateral pressure on the metatarsal heads and causing agony. This is the type of boot commonly associated with the torture of Esmeralda in Victor Hugo's Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The cruelty of the torture could be increased by spacing <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> apart with stiff wooden pegs. Various extensions of the instrument were designed to crush the ankle, calf, or knee in addition to its primary target, <b>the</b> instep. <b>The</b> <b>toes</b> often protruded {{from the front of the}} boot, facilitating the infliction of additional tortures, such as forcibly tearing the nails from <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> with red-hot iron pincers.|$|R

50|$|The {{metatarsal}} bones behind <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> vary {{in relative}} length. For most feet, a smooth curve {{can be traced}} through the joints at the bases of <b>the</b> <b>toes.</b> But in Morton's foot, the line has to bend more sharply {{to go through the}} base of <b>the</b> big <b>toe,</b> as shown in the diagram.|$|R
5|$|The VT heralded the fitment of {{semi-trailing}} arm independent {{rear suspension}} as standard across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, in terms of suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> of the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E
5|$|The new 3rd Army Ranger Infantry Company was {{formulated}} {{based on}} the Table of Organization and Equipment documents of Ranger units in World War II, all {{of which had been}} deactivated. The 3rd Ranger Infantry Company was organized into three platoons. A headquarters element of five men oversaw the platoons. However, due to lack of battalion support for clerical, transportation, supply and mess kitchen support, 3rd company had to acquire the personnel, vehicles, and other equipment needed to support their operations. This resulted in the involvement of considerably more highly trained personnel than the five called for by <b>the</b> <b>TOE.</b> Each platoon had three squads of ten men each, with a platoon sergeant and assistant platoon sergeant (a.k.a. platoon guide). Each squad had two fireteams of five men each and one man in each fireteam carried a M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. The BAR was the largest weapon in the platoon. The 60mm M2 mortars, the 57mm recoilless rifles, and the M20 Super Bazookas were carried on the company M35 2½ ton cargo truck but seldom used. The company was authorized two vehicles; an M38 Jeep and an M35 2½ ton cargo truck. The company was more heavily armed than the Eighth Army Ranger Company but less in strength and fire power than standard infantry companies. Like the other numbered Ranger companies, its organization called for five officers and 107 enlisted men in three platoons.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{exception}} of <b>the</b> hallux, <b>toe</b> movement is generally governed by action of the flexor digitorum brevis and extensor digitorum brevis muscles.

50|$|Rossolimo's sign is a {{clinical}} sign in which percussion of {{the tips of}} <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> causes an exaggerated flexion of <b>the</b> <b>toes.</b> It is found in patients with pyramidal tract lesions, {{and is one of}} a number of Babinski-like responses.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to his military work, Lord Kitchener contributed to efforts on the home front. The knitted sock patterns of the day used a seam up <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> that could rub uncomfortably against the toes. Kitchener encouraged British and American women to knit for the war effort, and contributed a sock pattern featuring a new technique for a seamless join of <b>the</b> <b>toe,</b> still known as the Kitchener stitch.|$|E

The patient's doctor may also prescribe some toe exercises that can be done at home to stretch and strengthen the muscles. For example, the individual can gently stretch <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> manually, or use <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> to pick things up off the floor. While watching television or reading, one can put a towel flat under the feet and use <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> to crumple it.
