5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E
5|$|Move is {{the tenth}} studio album by Christian rock band Third Day. Released on October 19, 2010, {{the album was}} the band's first after guitarist Brad Avery left Third Day. The band wanted the album to be a {{departure}} from the modern rock stylings of Revelation (2008), intending <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> of their southern rock roots. Third Day chose to work with producer Paul Moak on the album and recorded it at their own studio, feeling it offered them more creative freedom. Primarily a southern rock album, Move also has significant influence from gospel music.|$|E
5|$|Johansen rapidly climbed {{prospect}} charts for the 2010 NHL Draft, {{starting the}} year as a potential second round selection, before rising to 16th among North American skaters when the NHL Central Scouting Bureau (CSB) released its mid-season ranking. Johansen's coach with Penticton noted that, {{as one of the}} younger players of his draft class, his skill was often overlooked. NHL scouts praised his speed, playmaking ability and vision on the ice but believed he needed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> consistency and physicality. He had been compared to Ottawa Senators centre Jason Spezza, while Johansen had said he tried to model his game after San Jose Sharks centre Joe Thornton. He finished the season as the tenth ranked skater according to Central Scouting and was projected to be a top 20 pick, perhaps as high as top 10. With the fourth overall pick in the 2010 NHL Draft, Johansen was chosen by the Columbus Blue Jackets.|$|E

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} having secret {{meetings}} in the parking lot, where Dwight provides information about Dunder Mifflin so Michael can undercut the company. However, Dwight's loyalty is {{put to the test}} as Charles Miner (Idris Elba) seems <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> respect for Dwight than Michael ever did. Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.|$|E
5|$|The Brooklyn native {{began the}} busier fighter, using the jab {{and trying to}} land uppercuts {{for the first two}} rounds, while Matthysse worked on the body. In round three, a clash of heads opened a cut outside of the left eye of Judah. Matthysse {{displayed}} more aggression and became the aggressor in the third and the fourth round and Judah switched to a defensive tactic. In the next two rounds, the American boxer picked up the pace, beginning to land more combinations. The seventh round was less active but in the eight, Judah landed some hard right counter shots. Judah continued to box throughout the ninth round but Matthysse began <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> power in the tenth, focusing on the head of his opponent and knocking down the American boxer after a hard right hand to the jaw. Judah got up but he was hurt, and the Argentine fighter tried to press the attack after the knockdown. However, Judah held and worked on the defensive and managed to finish the bout. Two judges scored the fight 114–113 for Judah, while the other judge scored it 114–113 for Matthysse.|$|E

It is estimated that 43–78% of the variance in age to ESRD could be due to heritable modifying factors, with parents as likely as children <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> severe disease in studies of parent-child pairs.|$|E

25|$|Around 14,000 years ago, the Villabruna Cluster shifted {{away from}} GoyetQ116-1 {{affinity}} and started <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> affinity with the Near East, a shift which coincided with the warming temperatures of the Bølling-Allerød interstadial. This genetic shift shows that Near East populations had probably already begun moving into Europe during {{the end of the}} Upper Paleolithic, about 6,000 years earlier than previously thought, before the introduction of farming. A few specimens from the Villabruna Cluster also show genetic affinities for East Asians that are derived from gene flow.|$|E

Randi went on to have given scientific explanations for all the activities observed. Randi revealed the natural explanations for activities ranging from putting forceps in the nose, random cutting of the flesh, 'scraping' of the eyeball, the subsequent absence of infection, and other activities one by one as age old parlor tricks. However, he was dismayed that none of his critical comments were shown in the final segment. This was cut down to under 20 seconds of screen time.|$|E
25|$|The {{revival of}} natural dyeing {{has had a}} major impact on Qashqai rug production. Initiated in Shiraz during the 1990s by master dyers as Abbas Sayahi, {{particularly}} Gabbeh rugs raised much interest when they were first presented at the Great Persian Exhibition in 1992. Initially woven for home use and local trade, coarsely knotted with symmetric knots, the colours initially seen were mostly natural shades of wool. With the revival of natural colours, Gabbeh from Fars province soon were produced in a full range of colours. They met the Western demand for primitive, naïve folk art as opposed to elaborate commercialized designs, and gained high popularity. In the commercial production of today, the Gabbeh rug patterns remain simple, but tend <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> modern types of design.|$|E

However, Davina was a critical and ratings disaster, which Fincham subsequently admitted was personally his fault, although he defended the strategy of experimenting with the BBC One schedule. He made another notable change to the schedule in January 2007, when he moved the current affairs series Panorama back from Sunday nights to the prime time Monday evening slot it had been removed from in 2000, although this decision was at least partly in response to a demand from the Board of Governors of the BBC for the channel <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> current affairs programming in prime time.|$|E
25|$|In Washington State, {{the first}} plantings of Cabernet Franc were {{cultivated}} in experimental blocks by Washington State University in the Columbia Valley during the 1970s. In 1985, Cabernet Franc was {{planted in the}} Red Willow Vineyard for use in Bordeaux style blends. The first varietal Cabernet Franc in Washington was released in 1991 by Columbia Winery followed by Chateau Ste Michelle in 1992 with grapes planted from their Cold Creek Vineyard. In the 1990s, Chinook Winery introduced the state's first Cabernet Franc rosé. Today it is the fourth most widely planted grape in the state behind Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah. Washington Cabernet Franc is distinctive for its fruit forward style with blueberry and raspberry fruit. The characteristic vegetal notes are toned down in Washington, with the wines tending <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> notes of ground coffee and olives.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} the {{salience}} hypothesis, there is considerable evidence {{that people who have}} more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and hypnotic susceptibility, tend <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>more</b> frequent dream recall. There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience. That is, people who report more bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy (psychosis proneness) have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent nightmares.|$|E
