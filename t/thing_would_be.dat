5|$|Chaplin {{never spoke}} more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} such a <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{tantamount to a}} magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} 9th and 10th centuries make {{no mention of}} the Polan (Polanie) tribe. The closest <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the huge (400 gords) Glopeani tribe of the Bavarian Geographer, whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake Gopło, but archeological {{investigations}} cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gopło area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle Obra River basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the Warta River. There was the Gniezno area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the Lech Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural, or settlement pattern sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the Piast House, which resulted {{in the early part of}} the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.|$|E
25|$|In the post-fight interview, Rampage {{expressed}} that the fairest <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to offer Machida an immediate rematch, {{as he felt}} he had lost the fight. Five of 7 media outlets scored the bout in favor of Machida. However, since UFC President Dana White personally felt that Rampage won the fight, he denied the possibility of an immediate rematch. This generated some controversy, as White had previously awarded an immediate rematch to Rua in spite of a unanimous judgment decision awarded to Machida in that fight.|$|E

25|$|Around 1997 the JASONS {{advisory}} group took testimony about the triggering of nuclear isomers. The JASON Defense Advisory Group published a relevant public report {{saying that they}} concluded that such a <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> impossible {{and should not be}} attempted. Despite intervening publications in peer-reviewed journals of articles written by an international team reporting IGE from 178m2Hf, around 2003 IDA took testimony, again from relevant scientists on matters of the credibility of reported results. Professor Carl Collins, the lead U.S. member of the team publishing the successes, did not testify.|$|E
25|$|The polite <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to say 'No comment'. But {{the truth}} is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E
500|$|In October 2007, drinks' {{industry}} {{body the}} Portman Group made an official complaint to communications regulator Ofcom about {{a scene in}} Holby City episode [...] "Trial and Retribution", which depicted the characters Maddy and Sam Strachan each taking five shots of tequila following a stressful day at work. The body's chief executive David Poley claimed that in failing to show {{the negative consequences of}} this action, the series was presenting a [...] "highly irresponsible portrayal of excessive and rapid drinking". The Daily Telegraph noted that the complaint came shortly after Home Secretary Jacqui Smith expressed concern about televisual glorification of drunkenness, having told the Labour Party conference such a <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> branded unacceptable as part of a [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] approach to anti-social behaviour. In response to the Portman Group's accusation that [...] "We would expect the BBC to take greater care with the portrayal of alcohol in programmes", the BBC released a statement explaining that: [...] "Holby City takes the issue of the negative effects of alcohol abuse very seriously. On occasions when our continuing drama series deal with alcohol within a storyline we always seek to handle the issue sensitively".|$|E

500|$|Although Churchill's, {{described}} by Lewington as [...] "the worst club {{that has ever}} been in Reading", tolerated such behaviour, the town's fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called [...] "the elephant" [...] which consisted of turning {{the pockets of his}} jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself. He and his friends would regularly drink all day, though he was able to exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game. However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: [...] "Even if it was three in the morning, the first <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to get the music playing", Simmonds later said. [...] "We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat. Pounding music, people knocking on the door, girls throwing stones at the windows. Poor old sod." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Kulikovsky {{was sent to the}} front with his regiment. Michael was recalled from abroad, and Olga went to work in a military hospital as a nurse. Olga continued to press the Tsar to allow her divorce. In a letter she wrote, [...] "...finish with the divorce now during the war while all eyes and minds are occupied elsewhere—and such a small <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lost in all the greater things". The war went badly for the Russian imperial forces, and the Central Powers, led by Germany, advanced into Russia. Fearful for Kulikovsky's safety, Olga pleaded with the Tsar to transfer him to the relative safety of Kiev, where she was stationed at a hospital. In 1916, after visiting her in Kiev, the Tsar officially annulled her marriage to Duke Peter, and she married Kulikovsky on 16 November 1916, in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in Kiev. Only the officiating priest, Olga's mother the Dowager Empress Marie, Olga's brother-in-law Grand Duke Alexander, two fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev and four officers of the Akhtyrsky regiment, of which Olga was honorary colonel, attended. Their two-week honeymoon was spent in a farmhouse in Podgorny that had belonged to family friends of the Kulikovskys. After visiting Kulikovsky's parents and grandmother in Kharkov, Olga and Kulikovsky returned to Kiev.|$|E

It was given royal assent on June 22 that year as An Act to prevent the cruel and improper Treatment of Cattle, and made it an offence, punishable by fines up to five pounds or two months imprisonment, to [...] "beat, abuse, or ill-treat any horse, mare, gelding, mule, ass, ox, cow, heifer, steer, sheep or other cattle." ...|$|E

The British still demanded an apology {{and the release of}} the Confederate emissaries. Lyons' private instructions directed him to give Seward seven days to reply and to close the British Legation in Washington and return home if a satisfactory response was not forthcoming. In a further effort to defuse the situation, Russell added his own private note telling Lyons to meet with Seward and advise him of the contents of the official letter before it was actually delivered. Lyons was told {{that as long as the}} commissioners were released, the British would [...] "be rather easy about the apology" [...] and that an explanation sent through Adams would probably be satisfactory. [...] He reiterated that the British would fight if necessary, and suggested that the [...] "best <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if Seward could be turned out and a rational man put in his place."

[...] Bookchin mentions that some, like Foreman, defend seemingly anti-human measures, such as severe population control and the claim regarding the Third World that [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve". However, Bookchin himself later admitted that [...] "statements made by Earth First! activists are {{not to be confused with}} those made by deep ecology theorists". Ecophilosopher Warwick Fox similarly [...] "warns critics not to commit the fallacy of 'misplaced misanthropy.' That is, just because deep ecology criticizes an arrogant anthropocentrism does not mean that deep ecology is misanthropic." [...] Likewise, The Deep Ecology Movement: An Introductory Anthology attempts to clarify that [...] "deep ecologists have been the strongest critics of anthropocentrism, so much so that they have often been accused of a mean-spirited misanthropy"; however, [...] "deep ecology is actually vitally concerned with humans realizing their best potential" [...] and [...] "is explicit in offering a vision of an alternative way of living that is joyous and enlivening." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Raymond Padulla {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 3 out of 5. He praised the {{differentiation}} {{in the fighting}} style of the playable characters, writing, [...] "the additional variety in Dark Alliance II {{is one of the}} few cases where more translates to better." [...] However, he felt that when compared with the original game, [...] "while it is superior in a few ways, it's inferior in others." [...] He was critical of the graphics, writing [...] "there are a smattering of areas and effects that are cooler than the original, but for the most part the visuals look dated and uncreative [...] That isn't to say that the graphics are offensive, but compared to the original -- whose graphics were a strong point -- it's definitely a step down." [...] He concluded [...] "I was convinced that more of a great <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an even greater thing. I thought Black Isle would do as fine a job with the series as Snowblind did. I was wrong on both counts. While Dark Alliance II is a good game, it has barely progressed the series." [...] Writing later in 2004, Allen Raucsh said much the same; [...] "Black Isle Studios took over the development chores on this edition, and essentially delivered the same game again. Unfortunately, gamers had moved on [...] In short, while Dark Alliance II was by no means a bad game, it badly needed updating before it could become relevant again.".|$|E
