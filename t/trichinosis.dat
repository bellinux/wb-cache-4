5|$|Rodents {{are also}} {{significant}} vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and <b>trichinosis.</b> A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and <b>trichinosis.</b>|$|E

25|$|Suffering {{from the}} {{hardship}} of his travels, and having eaten polar bear, Hantzsch died of <b>trichinosis</b> on Baffin Island in 1911. His Inuit companions buried {{him on the}} shores of Foxe Basin.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} Mozart's death cannot be known with certainty. The {{official}} record has it as hitziges Frieselfieber ("severe miliary fever", {{referring to a}} rash that looks like millet seeds), more {{a description of the}} symptoms than a diagnosis. Researchers have posited at least 118 causes of death, including acute rheumatic fever, streptococcal infection, <b>trichinosis,</b> influenza, mercury poisoning, and a rare kidney ailment.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, the Western Arctic {{suffered}} a population decline {{of close to}} 90%, resulting from exposure to new diseases, including tuberculosis, measles, influenza, and smallpox. Autopsies near Greenland reveal that, more commonly pneumonia, kidney diseases, <b>trichinosis,</b> malnutrition, and degenerative disorders {{may have contributed to}} mass deaths among different Inuit tribes. The Inuit believed that the causes of the disease were of a spiritual origin.|$|E
25|$|Raw meats {{may also}} contain harmful parasites. As with bacteria, these parasites are {{destroyed}} during the heat processing of cooking meat or manufacturing pet foods. Some raw diet recipes call for freezing meat before serving it, which greatly reduces (but {{does not necessarily}} eliminate) extant parasites. According to a former European Union directive, freezing fish at -20°C (-4°F) for 24 hours kills parasites. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends freezing at -35°C (-31°F) for 15 hours, or at -20°C (-4°F) for 7 days. The most common parasites in fish are roundworms from the family Anisakidae and fish tapeworm. While freezing pork at -15°C (5°F) for 20 days will kill any Trichinella spiralis worm, <b>trichinosis</b> is rare in countries with well established meat inspection programs, with cases of <b>trichinosis</b> in humans in the United States mostly coming from consumption of raw or undercooked wild game. Trichinella species in wildlife are resistant to freezing. In dogs and cats symptoms of trichinellosis would include mild gastrointestinal upset (vomiting and diarrhea) and in rare cases, muscle pain and muscle stiffness.|$|E
25|$|Surveys and {{specimens}} of brown rat populations {{throughout the world}} have shown this species {{is often associated with}} outbreaks of <b>trichinosis,</b> but {{the extent to which the}} brown rat is responsible in transmitting Trichinella larvae to humans and other synanthropic animals is at least somewhat debatable. Trichinella pseudospiralis, a parasite previously not considered to be a potential pathogen in humans or domestic animals, has been found to be pathogenic in humans and carried by brown rats.|$|E
25|$|In 1632 the Noordsche Compagnie {{expelled}} the Danish-employed Basque whalers from Spitsbergen. In revenge, {{the latter}} sailed to Jan Mayen, where the Dutch {{had left for}} the winter, to plunder the Dutch equipment and burn down the settlements and factories. Captain Outger Jacobsz of Grootebroek was asked to stay the next winter (1633/34) on Jan Mayen with six shipmates to defend the island. While a group with the same task survived the winter on Spitsbergen, all seven on Jan Mayen died of scurvy or <b>trichinosis</b> (from eating raw polar bear meat) combined with the harsh conditions.|$|E
25|$|Nematodes {{commonly}} parasitic {{on humans}} include ascarids (Ascaris), filarias, hookworms, pinworms (Enterobius), and whipworms (Trichuris trichiura). The species Trichinella spiralis, {{commonly known as}} the 'trichina worm', occurs in rats, pigs, and humans, and is responsible for the disease <b>trichinosis.</b> Baylisascaris usually infests wild animals, but can be deadly to humans, as well. Dirofilaria immitis are known for causing heartworm disease by inhabiting the hearts, arteries, and lungs of dogs and some cats. Haemonchus contortus {{is one of the most}} abundant infectious agents in sheep around the world, causing great economic damage to sheep. In contrast, entomopathogenic nematodes parasitize insects and are mostly considered beneficial by humans, but some attack beneficial insects.|$|E
25|$|Wild boars are an {{invasive}} {{species in the}} Americas, and cause problems including outcompeting native species for food, destroying the nests of ground-nesting species, killing fawns and young domestic livestock, destroying agricultural crops, eating tree seeds and seedlings, destroying native vegetation and wetlands through wallowing, damaging water quality, coming into violent conflict with humans and pets, and carrying pig and human diseases including brucellosis, <b>trichinosis,</b> and pseudorabies. In some jurisdictions, {{it is illegal to}} import, breed, release, possess, sell, distribute, trade, transport, hunt, or trap Eurasian boars. Hunting and trapping is done systematically, to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boars, which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunters.|$|E
25|$|In October 1834, {{he entered}} {{as a student}} at St Bartholomew's Hospital, in London. Here he is noted to have {{described}} the first journal club. Medical students in those days were left very much to themselves; there was no close supervision of their work, but Paget probably gained rather than lost by having to fight his own way. He swept the board of prizes in 1835, and again in 1836; in his first winter session, he discovered the pathogen for <b>trichinosis,</b> a parasitic disease caused by Trichinella spiralis, a minute roundworm that infests the muscles of the human body, and which is usually acquired by eating infected pork. In May 1836, he passed his examination at the Royal College of Surgeons, and became qualified to practice. The next seven years (1836–1843) were spent in London lodgings, and were a time of poverty, for he made only 15 pounds a year by practice, and his father, having failed in business, could not give him any help. He managed to keep himself by writing for the medical journals, and preparing the catalogues of the hospital museum and of the pathological museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1836, he had been made curator of the hospital museum, and in 1838, demonstrator of morbid anatomy at the hospital, but his advancement there was hindered by the privileges of the hospital apprentices, and because he had been too poor to afford a house-surgeoncy, or even a dressership.|$|E
500|$|The best-known {{and most}} widely {{credited}} {{suggestion is that}} made by Ernst Tryde, a medical practitioner, in his book De döda på Vitön ("The Dead on Kvitøya") in 1952: that the men succumbed to <b>trichinosis,</b> which they had contracted from eating undercooked polar bear meat. Larvae of Trichinella spiralis were found in parts of a polar bear carcass at the site. Lundström and Sundman both favor this explanation. Critics note that the diarrhea, which Tryde cites as the main symptomatic evidence, hardly needs an explanation beyond the general poor diet and physical misery, but some more specific symptoms of <b>trichinosis</b> are missing. Also, Fridtjof Nansen and his companion Hjalmar Johansen had lived largely on polar bear meat {{in exactly the same}} area for 15 months without any ill effects. Other suggestions have included vitamin A poisoning from eating polar bear liver; however, the diary shows Andrée to have been aware of this danger. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a theory that has found a few adherents, such as the explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson. [...] The chief objection is that their primus stove had kerosene still in the tank when found. [...] Stefansson argues that they were using a malfunctioning stove, something he has experienced in his own expeditions. Lead poisoning from the cans in which their food was stored is an alternative suggestion, as are scurvy, botulism, suicide (they had plenty of opium), and polar bear attack. A combination favoured by Kjellström is that of cold and hypothermia as the Arctic winter closed in, with dehydration and general exhaustion, apathy, and disappointment. Kjellström argues that Tryde never takes the nature of their daily life into account, and especially the crowning blow of the ice breaking up under their promisingly mobile home, forcing them to move onto a glacier island. [...] "Posterity has expressed surprise that they died on Kvitøya, surrounded by food," [...] writes Kjellström. [...] "The surprise is rather that they found the strength to live so long" [...] (p.54).|$|E
2500|$|Meat {{from other}} animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, {{may also be}} cut, cured, or {{otherwise}} prepared to resemble bacon, and may even {{be referred to as}} [...] "bacon". Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations, both of which prohibit the consumption of pigs. For safety, bacon may be treated to prevent <b>trichinosis,</b> caused by Trichinella, a parasitic roundworm which can be destroyed by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking.|$|E
2500|$|The Arctic islands were of {{strategic}} importance {{during the war}} {{in part because of the}} weather reports they produced. With the Allies strong grip on most suitable locations, Germany established an undetected weather station on Alexandra Land named Schatzgrüber, located [...] inland from Cambridge Bay. Ten men landed in September 1943 after a three-day voyage from Tromsø in the weather observation ship Kehdingen escorted by U-387. Additional supplies were dropped by aircraft in May 1944. The entire party ate raw polar bear meat the same month, which almost caused the entire station to cease operation as a result of most of the men becoming infected with <b>trichinosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Pigs can harbour a {{range of}} parasites and {{diseases}} that can be transmitted to humans. These include <b>trichinosis,</b> Taenia solium, cysticercosis, and brucellosis. Pigs are also known to host large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tract. According to the USDA fact sheet modern pork can be enjoyed cooked rare at 145°F (63°C) with pink in the middle. Today trichinellosis infections from eating undercooked pork are rare in more technologically developed countries due to refrigeration, health laws, and public awareness. Some religious groups have dietary laws that make pork an [...] "unclean" [...] meat, and adherents sometimes interpret these health issues as validation of their views.|$|E
2500|$|Activity dwindled {{during the}} Second World War {{and only a}} small group of men were kept at Rudolf Island, {{remaining}} unsupplied throughout the war. They never discovered that a German weather station, named Schatzgrüber, had been established on Alexandra Land. However, it was evacuated in 1944 after the men were struck by <b>trichinosis.</b> The Cold War produced renewed Soviet interest in the islands because of their strategic military significance. The islands were regarded as an [...] "unsinkable aircraft carrier". The site of the former German weather station was selected as the location of a Soviet aerodrome and military base, Nagurskoye. With the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union changed its military strategy in 1956, abolishing the strategic need for an airbase on the archipelago. The International Geophysical Year of 1957 and 1958 gave a new rise to the scientific interest in the archipelago and an airstrip was built on Heiss Island in 1956. The following year the geophysical Ernst Krenkel Observatory was established there. Activity at Tikhaya Bay was closed in 1959.|$|E
2500|$|While {{occupied}} with the cataloguing of the Hunterian collection, Owen did not confine {{his attention to}} the preparations before him but also seized every opportunity to dissect fresh subjects. He was allowed to examine all animals that died in London Zoo's gardens and, when the Zoo began to publish scientific proceedings, in 1831, he was the most prolific contributor of anatomical papers. His first notable publication, however, was his Memoir on the Pearly Nautilus (London, 1832), which was soon recognized as a classic. Henceforth, he continued to make important contributions to every department of comparative anatomy and zoology for a period of over fifty years. In the sponges, Owen was the first to describe the now well-known Venus' Flower Basket or Euplectella (1841, 1857). Among Entozoa, his most noteworthy discovery was that of Trichina spiralis (1835), the parasite infesting the muscles of man in the disease now termed <b>trichinosis</b> (see also, however, Sir James Paget). Of Brachiopoda he made very special studies, which much advanced knowledge and settled the classification that has long been accepted. Among Mollusca, he described not only the pearly nautilus but also Spirula (1850) and other Cephalopoda, both living and extinct, and it was he who proposed the universally-accepted subdivision of this class into the two orders of Dibranchiata and Tetrabranchiata (1832). In 1852 Owen named Protichnites – the oldest footprints found on land. [...] Applying his knowledge of anatomy, he correctly postulated that these Cambrian trackways were made by an extinct type of arthropod, and he did this more than 150 years before any fossils of the animal were found. Owen envisioned a resemblance of the animal to the living arthropod Limulus, which {{was the subject of a}} special memoir he wrote in 1873.|$|E
