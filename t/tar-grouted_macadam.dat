5000|$|Tarmac (short for tarmacadam) {{is a type}} of road {{surfacing}} material patented by English inventor Edgar Purnell Hooley in 1902. The term is also used, with varying degrees of correctness, for a variety of other materials, including <b>tar-grouted</b> <b>macadam,</b> bituminous surface treatments, and modern asphalt concrete. The term is also often used to describe airport aprons (also referred to as [...] "ramps"), taxiways, and runways regardless of the surface.|$|E
5000|$|Later on, {{they did}} not hold up to higher-speed motor vehicle use. Methods to {{stabilise}} macadam roads with tar date back to at least 1834 when John Henry Cassell, operating from Cassell's Patent Lava Stone Works in Millwall, patented [...] "Pitch Macadam".This method involved spreading tar on the subgrade, placing a typical macadam layer, and finally sealing the macadam {{with a mixture of}} tar and sand. <b>Tar-grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> was in use well before 1900, and involved scarifying the surface of an existing macadam pavement, spreading tar, and re-compacting. Although the use of tar in road construction was known in the 19th century, it was little used and was not introduced on a large scale until the motorcar arrived on the scene in the early 20th century.|$|E

Early {{organizers}} cited Europe where road construction and maintenance was supported by national and local governments. In its early years, the main goal of the movement was education for road building in rural areas between cities and to help rural populations gain the social and economic benefits enjoyed by cities where citizens benefited from railroads, trolleys and paved streets. Even more than traditional vehicles, the newly invented bicycles could benefit from good country roads.Later on, they did not hold up to higher-speed motor vehicle use.
