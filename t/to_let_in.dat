5|$|The castle was redeveloped in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, {{probably}} by the Praters: the windows were enlarged <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> more light; a grand staircase was built in one of the towers; a Catholic altar was installed, and a revetment, or terrace, was built around the inside of the moat, leaving it 25 feet (7.6 m) wide.|$|E

They entered it {{through the front door}} of the sheriff's office. Payne, the jailer, said he had left it {{unlocked}} <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> a detective from McAlester, who was looking for an escaped prisoner. He said the men bound, gagged and blindfolded him at gunpoint, took his keys, and cut the telephone line. He was unable to identify them.|$|E
5|$|Méliès's film studio, {{which he}} had built in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in 1897, was a greenhouse-like {{building}} with glass walls and a glass ceiling <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> as much sunlight as possible, a concept used by most still photography studios from the 1860s onward; it was built with the same dimensions as Méliès's own Théâtre Robert-Houdin (13.5×6.6m). Throughout his film career, Méliès worked on a strict schedule of planning films in the morning, filming scenes during the brightest hours of the day, tending to the film laboratory and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in the late afternoon, and attending performances at Parisian theaters in the evening.|$|E

25|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Tibetan architecture {{is that many}} of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made out of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against the frequent earthquakes in this mountainous area.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting in the helmet. This {{can be a}} real {{emergency}} and life-threatening if not handled effectively, as the diver can aspirate the vomit and asphyxiate. Once again, the action is to open the free flow valve, preferably before vomiting, and to inhale as carefully as possible. If there is no free flow valve, as on a full face mask, the purge button should clear the demand valve and oro-nasal mask, and the mask can be rinsed by lifting the bottom edge away from the face <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> some water, before purging again.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, {{there was}} also the Truman Directive of 1945, which did not allow more people to migrate, but did use the {{immigration}} quotas <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> more displaced people after the war. There was also the War Brides Act of 1945, which allowed spouses of US soldiers to get an expedited path towards citizenship. In contrast, the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act, turned away migrants based not on their country of origin but rather whether they are moral or diseased.|$|E
25|$|The Capilla de la Tercera Orden (Chapel of the Third Order) is a {{much smaller}} chapel and located between the Capilla Real and the main church, also fronted by the large atrium area. The façade has a Baroque portal with Solomonic columns. Inside, there is gold {{ornamentation}} and seven large 18th and 19th century paintings. In the pendentives of the cupolas there are more paintings of various important Franciscans. The altars are Neoclassical in white and gold, and two large windows were opened {{on either side of}} the main altar <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> more light.|$|E
25|$|Some of the extravagances of the Domus Aurea had repercussions for the future. The architects {{designed}} two of {{the principal}} dining rooms to flank an octagonal court, surmounted by a dome with a giant central oculus <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> light. It was an early use of Roman concrete construction. One innovation was destined to have an enormous influence {{on the art of}} the future: Nero placed mosaics, previously restricted to floors, in the vaulted ceilings. Only fragments have survived, but that technique was to be copied extensively, eventually ending up as a fundamental feature of Christian art: the apse mosaics that decorate so many churches in Rome, Ravenna, Sicily and Constantinople.|$|E

25|$|Captain Charles Fielding assumed {{command in}} June 1803. On 16 November 1803, Circe was sailing {{to return to}} her station on the {{blockade}} of France after gales had driven her into the North Sea. At 3pm she struck the Lemon and Ower sandbank. Although she was able to get over the bank, she lost her rudder and her hull started <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> water. By 2am on 17 November she was able to anchor and daylight revealed that she was off the coast of Norfolk. Several fishing vessels came out of Yarmouth to help. She took the captains of two of them on board as pilots, and towing their boats, sailed for the port. However, the weather had not improved and, despite her crew's efforts at the pumps, the water in her kept rising. Fielding decided to abandon ship and at 7pm her crew transferred to the fishing vessels. The subsequent court martial blamed inaccuracies in Circes navigation charts for her loss.|$|E
500|$|The {{tower is}} [...] high and has massive masonry walls about [...] thick {{with a number}} of {{apertures}} <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> air. Inside there is a massive column made of concrete. At night, the whole structure is allowed to cool, and during the day warm moist air enters the structure via the high apertures, cools, descends, and leaves the building by the lower apertures. Knapen's intention was that water should condense on the cool inner column. In keeping with Chaptal's finding that the condensing surface must be rough and the surface tension must be sufficiently low that the condensed water can drip, the central column's outer surface was studded with projecting plates of slate. The slates were placed nearly vertically to encourage dripping down to a collecting basin {{at the bottom of the}} structure. Unfortunately, the aerial well never achieved anything like its hoped-for performance and produced no more than a few litres of water each day.|$|E
500|$|This {{story is}} partly in {{conflict}} with what is told by the Origo, which has Peredeo acting as an instigator and not as the murderer. In a similar vein to the Origo is the account of Peredeo contained in the Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani, where it is added that Peredeo was Alboin's [...] "chamber-guard", hinting that in the original {{version of the story}} Peredeo's role may just have been <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> the real assassin, who is Helmichis in Agnellus' account, as it had been in that of Marius. However, the primary intent of the Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani may have been to obtain a more straightforward and coherent narrative by reducing the number of actors in the story, beginning with Peredeo. The disappearance of Peredeo, however, means that the role of Helmichis changes: while Paul presents him as [...] "the efficient conspirator and killer", with Agnellus he is a victim of a ruthless and domineering queen.|$|E

500|$|Performances usually {{began at}} 3pm to take {{advantage}} of the daylight: the main floor for the audience, the pit, had no roof in order <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> the light. A glazed dome was built over the opening, but according to one of Pepys' diary entries, the dome was not entirely effective at keeping out the elements: he and his wife were forced to leave the theatre to take refuge from a hail storm. Green baize cloth covered the benches in the pit and served to decorate the boxes, additionally ornamented with gold-tooled leather, and even the stage itself. The backless green benches in the pit were in a semicircular arrangement facing the stage, according to a May 1663 letter from one Monsieur de Maonconys: [...] "All benches of the pit, where people of rank also sit, are shaped in a semi-circle, each row higher than the next." [...] The three galleries formed a semicircle around the floor seats; both the first and second galleries were divided up into boxes.|$|E

(He and Nhu were deposed and shot dead during the November 1963 coup.) Diệm reacted to the assassination attempt by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press. Off the record, one official admitted that [...] "e don't even talk about freedom of the press or ask for other liberties any more... had completely surrounded himself in a protective oligarchy". Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that [...] "here's always going to be an opposition. If we take these people in, there will be another opposition springing up, because they are controversial men." [...] Madame Nhu added, [...] "ou open a window <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> light and air, not bullets. We want freedom, but we don't want to be exploited by it." ...|$|E
500|$|While playing junior hockey, Hextall's coaches {{advised him}} that he would not reach the NHL if he {{continued}} to move the puck. Not everyone agreed; NHL goaltender Darren Pang described feeling as if [...] "he had just witnessed Superman flying out of a phone booth" [...] when he saw Hextall's puckhandling ability in a minor league game. Former NHL goaltender Johnny Bower, when scouting for the Toronto Maple Leafs in Brandon, remarked that Hextall would at times let in soft goals, and doubted if he would reach the NHL; Hextall retained a tendency <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>in</b> occasional weak goals throughout his career. Hextall claims his adventurous style stemmed from his youth, when he played on outdoor ice rinks with a skater's stick, rather than the heftier goaltender's stick. Martin Brodeur modelled his own play on that of Hextall, saying [...] "I love {{the fact that he was}} playing the puck. He was one of the first goalies that came out and played the puck. He was a little rough for my liking, but it was entertaining. The playing of the puck was the big thing." [...] Hextall's mobility provided extra passing opportunities for his defencemen: when killing a penalty they would frequently pass the puck back to him, relieving some of the pressure on his team. He is described on the Hockey Hall of Fame's Legends of Hockey website as being [...] "perhaps the game's most mobile goalie of all time." ...|$|E
