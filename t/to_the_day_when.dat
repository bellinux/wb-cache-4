It occurred just one month after the June 2005 Gujarat floods.

25|$|In 1995 the States of Jersey {{became the}} new owner of the Jersey Opera House {{at a cost of}} £1.3 million. In January 1997 the theatre closed for a major {{restoration}} project. A proposition was presented to the States of Jersey for a loan of £5.5 million to add to the £1.5 million that had been raised by the good will of the people and businesses of Jersey. This was successful and this major programme of work started in August 1998. After an extensive programme of rebuilding and renovation the new theatre opened its door on 9 July 2000 exactly 100 years <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> the first Opera House had opened its doors to the public of Jersey.|$|E
25|$|February 8, 2007 was a {{very cold}} day, and {{that may have been}} a {{contributing}} factor in the low voter turnout. When the polling stations closed at 8:00p.m., it took two hours to count the ballots and declare Ferreira the winner. At his victory party, Donald C. MacDonald (the former Ontario CCF/NDP leader from the 1953 to 1970 and local area MPP for almost thirty years), joined Ferreira onstage in a symbolic passing of the generational torch ceremony. One of the coincidences of this NDP election victory was, that it came almost exactly 65 years <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> the CCF first won York South, in the February 9, 1942 by-election. In that election Joseph Noseworthy won a surprise victory, similar to Ferreira's.|$|E

25|$|Noah tracks Sylar and Elle {{down at the}} Canfield {{household}} and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks {{into the house and}} shoots at them with a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult ("Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to be special. Now look at you; you're nobody."), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet {{household and}} are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> his father first assigned Noah to protect her.|$|E
500|$|Woody Guthrie wrote two songs, unrecorded, {{about the}} Nelson's lynching, [...] "Don't Kill My Baby and My Son" [...] and [...] "High Balladree". The songs {{refer to a}} woman and two sons hanging. His work was not always {{historically}} accurate; for example, he wrote elsewhere that he had witnessed some of the Nelson's troubles, although he was born 14 months after their death. Guthrie recorded another song, [...] "Slipknot", about lynching in Okemah in general: [...] "edicated to the many negro mothers, fathers, and sons alike, that was lynched and hanged under {{the bridge of the}} Canadian River, seven miles south of Okemah, Okla., and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> such will be no more" [...] (signed February 29, 1940). He also sketched a bridge in 1946 from which a row of lynched bodies hang; the sketch is held by the Ralph Rinzler archives in the Smithsonian.|$|E
500|$|The Manchester Evening Chronicle {{brought to}} the fore the issue of [...] "regional unity" [...] for the area in April 1935 under the {{headline}} [...] "Greater Manchester– The Ratepayers' Salvation". It reported on the [...] "increasing demands for {{the exploration of the}} possibilities of a greater merger of public services throughout Manchester and the surrounding municipalities". The issue was frequently discussed by civic leaders in the area at that time, particularly those from Manchester and Salford. The Mayor of Salford pledged his support to the idea, stating that he looked forward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> [...] "there would be a merging of the essential services of Manchester, Salford, and the surrounding districts constituting Greater Manchester." [...] Proposals were halted by the Second World War, though in the decade after it, the pace of proposals for local government reform for the area quickened. In 1947, Lancashire County Council proposed a three [...] "ridings" [...] system to meet the changing needs of the county of Lancashire, including those for Manchester and surrounding districts. Other proposals included the creation of a Manchester County Council, a directly elected regional body. In 1951, the census in the UK began reporting on South East Lancashire as a homogeneous conurbation.|$|E

500|$|The Spectator {{was more}} equivocal in its {{appraisal}} of She. The review described the narrative as [...] "very stirring" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] and of [...] "remarkable imaginative power", adding: [...] "The ingenuity of the story... is as subtle as ever romancer invented, {{and from the}} day when Leo and Holly land {{on the coast of}} Africa, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> the Pillar of Fire is revealed to them by the all but immortal 'She-who-must-be-obeyed', the interest of the tale rises higher and higher with every new turn in its course". However, the review took issue with the characterisation of She and the manner of her demise: [...] "To the present writer {{there is a sense of}} the ludicrous in the end of She that spoiled, instead of concluding with imaginative fitness, the thread of the impossible worked into the substance of this vivid and brilliantly told story". Haggard was moved to respond to the criticism of Ayesha's death, writing that [...] "in the insolence of her strength and loveliness, she lifts herself up against the Omnipotent. Therefore, at the appointed time she is swept away by It... Vengeance, more heavy because more long delayed, strikes her in her proudest part – her beauty".|$|E
500|$|On December 30, 2004, {{following}} the island being moved in [...] "There's No Place Like Home", {{the survivors of}} Oceanic Flight 815, the freighter team, and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begin to erratically jump through time - something Faraday likens to standing on a skipping record - [...] while the Others are unaffected. The first jump takes them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> the Beechcraft carrying Mr. Eko's brother crashes onto the island. John Locke is shot in the leg by Ethan Rom (William Mapother), who has not yet met him and therefore does not recognize him. Meanwhile, James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet and the freighter team head to the [...] {{in order to determine}} when they are. A second jump brings the group forward in time to after the destruction of the station, while Locke is approached by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who recognizes Locke and treats his wound. He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting, and explains {{that the only way to}} stop the erratic movements through time is to bring back everyone who has left the island, and to do that Locke will have to die. Another jump brings them to the past, and they find that the Swan station is now intact. Sawyer tries to contact Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who is inside, but Daniel asserts that the past can not be changed, and since Desmond did not know Sawyer already when they first met, Sawyer cannot be successful. No one answers, and everyone heads back to the beach. Daniel stays behind and knocks again, and Desmond emerges dressed in a hazmat suit, thus belying Daniel's original assertion. Daniel tells him that if Desmond's future self and the survivors of 815 make it off the island on the helicopter then he should go to Oxford University and find Daniel's mother, in order to help the survivors. Another jump occurs just before Daniel can give his mother's name.|$|E
