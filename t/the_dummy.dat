5|$|Turpitude was communicated through visual deceptions in Syria by {{all three}} armed forces. The RAF flew {{reconnaissance}} flights across the supposed targets, whilst the Navy set up major {{facilities in the}} Syrian coastal ports (anti-aircraft guns, search lights and other efforts that might hide major activity). Along the Turkish border the British Ninth Army (the small force protecting Syria), the 31st Indian Armoured Division and 20th Armoured Division (a fictional division, really <b>the</b> <b>dummy</b> tanks of Jones' 24th Armoured Brigade) {{put on a show}} of readiness. Political deception, via Royal Flush, was also used to hint heavily at Allied actions in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} renewed in 2008 {{following}} {{the release of}} the first book in the Goosebumps HorrorLand series, Revenge of the Living Dummy, that was published on April 1, 2008. Before the 2008 release of Revenge of the Living Dummy, there had not been a Goosebumps book published in almost 10 years. Stine decided to start writing Goosebumps books again after receiving mail asking him to write new books in the series. Nineteen Goosebumps HorrorLand books were published, and books in the series mainly featured two stories. The series continued in 2012 with new stories featuring some of the series' most memorable villains, including Slappy <b>the</b> <b>Dummy,</b> the Lawn Gnomes and others. The first book of the spin-off series Goosebumps Most Wanted, Planet of the Lawn Gnomes, was released in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|The stunt {{simulating}} Lange's {{fall into}} the subway train was filmed on August 27, the second production day, and Yoshimura {{said that it was}} the most challenging part of the shoot. D'Onofrio and MacVittie had to arrive at the platform just as the subway train was approaching, and their scene had to be reshot several times because the train did not pass the actors on time. The crew also filmed shots of a dummy dressed as Lange being dragged by the train inside <b>the</b> <b>dummy</b> wall, but most of those scenes were not used in the final cut. The remaining five filming days focused primarily on the scenes between Braugher and D'Onofrio, which Yoshimura and Fleder felt were the most crucial element of the episode. During the filming of the climactic scene with Pembleton and Lange which ends with Lange's death, several members of the crew reacted emotionally, something Yoshimura said is extremely rare because the crew members typically look at their work as a job and do not become emotionally invested in the story that they are filming.|$|E

25|$|The first steam tram {{to service}} Darling Street was in 1892. Ten {{years later the}} service was electrified. A feature of this line was a {{counterweight}} dummy system that controlled and assisted trams on a steep single-line section of track near the terminus at Darling Street wharf. Due to the very steep incline {{at the bottom of}} the street, the trams used a complex 'dummy' / counterweight system constructed under the road surface. A 4-wheel 'dummy' car sat on the single-track at the top of the hill, connected via a large sheave under the track to the counterweight running on a narrow-gauge track in a tunnel under the road. A tram destined for the wharf would close-up to <b>the</b> <b>dummy</b> and push it down the steep hill (gradient 1 in 8), thus raising the counterweight and being assisted in braking. The tram was then assisted up the hill by the weight of the descending counterweight via <b>the</b> <b>dummy.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dummy</b> is behind car 2010 in the photograph below, and is on display at the Sydney Tramway Museum. The slot through which <b>the</b> <b>dummy</b> was fixed to the cable can be seen in that photograph.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>dummy</b> {{has been}} {{determined}} {{to be ready for}} testing, calibration marks are fastened {{to the side of the}} head to aid researchers when slow-motion films are reviewed later. <b>The</b> <b>dummy</b> is then placed inside the test vehicle, set to seating position and then marked on either the head and knees. Up to fifty-eight data channels located in all parts of the Hybrid III, from the head to the ankle, record between 30000 and 35000 data items in a typical 100–150millisecond crash. Recorded in a temporary data repository in the dummy's chest, these data are downloaded to computer once the test is complete.|$|E

The crew was also supposed to follow a very strict procedure while preparing the practice HTP torpedo for firing.|$|E

25|$|Plastic {{changes to}} the body schema are active and continuous. For example, gradual {{changes to the}} body schema must occur over the {{lifetime}} of an individual {{as he or she}} grows and absolute and relative sizes of body parts change over his or her life span. The development of the body schema has also been shown to occur in young children. One study showed that with these children (9-, 14-, and 19-month-olds), older children handled spoons so as to optimally and comfortably grip them for use, whereas younger children tended to reach with their dominant hand, regardless of the orientation of the spoon and eventual ease of use. Short-term plasticity has been shown with the integration of tools into the body schema. The rubber hand illusion has also shown the rapid reorganization of the body schema on the timescale of seconds, showing the high level of plasticity and speed with which the body schema reorganizes. In the Illusion, participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while their own hand is stroked identically. Participants may feel that the touches on their hand are coming from <b>the</b> <b>dummy</b> hand, and even that <b>the</b> <b>dummy</b> hand is, in some way, their own hand.|$|E
25|$|Another tactic is {{pretending to}} pass the ball, called 'dummying'. It can be used during normal backline play {{or as part of}} a set move. The aim of <b>the</b> <b>dummy</b> is to confuse the {{opposition}} and create a gap for the player carrying the ball. When used as a set move a player will run as a decoy, usually at a different angle {{to the rest of the}} players. In complicated moves there will be multiple players acting as decoys. Care must be taken to ensure the decoys do not impede the tacklers, which would result in a penalty being awarded to the defenders.|$|E
25|$|The government's {{final report}} found that the {{officers}} who had issued the order approving use of the HTP torpedoes {{did not have the}} authority to issue that order. <b>The</b> <b>dummy</b> torpedo was ten years old and some of its parts had exceeded their service life. Several sources said that one of the practice torpedoes had been dropped during transport, possibly leading to a crack in the casing, but that the weapon was put aboard the submarine anyway. The crane that would normally have been used to load the missiles was, as usual, out of order, and another had to be brought in, delaying the loading process. This also made the possibility of removing a damaged torpedo more difficult.|$|E
