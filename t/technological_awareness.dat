The “business as usual” run showed that with no additional mitigation measures, the environmental quality in Kampala and Dar es salaam Cities deteriorates. The “more enforcement” and “more collection” scenarios showed good reduction in environmental loads but they perform less well in resource recovery. The “proper management” scenario that combines enhanced <b>technological</b> implementation, <b>awareness</b> raising and policy enforcement, produced the smallest environmental loads, and recovered the largest amount of resources.

Conducted in 2010, the pilot study included 35 teacher education students, all of whom took a nine-week Chinese language/culture online course. Data sources included paper-based pre-and-post assessment, online pre-and-post assessment, task products, email correspondence, class discussion and class feedback. The pilot study was intended to explore four research questions: 1. What are the preservice teachers' initial perceptions of a Chinese as a foreign language online course? 2. How do preservice teachers' perceptions of new language online learning experience change as they take the course? 3. What activities do learners perceive as engaging them in the online course? 4. How do preservice teachers {{say they plan to}} apply their experience/benefits of the course to their own future classrooms before, during and after the course? The results of the pilot study suggested that 1) new forms of online learning were engaging to teacher-learners with diverse learning styles, prior technological experience, needs and goals; 2) the preservice teachers perceived that online foreign language learning during their teacher education program enhanced their linguistic, cultural and technological awareness; and 3) the participants expressed that they benefited from being prepared to work with linguistic, cultural, and technological diversity in classrooms. However, the pilot study was unclear about whether teachers perceived they transfer their awareness into teaching practice. Therefore, extending the pilot study, the follow-up study conducted in 2012 explored inservice teachers' perceptions of linguistic, cultural and <b>technological</b> <b>awareness</b> transfer. The pilot study suggested three main research questions: 1. What do teachers remember about linguistic, cultural and <b>technological</b> <b>awareness</b> acquired through the foreign language online course taken during their teacher education program? 2.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this book is to outline how a radically democratic politics can be reinvigorated in theory and practice {{through the use of}} the internet. The author argues that politics in its proper sense can be distinguished from anti-politics by analyzing the configuration of public space, subjectivity, participation, and conflict. Each of these terrains can be configured in a more or less political manner, though the contemporary status quo heavily skews them towards anti-political configuration. Using this understanding of what exactly politics entails, this book considers how the internet can both help and hinder efforts to move each area in a more political direction. By explicitly interpreting contemporary theories of the political in terms of the internet, this analysis avoids the twin traps of both technological determinism and <b>technological</b> cynicism. Raising <b>awareness</b> of what the word ‘politics’ means, the author develops theoretical work by Arendt, Rancière, Žižek and Mouffe to present a clear and coherent view of how in theory, politics can be digitized and alternatively how the internet can be deployed in the service of trulydemocratic politics. ...|$|R

40|$|Delusions {{involving}} technology, {{and specifically}} the internet, are increasingly common, and fear-reality statistics suggest computer-related fears are very widespread. These fears form a continuum from the widely understandable and realistic to the unrealistic, and frankly paranoid. The present {{study investigated the}} validity of this construct in a non-clinical population by constructing a novel self-report measure. The new Cyber-Paranoia and Fear Scale aims to measure the perception of information technology-related threats originating from or enabled by computers, smartphones, social networks and digital surveillance. Psychometric properties of the new Cyber-Paranoia and Fear Scale are reported alongside an established measure of suspiciousness and paranoia in 181 participants including a sub-group of fifty information technology professionals. Exploratory factor analysis suggested the presence of two, related, dimensions that we term Cyber-Fear and Cyber-Paranoia. Both sub-scales were internally consistent and produced a normal distribution of scores. The relationships of the sub-scales with age, gender, trait paranoia, digital literacy and digital inclusion are supportive of construct validity. The distinctiveness of ‘cyber-paranoia’ from general trait paranoia appears to mirror the clinical distinctiveness of ‘internet’ and other technology fuelled delusions. Knowledge provision to increase <b>technological</b> proficiency and <b>awareness</b> may bring about a reduction in cyber-paranoia...|$|R

A computational algorithm easy on resources is developed in this work to evaluate the effects of distribution network on the annual energy yield of residential PV systems under scenarios of increasing PV penetration. A case study was conducted for residential PV systems in Newcastle upon Tyne with a generic UK distribution network model. Results identified penetration levels at which PV generation curtailment would occur as a consequence of network voltage rise beyond grid limits and the variation in the percentage of annual energy yield curtailed among the systems connected to the network. The volatility of economic performance of the systems depending on its location within the network is also analysed.
