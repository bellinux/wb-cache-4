5|$|Earlier in {{the year}} manager George Graham had started to {{assemble}} a squad with a blend of youth and experience. Having already signed defenders Steve Bould and Lee Dixon, he set about trimming the squad letting Steve Williams and Kenny Sansom leave. Arsenal were not considered favourites for the league title {{at the start of}} the season, but a 5–1 win away at Wimbledon on the opening day led to <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> their chances. They continued their fine start to the campaign, particularly away from home and led the table from the Christmas period. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of Liverpool, but a series of draws and surprising defeats allowed the gap to be closed. By the time Arsenal faced Liverpool on the final day, they were faced with an improbable challenge – winning by a two-goal margin against the defending champions to claim the title. Graham's cautious approach paid dividends as Arsenal led after the break, and deep into stoppage time midfielder Michael Thomas scored the all-important second goal.|$|E

500|$|With Elaine's {{birthday}} {{coming up}} Jerry {{has to decide}} on what to get her. Since {{they are not in}} a relationship but they are still having sex he feels that the symbolism of the gift needs to be carefully thought out. He looks for a gift with George but is unable to think of anything, though he vaguely remembers her saying [...] "something about a bench". Elaine is unhappy with the eventual gift: $182 cash. When Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) gives Elaine the bench she was looking for, for which she is much more grateful, she and Jerry <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> their agreement. They decide to start dating. When Kramer sees them again and asks what they are up to, Jerry notes that they now do [...] "this, that and the other," [...] "the other" [...] being their romantic relationship as a couple.|$|E

500|$|The {{sound in}} the film was complex for its time; it {{included}} dialogue spoken over ambient noises such as crowds {{at the airport and}} gunfire during the hunt. Film director Jean Prat said the film's soundtrack was [...] "of a perfection [...] never equaled by any French film." [...] Characters often talk at once or <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> each other's lines. One example of the dense soundtrack is the party scene, which includes dialogue over screams, gunfire and music. Except for the opening credits and {{the very end of the}} film, all of the music heard in the film is incidental. The sound engineer was Joseph de Bretagne. Music used in the film includes Mozart's Three German Dances, Monsigny's Le déserteur, Louis Byrec, Léon Garnier and Eugène Rimbault's , Strauss's Die Fledermaus, Saint-Saëns's Danse macabre, Chopin's Minute Waltz and Scotto's À Barbizon. The music was arranged by Joseph Kosma and Roger Désormière.|$|E
500|$|On 12 August, a {{human rights}} activist said police fired tear gas and stun grenades on several anti-{{government}} protests, and arrested nine demonstrators. The same day, the PM issued another warning against protests after an urgent Ministerial meeting, saying his government will [...] "forcefully confront" [...] them. [...] " [...] will punish [...] who stand behind them {{in line with the}} recommendations of the Bahrain National Council ," [...] he added. Patrick Cockburn of The Independent said the PM warning showed the [...] "nervousness" [...] of Bahraini authorities ahead of the protests. The PM also held a meeting with the commander of Peninsula Shield Force, a joint Gulf Cooperation Council force that helped crackdown on protests in 2011. The state-controlled Bahrain News Agency (BNA) also reported that the PM headed a [...] "high level meeting" [...] attended by high-ranking officials to <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> arrangements before protests. The PM said his government was [...] "at a critical stage [...] eliminate terrorism".|$|E
500|$|After the Netherlands' exit at Euro 2000, Overmars {{was asked}} whether he would stay at Arsenal. He replied: [...] "I really don't {{want to talk about}} it at the moment but you never know. There are some {{meetings}} with the club going on, we will <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> the next week." [...] Lazio and Barcelona were reportedly interested in signing Overmars; the latter club hastened their efforts once Joan Gaspart was elected as president. Overmars was [...] "flattered" [...] by Barcelona's interest and said moving to such a club would [...] "excite any player". Gaspart travelled to London to open negotiations with Arsenal and eventually reached an agreement to sign Overmars and his teammate Emmanuel Petit for a combined fee of around £32million in July 2000. Overmars cost £25million, making him the most expensive player in Dutch football history. The announcement of his transfer was unconventional; he publicised it on his personal website before informing the media. His site garnered 250,000 hits in one day, highlighting the internet's [...] "potential for exponential growth" [...] in regards to football. Overmars was delighted with the move, saying, [...] "I can't wait to pull on the famous shirt and play my first game." ...|$|E

500|$|The writers {{originally}} conceived several premature joke game endings if {{the player}} performed certain actions, but these required too much development effort for little payback and were scrapped. One of these joke endings {{was triggered by}} shooting a portal onto the moon's surface, after which the player's character would die from asphyxiation over a closing song, {{but the idea of}} creating a portal on the moon was incorporated into the game's final ending. The writers planned that Chell would say a single word during the ending, but this was not considered funny enough. In an early version of the script, Chell finds a lost [...] "tribe" [...] of turrets looking for their leader, a huge [...] "Animal King" [...] turret which can be seen in in-game videos of the retail product. As a reward, the Animal King would have married Chell to a turret, which would have followed Chell around the game without visible movement. The cooperative campaign was planned to feature a more detailed storyline, in which GLaDOS would send two robots to discover human artifacts, such as a comic based on a pastiche of Garfield. The writers hoped to use this idea to make the robots human-like for testing purposes, but recognized that unlike the captive audience of the single-player campaign, the two players in cooperative mode may simply <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> the story, and thus the story was condensed into very basic elements.|$|E
500|$|After three {{films in}} 1957 Donen became an {{independent}} producer and director. He had reluctantly agreed to direct Kiss Them for Me {{on condition that}} 20th Century Fox buy out his remaining contract with MGM. Now free from contractual obligations, he formed Grandon Productions with Grant and signed a distribution deal through Warner Brothers. Donen would self-produce nearly all of his films {{for the rest of}} his career, sometimes under the name [...] "Stanley Donen Productions". Donen and Grant inaugurated their company in 1958 with Indiscreet, based on a play by Norman Krasna and starring Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Because of Bergman's schedule, the film was shot on location in London where, much like he had in his directorial debut, Donen utilized such landmarks as the Leicester Galleries, the Royal Opera House and the Garrick Club. Bergman plays a famous and reclusive actress who falls in love with the playboy-diplomat Grant, who tells her that he is already married and that his wife refuses to divorce him. When Bergman discovers that he has been lying about having a wife, she concocts a charade with another man in order to win Grant's full affection. The film's most famous scene involves Donen's clever circumvention of the strict Production Code. In the scene, Grant is in Paris while Bergman is still in London and the two exchange pillow <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> the phone. Donen used a split screen of the two stars with synchronized movements to make it appear as though they were in the same bed together. The film was a financial and critical success, and Donen was compared to such directors as Ernst Lubitsch and George Cukor.|$|E
500|$|Secrets reveal {{themselves}} steadily {{throughout the}} episode. Xander fears that his future marriage will turn {{him into an}} argumentative drunk like his father. He attempts to avoid his fears through the song [...] "I'll Never Tell", singing [...] "'coz there's nothing to tell", after summoning Sweet to Sunnydale to show him that he and Anya will be happy. Amid the various annoyances Xander and Anya express through this song, some verses are clear-sighted observations of behavior, such as Anya's accusation that Xander—once in love with Buffy—uses Buffy as a mother figure to hide behind. Anya also avoids the truth by burying herself in wedding plans without thinking critically about what being married will entail; instead she considers Xander an accessory to her desired lifestyle. Of all the characters, Anya is the most preoccupied with the style of singing and songs, demanding to know if Spike sang [...] "a breakaway pop hit, or a book number", and asking Dawn if the pterodactyl she facetiously says {{she gave birth to}} also broke into song. Anya and Xander's duet is the only song in the episode to address the audience directly. During the long single-shot scene when she and Xander <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> each other insisting to Giles that evil must be at play, Anya refers to the audience, saying [...] "It was like we were being watched... Like there was a wall missing ... in our apartment... Like there were only three walls and not a fourth wall." [...] Albright asserts that Anya's constant preoccupation with her and others' performances indicates that she has serious doubts about her future supporting role as Xander's wife.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film has}} many {{explicit}} sex scenes, including a tryst {{in a restaurant}} bathroom and a passionate exchange in an apartment building hallway. Lyne's repeated takes for these scenes were demanding for the actors, especially for Lane, {{who had to be}} emotionally and physically fit for the scenes. To prepare for the initial love scene between Paul and Constance, Lyne had the actors watch clips from Fatal Attraction, Five Easy Pieces, and Last Tango in Paris. Lane and Martinez would also <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> the scenes in his trailer beforehand. Once on the set, they felt uncomfortable until several takes in. She said, [...] "My comfort level with it just had to catch up quickly if I wanted to be the actress to play it." [...] Martinez was not comfortable with nudity. Lane said that Lyne would often shoot a whole magazine of film, [...] "so one take was as long as five takes. By the end, you're physically and emotionally shattered." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Michigan Alumnus {{published}} {{a letter from}} another Michigan athlete, Cecil F. Cross, recalling memories of football in Ann Arbor:"The autumn is approaching here. The days are getting shorter {{and there is a}} chill in the air ... It seems to bring back the old feeling which is experienced where the smell of football is in the air, the first cold days of autumn and it makes me homesick, though only slightly. Ralph Henning, of Bay City, is here, and though we come from different parts of Michigan and attended different schools, he being the captain of the Michigan Aggies' football team in 1916, we quite frequently <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> the old scenes with which we are both familiar. He, too, has mentioned the feeling of football in the air. If they were to train an army of football players and throw them into the lines, the last weeks of October, with Coach Yost to address them just before the battle, we would score a touchdown the first half, and before Thanksgiving we would have pushed the Germans under their own goal posts and eat dinner in Berlin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Al Michaels {{was criticized}} by the New York Post for not {{broadcasting}} the game and seeming uninterested in the NBA in general. Barry Horn of The Dallas Morning News said that Michaels was simply [...] "not a basketball guy". Meanwhile, Bill Simmons said during the 2005 Finals that Michaels [...] "shows up for these games, does his job, then drives home thinking, ‘Only five weeks to the [...] Hall of Fame Game, I'm almost there!’" [...] Another criticism that Michaels received was that he too often found himself making tediously long-winded explanations. In return, he would tend to <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> two or three possessions in a row (which Michaels seemed to be better suited for football and baseball broadcasts, for which he's better known for). The end result {{was that he would}} hardly have time to comment on the action viewers were seeing because he was so hung up on a prior subplot or storyline that he felt the audience just had to know about. Michaels was also accused of apparently lacking the kind of enthusiasm and confidence (for instance, Michaels initially reacted to Amar'e Stoudemire's block of Tim Duncan's shot during the 2005 playoffs by calling it a [...] "great, great contested shot") expected of a main play-by-play voice.|$|E
2500|$|From George Wilkins Kendall's {{account of}} the Texan Santa Fe Expedition: [...] "In their habits, they are clannish, social, and {{extremely}} convivial, never living alone like other animals, but, on the contrary, always found in villages or large settlements. They are a wild, frolicsome, madcap set of fellows when undisturbed, uneasy and ever on the move, and appear to take especial delight in chattering away the time, and visiting from hole to hole to gossip and <b>talk</b> <b>over</b> each other's affairs—at least so their actions would indicate. On several occasions I crept close to their villages, without being observed, to watch their movements. Directly in the centre {{of one of them}} I particularly noticed a very large dog, {{sitting in front of the}} door or entrance to his burrow, and by his own actions and those of his neighbors it really seemed as though he was the president, mayor, or chief—at all events, he was the 'big dog' of the place. For at least an hour I secretly watched the operations in this community. During that time the large dog I have mentioned received at least a dozen visits from his fellow-dogs, which would stop and chat with him a few moments, and then run off to their domiciles. All this while he never left his post for a moment, and I thought I could discover a gravity in his deportment not discernible in those by which he was surrounded. Far is it from me to say that the visits he received were upon business, or had anything to do with the local government of the village; but it certainly appeared so. If any animal has a system of laws regulating the body politic, it is certainly the prairie dog." ...|$|E
