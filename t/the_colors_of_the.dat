5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding Latin graphemes {{as soon as the}} Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, European nations used cockades, or {{knots of}} colored ribbons {{pinned to the}} hat, to denote the {{nationality}} of their military. In Poland, until 1831, there was no consensus as to what <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national cockade should be.

5|$|The flag {{does not}} differ {{significantly}} from {{the flag of the}} Byelorussian SSR, other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the red star, and the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern.

50|$|The {{specular}} highlight often reflects <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light source, not <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reflecting object. This {{is because}} many materials have {{a thin layer}} of clear material above <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pigmented material. For example, plastic is made up of tiny beads <b>of</b> <b>color</b> suspended in a clear polymer and human skin often has {{a thin layer of}} oil or sweat above the pigmented cells. Such materials will show specular highlights in which all parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> spectrum are reflected equally. On metallic materials such as gold <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specular highlight will reflect <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material.|$|R

5|$|The French team {{traditionally}} {{played in}} blue shirts, white shorts, and red socks, <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national flag, {{and as such}} were nicknamed les tricolores. Due to the mostly blue strip the French team currently wears, the team is now {{often referred to as}} les Bleus (the Blues), like many other French sporting teams. When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips were developed for the 2007 World Cup, one of which is a darker blue. In June 2011 they relaunched another kit which they wear blue shirt, blue shorts and blue socks for their home kit and they wear white shirt, white shorts and white socks for their away kit.|$|E
5|$|The other {{national}} symbol that was chosen in the 1995 referendum {{was the national}} emblem. The elements of the emblem include a ribbon in <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. At {{the base of the}} ribbon, it says the country's official name in the Belarusian language. The emblem is an allusion to the one used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle replaced the map of Belarus and the ribbon was all red. On the left and right ribbons, the Soviet motto Workers of the world, unite! appeared in the Belarusian and Russian languages.|$|E

5|$|Very rarely (about 1 in 10,000 conchs), a conch pearl may {{be found}} within the mantle.

These pearls are considered semi-precious, and a popular tourist curio. The best specimens have been used to create necklaces and earrings. A conch pearl is a non-nacreous pearl (formerly referred to by some sources as a 'calcareous concretion') which differs from most pearls that are sold as gemstones.|$|E
5|$|Going {{against the}} normal {{convention}} that the strongest characters {{should be the}} largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Ball most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku. Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up {{as a means to}} make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings. Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters mid-story and few characters having screen tone because he found it difficult to use. Since the completion of Dragon Ball, Toriyama has continued to add to its story, mostly background information on its universe, through guidebooks published by Shueisha.|$|E
