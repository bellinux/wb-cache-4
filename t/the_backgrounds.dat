5|$|The designers' {{goal was}} to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. Gibbons drew <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> in pencil, {{starting}} with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, Gibbons would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les Pace. <b>The</b> <b>backgrounds</b> were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. <b>The</b> <b>backgrounds</b> were designed so that the sprites would appear clear on the screen and wouldn't mix with <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons's sketches. Gibbons also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. He would have liked to design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to Gibbons, about 75% of <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and characters he designed were used in the game.|$|E

5|$|The game {{retains the}} classic pastel / crayon visuals from its predecessor. Small changes are {{noticeable}} — water animation has been improved, the black outlines around objects {{are not as}} thick and <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are less cluttered; but the visuals are still tightly-centered on those of the SNES game.|$|E
50|$|All {{detection}} {{techniques are}} based on modelling <b>the</b> <b>background</b> of <b>the</b> image, i.e. set <b>the</b> <b>background</b> and detect which changes occur. Defining <b>the</b> <b>background</b> can be very difficult when it contains shapes, shadows, and moving objects. In defining <b>the</b> <b>background</b> {{it is assumed that}} the stationary objects could vary in color and intensity over time.|$|R

5|$|The {{story was}} novelised by Nigel Kneale, {{his first book}} since his Somerset Maugham Award-winning short story {{collection}} Tomato Cain was published in 1949. The novelisation expanded on <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> {{of many of the}} characters seen in the story, and added a deeper, more physical, relationship between Quatermass and Annie Morgan. It was this version of the story with which Kneale was most pleased.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Charles Cecil began {{researching the}} Knights Templar {{for the game}} after he, Noirin Carmody and Sean Brennan {{conceived}} Broken Sword. It was built with Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine. This was also used for the company's previous two games. Cecil co-wrote and directed the game, while Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen drew <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> in pencil and digitally colored them in Photoshop. The game has a serious tone, but features humor and graphics {{in the style of}} classic animated films.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Potter sketched the {{interior}} of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of the upstairs rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E

30|$|Many {{computer}} vision systems demand accurate segmentation of moving {{objects in the}} video. It is common that the method involves a learning process, and <b>the</b> <b>background</b> model is generated from <b>the</b> video. <b>The</b> <b>background</b> model must be versatile since simple or complex scenes may be encountered. The features representing <b>the</b> <b>background</b> scene are very important. In our framework, <b>the</b> <b>background</b> is modeled using textural and photometric features.|$|R
5|$|Jedi Knight uses both 3D {{graphics}} and surround sound. It {{is one of}} the early games to adopt the use of 3D graphics hardware acceleration using Microsoft Direct3D. The 3D sound technology was tweaked extensively to give an immersive feel to the game. This was achieved by experimentation using many different sound effects and playback styles. Between levels Jedi Knight features full motion video cutscenes. The characters are represented by live actors while <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are pre-rendered graphics. The cutscenes included the first lightsaber footage filmed since Return of the Jedi in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words {{was created}} using a {{combination}} of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic.|$|E
5|$|Rendering was {{executed}} in Mental Ray, using numerous custom-made shaders to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes. Wireframes {{also served as}} a guide to model <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> In total Riven has over three hours of video and almost five thousand images; rendering was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated workstations. Some scenes consisted {{of tens of thousands of}} individual models and textures and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples.|$|E
50|$|A {{background}} light {{is used to}} illuminate <b>the</b> <b>background</b> area of a set. <b>The</b> <b>background</b> light will also provide separation between the subject and <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> Many lighting setups follow a three-point lighting or four-point lighting setup. Four-point lighting {{is the same as}} three-point lighting {{with the addition of a}} {{background light}}. In a four-point lighting, <b>the</b> <b>background</b> light is placed last and is usually placed directly behind the subject and pointed at <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> By adding a background light to a set, filmmakers can add a sense of depth to shots.|$|R

5|$|The 24-man {{animation}} {{team was}} {{split into two}} groups. Half {{were assigned to the}} creation of the 15 new CGI creatures populating noitulovE (in Maya), while the other half created <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> (in Houdini). Compositing work – combining the greenscreen shots with stock footage and CGI elements – was performed in Flame and Inferno. As the final commercial was to be shown on cinema screens, the animators worked at a resolution higher than that afforded by the 576i definition used by British PAL-encoded television sets, to improve the appearance of the advert when projected.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland {{and a lot of}} new designs and backgrounds had to be created for the wilderness scenes. <b>The</b> <b>backgrounds</b> were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the forest ranger was based on then-Vice President Al Gore. In the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at Yosemite National Park. However, the producers asked him to make the voice older and crazier.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E

5|$|The film saw digital {{distribution}} {{as part of}} the DVD release of the miniseries on September 8, 2015. The network previously released the film on their official website in May 2015. Róbert Kovács-Cohner of the Hungarian IGN gave it a high recommendation, calling the story beautiful as it occurs over <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> For their work on these backgrounds, Cross and Tsirgiotis earned juried Emmy Awards, {{as part of the}} 67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.|$|E
5|$|The first Myst titles used pre-rendered graphics, and {{digitally}} inserted {{footage of}} live actors into <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> For Myst V: End of Ages, {{a different approach}} was taken; a special camera recorded actor's faces and mapped the video onto digital models. The characters of Myst have been generally praised in each installment. Reviewers found that the live action characters increased immersion, while the digital body language and spoken conviction in End of Ages endeared the characters to the player. Dissenting reviewers considered Mysts acting overly melodramatic and overwrought.|$|E
5|$|The team at Revolution {{had high}} {{expectations}} for Broken Sword, but there was significant competition. Revolution had a team that had created successful adventure games, but believed they needed to utilise the best of other creative industries. Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen of Dublin's Don Bluth studios drew <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> in pencil and digitally colored them in Photoshop. The introductory sequence and the main characters were done by animator Mike Burgess, {{who worked for the}} Red Rover animation studio. The game's graphics were animated in a style resembling classic animated films.|$|E

5|$|While writing Prisoners of the Sun, Hergé {{decided that}} he wanted to move to Argentina, and focused his {{attention}} on completing all outstanding commissions so that he could focus on his emigration. He enlisted the aid of Van Melkebeke, Guy Dessicy, and Frans Jageneau to help finish Prisoners; they gathered at his home on the Avenue Delleur and produced many of <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> within the story. He also employed his friend Bernard Heuvelmans to help devise the ending of the story; he paid Heuvelmans 43,000 Belgian francs for doing so.|$|E
5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E
5|$|Character Designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nicolas Marlet {{worked on}} setting {{the design and}} overall look of the {{character}}s. Drawing on various inspirations for the widely known characters, the team of character designers worked on designs that had a more realistic feel than the usual animated characters up to that time. Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical, more angular look of the Egyptians versus the more organic, natural look of the Hebrews and their related environments. <b>The</b> <b>Backgrounds</b> department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts. Within the film, approximately 934 hand-painted backgrounds were created.|$|E
30|$|The {{most common}} method for {{foreground}} segmentation is background subtraction. Modern background subtraction algorithms operate by first building {{a model for}} <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> An incoming frame is compared with <b>the</b> <b>background</b> model, and every pixel in the frame is classified as either background or foreground based on the similarity with the model. Pixels in the current frame that have significant disparities with the model are labeled as foreground. An incoming frame {{is also used to}} update <b>the</b> <b>background</b> model. Updating <b>the</b> <b>background</b> model is necessary since the model should adapt to various changes in <b>the</b> <b>background</b> like gradual or sudden illumination changes (changing time of the day, toggling of light switch, etc.), weather changes (rain, fog, etc.), or structural changes in <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> Most algorithms employ independent pixel-wise models for <b>the</b> <b>background</b> to aid fast hardware implementations. Post-processing operations like morphological or median filtering are often used to ensure some spatial consistency to the segmentation results.|$|R
50|$|Then, {{the program}} renders the image pixel's bits by {{combining}} them with <b>the</b> <b>background</b> pixel's bits using the bitwise OR operation. This way, the image pixels are appropriately placed while keeping <b>the</b> <b>background</b> surrounding pixels preserved. The {{result is a}} perfect compound of the image over <b>the</b> <b>background.</b>|$|R
