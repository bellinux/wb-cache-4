40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} {{related to the}} bioavailability of <b>tin,</b> <b>inorganic</b> tin compounds, and organotin compounds. On the one hand, the toxicity of metallic tin and inorganic tin compounds is low. In aqueous systems, the potential bioavailability of tin seems {{to depend on the}} concentration of the truly dissolved ion species. Some studies suggest that tin is an essential trace element for humans. However, organotin compounds have been proven to be of toxicological relevance. Triorganotin compounds are particularly toxic explaining their wide use as biocides (e. g., in antifouling paints or pesticides). Persistence of organotin compounds is governed by moderate to fast aerobic biotic degradation processes, slow anaerobic biotic degradation, slow abiotic degradation by photolysis, and fast, but reversible, adsorption/desorption processes. Organotin compounds are ubiquitously distributed in aquatic organisms. Bioconcentration in organisms and ecotoxicity are dependent on the bioavailable fraction. The bioavailability is highest at neutral and slightly alkaline pH and is reduced in the presence of dissolved organic carbon. The biomagnification of organotin compounds via the food chain is of minor importance compared with the bioconcentration from the water phase...|$|E
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] main objective {{of this study was}} to select and grow wastewater-borne cyanobacteria in a closed photobioreactor (PBR) inoculated with a mixed consortium of microalgae. The 30 L PBR was fed with a mixture of urban secondary effluent and digestate, and operated in semi-continuous mode. Based on the nutrients variation of the influent, three different periods were distinguished during one year of operation. Results showed that total inorganic nitrogen (<b>TIN),</b> <b>inorganic</b> phosphorus concentration (PO 43 -), phosphorus volumetric load (LV-P) and carbon limited/non-limited conditions leaded to different species composition, nutrients removal and biomass production in the culture. High TIN/PO 43 - concentrations in the influent (36 mg N L- 1 / 3 mg P L- 1), carbon limitation and an average LV-P of 0. 35 mg P L- 1 d- 1 were negatively related to cyanobacteria dominance and nutrients removal. On the contrary, cyanobacteria predominance over green algae and the highest microbial biomass production (averaging 0. 084 g Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) L- 1 d- 1) were reached under TIN/PO 43 - concentrations of 21 mg N L- 1 / 2 mg P L- 1, no carbon limitation and an average LV-P of 0. 23 mg P-PO 43 - L- 1 d- 1. However, although cyanobacteria predominance was also favored with a LV-P 0. 15 mg L- 1 d- 1, biomass production was negatively affected due to a P limitation in the culture, resulting in a biomass production of 0. 0. 39 g VSS L- 1 d- 1. This study shows that the dominance of cyanobacteria in a microalgal cyanobacterial community in an agitated PBR using wastewater as nutrient source can be obtained and maintained for 234 days. These data can also be applied in future biotechnology applications to optimize and enhance the production of added value products by cyanobacteria in wastewater treatment systems.

40|$|In the Netherlands tin is {{produced}} from concentrate and secondary production (about 3, 500 tonnes Sn per year), whereas about 5, 000 tonnes Sn per year is applied. Of this amount about 4, 200 tonnes is applied as <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> (most for the manufacturing of tin plate) and about 800 tonnes Sn is applied as organotin compounds (most in pesticides, PVC-stabilizer and anti-fouling paints). Available information {{indicates that the}} risk of <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> compounds to humans is very small, if present at all. The risks of <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> compounds to aquatic ecosystems are considered to be small and are likely to be restricted to surface waters in the vicinity of industrial sites. Although little information on exposure to and effects of <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> in soil organisms, current and future emissions to soil indicate a low priority to fill in these gaps in knowledge. As to organotin compounds it is assumed that environmental concentrations unlikely present a risk to the general population. The risk of organotin compounds in food to humans is unknown, mainly because no quantitative data on exposure are available. Triphenyl and tributyl organotin compounds present a risk to aquatic ecosystems in the Netherlands. Information on the toxicity to sediment and soil organisms {{as well as on the}} occurrence in soil are lacking, hampering a sound risk evaluation. It is recommended [a] to determine the concentrations of organotins in food, [b] to execute the ban on triphenyl tin acetate and triphenyl hydroxide as soon as possible and [c] to stimulate alternative methods for anti-fouling paints.

40|$|Tin and organotin {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} in at least 214 and 8 sites, respectively, of the 1, 662 hazardous waste sites that have been proposed for inclusion on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) (HazDat 2004). However, the number of sites evaluated for tin and {{organotin compounds}} is not known. The frequency of these sites can be seen in Figures 6 - 1 and 6 - 2, respectively. All sites where tin and organotin compounds were found are located in the United States. Tin occurs naturally in the earth's crust with a concentration of approximately 2 – 3 ppm (Budavari 2001). Tin compounds are found in various environmental media in both inorganic and organic forms. Tin may be released to the environment from natural and anthropogenic sources. Tin is a component of many soils and <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> compounds may be released in dusts from wind storms, roads, and agricultural activities. Releases of tin to environmental media may occur from the production and use of tin and tin compounds. Gases, dusts, and fumes containing tin may be released from smelting and refining processes, industrial uses of tin, waste incineration, and burning of fossil fuels (Byrd and Andreae 1986; Senesi et al. 1999; WHO 1980).

40|$|The heme-cytochrome P- 450 {{complexes}} represent sensitive metabolic {{systems for}} examining the biological impact of metals on important cellular functions. Many metals, {{both in the}} inorganic form and bound to organic moieties, potently induce heme oxygenase, the rate limiting enzyme of heme degradation. The resulting increase {{in the rate of}} heme breakdown is reflected in a marked depression of cellular cytochrome P- 450 content and impairment of the oxidative metabolism of natural and foreign chemicals dependent on this hemeprotein. Organometal complexes do not mimic in all their aspects the actions of the inorganic elements which they contain. For example, organotins, in contrast to <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin,</b> produce a prolonged induction response of heme oxygenase in the liver but not in the kidney. Co-protoporphyrin is a much more potent inducer of heme oxygenase in liver than is inorganic cobalt; and Sn-protoporphyrin inhibits heme oxygenase activity nearly completely, whereas <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> is a powerful inducer of the renal enzyme. Contrasting effects on heme metabolism exist as well within the metalloporphyrin species as demonstrated by the effects in vivo of Co-protoporphyrin and Sn-protoporphyrin on heme oxygenase activity; the former induces the enzyme whereas the latter potently inhibits it. In vitro, however, both compounds competitively inhibit heme oxidation activity. These differences, among others which characterize metal actions in vivo and in vitro attest to the importance of pharmacokinetic, adaptive and other host factors in defining the responses of the heme-cytochrome P- 450 systems to the impact of metals in the whole animal...|$|R

Tin concentrations in sediments were higher (3. 0 to 7. 9 mg kg− 1) at sites impacted by human activity than at open water sites (0. 8 to 0. 9 mg kg− 1), {{and they were very}} high (239. 6 mg kg− 1) in Baltimore Harbor, which is impacted by both shipping and heavy industry. <b>Inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> (75 mg Sn liter− 1) in agar medium significantly decreased viable counts, but its toxicity was markedly reduced in liquid medium; it was not toxic in medium solidified with silica gel. Addition of SnCl 4 · 5 H 2 O to these media produced a tin precipitate which was not involved in the metal's toxicity. The data suggest that a soluble tin-agar complex which is toxic to cells is formed in agar medium. Thus, the toxicity of tin depends more on the chemical species than on the metal concentration in the medium. All sites in Chesapeake Bay contained organisms resistant to tin. The microbial flora was more sensitive to (CH 3) 2 SnCl 2 than to SnCl 4 · 5 H 2 O.

The system results in discharge of <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> to the ecosystem. This screening study is based on historical information combined with measurements of contaminant concentrations in water, fish, sediment, biofilms and invertebrates. Initial mercury data indicate that {{first few years of}} mercury treatment resulted in a significant decrease in mercury concentration in an upper trophic level fish, redfin pickerel, at all sampling locations in the impacted reach. For example, the whole body mercury concentration in redfin pickerel collected from the most impacted pond decreased approximately 72 % between 2006 (pre-treatment) and 2010 (post-treatment). Over this same period, mercury concentrations in the fillet of redfin pickerel in this pond were estimated to have decreased from approximately 1. 45 {micro}g/g (wet weight basis) to 0. 45 {micro}g/g - a decrease from 4. 8 x to 1. 5 x the current EPA guideline concentration for mercury in fillet (0. 3 {micro}g/g). Thermodynamic modeling, scanning electron microscopy, and other sampling data for tin suggest that particulate tin (IV) oxides are a significant geochemical species entering the ecosystem with elevated levels of tin measured in surficial sediments and biofilms.

Our study areas were evenly distributed across the A, C and D climates of the Köppen classification. Gas measurements using static chambers, groundwater analysis and gas and peat sampling for further laboratory analysis have been conducted in 13 regions evenly distributed across the globe. In each study area at least two study sites were established. Each site featured at least three sampling plots, three replicate chambers and corresponding soil pits and one observation well per plot. Gas emissions were measured during 2 – 3 days {{in at least three}} sessions. A log-log linear function limits N 2 O emissions in relation to soil <b>TIN</b> (total <b>inorganic</b> nitrogen). The boundary line of N 2 O in terms of soil temperature is semilog linear. The closest representation of the relationship between N 2 O and soil moisture is a local regression curve with its optimum at 60 – 70 %. Semilog linear upper boundaries describe the effects of soil moisture and soil temperature to CH 4 best. The global N 2 O boundary lines revealed a striking similarity with the Southern German N 2 O boundary lines, as well as with analogous scattergrams for Europe (Couwenberg et al. 2011) and Southern Queensland (Wang and Dalal 2010).

40|$|While surface {{studies of}} tin oxide, a well {{established}} gas sensing material, are quite prevalent, a void of information regarding most other tin materials is quite apparent. Tin oxide, like silicon and germanium, is a semiconductor, while tin itself is metallic in nature. This disparity {{allows for the}} possibility of a multitude of new chemistries on metallic tin surfaces which have not yet been attempted. <b>Inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> compounds are useful starting materials for many reactions, including those which lead to organotin compounds. As to our knowledge there are no instances of many surface-bound tin functionalities including halides, hydrocarbons, and hydrides. ^ The bulk of this thesis explores the different chemistries that lead to various tin surface functionalizations. A number of reactions produced high surface area materials and in addition, many displayed unexpected room temperature and low temperature photoluminescence (PL). Of these surfaces several were found to be responsive to specific analytes such as amine-containing vapors, human sweat, and various aqueous salts and amino acids by inducing either a shift or quench of the visible light emission. ^ In addition a number of similar PL quenching experiments were preformed on various luminescent lead compounds. These results will be discussed in order to elucidate the differences and similarities with the described luminescent tin compounds. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{perspective of}} Butyltin (BTs) contamination and its possible implications on the marine and coastal environments of the Philippines is presented using green mussels, marine mammals and skipjack tuna as bioindicators. BTs were detected in mussels {{from all the}} sampling locations investigated {{as part of the}} monitoring surveys under the Asia-Pacific Mussel Watch (APMW) Program conducted in the late 1990 s. The BTs detected in green mussels collected in 1994, 1997 and 1998 from various aquaculture and coastal sites in the country were suggestive of considerable widespread pollution by BTs in the coastal waters. Among BTs, TBT was detected at all locations at relatively higher concentrations, whereas the concentrations of DBT and MBT were found to be at lower residual concentrations. This could be indicative that green mussels have limited ability of metabolize TBT to DBT and MBT. It could also be suggestive of recent TBT inputs into the aquatic environments and the presence of sources along the coastal waters. Concentrations of BTs (MBT+DBT+TBT) in green mussels were reported up to 790 ng g 1 wet weight in a site where intensive maritime activities are occurring. Mussels from rural areas contained TBT at lower proportions indicating that TBT usage as antifouling agents is minimal. Tolerable Average Residue Level (TARL) for seafood in the Philippines was estimated at 173 ng g wet weight for an average person weighing 60 kg. Concentrations of TBT or the sum of TBT and DBT in some green mussels analysed revealed that some values exceeded TARL level, which could suggest that humans consuming this seafood from areas with high BTs contamination could be at risk from elevated exposure to BTs. BTs were likewise detected in skipjack tuna collected from the offshore waters of the Philippines, suggestive of the widespread contamination even in offshore waters. Considerable BTs levels (up to 220 ng g wet weight), with high percentages of BTs in total <b>tin</b> (ΣSn: <b>inorganic</b> tinorganic <b>tin)</b> were noted in the liver tissues. This finding indicates that the anthropogenic BTs represent the major source of Sn accumulation. On the other hand, relatively low concentrations of BTs were found in the liver of cetaceans from the coastal waters of the Philippines, which ranged at 42 - 98 ng g 1 wet weight. Significantly lower hepatic BT concentrations in cetaceans in tropical waters were noted compared with those inhabiting temperate waters proximal to developed nations. This result could imply that, at present, usage of BTs in the Philippines is still minimal...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the widespread industrial and agricultural applications of organotin compounds, contamination of various ecosystems has occurred in recent decades. Understanding how these compounds interact with cellular membranes is essential in assessing the risks of organotin pollution. The organotins, tributyltin (TBT) and trimethyltin (TMT) and <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin,</b> Sn(IV), were investigated for their physical interactions with non-metabolising cells and protoplasts of the yeast, Candida maltosa, an organism that is often associated with contaminated environments. Sn(IV) and TBT uptake occurred by different mechanisms. TBT uptake resulted in cell death and extensive K+ leakage, while Sn(IV) uptake had no effect. TMT did not interact with cells. Of the three compounds, TBT alone altered the membrane fluidity of cells, as measured by the fluorescence anisotropy of 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene incorporated into cells. To further examine the contribution of lipophilic interactions, the influence of pH and NaCl concentration on TBT and triphenyltin (TPT) uptake and toxicity was assessed. Solution pH and ionic composition influence the chemical speciation and toxicity of organotins in the aquatic environment. Organotin compounds may exist as both hydrated cationic species and neutral hydroxides in solution, with the formation of chloride species in the presence of NaCl. The uptake and toxicity of TBT and TPT by C. maltosa was investigated between pH 3. 5 and 7. 5 and in concentrations of up to 500 mM NaCl. A theoretical model was used to predict the speciation and overall octanolwater distribution ratios (Dow) - TBT and TPT toxicity was correlated with Dow values, corresponding to increasing pH and NaCl concentration and implicating compound lipophilicity as a toxicity determinant...|$|R

Due to changes in climate and socioeconomic developments, current soil management practices in the Bolivian Andean Highlands may be increasing soil degradation thereby threatening food security. A study was established in four representative communities during the 2006 - 09 growing seasons to identify an integrated soil management strategy that may help to improve soil fertility and productivity by increasing soil organic matter. Soil samples collected from fields of different lengths of cropping (LC) and fallow (LF) showed that LC decreased and LF increased total (TOC) and active soil organic C (AOC), and total (TN), <b>inorganic</b> (<b>TIN)</b> and active soil N (AIN). Field trials established with combinations of soil inorganic fertilizers (SIF) and local and alternative soil organic fertilizers (i. e., cow and sheep manure, household compost and a biofertilizer) revealed that the cow and sheep manure combined with SIF significantly affected soil properties, such as pH, soil test P, TN, TIN and TOC, soil water content and bulk density and significantly increased the production of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and a subsequent quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) crop. Results of testing a portable field method to assess N status of potato plant tissue suggest that use of the Cardy nitrate-N meter may have some promise for tissue testing for potato in the Andean highlands of Bolivia, where access to soil and plant tissue testing services is limited...|$|R
40|$|Mercury (Hg) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a 'persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic' pollutant with widespread impacts throughout North America and the world (EPA. 1997 a, 1997 b, 1998 a, 1998 b, 2000). Although most of the mercury in the environment is inorganic Hg, a small proportion of total Hg is transformed through the actions of aquatic microbes into methylmercury (MeHg). In contrast to virtually all other metals, MeHg biomagnifies or becomes increasingly concentrated as it is transferred through aquatic food chains so that the consumption of mercury contaminated fish is the primary route of this toxin to humans. For this reason, the ambient water quality criterion (AWQC) for mercury is based on a fish tissue endpoint rather than an aqueous Hg concentration, as the tissue concentration (e. g., < 0. 3 {mu}g/g fillet) {{is considered to be a}} more consistent indicator of exposure and risk (EPA, 2001). Effective mercury remediation at point-source contaminated sites requires an understanding of the nature and magnitude of mercury inputs, and also knowledge of how these inputs must be controlled in order to achieve the desired reduction of mercury contamination in biota necessary for compliance with AWQC targets. One of the challenges to remediation is that mercury body burdens in fish are more closely linked to aqueous MeHg than to inorganic Hg concentrations (Sveinsdottir and Mason 2005), but MeHg production is not easily predicted or controlled. At point-source contaminated sites, mercury methylation is not only affected by the absolute mercury load, but also by the form of mercury loaded. In addition, once MeHg is formed, the hydrology, trophic structure, and water chemistry of a given system affect how it is transformed and transferred through the food chain to fish. Decreasing inorganic Hg concentrations and loading may often therefore be a more achievable remediation goal, but has led to mixed results in terms of responses in fish bioaccumulation. A number of source control measures have resulted in rapid responses in lake or reservoir fisheries (Joslin 1994, Turner and Southworth 1999; Orihel et al., 2007), but examples of similar responses in Hg-contaminated stream ecosystems are less common. Recent work suggests that stream systems may actually be more susceptible to mercury bioaccumulation than lakes, highlighting the need to better understand the ecological drivers of mercury bioaccumulation in stream-dwelling fish (Chasar et al. 2009, Ward et al. 2010). In the present study we examine the response of fish to remedial actions in Tims Branch, a point-source contaminated stream on the Department of Energy's (DOE) Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina. This second order stream received inorganic mercury inputs at its headwaters from the 1950 s- 2000 s which contaminated the water, sediments, and biota downstream. In 2007, an innovative mercury removal system using tin (II) chloride (stannous chloride, SnCl{sub 2 }) was implemented at a pre-existing air stripper. Tin(II) reduces dissolved Hg (II) to Hg (0), which is removed by the air stripper. During this process, tin(II) is oxidized to tin (IV) which is expected to precipitate as colloidal tin(IV) oxides and hydroxides, particulate materials with relatively low toxicity (Hallas and Cooney, 1981, EPA 2002, ATSDR, 2005). The objectives of the present research are to provide an initial assessment of the net impacts of the tin(II) based mercury treatment on key biota and to document the distribution and fate of <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> in this small stream ecosystem after the first several years of operating a full scale system. To support these objectives, we collected fish, sediment, water, invertebrates, and biofilm samples from Tims Branch to quantify the general behavior and accumulation patterns for mercury and tin in the ecosystem and to determine if the treatment process has resulted in: (1) a measurable beneficial impact on (i. e., decrease of) mercury concentration in upper trophic level fish and other biota; this is a key environmental endpoint since reducing mercury concentration in fish is a primary regulatory driver for controlling mercury in streams; and (2) the potential for negative impacts associated with <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin,</b> including, biological transformation and uptake, and/or undesirable accumulation/focusing of tin to in key ecosystem compartments...|$|R
40|$|Heavy metals {{are present}} {{naturally}} in relatively low amounts in the earth’s crust. Through food, {{drinking water and}} the air, humans absorb trace amounts of these elements. Trace amounts of some heavy metals, such as selenium, zinc, and copper, are key to maintaining the metabolism of the human body. At high concentrations usually found in contaminated environments, such as and contaminated water, heavy metals can cause poisonings resulting in impaired mental and central nervous function, as well as damage to vital organs. Long-term exposure may result in slowly progressing physical, muscular, and neurological degenerative conditions including cancer. Arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead and <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> account {{for a majority of}} heavy metal poisoning cases involving food products. Levels of arsenic are naturally high in fish and seafood. Found in soil due to the presence of insecticides, fungicides, sludge and commercial fertilizers, cadmium can contaminate agricultural food products. Mercury is an industrial pollutant as well as a by-product of volcanic emission. In recent years, a number of products, ranging from protein shakes to baby formula to fresh produce, have been linked to heavy metal contamination. Spurred by consumer calls for safer products, regulatory agencies around the globe are taking steps to detect and minimize the presence of hazardous heavy metals in food. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforces action levels for poisonous or deleterious substances in human food and animal feed, including cadmium, lead, mercury, and others. For most people, diet is the main route of exposure to trace metals, so the assessment risks of these elements to human via dietary intake is important. Cooking jams using fruits, sugar, pectin and edible acids {{is one of the oldest}} food preserving processes known to mankind and presents a way of making food stable by increasing the content in soluble solids. In the recent times lots of research findings revealed the presence of deleterious artificial colorants above the permissible levels as well as the heavy metals in sweets, cakes, ice creams etc. Hence Spurred and encouraged by the above reports we authors in our studies analyzed 5 different mixed fruit jam samples of 5 different brands collected from 5 different areas of Bangalore city for some of the heavy metals like Cadmium, Lead, Chromium and Mercury. Our preliminary analysis revealed the minimal permissible levels of all the above mentioned heavy metals in all the 5 different brands which clearly confirms the very presence of the heavy metals at first and secondly also incites a doubt of their usage for human consumption especially for young children who like the very taste of it as to how safe are these Food stuffs contaminated with heavy metals and with carcinogenic artificial food colorants and hence we strongly recommend the Scientific Community to hold a detailed research of these Fruit Jam samples in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Mono- and di-alkyltins {{are used}} {{extensively}} as heat stabilizers for processing of poly vinyl chloride (PVC). Tin mercaptide stabilizers {{are some of}} the most effective PVC stabilizers available. The main applications for tin stabilizers are building/construction products, such as pipes, fittings, siding and profiles (windows etc.), packaging and flexible PVC plastics. Most PVC products have been and are subjected to landfilling, when their use is terminated. The structure of the polymer itself and the substances used as additives have been a concern for environmental authorities in many countries since long, which also includes their presence in landfills. In the case of the organotin stabilizers their leaching out from (PVC) plastics into the leachate phase of landfills with the risk for further transport to ground and surface waters is in focus. The main objectives of this thesis take their start in this background and, thus, included the elucidation of whether organotin compounds (OTs) in stabilized PVC products contribute to the pool of OTs observed in landfill leachates and if these compounds are degradable by the microorganisms developing under anaerobic landfill conditions. To reach these aims and the research questions raised the forwarded PVC materials were added to muniscipal solid waste (MSW) processed in containers used to simulate the ageing of landfills under forced conditions. These include traditional landfill simulation reactors (LSRs) at a scale of ca 100 L and also at a smaller scale ca 5 L constructed for the purpose of this study, i. e. the modular environmental test system (METS). The latter were used to investigate temperature effects on the possible release of OTs from different types of PVC materials. The capacity by microorganisms in landfill environments were used to investigate their capacity to degrade or transform organotin stabilizer compounds focused on in this thesis. Differences in this capacity in relation to the ageing of landfills and exposure to the alkyltin stabilizers were studied with microorganisms sampled from LSRs spiked with PVC over time and from landfill site. Access to sensitive and reliable equipment and analytical protocols for the analysis of OTs and their transformation intermediates and end products are prerequisites for this kind of studies. This necessitated an adoption and adaptation of analytical methods for the low concentrations occurring in the environment. Two methods were established and well served the requirements. Indeed OTs migrated out from especially flexible PVC materials, while rigid PVC was less prone for OT release as judged from the METS simulations. The METS studies showed that the OT release increase substantially at higher temperatures and especially so when the temperature was higher than the glass transition of the PVC. materials. The organotin stabilizers were transformed, partly or completely degraded, by anaerobic microorganisms derived from landfill environments. Upon prolonged exposure to OTs leaching from PVC in LSR simulations the microorganisms displayed a higher efficiency in degradation of the leached OTs. The microorganisms would methylate <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> and metyltin present in the MSW material as well as perform dealkylation depending on the tin concentrations prevailing. During these studies it was discovered that the organotin stabilzers were inhibiting the methanogens and fermentative bacteria, which lead to a retardation of the anaerobic mineralisation of the MSW in the assays. An in depth study revealed that the OTs themselves but also their ligands and degradation products from these together effected the inhibition. However, given the extent of leaching in relation to the water flows in landfills, the concentrations will mainly be too low to pose any risks to the surrounding environment...|$|R
