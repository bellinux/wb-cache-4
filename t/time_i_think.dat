Towards the song's end, she repeats [...] "they're coming for you" [...] in a [...] "reedy and distorted" [...] voice. The track's sound was compared to the works of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails by David Chiu of Consequence of Sound. Furthermore, Chris Gerard, a writer for PopMatters, compared the production's sound to being intoxicated.|$|E

Later that month, Bell talked about some of the new character pairings in the season, saying [...] "Putting Mack and Daisy together; putting Hunter and May together; putting Bobbi and Fitz together—suddenly you have all these different dynamics, all these different stories that you didn't have before." [...] Tancharoen later highlighted the number of characters in the season compared to previous, stating that [...] "There's more scale and scope, but at the same <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we're diving into each character's internal struggle a little bit more." ...|$|E

[...] Gabriel addressed the possibility of a reunion: [...] "I never say never.

It’s not as if you’re going to get Peter as the singer, me as the drummer. I can’t play any more, so it’s never going to happen," [...] adding it would not be likely for Gabriel to perform songs Collins originally sang lead on.|$|E

500|$|While Green Day {{was nearing}} {{completion}} of Warning, the band {{announced it would}} be performing on the 2000 Vans Warped Tour during the summer before the album's October release. Although the group {{had been invited to}} perform on the tour before, the band was unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts. Because of Green Day's new stylistic change displayed on Warning, the band was considered an unconventional choice for the tour. Jason White, guitarist for Armstrong's side project Pinhead Gunpowder, was recruited to perform with the band to add [...] "more power" [...] to the group's sound; White observed that [...] "Even I was like, 'Why are Green Day on the Warped Tour?'". Fat Mike of NOFX recalled, [...] "They were the biggest band on the tour but it wasn't by far. [...] Green Day weren't super popular at that <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they did the Warped tour because they wanted to get popular again."

[...] However, Joel Madden of Good Charlotte, whose 2002 release The Young and the Hopeless outsold Warning, opined that [...] "I was definitely aware that our record at the time sold more maybe than their record but I think we idolized them so much that it didn't matter.
