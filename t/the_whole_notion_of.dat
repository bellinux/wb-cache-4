40|$|AbstractAs for {{extending}} real-valued continuous functions or continuous pseudometrics on a subspace to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> space, <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> z -, C∗ -, C -, P - and Pγ -embeddings are known. As {{a cardinal}} generalization of z -embedding, Blair defined in 1985 the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> zγ -embedding with γ≥ω, where zω -embedding coincides with z -embedding. On the other hand, since Pω -embedding equals C -embedding, Pγ -embedding can be also {{regarded as a}} cardinal generalization of C -embedding. Recently Ohta asked if a cardinal generalization of C∗ -embedding can be defined so that this property plus Uω -embedding is equal to Pγ -embedding, and it is itself equals C∗ -embedding in case γ=ω. In this paper, we give a cardinal generalization of C∗ -embedding, called (P∗) γ -embedding, and answer this problem. As a characterization of (P∗) γ -embedding, we show that (P∗) γ -embedding naturally admits its description by using continuous maps from a subspace into the hedgehog with γ spines. We also give a new extension-like property called weak zγ -embedding, with which z - (respectively C∗ -, C - or Uω -) embedding equals zγ - (respectively (P∗) γ -, Pγ - or Uγ -) embedding...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{significant}} interest {{in the concept of}} wellbeing in the academic literature. Likewise, Government strategies are increasingly being aligned with the promotion of positive mental health, as opposed to merely the treatment of illness. Experiencing wellbeing in later life has, however, been labelled by some as a ‘paradox’, as the conditions of older age are assumed to be negative and thus at odds with those which sustain wellbeing. On <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> wellbeing as applied to older adults has been defined by ‘experts’, and the small number of studies that have examined this from the perspective of older adults have often reduced this to the life domains which support or undermine quality of life. Therefore, in order to gain a richer understanding of this topic, the aim {{of this study was to}} further explore older adults’ perceptions and experience of wellbeing. In this qualitative study, a combination of narrative inquiry and photographic methods were used to elicit wellbeing stories from older adults. Thirteen participants aged 56 – 82 years took photographs of the factors they associated with their wellbeing, which they discussed in narrative interviews. Analysis of these data revealed that there were six ‘narrative types’ present in the stories told by participants; namely Continuity, Proactivity, Opportunity, Recovery, Acceptance and Disruption. These findings were considered in relation to the narrative elements of tone, plot, agency, temporality and pace. Comparisons were made between the six ‘narrative types’ and the ‘narrative of decline’ which is assumed to shape the stories told by older adults. It emerged that, on <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> narratives which were present in my study were positive in tone, had plots of stability or progression, displayed high levels of agency in the storytellers, were placed in the present and within a coherent life story, and revealed a busy pace of life. The ‘narrative of decline’ was found to have little influence over the stories which were told. In addition, it seemed that there may be a new ‘wellbeing’ narrative which is more pertinent to those in younger-old age. Thus my findings suggest that wellbeing can be experienced in later life and that the ‘narrative of decline’ should no longer be automatically cited as the one which shapes the stories older adults can tell about their lives...|$|R

5000|$|In the Ottoman Empire, a millet was a {{separate}} {{court of law}} pertaining to [...] "personal law" [...] under which a confessional community (a group abiding {{by the laws of}} Muslim Sharia, Christian Canon law, or Jewish Halakha) was allowed to rule itself under its own laws. Despite frequently being referred to as a [...] "system", before the nineteenth century the organization of what are now retrospectively called millets in the Ottoman Empire was far from systematic. Rather, non-Muslims were simply given a significant degree of autonomy within their own community, without an overarching structure for the 'millet' as a <b>whole.</b> <b>The</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> distinct millets corresponding to different religious communities within the empire would not emerge until the eighteenth century. Subsequently, the existence of the millet system was justified through numerous foundation myths linking it back to the time of Sultan Mehmed II (r. 1451-81), although it is now understood that no such system existed in the fifteenth century. After the Ottoman Tanzimat (1839-76) reforms, the term was used for legally protected religious minority groups, similar to the way other countries use the word nation. The word millet comes from the Arabic word millah (ملة) and literally means [...] "nation". The millet system has been called an example of pre-modern religious pluralism.|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{interactive}} translation dictation (ITD), {{a translation}} technique that involves interaction with multimodal interfaces equipped with voice recognition (VR) technology {{throughout the entire}} translation process. Its main objective {{is to provide a}} solid theoretical background and an analysis of empirical qualitative and quantitative data that demonstrate ITD’s advantages and challenges, with a view to integrating this technique into the translation profession. Many empirical studies in human-computer interaction have strived to demonstrate the efficiency of voice input versus keyboard input. Although it was implicit in the earliest works that voice input was expected to completely replace—rather than complement—text-input devices, it was soon proposed that VR often performed better in combination with other input modes. This study introduces multimodal interaction to translation, taking advantage of the unparallelled robustness of commercially available voice-and-touch-enabled multimodal interfaces such as touch-screen computers and tablets. To that end, an experiment was carried out with 14 professional English-to-French translators, who performed a translation task either with the physical prototype of an ITD environment, or with a traditional keyboard-and-mouse environment. The hypothesis was that the prototypical environment would consistently provide translators with a better translator experience (TX) than the traditional environment, considering the translation process as a <b>whole.</b> <b>The</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> TX as introduced in this work is defined as a translator’s perceptions of and responses to the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected using different methods, such as video and screen recording, input logging and semi-structured interviews. The combined analysis of objective and subjective usability measures suggests a better TX with the experimental environment versus the keyboard-and-mouse workstation, but significant challenges still need to be overcome for ITD to be fully integrated into the profession. Thus, this doctoral study provides a basis for better-grounded research in translator-computer interaction and translator-information interaction and, more specifically, for the design and development of an ITD environment, which is expected to support professional translators’ cognitive functions, performance and well-being. Lastly, this research aims to demonstrate that translation studies research, and translation technology in particular, needs to be more considerate of the translator, the TX, and the changing realities of the interaction between humans, computers and information in the twenty-first century...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the intra-national travel behaviour of travelling professional workers (TPWs) and their familiarisation with the host country as their new home. It aims to provide {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between tourism and migration. A conceptual framework is developed to illustrate the context and direction of this study. This research is a case study performed by employing semi-structured, in-depth interviews. A total of 34 interviews were conducted with TPWs in the hospitality and tourism industry in Da Nang and Hoi An (Vietnam). Collected data were coded into prominent themes using an analytical framework developed by the researcher. This thesis found that the intra-national travel behaviour of TPWs is related to their familiarisation with the host country as their new home. In particular, the intra-national travel motivations of TPWs reveal their desire to become familiar with a new home. In relation to intra-national travel patterns, volume of travel, choice of destinations and activities are found to have an impact on TPWs’ familiarisation with a new home. This study also found that intra-national travel experiences help them become familiar with their new home through the establishment of social relationships, by increasing their cultural familiarity, and through enhancing a sense of safety and security, psycho-socio wellbeing and life satisfaction. Moreover, travel companions and the most memorable experiences play a significant role influencing TPWs’ familiarisation with a new home. An underlying concept for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> topic, <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> home, is explored and found to be influenced by a number of factors including physical exposure to the place, social relationships, psycho-socio wellbeing, life satisfaction, safety and security, cultural familiarity, local language skills and employment. In the case of TPWs, the concept of home often carries a temporary meaning rather than a permanent one due to their frequent movements. In addition to intra-national travel, this research found two aspects influencing the way by which TPWs make the host country their new home: ‘employment’ and ‘domestic partnership and family’. Nevertheless, the results of this study suggest that TPWs represent a resident international market and contribute to the development of the local tourism industry. Several recommendations are also made regarding TPWs’ settlement in the host country, and the opportunity for local marketers to capture the TPW market efficiently...|$|R
