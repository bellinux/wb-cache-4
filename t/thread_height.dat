The {{tests were conducted}} over the Mach number range from 2. 8 to 7 at a nominally constant unit Reynolds number of 3 million per inch, and with heat transfer to the model surface. A screwthread type of distributed two-dimensional roughness was used. Nominal <b>thread</b> <b>heights</b> varied from 100 microinches to 2100 microinches. Transition Reynolds number was found to increase with increasing Mach number at a rate depending simultaneously on Mach number and roughness height.

40|$|Introduction : The {{clinical}} {{survival of}} a dental implant {{is directly related}} to its biomechanical behavior. Since short implants present lower bone/implant contact area, their design may be more critical to stress distribution to surrounding tissues. Photoelastic analysis is a biomechanical method that uses either simple qualitative results or complex calculations for the acquisition of quantitative data. In order to simplify data acquisition, we performed a pilot study to demonstrate the investigation of biomechanics via correlation of the findings of colorimetric photoelastic analysis (stress transition areas; STAs) of design details between two types of short dental implants under axial loads. Methods Implants were embedded in a soft photoelastic resin and axially loaded with 10 and 20 N of force. Implant design features were correlated with the STAs (mm 2) of the colored fringes of colorimetric photoelastic analysis. Results Under a 10 N load, the surface area of the implants was directly related to STA, whereas under a 20 N load, the surface area and <b>thread</b> <b>height</b> were inversely related to STA. Conclusion A smaller external <b>thread</b> <b>height</b> seemed to improve the biomechanical performance of the short implants investigated...|$|E

That to the south showed us a perfectly familiar formation; conglomerates of water-rolled pebbles in the lower levels, and hills of the normal dark porphyries, with large quartz-seams of many colours trending in every direction. The mouth of the northern gorge was blocked by a vein of finely crystallized carbonate of lime, containing geodes and bunches. The taste is astringent, probably from the alumina; and it is based upon outcrops of a sandy calcaire apparently fit for hydraulic cement. The only novelty in the vegetation was the Fashak-tree, a creeper like a gigantic constrictor, with sweet yellow wood somewhat resembling liquorice.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A slug of {{the genus}} Belocaulus can lower itself on a mucus <b>thread</b> from the <b>height</b> of almost 3 m, like a spider on a spider thread. KEY WORDS: Belocaulus, Vaginulidae, mucus, {{locomotion}} During ornithological field work in Ecuador the junior author observed a vaginulid slug lowering it-self from a tree branch on a mucus thread, like a spi-der on a spider thread. The slime thread was about 3 m long. The thread’s resistance and its length seemed unusual; producing such a thread must have necessitated a great water expenditure. Some other slugs can hang from a mucus thread, for ex-ample the western-Palaearctic Limacidae, but their threads are at most a few to 20 cm long. They hang from a common thread during courtship dance and copulation. Afterwards they often consume a par...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence implant length on stress distribution at bone implant interface in single immediately loaded implants when placed in D 4 bone quality. Materials and Methods: A 2 -dimensional finite element models were developed to simulate two types of implant designs, standard 3. 75 mm-diameter tapered body implants of 6 and 10 mm lengths. The implants were placed in D 4 bone quality with a cortical bone thickness of 0. 5 mm. The implant design incorporated microthreads at the crestal part {{and the rest of the}} implant body incorporated Acme threads. The Acme thread form has a 29 ° thread angle with a <b>thread</b> <b>height</b> half of the pitch; the apex and valley are flat. A 100 N of force was applied vertically and in the oblique direction (at an angle of 45 °) to the long axis of the implants. The respective material properties were assigned. Micro-movements and stresses at the bone implant interface were evaluated. Results: The results of total deformation (micro-movement) and Von mises stress were found to be lower for tapered long implant (10 mm) than short implant (6 mm) while using both vertical as well as oblique loading. Conclusion: Short implants can be successfully placed in poor bone quality under immediate loading protocol. The novel approach of the combination of microthreads at the crestal portion and acme threads for body portion of implant fixture gave promising results...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of forced-convection heat transfer and associated pressure drops {{was conducted with}} air flowing through electrically heated Inconel tubes having various degrees of square-thread-type roughness, an inside diameter of 1 / 2 inch, and a length of 24 inches. were obtained for tubes having conventional roughness ratios (height of thread/radius of tube) of 0 (smooth tube), 0. 016, 0. 025, and 0. 037 over ranges of bulk Reynolds numbers up to 350, 000, average inside-tube-wall temperatures up to 1950 deg R, and heat-flux densities up to 115, 000 Btu per hour per square foot. Data The experimental data showed that both heat transfer and friction increased with increase in surface roughness, becoming more pronounced with increase in Reynolds number; for a given roughness, both heat transfer and friction were also influenced by the tube wall-to-bulk temperature ratio. Good correlation of the heat-transfer data for all the tubes investigated was obtained by use of a modification of the conventional Nusselt correlation parameters wherein the mass velocity in the Reynolds number {{was replaced by the}} product of air density evaluated at the average film temperature and the so-called friction velocity; in addition, the physical properties of air were evaluated at the average film temperature. The isothermal friction data for the rough tubes, when plotted in the conventional manner, resulted in curves similar to those obtained by other investigators; that is, the curve for a given roughness breaks away from the Blasius line (representing turbulent flow in smooth tubes) at some value of Reynolds number, which decreases with increase in surface roughness, and then becomes a horizontal line (friction coefficient independent of Reynolds number). A comparison of the friction data for the rough tubes used herein indicated that the conventional roughness ratio is not an adequate measure of relative roughness for tubes having a square-thread-type element. The present data, {{as well as those of}} other investigators, were used to isolate the influence of ratios of <b>thread</b> <b>height</b> to width, thread spacing to width, and the conventional roughness ratio on the friction coefficient. A fair correlation of the friction data was obtained for each tube with heat addition when the friction coefficient and Reynolds number were defined on the basis of film properties; however, the data for each tube retained the curve characteristic of that particular roughness. The friction data for all the rough tubes could be represented by a single line for the complete turbulence region by incorporating a roughness parameter in the film correlation. No correlation was obtained for the region of incomplete turbulence...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the profile of}} implants subjected to torsion test. Four types of implants (Conex&# 227;o&# 174;) were analyzed: Master Porous (MP - external hexagon, cylindrical, double-porous surface implants; 11. 5 X 3. 75 mm), Master Screw (MS - external hexagon, cylindrical, machined implants; 11. 5 X 3. 75 mm), Conect Conic (CC - external hexagon, cylindrical, machined implants; 11. 5 X 3. 5 mm) and Master Conect AR (CA - internal hexagon, cylindrical, double-porous surface implants; 11. 5 X 3. 75 mm). The Nikon&# 174; model C profile projector {{was used for the}} analysis before and after torsion test with a Mackena&# 174; model MK- 20 XX digital torque meter. The measures analyzed in the profile of implants were: diameter and height of the platform, diameter of the screw/platform connection, angle of the screw/platform connection, external diameter, internal diameter, <b>thread</b> pitch, <b>height</b> and length of the thread. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Tukey test at 5 % significance level. The torsion test caused a visible deformity on the external implant profile. There was a statistical difference among the implants before and after torsion (p< 0. 05) for the variables: platform diameter, platform height, diameter of the screw/platform connection and length. Changes were observed in platform height of CC and CA, fracture of CA implants, fracture of the MP and MS assembler/connectors, and internal thread stripping of CC. Thus, it was concluded that excessive or some unadvised torque by the manufacturer can lead to changes in different geometric measurements of implants...|$|R
