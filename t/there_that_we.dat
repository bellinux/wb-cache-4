25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s out <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E

It’s rather nice to have it on one record, where you get both things. It’s a cross-fade rather than a cut.” ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] {{was written}} by Scott M. Gimple and {{directed}} by Michelle MacLaren. It features recurring appearances from Lauren Cohan, Scott Wilson, IronE Singleton, Madison Lintz, Emily Kinney, Jane McNeill, James Allen McCune, and Amber Chaney. Following the initial broadcast of the previous installment, [...] "Secrets", writer Robert Kirkman teased the following episode [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already". He stated: [...] "There's {{a lot of big}} stuff out <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will be wrapping up to a certain extent. In the writers' room we were fully aware that we were coming up on this hiatus, so we definitely wrote to it. I {{think people are going to}} be a little shocked." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{attained a}} mixed reception. Critics enjoyed the game's battle system, which deviated from role-playing game tradition. IGN's Craig Harris commented that [...] "unlike most Japanese RPGs Mario & Luigi's turn-based battle involves the player at all times". Despite this novel approach to combat situations, some reviewers {{thought that the}} overall gameplay lacked innovation. GameSpy in particular criticized the game for an apparent lack of originality, commenting that [...] "in terms of gameplay, there isn't much <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> haven't seen in the NES and SNES Mario and Zelda titles." [...] Furthermore, some reviewers were disappointed by a perceived lack of difficulty in the gameplay {{as a result of}} targeting a younger audience. However, Cubed3 welcomed this approach, citing that [...] "any gamer, be them [...] veterans to the genre or complete amateurs, will find the title to be perfectly accessible." [...] Edge and other gaming publications have criticized the controls for being occasionally confusing when considering the usage of jumping, hammers, and other combinations between the two characters.|$|E
500|$|The show, {{entitled}} Keeping Up With the Kardashians, premiered on October 14, 2007. The reality series {{centers around}} {{the members of the}} Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé. Most episodes have very similar structure: the family [...] "show off their privileged lifestyle and maybe get into one or two minor family squabbles before ultimately wrapping things up with a monologue that reinforces the importance of family," [...] as noted by Caroline Siede of Quartz. Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described the reality series as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, [...] "When we first started , we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'". She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network [...] "has never once put anything out <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> haven't approved of or accepted". The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings. Seacrest described the show's success: [...] "At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another [...] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain." ...|$|E

The state is trying to control the Internet and, by extension, our private lives".

"Spin {{currents}} {{are capable}} of carrying far more information than a conventional charge current—which makes them the ideal vehicle for information transport in future applications such as quantum computing," [...] stated first author Suchitra Sebastian. Noted Fisher: [...] "Our research group focuses on new materials with unconventional magnetic and electronic properties. Han Purple was first synthesized over 2,500 years ago, but we have only recently discovered how exotic its magnetic behavior is. It makes you wonder what other materials are out <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> haven't yet even begun to explore." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Smooth Noodle Maps, Devo's last album {{for twenty}} years, was released. It too was a {{critical}} and commercial failure which, along with its two singles [...] "Stuck in a Loop" [...] and [...] "Post Post-Modern Man", hold {{the distinction of being}} Devo's worst-selling efforts; all failed to appear on the U.S. charts. Devo launched a concert tour in support of the album, but poor ticket sales and the bankruptcy and dissolution of Enigma Records, who was responsible for organizing and financing the tour, caused it to be cancelled part way through. They had a falling out and played one final show in March 1991 before breaking up. In an interview with Mark Mothersbaugh from excerpts on their 1996 computer game [...] "Devo Presents Adventures of the Smart Patrol, [...] "Around '88, '89, '90 maybe, we did our last tour in Europe, {{and it was kind of}} at that point, We were watching This Is Spinal Tap on the bus and said, 'Oh my God, that's our life.' And we just said, 'Things have to change.' So we kind of agreed from <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> wouldn't do live shows anymore." [...] Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film The Spirit of '76, except for Bob Mothersbaugh. Two albums of demo recordings from 1974–1977— (1990) and [...] (1991)—were released on Rykodisc, as well as an album of early live recordings, [...]|$|E
