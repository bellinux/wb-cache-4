5|$|The {{second section}} of the Fourteenth Amendment punished, by reduced {{representation}} in the House of Representatives, any states that disenfranchised any male citizens over 21 years of age. By failing to adopt a harsher penalty, this signaled to the states that they still possessed the right to deny ballot access <b>to</b> <b>blacks.</b> Northern states were generally as averse to granting voting rights <b>to</b> <b>blacks</b> as Southern states. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed blacks to vote. In the South, blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through {{the intervention of the}} occupying Union Army. Congress had granted suffrage to the blacks in the territories in 1867 by passing the Territorial Suffrage Act.|$|E
5|$|In late 2000, as {{word spread}} that President-elect George W. Bush {{intended}} to appoint both Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice {{and a third}} unnamed black to the United States Cabinet, Jackson sought to prevent blacks from supporting Bush as Bush planned to reach out <b>to</b> <b>blacks.</b> Jackson partnered with Republican Henry Hyde {{to push for a}} third Chicago airport. Jackson said Hyde was the right wing complement to his own left wing role in pursuing support for the airport. Jackson has withheld support for local Democrats who would not support the airport, such as 1998 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Glenn Poshard.|$|E
5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors {{who are able to}} achieve a standard of living normally denied <b>to</b> <b>blacks.</b> The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the shebeen culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E

5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell <b>to</b> <b>blacks</b> and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Rhodesian Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Garfield Todd, began removing restrictions imposed on native Africans. The civil service opened more positions <b>to</b> <b>blacks,</b> the title for male Africans was changed from 'AM' (African male) to Mr., and diners and restaurants were allowed to be multiracial; Welensky, as Transport Minister, allowed for railway dining cars to be multiracial. However, when it came to liberalising alcohol restrictions on blacks, Welensky argued against doing so, stating that such an action would cause the UFP to lose the next election. After repeated failed attempts to secure Dominion status for the federation, Prime Minister Huggins opted not to stand again for his party's leadership at their September 1956 conference. In October he resigned and Welensky, the second most senior figure in the federal arena, was chosen to replace him. Welensky took office on 1 November.|$|E

25|$|Little {{investment}} in private homes or businesses {{took place in}} the neighborhood between 1911 and the 1990s. However, the unwillingness of landlords elsewhere in the city to rent to black tenants, together with {{a significant increase in the}} black population of New York, meant that rents in Harlem were for many years higher than rents elsewhere in the city, even as the housing stock decayed. In 1920, one-room apartments in central Harlem rented for $40 to whites or $100–$125 <b>to</b> <b>blacks.</b> In the late 1920s, a typical white working-class family in New York paid $6.67 per month per room, while blacks in Harlem paid $9.50 for the same space. The worse the accommodations and more desperate the renter, the higher the rents would be. This pattern persisted through the 1960s; in 1965, CERGE reported that a one-room apartment in Harlem rented for $50–$74, while comparable apartments rented for $30–$49 in white slums. The high rents encouraged some property speculators to engage in block busting, a practice whereby they would acquire a single property on a block and sell or rent it <b>to</b> <b>blacks</b> with great publicity. Other landowners would panic, and the speculators would then buy additional houses relatively cheaply. These houses could then be rented profitably <b>to</b> <b>blacks.</b>|$|E

25|$|Formal {{segregation}} also {{existed in}} the North.

25|$|The racial {{makeup of}} Union-Miles Park changed {{as the local}} Union-Miles Park economy worsened. African Americans had long been {{restricted}} to Cleveland's Central neighborhood by white refusal to sell or rent <b>to</b> <b>blacks,</b> restrictive housing covenants, and low incomes. Few blacks lived outside Central; just 2,300 African Americans (10 {{percent of the total}} neighborhood population) lived in Union-Miles Park in 1960. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, African Americans moved into Cleveland neighborhoods being abandoned by whites—neighborhoods once denied <b>to</b> <b>blacks,</b> but now with plenty of empty housing being sold at steep discounts. Although Cleveland as a whole lost 52 percent of its population from 1960 to 1980, the city's African American population held steady. There were 253,108 African American residents in Cleveland in 1960 (28.9 percent of total population), and 252,481 blacks in Cleveland in 1980 (44 percent of total population)—a loss of just 627 people. As a percentage of population, however, African Americans rose from 28.9 {{percent of the total population}} in 1960 to 44 percent of the total population in 1980.|$|E

25|$|The {{leadership}} of the Communist International, while largely ignorant about the particulars of the situation {{of blacks in the}} United States, did understand the importance of ethnic and other non-class forms of oppression, and pushed the early CP to pay more attention <b>to</b> <b>blacks</b> in the U.S. Before this intervention by the Comintern, the party had largely ignored blacks, and thus was not particularly attractive to black radicals like Briggs. Instead, it was the Bolshevik Revolution that attracted their attention.|$|E

25|$|In {{alliance}} with the American Federation of Labor, the NAACP led the successful fight to prevent the nomination of John Johnston Parker to the Supreme Court, based on his support for denying the vote <b>to</b> <b>blacks</b> and his anti-labor rulings.

The NAACP lost most of the internecine battles with the Communist Party and International Labor Defense over the control of those cases and the legal strategy to be pursued in that case.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic {{strategy}} for the election was twofold; Wade Hampton was to attract moderate voters by appearing as a senior statesman.

Financial enticements were given <b>to</b> <b>blacks</b> who supported the Democrats, and violence was waged on others in order to convince them to join a Democratic club for protection.|$|E
