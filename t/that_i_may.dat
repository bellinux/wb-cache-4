500|$|The Paxton Boys {{then set}} their sights on other Native Americans living within eastern Pennsylvania, {{many of whom}} fled to Philadelphia for protection. Several hundred Paxtonians marched on Philadelphia in January 1764, where the {{presence}} of British troops and Philadelphia militia prevented them from committing more violence. Benjamin Franklin, who had helped organize the local militia, negotiated with the Paxton leaders and brought {{an end to the}} immediate crisis. Franklin published a scathing indictment of the Paxton Boys. [...] "If an Indian injures me," [...] he asked, [...] "does it follow <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> revenge that Injury on all Indians?"

500|$|Despite a {{perceived}} decline in his work's quality, the 1840s {{were the most}} financially successful of Etty's career. His income increased with further opportunities for patronage from a growing industrial class, and with few costs and all his earlier debts cleared, Etty {{was in a position}} to invest money for the first time. By 1841 Etty had around £300 invested, rising to £8500 in 1845 and £17,000 in 1849. He continued to have difficulty forming relationships with any woman other than Betsy Etty, writing in his diary in 1843 that [...] "being in sound Mind and Body I declare it to be my Firm Intention NEVER TO MARRY.

The king... was so far forward that he strake a stroke with his sword, yea and more than four, and fought valiantly and so did his company; and they adventured themselves so forward, that they were there all slain, and the next day they were found in the place about the king, and all their horses tied each to other.|$|E
500|$|In antiquity Sappho's poetry {{was highly}} admired, and several ancient sources refer {{to her as}} the [...] "tenth Muse". [...] The {{earliest}} surviving poem {{to do so is}} a third-century BC epigram by Dioscorides, but poems are preserved in the Greek Anthology by Antipater of Sidon and attributed to Plato on the same theme. [...] She was sometimes referred to as [...] "The Poetess", just as Homer was [...] "The Poet". [...] The scholars of Alexandria included Sappho in the canon of nine lyric poets. [...] According to Aelian, the Athenian lawmaker and poet Solon asked to be taught a song by Sappho [...] "so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> learn it and then die". [...] This story may well be apocryphal, especially as Ammianus Marcellinus tells a similar story about Socrates and a song of Stesichorus, but it is indicative of how highly Sappho's poetry was considered in the ancient world.|$|E

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to England, Heber {{prepared}} for Holy Orders at Oxford, where he found time for literary pursuits, was active in university politics and led a busy social life. He was ordained as deacon {{at the end of}} February 1807 and received full priest's orders from the Bishop of Oxford on 24 May 1807. He was then inducted into the family living, as rector of Hodnet; he was later to describe his role as [...] "a half-way station between a parson and a squire". At first he divided his time between his parish and Oxford, where he continued working for his M.A. degree and fulfilled duties at All Souls. He had not at this time determined his own doctrinal position; writing to Thornton he admitted that he was still searching: [...] "Pray for me, my dear friend, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> have my eyes open to the truth ... and if it please God that I persevere in his ministry I may undertake the charge with a quiet mind and a good conscience". A High churchman by upbringing, Heber was a strong opponent of factional rivalry; he eventually found a place around the midpoint of the Anglican spectrum between the High Church and evangelical wings, with perhaps a slight inclination towards the evangelicals.|$|E
500|$|Ubaldini {{reported}} Molyneux's {{progress in}} manufacturing the globes to the Duke of Milan. He was in attendance when Molyneux presented {{a pair of}} manuscript globes to Elizabeth I at Greenwich in July 1591. Ubaldini noted that [...] "he gave her the globe to let her see at a glance {{how much of the}} world she could control by means of her naval forces". According to Wallis, the printed globes, which at [...] in diameter were then the largest ever made, were published after some delay in late 1592 or early 1593. Sanderson arranged entertainments at his home in Newington Butts to mark the presentation of these globes to the Queen. His son William later reported the Queen's words on accepting the terrestrial globe: [...] "The whole earth, a present for a Prince ..."; and on accepting the celestial globe, she said: [...] "Thou hast presented me with the Heavens also: God guide me, to Govern my part of the one, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> enjoy but a mansion place in this other." [...] Elizabeth I saw globes and armillary spheres as symbols of her empire and spiritual mission on earth. The royal coat of arms contained in Elizabeth I Privy Seal was emblazoned across North America on the terrestrial globe.|$|E

500|$|Besides {{working on}} the Dictionary, Johnson also wrote {{numerous}} essays, sermons, and poems during these nine years. In 1750, he decided to produce a series of essays under the title The Rambler that were to be published every Tuesday and Saturday and sell for twopence each. Explaining the title years later, he told his friend, the painter Joshua Reynolds: [...] "I {{was at a loss}} how to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside, and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title. The Rambler seemed the best that occurred, and I took it." [...] These essays, often on moral and religious topics, tended to be more grave than the title of the series would suggest; his first comments in The Rambler were to ask [...] "that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld from me, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> promote thy glory, and the salvation of myself and others." [...] The popularity of The Rambler took off once the issues were collected in a volume; they were reprinted nine times during Johnson's life. Writer and printer Samuel Richardson, enjoying the essays greatly, questioned the publisher as to who wrote the works; only he and a few of Johnson's friends were told of Johnson's authorship. One friend, the novelist Charlotte Lennox, includes a defence of The Rambler in her novel The Female Quixote (1752). In particular, the character Mr. Glanville says, [...] "you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a Young, a Richardson, or a Johnson. Rail with premeditated Malice at the Rambler; and for the want of Faults, turn even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule." [...] (Book VI, Chapter XI) Later, she claims Johnson as [...] "the greatest Genius in the present Age." ...|$|E

[...] Nut was thought to draw the dead into her star-filled sky, and refresh them with food and wine: [...] "I am Nut, and I have come so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> enfold and protect you from all things evil." ...|$|E
