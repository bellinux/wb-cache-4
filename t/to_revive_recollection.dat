6000|$|The only {{surviving}} depositary of {{the domestic}} history {{of the family in}} past years, was Agnes Lockwood's old nurse. Henry took his first opportunity of trying <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> her personal <b>recollections</b> of the deceased Lord Montbarry. But the nurse had never forgiven the great man of the family for his desertion of Agnes; she flatly refused to consult her memory. 'Even the bare sight of my lord, when I last saw him in London,' said the old woman, 'made my finger-nails itch to set their mark on his face. I was sent on an errand by Miss Agnes; and I met him coming out of his dentist's door--and, thank God, that's the last I ever saw of him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|If I am {{giving the}} reader the {{impression}} that I went to the Campo Santo in my last stop at Genoa, I am deceiving him; I record here the memories of four years ago. I did not revisit the place, but I should {{like to see it}} again, if only <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> my <b>recollections</b> of its unique interest. I did really revisit the Pal-lavicini-Durazzo palace, and there revived the pleasure I had known before in its wonderful Van Dycks. Most wonderful was and will always be the [...] "Boy in White," [...] the little serene princeling, whoever he was, in whom the painter has fixed forever a bewitching mood and moment of childhood. [...] "The Mother with two Children" [...] is very well and self-evidently true to personality and period and position; but, after all, she is nothing beside that [...] "Boy in White," [...] though she and her children are otherwise so wonderful. Now that I speak of her, however, she rather grows upon my recollection as a woman greater than her great world and proudly weary of it.|$|R
