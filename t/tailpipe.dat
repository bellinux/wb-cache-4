5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful <b>tailpipe</b> pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long <b>tailpipe</b> of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, <b>tailpipe</b> and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E
5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated <b>tailpipe,</b> similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single <b>tailpipe</b> meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Aero Engines and Hooker {{had already}} {{been working on a}} project to produce a {{suitable}} VTOL engine; this engine combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of the}} compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central <b>tailpipe.</b> With a suitable engine already being developed, Camm and his team at HSA proceeded to develop the company's first VTOL aircraft, designated as the Hawker Siddeley P.1127. The P.1127 was envisioned as a subsonic VTOL-capable strike aircraft, while also serving to demonstrate and prove the capabilities of the aircraft's basic configuration and to validate the performance of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine that powered it.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, {{jet engine}} {{engineer}} Stanley Hooker of the Bristol Engine Company informed aeronautics engineer Sydney Camm of Hawker Aircraft that Bristol {{had been working}} a project that combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of}} the compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central <b>tailpipe.</b> The original concept upon which the engine, which had been named Pegasus, was based came from Michel Wibault, a French aviation consultant. Several adaptions and enhancements were made by Bristol to reduce size and weight over Wibault's original concept.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{subsidiaries}} of Magneti Marelli, Delphi and Bosch {{have developed}} and announced the introduction in 2009 {{of a new}} flex engine generation that {{eliminates the need for}} the secondary gasoline tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing flex vehicles to do a normal cold start at temperatures as low as, the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. Another improvement is the reduction of fuel consumption and <b>tailpipe</b> emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start. The Flex Start system used by the Polo was developed by Bosch.|$|E
5|$|While {{operating}} in all-electric mode the Volt produces no <b>tailpipe</b> emissions. In this mode {{there is an}} absence of harmful chemical emissions that can negatively impact air quality, allowing for a continuous clean air benefit. There is also a lack of carbon dioxide emissions. However, this benefit is mostly local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, these emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle. When the Volt's battery is depleted and the gasoline-powered engine engages, the plug-in emissions are similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles. The amount of total local emissions depends on how much the Volt is driven in all-electric mode and how much in charge-sustaining mode.|$|E

25|$|The long <b>tailpipe</b> {{has been}} the target of criticism, ranging from claims that many {{estimates}} are methodologically flawed to estimates that state that electricity generation in the United States will become less carbon-intensive over time.

25|$|<b>Tailpipe</b> {{emissions}} of CO2 also decrease {{due to the}} lower carbon-to-hydrogen ratio of these alcohols, and the improved engine efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The long <b>tailpipe</b> is an {{argument}} stating that usage of electric vehicles does not result in fewer emissions (e.g. greenhouse gases) compared to those from non-electric vehicles. While the argument acknowledges that plug-in electric vehicles operating in all-electric mode have no greenhouse gas emissions from the onboard source of power, it claims that these emissions are shifted from the vehicle <b>tailpipe</b> {{to the location of}} the electrical generation plants. From {{the point of view of}} a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the actual carbon footprint depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation.|$|E
