He was sent to Warwick Farm, <b>then</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western {{outskirts}} of Sydney, for training. A non-conformist known for being forthright, Fingleton did not enjoy military discipline. In May 1942, he went AWOL from his post at Double Bay {{on the shores of}} Sydney Harbour to visit his wife. As a result, he was missing when a Japanese midget submarine launched an attack in the harbour. Soon after, he was deployed to Townsville in northern Queensland in anticipation of a Japanese land invasion, which never materialised. He was then transferred to the Press Relations unit. There he did work in intelligence analysis and censorship.|$|E
5|$|Although Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown had a storyline rivalry that dated {{back to when}} Doink {{turned on}} Lawler by dumping {{a bucket of water}} on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been {{mentioned}} since <b>then.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> September 10, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced many more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only <b>then</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E

Also, in some installations local weather conditions were periodically broadcast in voice over the range frequency, preempting the navigational signals, but eventually this was done on the central fifth tower.|$|E
