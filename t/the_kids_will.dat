500|$|The film premiered at the Lido Theater, a cinema in Newport Beach, California. It was {{released}} in the United States in June 1941. Up till at least January 1942, screenings of the film were still available at cinemas. It was re-screened in September 1957 at the Apollo Theatre. It received mixed reviews from contemporary film critics. A reviewer for Variety wrote, [...] "Saddled with sophomoric episodes and dialog, The Medico of Painted Springs will find a groove for Saturday matinees, where <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> stand for anything as long as it's western." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for DVD Talk, Paul Mavis [...] "highly recommended" [...] the Volume 1 season set, saying [...] " [...] is another winner from Nickelodeon DVD, and a must-have {{for parents who}} can't {{get enough of the}} braying little yellow sponge. Oh yeah; <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> {{probably}} like it, too." [...] Mavis also praised the voice actors who contributed on the show, and wrote [...] "As funny as the stories are, and in this collection, there are some real gems, I can't stress enough the importance of those voice talents in conveying the unhinged, manic quality that is so integral to the success of SpongeBob SquarePants. In a separate review for the Volume 2 DVD, Mavis only [...] "recommended" [...] the set and wrote [...] "SpongeBob may, and I repeat, 'may,' be starting to level off." [...] He particularly criticized the later entries as [...] "indication of that potential trend." ...|$|E
500|$|Cagney starred as Rocky Sullivan, {{a gangster}} {{fresh out of}} jail and looking for his former associate, played by Humphrey Bogart, who owes him money. While revisiting his old haunts, he runs into his old friend Jerry Connolly, played by O'Brien, {{who is now a}} priest {{concerned}} about the Dead End Kids' futures, particularly as they idolize Rocky. After a messy shootout, Sullivan is eventually captured by the police and sentenced to death in the electric chair. Connolly pleads with Rocky to [...] "turn yellow" [...] {{on his way to the}} chair so <b>the</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>will</b> lose their admiration for him, and hopefully avoid turning to crime. Sullivan refuses, but on his way to his execution, he breaks down and begs for his life. It is unclear whether this cowardice is real or just feigned for the Kids' benefit. Cagney himself refused to say, insisting he liked the ambiguity. The film is regarded by many as one of Cagney's finest, and garnered him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for 1938. He lost to Spencer Tracy in Boys Town. Cagney had been considered for the role, but lost out on it due to his typecasting. (He also lost the role of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne in Knute Rockne, All American to his friend Pat O'Brien for the same reason.) Cagney did, however, win that year's New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.|$|E

500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "The characters are irresistible, the animation is astonishing and the film, a fantasy {{version of a}} foodie rhapsody, sustains a level of joyous invention that hasn't been seen in family entertainment since The Incredibles." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, saying [...] "Brad Bird's Ratatouille is so audacious you have {{to fall in love with}} its unlikely hero." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille is delicious fun sure to be savored by audiences of all ages for its sumptuous visuals, clever wit and irresistibly inspiring tale." [...] Miriam Di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille will make you wonder why animation needs to hide behind the mantle of 'it's for children, but grownups will like it, too.' This one's for Mom and Dad, and yep, <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> like it, too." [...] Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Writer and director Brad Bird keeps Ratatouille moving without resorting to the cute animal jokes or pop-culture wisecracking that ruined so many other recent animated films." [...] Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film an A, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the technical genius, emotional core and storytelling audacity to lift it into the ranks of [...] Pixar films, the crème de la crème of modern animation." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "No sketchy backgrounds here – Ratatouilles scenes feels like deep-focus camera shots. The textures, from the gleam of copper pans to the cobblestone streets, are almost palpable." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille doesn't center on the over-familiar surfaces of contemporary life. It harks back to Disney's older era, when cartoons seemed part of a more elegant world with less edgy characters." ...|$|E

Thirty years from now, <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> be getting ready for Super Bowl LXI, and NFL Films will drag out Steve Sabol — he'll be around 102 then — and he'll talk about how Brett Favre fought through such adversity.

2500|$|Ed Sheeran {{has spoken}} about his support her Sandé and her music, {{saying that she}} has {{spent a lot of}} time on the record and that it could be as big as Adele's second album, 21, which has sold over 27 million records worldwide. Sandé {{revealed}} that she wanted to bring poetry back into music, as it has been lost. The songs which are currently being released are for the [...] "moment" [...] as they make us feel good and we can dance to them, Sandé said. She said that Our Version of Events will see poetry lyrics, as she intends to bring them back into fashion. She said; Great songwriters come along quite rarely, but when I listen to Tracy Chapman or Joni Mitchell, these are people who pay attention to the lyric and are precise about it. I feel that has been put second to having a cool producer or whether <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> like it. She said that the music industry is hard to get into, but once you are in, it is very loyal. In the recording studio, Syco Music heard some of Sandé's songs which they wanted, but she refused and told them she wanted to keep them for her own album. They later asked her to write for some of their artists, and Leona Lewis went into the studio with her and Naughty Boy to record for a couple of weeks, and she said that her and Lewis had a lot in common. She also said that Lewis has a phenomenal voice and she was lovely.|$|E
