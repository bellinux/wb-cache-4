40|$|Background: Various {{strategies}} such {{as teaching}} self care to hemodialysis patients have been employed to increase {{the level of their}} hope. This study aimed at examining the effects of a <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> program on the level of hope in a self care education program. Methods: In this single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial, 75 hemodialysis patients, selected by convenient sampling, were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n= 25 each) including a control, a self care education, or a self care education with <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up.</b> The control group received the routine care. The self care education group received 5 instruction sessions. The <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> group had similar instructional sessions followed by telephone calls during the subsequent 2 months. Data, collected using demographic information list and Miller’s hope questionnaire, were analyzed using Chi-Square, t-test, and one-way ANOVA followed by Scheffee test. Results: There was no significant difference among the scores of hope in the three groups before the intervention (P= 0. 40). However, after the intervention, the level of hope in the self care education group and self care education plus <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> groups were significantly higher than that of the control group (P= 0. 001). Moreover, the level of hope in the group with self care education plus <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> was significantly (P= 0. 001) more than that of the self care education group.

40|$|With the {{evolution}} of cancer care and chemotherapy agents over the last 15 {{years there has been}} an evident shift in care from the inpatient to the ambulatory setting. There is a growing need for cancer care, particularly in the ambulatory (outpatient) setting. Patients receiving chemotherapy in the outpatient setting return home immediately after completing treatment and do not have direct medical and nursing supervision to monitor for and address side effects or adverse reactions of treatment in a hospital inpatient setting. Nurse <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> post initial chemotherapy allows for assessment and timely management of potential side effects experienced after the administration of chemotherapy in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to develop a standardized nurse <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> procedure post initial chemotherapy. The author developed an electronic script guideline and documentation tool along with a process for conducting the nurse-initiated calls. The project design included an educational activity and a post evaluation of the <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> procedure. Fifteen biotherapy/chemotherapy nurses participated in a four week pilot. During the four week pilot period 14 out of 34 first time chemotherapy patients received <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> utilizing the script guidelines. Ten nurses (N= 10, 67 %) completed the post evaluation survey. Results indicated that overall the script guidelines for <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> post initial chemotherapy was well received by staff and utilized appropriately.

40|$|Background: This was an {{economic}} evaluation of hospital versus <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> by specialist nurses after treatment for breast cancer. Methods: A cost minimization analysis {{was carried out}} from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective using data from a trial in which 374 women were randomized to telephone or hospital follow-up. Primary analysis compared NHS resource use for routine follow-up over a mean of 24 months. Secondary analyses included patient and carer travel and productivity costs, and NHS and personal social services costs of care in patients with recurrent breast cancer. Results: Patients who had <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> had approximately 20 per cent more consultations (634 versus 524). The longer duration of telephone consultations and the frequent use of junior medical staff in hospital clinics resulted in higher routine costs for <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> (mean difference £ 55 (bias-corrected 95 per cent confidence interval (b. c. i.) £ 29 to £ 77)).

40|$|Background: Access to {{effective}} smoking cessation programs {{is crucial to}} reducing smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Several studies have shown promising results {{for the application of}} Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in managing psychological or behavioral health problems. However, to date, only one study has examined the feasibility of a telephone-based ACT for smoking cessation and it was conducted among a Western population, in the United States. This study reports a protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the feasibility and potential efficacy of an individual, telephone-delivered ACT for smoking cessation in primary healthcare settings among a Chinese population. Methods: A randomized, two-group design was chosen, with assessment at baseline (before intervention) and via <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-ups</b> at three and six months. Subjects will be proactively recruited from primary healthcare centers. Eligible participants will be randomized to either the intervention (ACT) or control group following the baseline assessment. Both groups will receive self-help materials on smoking cessation. Those in the ACT group will undergo an initial face-to-face session and two telephone ACT sessions at one week and one month following the first session, to be delivered by a counselor based on the treatment protocol. All of the participants will be contacted by <b>telephone</b> for <b>follow-up</b> assessments at three and six months. Treatment fidelity will be assessed by reviewing around one-fifth of audio-recorded telephone calls. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this protocol describes the first RCT of a telephone-based ACT for smoking cessation. It is also the first RCT of ACT for smoking cessation on a Chinese population. The study will provide us with information about the feasibility of a telephone-delivered ACT within a Chinese sample. If effective, this trial will support the development of ACT treatment protocols that could be made available for use by a greater range of clinicians, and offer an evidence base to support alternative treatments for smoking cessation.

We explored the potential benefits of nurse-led <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> for colorectal cancer patients. Method:  Sixty-five patients were randomised to either telephone or hospital follow-up in an exploratory randomised trial. Results:  The telephone intervention was deliverable in clinical practice and acceptable to patients and health professionals. Seventy-five percent of eligible patients agreed to randomization. High levels of satisfaction were evident in both study groups. Appointments in the hospital group were shorter (median 14. 0 minutes) than appointments in the telephone group (median 28. 9 minutes).

Methods This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using The Cochrane Library, including the Cochrane central register of controlled trials; MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINHAL, together with citation searching. The included studies were randomized controlled trials examining the effect of a <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> intervention on glycaemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. All the included trials were subject to critical appraisal. Data were extracted on study design, characteristics of patients, exact nature of the telephone intervention and details of comparison.

Formalized CPD is, therefore, essential in order to stay current in a dynamic work environment. The majority of radiographers in Kenya work in remote rural health facilities where CPD activities are limited. The question thus arose: “To what extent are radiographers participating in CPD activities and what constitute barriers to participation?” Objective: The aim {{of this article is to}} describe the challenges which affect diagnostic radiographers’ participation in CPD activities in Kenya. Methods: The study targeted radiographers who were registered with the Society of Radiographers in Kenya (SORK). Two hundred and fifty prospective participants were recruited from the SORK data base, using the fish bowl sampling method. Questionnaires with self-addressed stamped envelopes were posted by ordinary mail to facilitate ease of return, while <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-ups</b> improved the response rate. Results: The study revealed that 69 % of diagnostic radiographers in Kenya were effectively participating in CPD activities.

Background:  A recent randomised controlled trial demonstrated that nurse-led <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> led {{to high levels of}} patient satisfaction with no physical or psychological detriment. This study aimed to explore in more detail {{the views of}} patients randomised to <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> and the nurses who conducted telephone appointments. Design:  Qualitative. Method:  Individual interviews with 28 patients and four specialist breast care nurses. Content analysis was used to analyse the interview data. Results:  <b>Telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> was convenient for patients and provided continuity of care. Speaking on the telephone was perceived as a more ‘normal’ activity than attending hospital outpatient clinics. A structured approach was appreciated, instilling feelings of confidence that all questions had been asked and no errors had been made. Specialist nurses emphasised the high level of skill required to deliver the intervention and perceived that the telephone approach was well able to meet the individual needs of patients. Conclusions:  Positive views on <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> were reported. An experienced and skilled practitioner, with effective communication skills, is required to deliver the intervention and a period of training is recommended. Nurse-led telephone interventions have a broader applicability to other disease conditions, although more work is needed to develop appropriate interventions and evaluate their effectiveness. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses at advanced levels of practice are uniquely placed to deliver such complex interventions. However, a period of initial training with effective peer support and channels for ongoing feedback are essential for administering an intervention that relies on audio rather than visual cues...|$|E

Methods: Patients were recruited at the emergency room of a trauma hospital and screened for alcohol by a qualitative saliva test (positive from a blood alcohol concen-tration of 0. 02 g/l). Positive patients (13. 3 %) who accepted entering the study were randomly allocated into BI and MI. Baseline assess-ment was the same for all patients. Blind <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-ups</b> were performed at months 3, 6, and 12, and results were analysed by protocol and by intention-to-treat analysis. Results: After 1 year of follow-up, 67 % of the patients had reduced their consumption, the percentage of heavy drinkers had dropped by 47 %, and 62 % of baseline AUDIT-C positive patients (hazardous drinkers) had become negative. Binge drinking dropped significantly (P < 0. 05). Results at month 12 were in line with the previous ones. Conclusions: The effectiveness of BI compared with MI has not been verified, but a significant reduction in consumption has been observed in the whole sample, without significant differences by type of intervention. The persistence and dimension of changes suggest a real effect of both interventions, although the lack of a pure control group does not allow definitive conclusions.

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{frequent}} follow-up {{after treatment}} {{for breast cancer}} does not meet its intended aims, but does depend on expensive and scarce specialized knowledge for routine history taking and physical examinations. The study described in this paper compared patient satisfaction with a reduced follow-up strategy, i. e. nurse-led <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up,</b> to satisfaction with traditional hospital follow-up. Methods Patient satisfaction was assessed among patients (n = 299) who were participants of a randomized controlled trial investigating the cost-effectiveness of several follow-up strategies {{in the first year}} after treatment for breast cancer. Data on patient satisfaction were collected at baseline, three, six and 12 months after treatment, using the Dutch version of Ware's Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire III (PSQ III). In addition to general satisfaction, the PSQ III reports on satisfaction scores for technical competence, interpersonal aspects, and access of care. Regression analysis was used to predict satisfaction scores from whether or not nurse-led <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> was received. Results Nurse-led <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> had no statistically significant influence on general patient satisfaction (p = 0. 379), satisfaction with technical competence (p = 0. 249), and satisfaction with interpersonal aspects (p = 0. 662). Regarding access of care, patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher for patients receiving <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> (p = 0. 015). However, a mean difference at 12 months of 3. 1 points was judged to be not clinically relevant. Conclusions No meaningful differences were found in satisfaction scores between nurse-led telephone and hospital follow-up in the first year after breast cancer treatment. With high satisfaction scores and the potential to substantially reduce clinic visits, nurse-led <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> may be an acceptable alternative to traditional hospital follow-up.

Background. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a worldwide health problem and has been labelled a burdensome disease. Because of the fear of activity-induced dyspnoea, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lack the confidence to perform daily activities. Studies of cardiac and diabetic patients have shown that <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> care is an effective approach to increasing self-efficacy. However, little such research has been done with patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods. This was a randomized controlled study. A total of 60 participants (30 <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up,</b> 30 control) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were recruited from an acute care hospital in Hong Kong. The Chinese Self-Efficacy Scale was used to assess self-efficacy. Measures of health care use were numbers of visits to an accident and emergency department, hospitalizations, and unscheduled visits by physicians. Findings. The self-efficacy scores (U = 272. 5, P = 0. 009) of patients who were followed up by telephone improved significantly compared with those of patients in the control group. Multiple regression analyses showed that <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> (Beta = 0. 33, CI: 0. 19 - 0. 48, P = 0. 001), the pulmonary rehabilitation programme (Beta = 0. 44, CI: 0. 16 - 0. 72, P = 0. 003), smoking (Beta = 0. 34, CI: 0. 09 - 0. 57, P = 0. 009), and health care use (Beta = - 0. 27, CI: - 0. 47 -(- 0. 07), P = 0. 008) were significant factors in predicting patient self-efficacy. Conclusions. Nurse-initiated <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> care was effective in increasing self-efficacy in managing dyspnoea. The study needs to be replicated in other setting to strengthen its external validity. School of Nursin...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> {{interviewing}} is {{one method}} of monitoring treatment outcomes of individuals involved in {{drug and alcohol}} treatment programs. The present study {{is the first to}} examine the feasibility and generalizability of data obtained from <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> interviews after drug and alcohol treatment in Australia. Methods: Participants attended 1 of 8 Salvation Army Recovery Service Centres where staff administered outcome measures at intake. Three-month postdischarge <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-up</b> interviews were conducted by researchers from the Illawarra Institute for Mental Health, University of Wollongong. Results: A sample of 700 clients was obtained for follow-up (582 males; 118 females). A 51 % follow-up rate was achieved at a cost of US$ 82 per completed interview. No significant differences in baseline characteristics between responding and nonresponding participants were found. Conclusions: Overall, the telephone methodology was shown to be feasible and relatively inexpensive. However, the introduction of outcome measures at the service level in parallel with follow-up data collection procedures complicated the collection of response data. The burden of introducing outcome measures in residential services may be reduced by utilizing a phased implementation strategy...|$|E

However, few have examined changes in potential mediators of change preceding behavioral changes, resulting in a lack of information concerning how the intervention worked. Our purpose was to examine mediation effects of changes in psychosocial variables on changes in physical activity in type 2 diabetes patients. Methods Ninety-two patients (62 ± 9 years, 30, 0 ± 2. 5 kg/m 2, 69 % males) participated in a randomized controlled trial. The 24 -week intervention was based on social-cognitive constructs and consisted of a face-to-face session, <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-ups,</b> {{and the use of}} a pedometer. Social-cognitive variables and physical activity (device-based and self-reported) were collected at baseline, after the 24 -week intervention and at one year post-baseline. PA was measured by pedometer, accelerometer and questionnaire. Results Post-intervention physical activity changes were mediated by coping with relapse, changes in social norm, and social modeling from family members (p ≤ 0. 05). One-year physical activity changes were mediated by coping with relapse, changes in social support from family and self-efficacy towards physical activity barriers (p ≤ 0. 05) Conclusions For patients with type 2 diabetes, initiatives to increase their physical activity could usefully focus on strategies for resuming regular patterns of activity, on engaging family social support and on building confidence about dealing with actual and perceived barriers to activity.

40|$|Aim Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} lifestyle and risk factor deterioration following completion of a cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP). We report {{the results of a}} one-year Extensive Lifestyle Management Intervention (ELMI) aimed at preventing these adverse changes. Methods and results A total of 302 men and women with ischaemic heart disease were recruited following completion of a CRP and randomized to either the ELMI (consisting of exercise sessions, <b>telephone</b> <b>follow-ups</b> and risk factor and lifestyle counselling) or usual care. The primary outcome was global cardiovascular risk using the Framingham and Procam risk scores. Secondary outcomes included risk factors and lifestyle behaviours. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Adherence to the ELMI was high. There was a non-significant trend in favour of the ELMI between for both the Framingham (6. 6 ± 3. 1 to 6. 2 ± 2. 9 vs 6. 6 ± 3. 2 to 6. 7 ± 3. 2, P= 0. 138) and Procam (20. 0 ± 20. 0 to 20. 6 ± 19. 5 vs 19. 1 ± 18. 7 to 21. 8 ± 19. 1, P= 0. 089) scores. There were no differences in secondary outcomes. Conclusions A one-year multi-factorial post-CRP intervention results in modest, non-significant benefits to global risk compared to usual care. The absence of deterioration in the usual care group may be due to improved practices in usual care. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The European Society of Cardiology...|$|R
