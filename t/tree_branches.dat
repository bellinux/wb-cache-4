5|$|Cicadas {{sometimes}} {{cause damage}} to amenity shrubs and trees, {{mainly in the}} form of scarring left on <b>tree</b> <b>branches</b> where the females laid their eggs. Branches of young trees may die as a result.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they reach}} {{adulthood}} most adult cicada species live for around another {{two to four}} weeks. During this time they feed on flowing sap from <b>tree</b> <b>branches,</b> and mating and egg laying occurs.|$|E

5000|$|Brachiators are {{a type of}} primate {{mostly from}} the family Hylobatidae, which {{includes}} gibbons. Brachiators use their arms to move from <b>tree</b> <b>branch</b> to <b>tree</b> <b>branch,</b> through a process called brachiation. Their arms are longer than their legs, and are much more powerful.|$|R

5|$|The {{fruits of}} Schlumbergera do not open spontaneously when ripe, {{and appear to}} be adapted for {{distribution}} by birds, which eat the seeds and pulp contained in the fruit. Birds have been observed removing seeds which had stuck to their beaks by rubbing them on <b>tree</b> <b>branches,</b> where the seeds {{might be able to}} germinate. Segments may also break off from the stems and take root, thus enabling plants to propagate vegetatively.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} is {{specialized}} as a bamboo feeder with strong, curved and sharp semi-retractile claws standing inward for grasping narrow <b>tree</b> <b>branches,</b> leaves, and fruit. Like the giant panda, {{it has a}} “false thumb” which {{is an extension of}} the wrist bone. When descending a tree head-first, the red panda rotates its ankle to control its descent, one of the few climbing species to do so.|$|E
5|$|Along the coast, large waves damaged 15 to 20boats in Falmouth, Maine harbor. Total boat {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at $250,000. Coastal residents in low-lying beach areas of Cumberland and York counties were evacuated in Maine. Several counties lost power during the storm. In Southwest Harbor, lightning struck the Dirigo Hotel, causing a fire that resulted in $100,000 in damages. Winds caused a lost of telephone and electrical services in the Auburn-Lewiston area due to falling trees or <b>tree</b> <b>branches.</b> Television antennas were damaged, as were several signs, including a Sears sign. In addition, 25% to 40% of the apple crop was destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high <b>tree</b> <b>branches.</b> According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in {{the northern}} offshore islands and {{in the northern}} portion of the mainland. On the offshore islands, downed trees and power lines blocked most roads. In Caye Caulker and San Pedro, Keith damaged the roofs of about 90% of houses and damaged or destroyed 676 houses, leaving 3,279 people homeless. About 50% of the houses in Caye Caulker were destroyed, with reports of only five dwellings still standing after the storm. In San Pedro, about 30% of houses, or at least 50, were wrecked. On Ambergris Caye, four airplanes were destroyed. At Turneffe Atoll, about 35% of the landmass was affected, with many trees in that section uprooted and numerous <b>tree</b> <b>branches</b> snapped.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} caused {{flooding in}} the state of Veracruz. Thousands of people were forced from their homes as rivers rose, including upwards of 30,000fleeing for shelter after the Tuxpan River exceeded its bank. About 8,000residents of the city of Álamo were rendered homeless. Flooding in Poza Rica forced the rescue of dozens of people from their cars and homes. Several homes in the city were swept away, while debris such as <b>tree</b> <b>branches</b> and trash blocked water runoff. Water, mudslides, and rocks blocked numerous roads in the area. In combination with Hurricane Kristy in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 50,000people were left homeless in Mexico. At least 20fatalities were attributed to Debby.|$|E

5|$|High surf also {{occurred}} {{along the southern}} coast of Massachusetts, prompting {{the closing of the}} ferry between Nantucket and Boston. Beryl produced a storm surge of 0.9feet (.27m) on Nantucket. Winds across southeastern Massachusetts were fairly light, with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44mph (71km/h); unofficially gusts reached 51mph (82km/h). Beryl dropped moderate precipitation just offshore, though the maximum precipitation total in the United States was only 0.97inches (24.6mm) on Nantucket. Rainfall along southeastern Massachusetts reached 0.33inches (8.38mm) at Chatham. The only reported damage were some downed telephone poles and fallen <b>tree</b> <b>branches.</b> Overall impact was minor; there were no reported power outages, deaths, injuries, or maritime emergencies in association with the storm.|$|E
5|$|Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication. This {{involves}} smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on <b>tree</b> <b>branches,</b> along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm calls are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained {{by the lack of}} light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their territory.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low <b>tree</b> <b>branches.</b> Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Mulder {{discovers that}} Karin's father was {{pulled from the}} mud of an orchard twenty years earlier. Ramirez tells him that the death brought about an end of a blight {{affecting}} the trees. Later, Mulder digs up Mr. Matthews' casket and finds it filled with roots, his body missing. When Lisa's aunt, Linda, arrives at Karin's house to retrieve her niece, she is attacked and killed by an unseen force as <b>tree</b> <b>branches</b> sway in the wind above her. Karin enters the root cellar, and is revealed {{to be the source}} of the male voice Lisa heard earlier, due to her having Dissociative personality disorder brought on by abuse from her own father.|$|E
5|$|Along Long Island, {{the high}} storm surge flooded {{hundreds}} of streets and caused heavy beach erosion. High winds downed thousands {{of trees and}} damaged hundreds of homes, causing widespread power outages. About 1.5 {{million people in the}} state lost power, including two-thirds of the Long Island Lighting Company customers, {{making it one of the}} worst power outages in the state. There were four deaths on Long Island, two of whom related to heart attacks and the other two related to fallen trees. There were also 14 injuries in the region, many of them due to downed <b>tree</b> <b>branches.</b> In the New York mainland, heavy rainfall flooded rivers and alleviated drought conditions. Rough waves damaged boats and docks along the Hudson River. Unsettled weather contributed to a traffic fatality and an airplane crash that killed one in the New York mainland.|$|E
5|$|During Byzantine rule, {{the first}} hermitage in Palestine was {{established}} by the early Christian monk Hilarion {{at the site of}} modern-day Deir al-Balah. Hilarion initially built a small hut there, but during the reign of Constantius II (337–361) he set up the hermitage. Towards the end of his life, the monastery grew and began to attract numerous visitors. Hilarion resided at the monastery for a total of 22 years until his departure for Cyprus where he died in 371 AD. The hermitage was divided into several small cells constructed of mud brick and palm <b>tree</b> <b>branches.</b> According to local tradition and observations from Western travelers in the 19th century, the prayer hall of the Monastery of Hilarion is currently occupied by the Mosque of al-Khidr. French explorer Victor Guérin noted that two marble columns in the mosque were possibly parts of the Byzantine-era monastery.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on <b>tree</b> <b>branches</b> and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|Power workers {{immediately}} began repairing the power failures by clearing <b>tree</b> <b>branches</b> and replacing fuses and circuit breakers. Peco energy restored power to 72% {{of the affected}} customers by {{two days after the}} storm, with 85% restored by two nights. By two days after the storm, Pennsylvania Power and Light restored power to about 80% of its impacted customers, with about 93% restored by two nights after the storm. By five days after Isabel, most power outages in southeastern Pennsylvania were repaired, with all outages restored by a week after the hurricane. Allegheny Power restored power to about 20% of its customers by two days after the storm. Most power outages for the company were restored by five days after the hurricane, with all power completely restored by a week after Isabel.|$|E
5|$|Red {{follows a}} {{familiar}} scent and is reunited with her sister, {{a single mother}} with three chicks. The two hunt together and bring food back to the nest for the young. A white pterosaur, one Red has seen since she hatched, helps the two by finding carrion and prey {{in exchange for a}} helping of meat. On one hunting expedition, when the two adult Utahraptor are stalking a herd of Iguanodon, Red spies a young male Utahraptor that is watching their prey. He begins a courtship dance for Red, but Red's sister chases him off, hissing. Her growls agitate the Iguanodon, who stampede; the male hastily leaves. After climbing into a tree to escape a flash flood, Red encounters the male raptor again, who performs a courtship dance while hanging onto the <b>tree</b> <b>branches.</b> Red's sister begrudgingly allows the male to stay with them, provided he steers clear of her chicks.|$|E

5000|$|A branch ( [...] or , [...] ) or <b>tree</b> <b>branch</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to in botany as a ramus) is a woody structural member connected to but {{not part of the}} central trunk of a tree (or sometimes a shrub). Large branches are known as boughs and small branches are known as twigs. Due to a broad range of species of <b>trees,</b> <b>branches</b> and twigs can be seen in many different shapes and sizes.|$|R
