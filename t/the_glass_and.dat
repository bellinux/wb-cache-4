5|$|The pouring {{process has}} an {{influence}} on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel, tilt of <b>the</b> <b>glass,</b> <b>and</b> position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of carbonation.|$|E
5|$|Decorative {{arts for}} luxury {{consumers}} included fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels and implements, and glassware. The {{manufacture of pottery}} {{in a wide range}} of quality was important to trade and employment, as were <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production. Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss pottery (terra sigillata) that was a major item of trade in 1st-century Europe. Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass.|$|E
5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E

5|$|Mulder, still {{restrained}} {{in his bed}} at the hospital, {{sees the}} silhouette of the monster at the window. He screams for the nurse, but she has already been bitten and opens the window to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open window, breaking <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape <b>the</b> <b>glass,</b> <b>and</b> to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> hands it to Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she {{had been told that}} her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-nine {{elements}} {{were determined by}} instrumental neutron activation analysis in two impact <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> four basalts from Lonar Crater, India, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> underlying core basalt samples {{are found to be}} very similar in major, minor, and trace element abundances. This finding seems to indicate that impact-induced chemical fractionation during formation of <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> from basalt is minimal for many of the principal rock and mineral-forming elements. Since most volatile trace {{elements were}} not determined in this study, differences in the volatile trace element contents of <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> basalts can not be excluded...|$|R
5|$|When {{the gunmen}} {{stop at a}} restaurant, Lou phones the police. They arrive and {{exchange}} gunfire. One suspect is killed while the other manages to escape in his SUV. The police give chase with Lou and Rick tailing and recording. After the gunman's SUV crashes, Lou urges Rick to film the gunman, claiming he is dead. The wounded gunman shoots Rick through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> tries to escape but is shot by police. As Rick lies dying, Lou films him and tells him that he cannot work with someone who has leverage over him. Nina is awed by the chase footage and expresses her devotion to Lou. The news team discovers that the home invasion was actually a drug deal gone wrong; Nina refuses to report this information to maximize the story's impact. Police try to confiscate the footage for evidence but Nina defends her right to withhold it. Interrogated by Frontieri, Lou fabricates {{a story about the}} men in the SUV following him; Frontieri suspects he is lying, but cannot prove it. Lou hires a team of interns and buys new vans to expand his business.|$|E
25|$|If a body {{electrified}} in {{any manner}} whatsoever behaves as the glass does, that is, if it repels <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> attracts the resin, the body {{is said to be}} vitreously electrified, and if it attracts <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> repels the resin it is said to be resinously electrified. All electrified bodies are either vitreously or resinously electrified.|$|E
25|$|Masks tend to fog when warm humid {{exhaled air}} {{condenses}} {{on the cold}} inside of the faceplate. To prevent fogging many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around the inside of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> rinse {{it out with a}} little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> form a continuous film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes.|$|E

25|$|The {{design for}} the new library went through several iterations. At one point, amidst budget constraints, model was {{proposed}} that scrapped much of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> proposed a structure similar to the old version. This was driven by the discovery that Metro has both a tunnel and a large vent under and abutting the library site, making it more expensive to do construction there.|$|E
25|$|The glass {{industry}} provides another significant application for sodium sulfate, as second largest application in Europe.
