5|$|As {{a sitting}} president, Reagan {{did not have}} the highest {{approval}} ratings, but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of post–World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by British newspaper <b>The</b> <b>Times.</b> <b>In</b> a Siena College survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42. While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president. The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Back in London, the Claimant {{employed}} a solicitor, John Holmes, {{who agreed to}} go with him to Paris to meet Lady Tichborne. This meeting took place on 11 January at the Hôtel de Lille. As soon as she saw his face, Lady Tichborne accepted him. At Holmes's behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that the Claimant was her son. She was unmoved when Father Châtillon, Roger's childhood tutor, declared the Claimant an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> <b>in</b> London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of £1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.|$|E
5|$|Cardigan Welsh Corgis {{continued}} to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in the war year of 1940. Both breeds survived the Second World War, although the Cardigans registered with the Kennel Club numbered only 61 {{by the end of}} the war. Pembrokes became very popular during the post war years in the United Kingdom; in 1953 it was ranked as the fourth most popular breed by the Kennel Club, behind the English Cocker Spaniel, the German Shepherd and the Pekingese. In 1955, the reserve Best in Show at Crufts was the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Kaytop Maracas Mint, who was beaten by the Standard Poodle Ch. Tzigane Affri of Nashend. The Corgi breeds declined in popularity: veterinary physician Brian Singleton suggested in <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> <b>in</b> 1963 that this was due to issues with their temperament.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{essentially}} {{established the}} historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance. Her Regencies {{were inspired by}} Jane Austen, but unlike Austen, who wrote about and for <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> which she lived, Heyer was forced to include copious information about the period so that her readers would understand the setting. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer's greatest asset. Her meticulous nature was also evident in her historical novels; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror's crossing into England for her novel The Conqueror.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after UDI, 46 {{academics}} {{working at}} University College, a racially non-segregated institution, in Rhodesia wrote to <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> <b>in</b> London, denouncing the move. Officers of the British South Africa Police visited {{many of those}} who had signed to search their houses. Shortly afterwards, the residence permit of one of the academics came up for renewal, which would normally be automatic. In fact, it was revoked and the academic was deported. Van der Byl was the responsible minister and all but admitted that the reason was his opposition to UDI.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his {{own beliefs}} about religion as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of <b>the</b> <b>times.</b> <b>In</b> The Psychology of the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E
5|$|The Sunday Times is a British {{national}} broadsheet newspaper, the Sunday sister {{paper of}} <b>The</b> <b>Times.</b> <b>In</b> 1968, under {{the ownership of}} Lord Thomson, The Sunday Times {{had been involved in}} a deal to purchase the Mussolini diaries for an agreed final purchase price of £250,000, although they had only paid out an initial amount of £60,000. These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 Rupert Murdoch, who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both The Times and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed Frank Giles to be the editor of The Sunday Times. The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper became an independent national director of <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> <b>in</b> 1974. Trevor-Roper—who was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979—was a specialist on Nazi Germany, who had worked for the British Intelligence Services during and after the Second World War. At the war's end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler's death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the Führer's last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published The Last Days of Hitler (1947) on the subject. He subsequently wrote about the Nazis in Hitler's War Directives (1964) and Hitler's Place in History (1965).|$|E

5|$|The club {{struggled}} on {{into the}} 1880–81 season, but was forced {{to withdraw from the}} FA Cup after being unable to raise a team for the scheduled first round match. After 1881, the club was reduced to playing only one match per year, against Harrow School each Christmas. A book published by the newspaper The Sportsman claimed that the club folded in 1884, however a match at Harrow was reported in <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> <b>in</b> December 1887, which Harrow won 3–1.|$|E
5|$|The paper, first {{owned by}} the Reid family, {{struggled}} financially {{for most of its}} life and rarely generated enough profit for growth or capital improvements; the Reids subsidized the Herald Tribune through the paper's early years.

A series of disastrous business decisions, combined with aggressive competition from the Times and poor leadership from the Reid family, left the Herald Tribune far behind its rival.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire {{and ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. She had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. Indeed, December and January polls had her 25percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with <b>the</b> <b>times.</b> <b>In</b> the , 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51percent to 26percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election.|$|E

5|$|During the hearing, Hurcomb {{pointed out}} a letter {{published}} in <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> <b>in</b> July 1944, in which the Bishop and Dean of Durham, and Warden of the Durham Colleges, had given the misleading impression that the proposed station would ruin views from the railway line, an idea compounded by the publication {{a few days later}} of a photograph taken from the proposed site. He acknowledged that a number of views from parts of the river would be ruined, and that the station would be visible from the Cathedral and church, Hurcomb emphasised {{that the majority of the}} beautiful views around the city would remain. Pepler also found that from the railway station, the power station and the Cathedral could not be viewed simultaneously. The members of the inquiry initially concluded that the station should be given the go-ahead, based on the grounds that a more suitable site could not be decided upon.|$|E
5|$|On {{leaving the}} Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns {{accepted}} {{the post of}} organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville. The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year {{there were more than}} two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income. The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot, had been badly damaged {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution and imperfectly restored. The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered. With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire. The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'ís, {{including}} Bahá'u'lláh and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after {{a journey}} by {{land and sea}} through Gallipoli and Egypt, arrived in Acre on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city. The inhabitants of Acre {{were told that the}} new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden. The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions with many becoming sick, and eventually three Bahá'ís dying. Dr. Thomas Chaplin, director of a British Hospital in Jerusalem visited Bahá'u'lláh in April 1871 and {{sent a letter to the}} editor printed in <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> <b>in</b> October. This seems to be the first extended commentary on Bahá'u'lláh in western newspapers. It was also a very trying time for Bahá'u'lláh, whose son, Mirzá Mihdí, died at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation. After some time, relations between the prisoners and officials and the local community improved, so that the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, Bahá'u'lláh was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of Mazra'ih.|$|E

5|$|The series mixes three {{different}} strands: a new monologue by Kneale {{in which he}} discusses the genesis {{and development of the}} Quatermass serials and their main character; archival material from the television productions, and from documentary and newsreel coverage of key events of <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> which they were made, such as the Cold War, the advent of nuclear weapons and the embryonic Space Race; and the dramatised strand, in which the Professor discloses his reasons for reclusion and discusses his demons with a persistent reporter who invades his hermitage (and ultimately becomes his friend). This third element is set several years after the events of the third serial, Quatermass and the Pit (195859), and shortly before those of the fourth and final serial, Quatermass (1979). Continuity is maintained with the 1979 serial by presenting Quatermass living in seclusion in the Scottish Highlands, while the final episode reveals that the social collapse foreshadowing the events of the final story has already begun.|$|E
