5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> find acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E
5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that water}} {{contamination}} {{is a major}} means of transmitting diarrheal disease, efforts to provide clean water supply and improved sanitation {{have the potential to}} dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence. In fact, it has been proposed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> expect an 88% reduction in child mortality resulting from diarrheal disease as a result of improved water sanitation and hygiene. Similarly, a meta-analysis of numerous studies on improving water supply and sanitation shows a 22–27% reduction in disease incidence, and a 21–30% reduction in mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease.|$|E
25|$|Now {{this seems}} to be so {{explained}} in the writings called the Scriptures, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> gain a great deal of profitable instruction, if we would read them under the regulating influence of the spirit of God. But they can afford no instruction to those who read them in their own ability; for, if they depend on their own interpretation, they are as a dead letter, in so much, that those who profess to consider them the proper rule of faith and practice, will kill one another for the Scriptures' sake.|$|E

25|$|The Memorial Gates were {{constructed}} {{in honour of}} those U of S students who made the ultimate sacrifice. Inscribed on the gates themselves is an inscription, “These are they who went forth from this University to the Great War and gave their lives <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> live in freedom.” The gates originally straddled the main road entrance to the campus via University Drive (later, this became the access road into Royal University Hospital); when a new road access, Hospital Drive, was constructed to {{the west in the}} 1990s, the gates were preserved in their original location.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} results {{which were}} {{expected from the}} exploration of the Mekong may be summed up in a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being our hope <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the Meïnam and the Mekong? To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was {{the first part of the}} programme the commission had to carry out.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so we have only {{to be sure that}} a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach {{is to look at the}} way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E

Because by suing us, the number one player in the marketplace opened up the door. Anyone can create an interesting product, spend $10 million and create awareness of it. But it's another thing to create a product and spend one-tenth that amount and create twice as much awareness." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking to Australian {{radio station}} 2Day FM, Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the title for their next album: [...] "is much easier to pronounce." [...] Martin debunked speculation that they were {{taking a break from}} touring by saying, [...] "This three-year break idea only came about because I said at a gig in Australia <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not be back there for three years. That’s probably true, but that’s just how a world tour works. No chance are we taking a three-year break.” ...|$|E

500|$|The intellectuals {{were stuck}} at a bypass; they {{recognized}} the government’s increasing normalization, {{but they were}} unsure whether to trust that the measures were only temporary or demand more. For example, still believing in Dubcek’s promises for reform, Milan Kundera published the article “Cesky udel” (Our Czech Destiny) in Literarni listy on 19 December. He wrote: [...] "People who today are falling into depression and defeatism, commenting {{that there are not}} enough guarantees, that everything could end badly, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> again end up in a marasmus of censorship and trials, that this or that could happen, are simply weak people, who can live only in illusions of certainty." ...|$|E
500|$|Early on, {{the team}} decided {{that rather than}} rely on old Halo themes, ODST would feature all-new music. [...] "It was a bit intimidating at first," [...] Salvatori recalled, [...] "because in {{previous}} Halo games if new ideas weren't coming, I could always dust off an old one {{and give it a}} new spin. I was afraid <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> hit some writer's block along the way, but that didn't happen at all. Instead, we had the freedom to explore some new musical territory, and the ideas flowed pretty quickly." [...] With the exception of the main player character, O'Donnell and Salvatori did not compose themes to represent characters. While the game's setting in Africa inspired some percussion pieces, the team was interested in a sparser atmosphere, which Salvatori described as [...] "a bit darker and less epic".|$|E
500|$|The {{monument}} {{is designed}} to honour both the war dead and all {{who served in the}} war—one face being inscribed to those who died in the war, while the other is dedicated to [...] "all who served". On the obverse side is inscribed the words [...] "To perpetuate the courage, loyalty, and sacrifice of those who served in the Great War 19141918", while the reverse states [...] "All honour give to those who, nobly striving, nobly fell <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> live". Above the two entrances to the inner shrine were to be inscribed the names of the major theaters in which Australians served in the Great War. Originally it was suggested that this was to be Egypt, Gallipoli and Palestine on one side, with France on the other, but in the final work Belgium was added to the list.|$|E

500|$|On 15 April 2013 Boyd {{announced}} the book's title at the London Book Fair. The announcement {{was part of}} the [...] "Author of the Day" [...] event at the English Pen Literary Café. Selected press were invited to the event and were given a brief opportunity to question Boyd about the book's title. Boyd believes the short title is [...] "strikingly apt" [...] for the novel. He remarked that [...] "titles are very important" [...] to him, and that as soon as he [...] "wrote down Solo on a sheet of paper I saw its potential. Not only did it fit the theme of the novel perfectly, it's also a great punchy word, instantly and internationally comprehensible, graphically alluring and, as an extra bonus, it's strangely Bondian in the sense <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be subliminally aware of the '00' of '007' lurking just behind those juxtaposed O's of SOLO".|$|E
500|$|The {{delivery}} program, codenamed Project Alberta, got underway under Ramsey's {{direction in}} October 1943. Starting in November, the Army Air Forces Materiel Command at Wright Field, Ohio, began Silverplate, the codename for the modification of B-29s {{to carry the}} bombs. Parsons arranged for a test program at Dahlgren [...] using scale models of Thin Man and Fat Man. Test drops were carried out at Muroc Army Air Field, California and the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California using full-size replicas of Fat Man known as pumpkin bombs. The ungainly and non-aerodynamic shape of Fat Man {{proved to be the}} main difficulty, but many other problems were encountered and overcome. Parsons, wrote Oppenheimer, [...] "has been almost alone in this project to appreciate the actual military and engineering problems which we would encounter. He has been almost alone in insisting on facing these problems at a date early enough so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> arrive at their solution." ...|$|E
500|$|Dr. Helmut F. Landsberg, {{a climate}} {{scientist}} {{with the federal}} Weather Bureau, predicted in 1963 that the Northeastern and Great Lakes regions could anticipate a major smog event every three years due to the confluence of weather events and trends like growing population, industrialization, and increased emissions from cars and central heating. In early 1966, Dr. Walter Orr Roberts—director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research—warned of the imminent threat of a smog event {{with the potential to}} kill as many as 10,000 people. Roberts identified Los Angeles or New York City as the cities most vulnerable to a large-scale lethal smog in the United States, and London, Hamburg, or Santiago as other the most vulnerable internationally. Asked if [...] "many" [...] American cities were vulnerable to a disaster smog event, Roberts replied, [...] "Yes. I have been worried that we would wake up some morning to an unusual meteorological situation that prevented the air from circulating and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> find thousands of people dead {{as the result of the}} air they were forced to breathe in that smog situation." ...|$|E
