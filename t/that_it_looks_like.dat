5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a sigh of happiness, SpongeBob says <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E

The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category.

25|$|CH-type radar {{displays}} use a {{time base}} generator {{to produce a}} smoothly varying voltage that is fed {{to one of the}} inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). The time base is calibrated to move the CRT dot across the screen in the same time that echoes would be returned from objects at the radar's maximum range. The dot moves so rapidly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a solid line. The return signal is amplified and then sent into the CRT's other channel, causing the spot to deflect away from the straight line being created by the time base. For small objects, like aircraft, the deflection causes a small blip to appear on the display. The range to the target can be measured by comparing the location of the blip to a calibrated scale on the display.|$|E

500|$|At [...] in length, the {{reclining}} {{image is}} the largest statue in Gal Vihara, and {{also one of the}} largest sculptures in Southeast Asia. It depicts the parinirvana of the Buddha, who is lying on his right side with the right arm supporting the head on a bolster, while the left arm lies along the body and thigh. The palm of the right hand and the soles of the feet have a single lotus flower carved on them. Charles Godakumbure, a former Commissioner of the Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka, has stated that the bolster upon which the Buddha rests his head has been so well carved <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a cotton stuffed pillow rather than one carved from rock. The upper footthe left foot of the imageis slightly withdrawn to indicate that the image depicts that the Buddha has attained parinirvana, and is not merely lying down. Unlike the other images, the reclining image does not have a decorated pedestal, and lies on levelled bare rock. On the wall behind the image, several sockets have been carved into the rock, as well as the remains of two stone columns, suggesting that its now missing image house had a wooden roof.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the music}} video for [...] "Ego" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics who noted similarities {{with the one}} for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A writer of Rap-Up magazine described the video as [...] "Single Ladies (Part 2)". Tracey Ford of AOL described the video as [...] "an ode to multiple personalities, leotards and all things 'diva.'" [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented that the video would divide critics' opinions whether it is [...] "a sexy, burlesque-inspired variation on the theme [...] established {{in the other two}} videos from the Sasha Fierce side of the album, or just a 'Single Ladies' retread with more crotch and rump". Leah Greenblatt of the magazine Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review for the video, saying that it was very similar to the one for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] noting [...] " [...] 'Ego' feels an awful like the (admittedly awesome) 'Single Ladies' with a spiral perm." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV was also negative towards the video for the song, writing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a dress rehearsal of the video for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] but [...] "in drag". She further wrote, [...] "Anyway, while the '80s horns-and-organ vibe delivers some throwback flavor, I'm not feeling the circa-2002-Christina-Aguilera curly wig or the satin prom gloves. And the boob grabbing is a little too gratuitous. And when Beyonce says 'It's too big, it's too wide, it's too strong, it won't fit, it's too much,' I'm not even positive that she's really referring to an ego." [...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun noted that Beyoncé's appeal is [...] "fast disppearing the more she morphs into alter ego Sasha Fierce" [...] further describing the dance moves in the video as [...] "bizarre". She finished her review by writing, [...] " [...] warbles along to her track while shaking her booty in a not very flattering leotard in a similar vein to the iconic Single Ladies vid. But unfortunately for her, Ego is not half as catchy." ...|$|E

O'Brien said: [...] "It's scary— everyone feels insecure. I'm a guitarist and suddenly it's like, well, there are no guitars on this track, or no drums." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bayern did not {{contest the}} Belmont Stakes and was instead {{aimed at the}} seven-furlong Woody Stephens Stakes at the same meeting. He contested the early lead before taking a clear {{advantage}} entering the straight and drew away in the closing stages to win by {{seven and a half}} lengths from Top Fortitude. His winning time of 1:20.75 was less than a second off the track record. [...] Stevens returned as his jockey and said, [...] "That was a powerhouse performance. He had a bad experience in the gate in the Preakness. Jimmy Barnes [...] and Bob's crew did a great job getting him ready by schooling, schooling, schooling him." [...] Bayern was moved back up in class and distance for the Grade I Haskell Invitational over nine furlongs at Monmouth Park on July 27. Ridden for the first time by Martin Garcia, he was the second choice in the betting behind the filly Untapable. Garcia took the lead from the start and set a steady pace before drawing away in the straight to win by more than seven lengths from Albano, with Untapable in fifth place. Baffert, who won the race for a record seventh time, watched the running on television. After the race, the trainer, who said that he had considered keeping the horse to sprint distances, stated, [...] "We tried to slow him down in the past, but now we know we just have to utilize his speed.
