50|$|On April 6, 1938, Roy Plunkett at DuPont’s Jackson Laboratory in New Jersey {{was working}} with gases related to DuPont’s Freon {{refrigerants}} {{when he and his}} associates discovered that a sample of gaseous tetrafluoroethylene had polymerized spontaneously into a white, waxy solid. The polymer was polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) commercialized by DuPont as Teflon in 1945. Because DuPont was basic in a variety of fluorinated materials, it was logical that organofluorine chemistry became important to DuPont. The discovery that <b>tetrafluorethylene</b> would cyclize {{with a wide variety of}} compounds to give fluorinated compounds opened up routes to a range of organofluorine compounds.|$|E
40|$|An {{invention}} {{that provides}} a method of altering the size of tetrafluoroethylene tubing which is only available in limited combination of wall thicknesses and diameter are discussed. The method includes the steps of sliding the tetrafluoroethylene tubing onto an aluminum mandrel and clamping {{the ends of the}} tubing to the mandrel by means of clamps. The <b>tetrafluorethylene</b> tubing and mandrel are then placed in a supporting coil which with the mandrel and <b>tetrafluorethylene</b> tubing are then positioned in a insulated steel pipe which is normally covered with a fiber glass insulator to smooth out temperature distribution therein. The entire structure is then placed in an event which heats the <b>tetrafluorethylene</b> tubing which is then shrunk by the heat to the outer dimension of the aluminum mandrel. After cooling the aluminum mandrel is removed from the newly sized <b>tetrafluorethylene</b> tubing by a conventional chemical milling process...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{unwanted}} photoacoustic (PA) signals due to volatiles released from various polymer tubing materials [transparent, {{red and black}} polyethylene (PE), polymer of <b>tetrafluorethylene</b> (PTFE) and copolymer of <b>tetrafluorethylene</b> and hexafluorethylene (FEP) ] when exposed to 245 nm radiation was determined in spectral region of CO 2 laser. The magnitude of PA signal decreases/increases when UV radiation is turned off/on suggesting formation of volatiles as a results of tubing/UV light interaction. The data obtained in this study suggests the necessity to shield polymer tubings. Generated volatiles were also analyzed independently by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} of the directional reflectance measurements taken on two <b>tetrafluorethylene</b> (TFE) paints formulated with silicone binders. Both paints {{are found to be}} more Lambertian than barium sulfate paint and pressed powder, although the pigment to binder ratios for barium sulfate and TFE paints are about 133 and 3. 3 to 1, respectively. The TFE paints exhibit total visible reflectances above 90 percent and offer surfaces that are not significantly affected by water...|$|E
40|$|Two optical {{reference}} coatings containing <b>tetrafluorethylene</b> {{have been}} formulated using silicone binders. One of the silicones used is an oligomer of methyl silanol supplied at 48 percent solids {{in a mixture}} of butanol and ethanol. The other silicone is a proprietory silicone tethered ethyl silicate based colloidal silica binder supplied at 22 and 36 percent solids {{in a mixture of}} low molecular weight aliphatic alcohols. The coatins are characterized by high durability and have an overall reflectance in the visible part of the spectrum of about 90 percent. The substrate preparation and application procedures are described...|$|E
40|$|The {{permeation}} of {{a mixture}} of CH 4 and CO 2 (97 % CH 4 and 3 % CO 2) saturated with water vapour through Tefzel has been studied at 950 C and 25 and 50 bars. Tefzel is the Du Pont trademark of an ETFE (ethylenetetrafluorethylene) which is a copolymer of ethylene and <b>tetrafluorethylene.</b> This material might be used as inner plastic lining of flexible pipes. For methane and carbon dioxide, the permeability of Tefzel {{is higher than the}} deplasticized PVDF (Polyvinylidenefluoride), but lower than the plasticized PVDF. For water, the situation seems to be the other way round; Tefzel has a lower permeability than deplasticized PVDF. Whether the permeability tests on Tefzel at higher temperatures and pressures will be pursued or not, will be considered by the steering committee of the CAPP project in May...|$|E
3000|$|To {{understand}} how the fuel may affect cluster structure organization of Nafion, SAXS analyses were performed for dry Nafion and Nafion-MPS composites preconditioned in both ambient relative humidity and saturated with ethanol solution (2  M) as shown in Fig.  4. The SAXS patterns of Nafion preconditioned both in water and in ethanol solution revealed the presence of two characteristics peaks of Nafion, namely, the ionomer peak (q ~  0.2 /Å) and the matrix peak (q ~  0.05 /Å) [14]. The matrix peak is attributed to the long range correlations among <b>tetrafluorethylene</b> crystallites and the ionomer peak is assigned to the correlation length among elongated polymeric aggregates [14]. The Bragg spacing (d max) due to the ionomer peak {{is reported to be}} increased as the water content or alcohol content increases [14, 15]. For membranes at ambient relative humidity, d max for Nafion and the Nafion-MPS composite is similar ~ 31 and ~ 29  Å, respectively. For samples previously swollen in ethanol solutions, d max of both samples increase to ~ 34 Å for Nafion and ~ 31  Å [...]...|$|E

Efficiency can be increased and costs reduced by optimizing and controlling the porous catalyst layer in MEAs. It is important to understand the polymer properties, which can be achieved by using different solutions and varying concentrations of one mixture for manufacturing the dispersion. Furthermore, the findings are of particular importance for the coating process. The efficiency of the PEMFCs and PEMELs depends on the number of active centers in the porous catalyst layer. The formation of the triple phase boundary is of great importance. This can be ensured by controlling the structural properties of the dispersion. Thereby, the static and dynamic surface tensions are analyzed. Surface tension and interfacial tension are necessary for understanding the coating process and adhesion to a transfer layer. The complex system was simplified and research on the surface properties performed with an aqueous Nafion® solution in an alcohol concentration series. Hence, the only aspect that changed was the alcohol, while the dynamic surface tension was measured with a bubble pressure tensiometer (BP 100, KRÜSS GmbH). The static surface tension and interfacial surface tension were carried out with a force tensiometer (K 100, KRÜSS GmbH) after Wilhelmy plate respectively the duNouy Ring method. In addition the solution was analyzed by means of IR- and 19 F-NMR- spectroscopy. It will be demonstrated in this contribution that the static and dynamic surface tensions differ significantly at lower alcohol concentrations in solution series with and without Nafion®. While at higher alcohol concentrations the static surface tension between both series is similar, the dynamic surface tension shows a different trend with varied bubble age. This {{can be explained by the}} interaction between alcohol and Nafion®. In accordance with the previous interface outcomes, the 19 F-NMR- and IR- spectra are analyzed. According to the first results, it is also apparent that there are interactions between Nafion® and alcohol. The application of these methods provides an understanding of the interaction between the molecules in the catalyst dispersions. This information is essential for understanding the interactions between the components of catalyst dispersion during electrode manufacturing...|$|E
