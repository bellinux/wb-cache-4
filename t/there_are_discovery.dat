40|$|Requirements {{elicitation}} is {{the practice}} of collecting the requirements of a system from users, customers and other stakeholders. It is usually realized that requirements are elicited rather than just taking or gathering. This means <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>discovery</b> and development of elements to the elicitation process. Requirements elicitation is a complex process connecting with many activities with a different of available techniques, approaches, and tools for performing them. The objectives {{of this paper is}} to present the important aspects of how to plan for elicitation, the techniques, approaches, and tools for requirements elicitation, and some elicitation problems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} our {{flight control}} {{development for the}} University of Glasgow Singapre (UGS) tilting tri-copter. The tilting tri-copter has the capability of high cruising speed by tilting the main rotors. The drawback of this design is that it causes instability during rotors transition and flight stability. As such, {{the development of a}} new flight control system is required to make this system stable. The first phase involves the designing &# 38; building of the tilting tri-copter for the investigation of its flight behaviour, and researching on different control systems to select the suitable control system for the tri-copter. The next phase is be to design the flight control system using the Simulink program. The final phase is to analyse and discuss the simulation result and compare with the test flights. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>discovery</b> from the simulation result that after the main rotor had titled, the roll effect become less responsive and the roll mode will caused the tri-copter to yaw. This can be resolved by changing the design of the main rotor tilting into an independent tilting rotor system to improve the performance. With the new develop flight control system, it can use for future in deep research or even use it to combine with other controller such as LQR controller...|$|E

25|$|In 2003, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>discovery</b> of {{endogenous}} morphine occurring {{naturally in}} the human body. Thirty years of speculation were made on this subject because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a receptor that, it appeared, reacted only to morphine: the μ3-opioid receptor in human tissue. Human cells that form in reaction to cancerous neuroblastoma cells {{have been found to}} contain trace amounts of endogenous morphine.|$|R
50|$|At the end: In the beginning, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>discovery,</b> a {{confusion}} of elements, a first snowfall of impossible change. Old lives undone, left behind, strange faces made familiar, new nightmares to challenge sleep, new friends {{to feel safe}} with. Only then comes control, the need to impose order onto chaos through determination, through study, through struggle, all in defiance of a thundering truth. They're here, and the earth shudders underfoot.|$|R
40|$|The {{enormous}} physics {{potential of}} the charged lepton experimental program {{was very much in}} evidence at the Workshop. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>discovery</b> opportunities in experiments that will be conducted over the coming decade using existing facilities and in more sensitive experiments possible with future facilities such as Project X. Exquisitly sensitive searches for rare decays of muons and tau leptons, together with precision measurements of their properties will either elucidate the scale and dynamics of flavor generation, or limit the scale of flavor generation to well above 104 TeV. The crown jewel of the program is the discovery potential of muon and tau decay experiments searching for charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) with several orders-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity in multiple processes. There is an international program of CLFV searches, with experiments recently completed, currently running, and soon to be constructed in the United States, Japan, and Europe. These include the completion of the MEG experiment at PSI, an upgrade of MEG, the proposed mu 3 e search at PSI, new searches from muon to electron conversion (Mu 2 e at Fermilab, COMET at J-PARC), SuperKEKB, and over the longer term, experiments exploiting megawatt proton sources such as Project X. Over the next decade gains of up to five orders-of-magnitude are feasible in muon-to-electron conversion and in the µ → 3 e searches, while gains of at least two orders-of-magnitude are possible in µ → eγ an...|$|E
