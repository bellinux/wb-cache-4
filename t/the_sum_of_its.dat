5|$|Paley {{considers}} how {{the whole}} of a system is more than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts. This is seen to be so both in a mechanical watch and in living systems.|$|E
5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is more than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{is named after}} James Joseph Sylvester, who first investigated it in 1880. Its values grow doubly exponentially, and <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> reciprocals forms a series of unit fractions that converges to 1 more rapidly than any other series of unit fractions with {{the same number of}} terms. The recurrence by which it is defined allows the numbers in the sequence to be factored more easily than other numbers of the same magnitude, but, due to the rapid growth of the sequence, complete prime factorizations are known only for a few of its members. Values derived from this sequence have also been used to construct finite Egyptian fraction representations of 1, Sasakian Einstein manifolds, and hard instances for online algorithms.|$|E

25|$|In number theory, {{a perfect}} number is a {{positive}} integer that is equal to <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> proper positive divisors, that is, <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half {{the sum of all}} of its positive divisors (including itself) i.e. σ1(n)=2n.|$|E
25|$|As a {{differentiable}} {{function of a}} complex variable is equal to <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Taylor series (that is, it is analytic), complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable (that is, holomorphic functions).|$|E
25|$|Gromov's Betti number theorem. There is a {{constant}} C = C(n) such that if M is a compact connected n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive sectional curvature then <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Betti numbers is at most C.|$|E

25|$|The G8 summits {{during the}} 21st century have {{inspired}} widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes more than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts, elevating the participants, {{the issues and}} the venue as focal points for activist pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of a function symbol is a function. For example, if the domain of discourse consists of integers, a function symbol f of arity 2 {{can be interpreted as}} the function that gives <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> arguments. In other words, the symbol f is associated with the function I(f) which, in this interpretation, is addition.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} asset-based {{analysis}} of a business is equal to <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to fair market value wherever possible.|$|E

30|$|Theorem 4 {{indicates}} that, {{although a}} system’s capability {{to carry out}} a work is more powerful than any <b>of</b> <b>its</b> components, the total work done by the system cannot exceed <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> all <b>its</b> components because the existence of overheads or no system may reach the ideal efficiency where η (S_i) = 1. In other words, in the term of abstract work done by a system, the whole of the system is not always greater than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> all <b>its</b> parts.|$|R
50|$|For an {{equilateral}} polygon, the circumcenter of {{mass and}} {{center of mass}} coincide. More generally, the circumcenter of mass and center of mass coincide for a simplicial polytope for which each face has <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> squares <b>of</b> <b>its</b> edges a constant.|$|R
25|$|The {{ability to}} reduce {{everything}} to simple fundamental laws {{does not imply}} the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. We can now see that the whole becomes not merely more, but very different from <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts.|$|E
25|$|Gloucestershire {{was very}} {{successful}} in one-day cricket in the late 1990s and early 2000s winning several titles under the captaincy of Mark Alleyne and coaching of John Bracewell. The club operated on a small budget and was famed as a team greater than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts, boasting few international stars. Gloucestershire's overall knockout record between 1999 and 2002 was 28 wins and seven losses from 37 games, including 16 wins from 18 at the Bristol County Ground.|$|E
25|$|In penalized regression, 'L1 penalty' and 'L2 penalty' {{refer to}} penalizing either the L1 norm of a solution's vector of {{parameter}} values (i.e. <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> absolute values), or its L2 norm (its Euclidean length). Techniques which use an L1 penalty, like LASSO, encourage solutions where many parameters are zero. Techniques which use an L2 penalty, like ridge regression, encourage solutions where most parameter values are small. Elastic net regularization uses a penalty term {{that is a}} combination of the L1 norm and the L2 norm of the parameter vector.|$|E

5000|$|The number 1289 is classed as a {{deficient}} number because <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> all <b>its</b> positive divisors (except itself) totals {{less than}} 1289. Compare with perfect and abundant numbers.|$|R
5000|$|Synergy is the {{creation}} of a whole that is greater than <b>the</b> simple <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts. <b>The</b> term synergy comes from the Attic Greek word συνεργία [...] from , , meaning [...] "working together".|$|R
25|$|The surface {{integral}} of the Gaussian curvature over some region of a surface {{is called the}} total curvature. The total curvature of a geodesic triangle equals the deviation of <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> angles from π. The sum of the angles of a triangle on a surface of positive curvature will exceed π, while {{the sum of the}} angles of a triangle on a surface of negative curvature will be less than π. On a surface of zero curvature, such as the Euclidean plane, the angles will sum to precisely π radians.|$|E
25|$|It has {{not been}} contested that {{cardiovascular}} risk factors tend to cluster together; the matter of contention has been the assertion that the metabolic syndrome is anything more than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> constituent parts. Phenotypic heterogeneity (for example, represented by variation in metabolic syndrome factor combinations among individuals with metabolic syndrome) has fueled that debate. However, more recent evidence suggests that common triggers (for example, excessive sugar-intake in the environment of overabundant food) {{can contribute to the}} development of multiple metabolic abnormalities at the same time, supporting the commonality of the energy utilization and storage pathways in metabolic syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the Young–Fibonacci graph and Young–Fibonacci lattice, {{named after}} Alfred Young and Leonardo Fibonacci, are two closely related {{structures}} involving sequences of the digits 1 and 2. Any digit sequence {{of this type}} can be assigned a rank, <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> digits: for instance, the rank of 11212 is 1+1+2+1+2=7. As was already known in ancient India, the number of sequences with a given rank is a Fibonacci number. The Young–Fibonacci lattice is an infinite modular lattice having these digit sequences as its elements, compatible with this rank structure. The Young–Fibonacci graph is the graph of this lattice, and has a vertex for each digit sequence. As the graph of a modular lattice, it is a modular graph.|$|E
50|$|In a structure, all <b>of</b> <b>its</b> data {{members are}} stored in {{contiguous}} memory locations. The size of an object of a struct is, therefore, <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> all <b>its</b> data members.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} ways to {{represent}} [...] as <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> four squares was due to Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi and it is eight times <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> all <b>its</b> divisors which are not divisible by 4, i.e.|$|R
50|$|The finite basis theorem is an {{extension}} of the notion of V-description to include infinite polytopes. The theorem states that a convex polyhedron is <b>the</b> convex <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> vertices plus <b>the</b> conical <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direction vectors <b>of</b> <b>its</b> infinite edges.|$|R
25|$|Resultative constructions are set {{syntactic}} patterns used {{to express}} resultativeness. Within these structures, the object NP is viewed as having undergone some change of state, and the change {{is viewed as a}} result achieved through the action expressed by the combination of the verb and the result phrase. The word order of the elements is said to be constant and crucial in conveying the resultative meaning; under this analysis, the output in its entirety is regarded as having a more complex meaning than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> components' individual meanings. This constructional approach has been proposed in order to account for the semantic differences between standalone verbs that have no intrinsic resultative meaning and their resultative counterparts (e.g. hammer versus hammer flat).|$|E
25|$|However, in {{contrast}} to simple convergence, the SC integrates information to create an output that differs from <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> inputs. Following a phenomenon labelled the 'spatial rule', neurons are excited if stimuli from multiple modalities fall on the same or adjacent receptive fields, but are inhibited if the stimuli fall on disparate fields. Excited neurons may then proceed to innervate various muscles and neural structures to orient an individual's behaviour and attention toward the stimulus. Neurons in the SC also adhere to the 'temporal rule', in which stimulation must occur within close temporal proximity to excite neurons. However, due to the varying processing time between modalities and the relatively slower speed of sound to light, {{it has been found}} the neurons may be optimally excited when stimulated some time apart.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 2012 it was {{reported}} that BAE and EADS were in discussions regarding a possible merger. In the event of the merger, BAE shareholders would own 40% and EADS 60% of the new enlarged organisation. A key French EADS shareholder Lagardere asked EADS to rethink the proposed merger plan as the conditions were unsatisfactory. The bosses of BAE Systems and EADS issued a joint statement seeking political support for their proposed 35 billion euro (US$45 billion) merger from the British, French and German governments; and reiterated that the combination is borne out of opportunity, not necessity and the new company would be greater than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts. It {{was reported}} on 10 October 2012, that the merger between BAE Systems and EADS had been called off.|$|E
