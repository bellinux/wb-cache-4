Finding derivations is a difficult task because the search space can be very large; an exhaustive search of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but computationally infeasible for many systems of interest in mathematics. Thus complicated heuristic functions are developed to attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search.|$|E

25|$|In this {{particular}} decision, which arose {{from a federal}} child pornography prosecution, the Court ruled that a warrant that was predicated on the undercover delivery of a videotape to the defendant's home, but did not state this on its face, was properly issued and executed because it described {{the place to be}} searched and the objects to be seized, and the search was conducted after the delivery was made. Evidence seized from the defendant's house from <b>that</b> <b>search</b> was therefore admissible in court against him.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps the {{predominant}} religious component is the series' theme: the human survivors' search for Earth. <b>That</b> <b>search</b> {{is motivated by}} ancient religious texts' references to a 13th tribe of humans that established a civilization on a distant planet called Earth.

25|$|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) {{described}} {{all systems}} of religion, philosophy, {{and social science}} as expressions of the basic urge of consciousness to learn about itself and its surroundings, and record its findings and hypotheses. Thus, religion is only a form of <b>that</b> <b>search</b> for knowledge, within which humans record various experiences and reflections. Others, compiling and categorizing these writings in various ways, form the consolidated worldview as articulated by that religion, philosophy, social science, etc. His work The Phenomenology of Spirit was a study of how various types of writing and thinking draw from and re-combine with the individual and group experiences of various places and times, influencing the current forms of knowledge and worldviews that are operative in a population. This activity is the functioning of an incomplete group mind, where each individual is accessing the recorded wisdom of others. His works often include detailed descriptions of the psychological motivations involved in thought and behavior, e.g., the struggle of a community or nation to know itself and thus correctly govern itself. In Hegel's system, Religion {{is one of the}} major repositories of wisdom to be used in these struggles, representing a huge body of recollections from humanity's past in various stages of its development.|$|E
25|$|Windows Explorer's task {{panel has}} been removed, {{integrating}} the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane {{on the left}} contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated Search Folders. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change {{the layout of the}} Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the Navigation Pane. Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as author or subject) to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the Details Pane that shows up at the bottom of an Explorer window. The Navigation Pane contains a list of most common folders (the Favorites) for quick navigation. It can also show the folder layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as virtual ones. By default it contains links to folders such as Documents and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders <b>that</b> <b>search</b> and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The Preview Pane can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in the folder listing, and sampling contents of a media file, without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the Windows Imaging Component is installed. Also, if an application installs Preview handlers (like Office 2007 does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.|$|E

The two bird communities that inhabit the subalpine and forest ecosystems are considered among the most complete in Greece: The first community includes species that nest and feed in the subalpine area, like the alpine chough, shore lark, western rock nuthatch and alpine swift, while the second comprises birds of prey like the griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, peregrine falcon and common kestrel, <b>that</b> <b>search</b> for food in a wider zone.|$|E
500|$|Rick Cohoon of Allmusic {{praised the}} album for its musical variety, saying, [...] "With artists as well {{anchored}} in the business as Diamond Rio, the musical quality is a given.

He cited [...] "Beautiful Mess" [...] and [...] "I Believe" [...] as standout tracks. Ray Waddell of Billboard also thought that the singles were among the best tracks on the album, while highlighting the instrumental track [...] "Rural Philharmonic" [...] (which Olander had originally intended to record for a solo album) {{as an example of the}} band's strong musicianship. Chrissie Dickinson of The Chicago Tribune was less favorable, commending the [...] "masterful musicianship" [...] and Roe's [...] "light vocal timbre", while criticizing the song selections as [...] "mostly a paint-by-numbers trip around the musical block, from the predictable power balladry of 'I Believe' to the saccharine sentiments of 'We All Fall Down.'" ...|$|E
