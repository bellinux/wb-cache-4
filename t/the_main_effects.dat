5|$|On September15, {{the eye of}} Choi-wan passed within 10km (5mi) of Alamagan {{and brought}} winds of up to 230km/h (145mph) to the island. The most recent storm of Choi-wan's {{intensity}} to strike the islands was Typhoon Chaba in 2004. That storm caused severe damage and widespread flooding. Unlike Chaba, relatively little rainfall fell due to Choi-wan, and no flooding was reported. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> from the typhoon in Saipan were downed trees which littered streets across the islands. Power lines were downed and sewer pipes were broken; however, crews began repairing damage once Choi-wan passed. In Garapan, the major shelter on the island sustained minor damage and repair work on it would take roughly a week.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> of {{tropical}} cyclones include heavy rain, strong wind, large storm surges at landfall, and tornadoes. The destruction from a tropical cyclone depends mainly on its intensity, its size, and its location. Tropical cyclones act to remove forest canopy {{as well as}} change the landscape near coastal areas, by moving and reshaping sand dunes and causing extensive erosion along the coast. Even well inland, heavy rainfall can lead to mudslides and landslides in mountainous areas. Their effects can be sensed over time by studying the concentration of the Oxygen-18 isotope within caves within the vicinity of cyclones' paths being very hazardous to people's life.|$|E

30|$|We did a 2 X 2 between {{subjects}} ANOVA {{with support}} and multi-tasking {{as independent variables}} and disorientation as dependent variable. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of support on disorientation was highly significant, F (1, 36)[*]=[*] 18.99, p[*]<[*]. 01). <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of multi-tasking was also significant F (1, 36)[*]=[*] 5.35, p[*]<[*]. 05.

5|$|The Expendables 2 {{contains}} approximately 1,547 {{digital effect}} shots. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 of the shots, and a further 800 shots which were discarded {{in response to}} changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and , also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. Digital effect pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model assets of the sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. Anything that was considered to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled {{even if it was}} not scheduled to appear in the film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes.|$|E

25|$|Shaking {{and ground}} rupture are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> created by earthquakes, principally {{resulting}} in {{more or less}} severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, {{the distance from the}} epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation. The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration.|$|E

30|$|We thus grouped the mid-rotoscoped and mid-cartoon {{stimulus}} sets as “low contrast”, {{with the}} rotoscoped and cartoon as “high contrast”. Similarly, cartoon and mid-cartoon images were grouped as “low featural complexity” and rotoscoped and mid-rotoscoped images as “high featural complexity”. In this way, we could compare <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of contrast and <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of featural complexity independently across our stimulus sets, using a 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA.|$|R
25|$|In {{his book}} Food of the Gods, McKenna {{proposed}} that the transformation from humans' early ancestors Homo erectus to the species Homo sapiens mainly {{had to do with}} the addition of the mushroom Psilocybe cubensis in its diet, an event that according to his theory took place in about 100,000 BCE (which is when he believed that the species diverged from the Homo genus). McKenna based his theory on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects,</b> or alleged effects, produced by the mushroom while citing studies by Roland Fischer et al. from the late 1960s to early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone {{acts as an}} agonist of the {{serotonin}} 5-HT1A receptor {{with high}} affinity. It is a preferential full agonist of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which are inhibitory autoreceptors, and a partial agonist of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. In accordance, an animal study found that buspirone dose-dependently decreases serotonin levels in specific brain areas while increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels. It is thought that <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> of buspirone are mediated via its interaction with the 5-HT1A receptor. Some of its effects may be mediated via oxytocin release secondary to 5-HT1A receptor agonism. Buspirone also has lower affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{state that}} one of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> of the inquisition was to end free thought and scientific thought in Spain. As one contemporary Spaniard in exile put it: [...] "Our country is a land of ... barbarism; down there one cannot produce any culture without being suspected of heresy, error and Judaism. Thus silence was imposed on the learned." [...] For the next few centuries, {{while the rest of}} Europe was slowly awakened by the influence of the Enlightenment, Spain stagnated. However, this conclusion is contested.|$|E
2500|$|Confounding has {{traditionally}} been defined as bias arising from the co-occurrence or mixing of effects of extraneous factors, referred to as confounders, with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect(s)</b> of interest. A more recent definition of confounding invokes the notion of counterfactual effects. According to this view, when one observes an outcome of interest, say Y=1 (as opposed to Y=0), in a given population A which is entirely exposed (i.e. exposure X=1 for every unit of the population) the risk of this event will be RA1. The counterfactual or unobserved risk RA0 corresponds to the risk {{which would have been}} observed if these same individuals had been unexposed (i.e. X=0 for every unit of the population). The true effect of exposure therefore is: RA1−RA0 (if one is interested in risk differences) or RA1/RA0 (if one is interested in relative risk). Since the counterfactual risk RA0 is unobservable we approximate it using a second population B and we actually measure the following relations: RA1−RB0 or RA1/RB0. In this situation, confounding occurs when RA0≠RB0. (NB: Example assumes binary outcome and exposure variables.) ...|$|E

40|$|Protein supplementation and {{nitrogen}} utilization of ammoniated roughages by ruminants was investigated. Rate of particulate passage was quadratically increased (P =. 09) in wethers due to level to ammoniation of corn cobs. Factorial arrangements of treatments {{were used in}} two lamb and two steer trails where <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> were level of ammoniation of corn cobs and level of supplemental protein from a blood meal-corn gluten meal mixutre (BM-CGM). In a lamb digestion trial, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of ammoniation quadratically increased (P 3 ̆c. 02) dry matter intake (DMI) and linearly decreased (P 3 ̆c. 02) dry matter digestibility (DMD) at ad libitum intake, however, a cubic <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> (P 3 ̆c. 01) was noted for DMD at restricted intake (350 g DMI). <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of BM-CGM linearly (P 3 ̆c. 01) increased DMI and DMD at ad libitum intake and quadratically increased (P 3 ̆c. 001) DMD at restricted intake.

Linear BM-CGM x ammonia interactions were noted for fecal nitrogen excretion {{and nitrogen}} retention.
