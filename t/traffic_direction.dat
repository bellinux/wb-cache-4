40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse residential demand by traffic destination, using a translogarithmic indirect utility function. We focus on five <b>traffic</b> <b>directions,</b> in order to construct a model adapted to evaluate the characteristics of telecommunications demand in a competitive market. The resulting price elasticities express high reactivity to own price changes for the main <b>traffic</b> <b>directions,</b> as well as little interactions between the different types of traffic. Moreover, the high values of income elasticities confirm the importance of income effects when analysing residential telecommunications demand. This model shows useful for welfare analysis. The computation of customers' income equivalent variation shows, on average, a higher willingness to pay for some <b>traffic</b> <b>directions</b> than the bill actually paid. Finally, we show that the optimal prices for the operator, in a cost minimisation point of view, are higher than the observed prices for local and national <b>traffic</b> <b>directions.</b> This emphasises the existence of important cross-subsidies among the different segments of customers...|$|R

50|$|Unusually, one {{service area}} is {{provided}} for both <b>traffic</b> <b>directions</b> {{and it is}} all located {{to the south of}} the motorway. Access from the eastbound carriageway is via a tunnel underneath the M25. Access from the west-bound carriageway is from the motorway itself.|$|R
5000|$|Currently {{the tunnel}} carries one lane of <b>traffic</b> in each <b>direction.</b> Plans are {{underway}} {{to open a}} second unfinished tunnel, the [...] "northern bore", to carry eastbound traffic. This will allow for two lanes of <b>traffic</b> in each <b>direction,</b> with each tunnel carrying <b>traffic</b> in one <b>direction</b> only.|$|R

50|$|Intersections {{generally}} must manage pedestrian {{as well as}} vehicle traffic. Pedestrian aids include crosswalks, pedestrian-directed {{traffic signals}} ("walk light") and over/underpasses. Walk lights may be accompanied by audio signals to aid the visually impaired. Medians can offer pedestrian islands, allowing pedestrians to divide their crossings into a separate segment for each <b>traffic</b> <b>direction,</b> possibly with a separate signal for each.|$|E

50|$|Twinning a road {{involves}} {{the construction of}} a similar or identical parallel road. It is usually done when an existing highway requires a significant increase in capacity. Twinning is frequently advantageous because it allows traffic capacity to be doubled and produces a dual carriageway with separation between <b>traffic</b> <b>directions,</b> while keeping the existing right of way. Additionally, unlike simple widening, the old road stays open while the twin is being built.|$|R

Players can configure these filters for different network interfaces and different <b>traffic</b> <b>directions.</b> This lets players see {{the consequences of}} leaving ports open (e.g., attacks). And this allows players to experience the need to open some ports (e.g., {{one of the characters}} might be unable to achieve a goal unless the filter is configured to allow SSH traffic).|$|R
