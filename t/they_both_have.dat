5|$|The endings {{of the two}} {{poems are}} the same but have {{opposite}} results: <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> a sunset and an exodus from the country, but the first deals with Wales and the second with the Aztec lands. The first is messianic and heralds a return of Wales's greatness, and the second deals with a new country being created.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} 188Re and 186Re are radioactive and {{are used}} for treatment of liver cancer. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> similar penetration depth in tissue (5mm for 186Re and 11mm for 188Re), but 186Re has advantage of longer lifetime (90 hours vs. 17 hours).|$|E

5|$|Triton and Nereid are unusual {{irregular}} {{satellites and}} are thus treated separately from the other five irregular Neptunian moons, which are more like the outer irregular satellites of the other outer planets. Firstly, they are the largest two known irregular moons in the Solar System, with Triton being almost {{an order of magnitude}} larger than all other known irregular moons. Secondly, <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> atypically small semi-major axes, with Triton's being over an order of magnitude smaller than those of all other known irregular moons. Thirdly, <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> unusual orbital eccentricities: Nereid {{has one of the most}} eccentric orbits of any known irregular satellite, and Triton's orbit is a nearly perfect circle. Finally, Nereid also has the lowest inclination of any known irregular satellite.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,500 {{same-sex}} couples married in Spain {{during the first}} year of the law. Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> legal residence in Spain.|$|E
5|$|If gcd(a,b)=1, then a and b {{are said}} to be coprime (or {{relatively}} prime). This property does not imply that a or b are themselves prime numbers. For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> two prime factors: 6=2×3 and 35=5×7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.|$|E

5|$|After {{weeks of}} {{rigorous}} training, Diana wins another amateur fight, this time against a girl, Ricki Stiles. Although Diana has accepted Adrian's apology, tensions rise between them again when {{they learn that}} <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> advanced to the finals in their division to fight each other. Adrian refuses to fight a girl and Diana struggles to convince him to view her as a legitimate opponent. He turns up for the fight on the day, however, and after an even match, Diana wins with a unanimous decision by the judges. After the fight, Adrian fears that he has lost Diana's respect, but she tells him she respects him even more for fighting her, and they reconcile.|$|E
5|$|In the {{standard}} periodic table, the elements {{are listed in}} order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) {{are determined by the}} electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.|$|E
5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, not with {{the cells of the}} automaton, but rather with the interstices between cells. Two consecutive cells that both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, two consecutive cells that both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells are that <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E

25|$|Originally Maple and Mathematica {{were the}} {{preferred}} programs for calculating sequences in the OEIS, and <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> their own field labels. , Mathematica {{was the most}} popular choice with 100,000 Mathematica programs followed by 50,000 PARI/GP programs, 35,000 Maple programs, and 45,000 in other languages.|$|E
25|$|Protons and {{neutrons}} {{were then}} grouped together as nucleons because <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> {{nearly the same}} mass and interact in nearly the same way, if the electromagnetic interaction is neglected. It was convenient to treat them as being different states of the same particle.|$|E
25|$|The DNS {{protocol}} uses {{two types}} of DNS messages, queries and replies, and <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> the same format. Each message consists of a header and four sections: question, answer, authority, and an additional space. A header field (flags) controls the content of these four sections.|$|E
50|$|Both teams {{decided to}} take the shortcut. So <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>had</b> to fight two wrestlers. Mohit {{selected}} himself and Rahul to fight. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>had</b> to defend themselves for three rounds. The one that defended for a longer time, wins. Rahul went first & broke a rule. He attacked a wrestler after the fight was over. So he was disqualified. Mohit automatically won. But to prove a point, he also fought. He performed very well and was appreciated by all.|$|R

25|$|Example. For −5 to be a residue (mod p), either both 5 and −1 {{have to be}} {{residues}} (mod p) or <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> to be non-residues: i.e., p ≡ ±1 (mod 5) and p ≡ 1 (mod 4) or p ≡ ±2 (mod 5) and p ≡ 3 (mod 4).

25|$|The {{lines of}} the Fano plane may also be given {{homogeneous}} coordinates, again using non-zero triples of binary digits. With this system of coordinates, a point is incident to a line if the coordinate for the point and the coordinate for the line have an even number of positions at which <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> nonzero bits: for instance, the point 101 belongs to the line 111, because they have nonzero bits at two common positions. In terms of the underlying linear algebra, a point belongs to a line if the inner product of the vectors representing the point and line is zero.|$|E
25|$|Escherichia coli (E. coli) expresses two {{different}} forms of shikimate dehydrogenase, AroE and YdiB. Theses two forms are paralogs of each other. The two forms of shikimate dehydrogenase have different primary sequences in different organisms but catalyze the same reactions. The is about 25% similarity between the sequences of AroE and YdiB, but their two structures have similar structures with similar folds. YdiB can utilize NAD or NADP as a cofactor and also reacts with quinic acid. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> high high affinity of their ligands as shown by their similar enzyme (Km) values. Both forms of the enzyme are independently regulated.|$|E

Mark Stuart and Will McGinniss started a project called Know Hope Collective, which features a changing group of musicians singing worship songs and presenting testimonies. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> also been working extensively with The Hands and Feet Project in Haiti. Tyler Burkum has been playing for several bands and as a session musician. He also started his own band called The Leagues.
