5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of Australian Leaders of the Op{{position}}. The Leader of the Opposition in Australian Federal Politics is a Member of Parliament in the House of Representatives. The {{position is}} held by the leader of the party not in government that has the most seats in the House. When in parliament, the Leader of the Opposition sits on the left-hand side of the centre <b>table,</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Opposition and opposite the Prime Minister. The Opposition Leader is elected by his or her party according to its rules. A new Opposition Leader may be elected when the incumbent dies, resigns, or is challenged for the leadership.|$|E
5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
60|$|That {{night the}} Captain {{called me to}} his cabin. He had a book <b>of</b> {{mathematical}} <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him, and great sheets of vulgar fractions littered the floor on all sides.|$|R

50|$|Spiro also {{opposed the}} Gulf War and the Iraq War. In {{the last years}} of his life he was the President of the New Jersey Catholic Peace Fellowship and he often engaged in counter-recruitment, setting up {{information}} <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> military recruiting offices in New Jersey.|$|R
25|$|In his 1502–9 {{cycle of}} the Piccolomini library frescoes at the Dome of Siena, Pinturicchio depicts Pope Pius II convoking, as the Latin {{inscription}} explains, a Diet of Princes at Mantua to proclaim a new crusade in 1459. On the eighth fresco, a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Pope's throne is covered by an Oriental carpet. It was hypothesized that the carpet {{might have been a}} trophy from previous expeditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} has {{two sets}} of pews divided by a broad center aisle. A serpentine balcony supported by iron columns covers the northern third, with a glazed screen creating a narthex. At the south end, a pulpit and lectern front a dais with Communion <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a dossal curtain {{is set in a}} crenellated Tudor Gothic wooden surround between {{two sets of}} organ pipes. On either side are the choir risers. The stained glass windows are set in a geometric pattern, each one having a diagonal stripe suggesting heraldric origin, with a floral design in yellow or pink at the top.|$|E
25|$|Mathieu {{began her}} career by {{participating}} in an annual singing contest in Avignon called On Chante dans mon Quartier (We sing in my neighborhood). Photos depict the affair as rather drab with a cheap curtain and one projector light. The stage was only twenty feet square, and the singer having to share that with a large piano and musicians. One cannot help but notice the large, boisterous, and mostly young audience. The judges sat at a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract {{in the weeks before}} the show was allowed to sing. Talent scouts made this a worthwhile event for singers within hundreds of kilometers to participate in.|$|E
50|$|When she {{directed}} {{a play on}} radio, she {{did not believe in}} letting the actors sit at <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> microphones reading the script. When a man was supposed to run, she had the actor run and then speak his lines rather than imitate a panting sound.|$|R

2500|$|Like {{the biblical}} shewbread, the Babylonians and Assyrians {{generally}} laid twelve cakes/loaves, or an integer multiple of twelve cakes/loaves, on <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> images of their deities; the number twelve, {{which is so}} prominent in the shewbread rite, has always borne mysterious religious significance, and with the Assyrian practice of laying out twelve cakes/loaves, [...] was directly connected with the Zodiac. The Babylonian cakes/bread were also required to be sweet (i.e. unleavened), and like the biblical shewbread were baked from wheat flour.|$|R
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
500|$|Her {{influence}} {{with the public}} was again demonstrated when sales of Riesling wine increased by 30% in the UK after she had incorporated it into her Coq au Riesling recipe on Nigella Express. In December 2007 she appeared on BBC's The Graham Norton Show and revealed that she had once eaten 30 pickled eggs for a £1,000 bet, saying [...] "How stupid to challenge me! I made them all put their money on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> me. The next day I had scrambled eggs for breakfast." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1856, a {{few years}} after the {{establishment}} of the “Abode of Love”, Prince and Zoe Patterson, one of his virginal female followers, engaged in public ceremonial sexual intercourse on a billiard <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a large audience. The scandal led to the secession of some of his most faithful friends, who were unable any longer to endure what they regarded as the amazing mixture of blasphemy and immorality offered for their acceptance. The most prominent of those who remained received such titles as the [...] "Anointed Ones", the [...] "Angel of the Last Trumpet", the [...] "Seven Witnesses" [...] and so forth.|$|E
60|$|Satisfied {{with what}} he had learned he passed out onto the {{sidewalk}} and crossed the street to a saloon. Some soldiers and citizens were drinking at little <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the bar. A couple of card games were in progress, and through the open rear doorway Billy saw a little gathering encircling a cock fight.|$|R
60|$|The tap-room was low {{and narrow}} and dark. Round the once {{whitewashed}} walls there were rows of wooden benches with narrow trestle <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them. Opposite the front door, on a larger table, were the bottles of wine and silvorium,[6] the jars of tobacco and black cigars, which a beneficent government licensed Ignácz Goldstein the Jew to sell to the peasantry.|$|R

500|$|Leslie {{decides to}} confront Tammy directly, {{only to find}} Tammy {{seems to be a}} {{friendly}} woman who instantly agrees to let Leslie have Lot 48 as a [...] "professional courtesy". Impressed, Leslie brings Tammy to the parks department so she can talk to Ron and work out their differences. Tammy and an agitated Ron go off to have coffee, and Donna (Retta) insists to Leslie that the arrangement is a mistake because the two act crazy when they are together. At a local diner, Ron and Tammy immediately start a very loud argument {{in front of the other}} patrons. Moments later, however, the two are publicly making out on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> everyone. The two rush off to a motel, where they frantically remove their clothing before even entering the building.|$|E
500|$|Travelling with Irwin was Ensign Robert Dale, who {{had somehow}} {{acquired}} Yagan's head. According to the historian Paul Turnbull, Dale {{appears to have}} persuaded Irwin to let him have the head as an [...] "anthropological curiosity". After arriving in London, Dale tried to sell the head to scientists, approaching a number of anatomists and phrenologists. His price of ₤20 failed to find a buyer, so he made an agreement with Thomas Pettigrew for the exclusive use of the head for 18 months. Pettigrew, a surgeon and antiquarian, was {{well known in the}} London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and autopsied Egyptian mummies. He displayed the head on a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a panoramic view of King George Sound reproduced from Dale's sketches. For effect, the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the red-tailed black cockatoo.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Final Ending", Cosmo {{is angry}} with the Lead Eliminator, who {{constantly}} attacks his family and godchild, so he transforms into a giant creature named [...] "Cos-zilla", {{a reference to the}} Japanese movie monster Godzilla. During Timmy's and his fairies' revisit the Blue Moon, they run into Turbo Thunder, who tells them how alone in the universe he was after the rock guardian threw him over the planet's horizon. Since then, he made a personified friend, a rock with a happy face, similar to Chuck Noland's companion Wilson the volleyball in the 2000 drama film Cast Away. In his flashback, Turbo Thunder receives an invitation flyer to the [...] "Chosen One Competition" [...] in Fairy World. On the flyer, the phrase [...] "Chosen One" [...] is printed in American Idol font. At the competition venue, the four fairy elders sit as judges behind a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the auditioners like the American Idol judges do.|$|E
50|$|A new gallery for the East Asian {{collection}} was opened in 2006, increasing the exhibition space by a quarter. It {{was created in}} a matter of months by the New York architect Peter Marino with a mixture of classical and modern elements. In the modern section, Japanese blue-and-white porcelain is presented on historic <b>tables,</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> panels lacquered with anthracite grey and cinnabar. Marino carried out further redesigns in 2010.|$|R

From this hall several chambers lead off, one to the burial-shaft. These chambers have Ptolemaic paintings, and show that the tomb was reused at this time.|$|R
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{portrait}} of Sigmund Freud in close-up, then shows a picture of Farmer's mother. The song's lyrics are subtitled. Still images of Farmer are then shown in silhouette wearing a white and transparent nightgown. With each line of the song, an image of Farmer appears. When the chorus begins, Farmer turns blue and begins to dance {{in front of a}} backdrop featuring stars and the moon. Three children are shown looking at Farmer. After another verse, which again features still images of Farmer, shots of the singer jumping are intercut with shots of her singing along with the track with her arms clutched to her breast. Afterwards Farmer and the three children are shown holding placards with the words [...] "Maman a tort". Following another verse the singer's decapitated head is pictured on a plate on a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the children who are holding knives and forks. The singer is again shown in blue and cries before being slapped in the face. A low-angle shot of Farmer shows her readjusting the strap of her nightgown and is intercut with images of her in silhouette. The video ends with a portrait of Freud.|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
500|$|The {{video of}} [...] "Jealous" [...] was {{considered}} to be a sequel to the one for the previous clip on the album, [...] "Partition". It opens with Beyoncé watching a man while he is sitting on a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her, reading a newspaper. She stands up and the scene transitions to the singer walking down the stairs in a mansion, wearing a gown. It continues with Beyoncé, sitting alone at an arranged table for dinner, waiting for her love interest to come home. As she waits for him, at one point she angrily sweeps the crystal, dinnerware and candles from the table with her hands as he does not show up. Afterwards, she dresses in a red leather trench coat with a gold choker and goes outside to look for her man. She is seen on a street surrounded by various fans taking pictures of her. The scenes also transition to the singer being at a party in a bar, chatting with people, holding a drink in her hands and straddling a pinball machine. As the song nears its end, sped-up scenes of a car driving on different streets follows. During the end, Beyoncé runs to a man who is seen only from the back, dressed in a hooded coat. She embraces him with teary eyes, sighing with relief. Throughout the video, close-up shots of the singer are also featured, showing her expressions. Beyoncé is seen wearing a high-waist corset and a cropped lace top designed by Ulyana Sergeenko with her look being complete with an earring. She also wears a studded plate cuff, a chain, and a gold bracelet from jewelry by Eddie Borgo. During scenes at the party, she wears a sweatshirt designed by Givenchy.|$|E

25|$|There are two Fourth Avenue Street Fairs, in December {{and late}} March/early April, staged between 9th Street and University Boulevard, that feature {{arts and crafts}} booths, food vendors and street performers.

50|$|The Democracy Wall is {{a public}} {{bulletin}} board that allows students, alumni and teachers to freely express their personal opinions, exchange their views on school policies, political point of views or academic theories. The school will also post official responses on the wall according to some particular issues. It acts as a public forum for the university community. There are also <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the wall with various leaflets and books on display, providing further information {{for those interested in}} particular issues.|$|R
2500|$|Officer's skat (German: [...] ) is {{a variant}} for two players. Each player gets 16 {{cards on the}} <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him, 8 facing down and 8 {{on top of each}} of them with face shown. Bidding is {{replaced}} by declaring a game type and trump by the companion. When a top card is played, the hidden card is uncovered, making a total of 16 tricks in that game. Scoring is like normal skat.|$|E
2500|$|Walker {{probably}} never expected {{the level of}} intense scrutiny from Auburn that would accompany design and planning of the murals and the supporting exhibits. [...] Not only Walker’s Extension Service sponsors but also U.S. Department of Agriculture employees became intimately involved in the planning, offering detailed instructions even for the selection and placement of the objects for display in the foreground of the murals. For example, each mural {{was to have a}} drapery border and a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> it filled with produce, farm implements, or household items that would complete the artwork.|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{with the}} {{player on the}} dealer's left, each player in turn lays one card face up on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him or her, stating the count—that is, the {{cumulative}} value of the cards that have been laid (for example, the first player lays a five and says [...] "five", the next lays a six and says [...] "eleven", and so on)—without the count going above 31. The cards are not laid in {{the centre of the}} table as, {{at the end of the}} [...] "play," [...] each player needs to pick up the cards they have laid.|$|E
