40|$|Contractors in the Dutch civil {{construction}} industry are adopting Systems Engineering (SE) into their work processes, {{to manage the}} increasingly complex and multi-disciplinary nature <b>of</b> their projects. <b>The</b> <b>implementation</b> rate <b>of</b> SE is low due to unknown problems caused by multiple factors. Currently, there is no overview of the factors affecting <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> rate <b>of</b> SE in the Dutch civil {{construction industry}} and how these should be managed. Through {{review of existing literature}} and case studies on civil construction projects, a list of factors affecting <b>the</b> successful <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> SE has been formulated and their relative effect on <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> rate <b>of</b> SE is determined. In this article six key problem areas are identified, which negatively influence <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> rate <b>of</b> SE. We propose that contractors adopt a single, independent organizational entity in their organization for process and SE management, who implicitly implement SE within the standard working procedures. Towards the client, these procedures depend on the level of SE-maturity of the client. This approach helps contractors to manage the identified problem areas, thereby improving <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> rate <b>of</b> SE in their organizations.
