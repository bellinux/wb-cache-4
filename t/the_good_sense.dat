In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to the university to teach in the coming academic year.

500|$|During an {{interview}} with entertainment website Digital Spy Dennis discussed Paul's later relationships in depth. Paul's relationship with Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) was short lived, he mistreated her but ultimately in a twist for the character, he did the right thing. Dennis describes this as: [...] "The Lyn story was quite sincere, but he had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> {{on the day of}} the wedding to tell her that he was no good. So he obviously cared about Lyn, but then she came back and haunted him." [...] His relationship with Rebecca Napier (Jane Hall) at times can be fiery, of this Dennis said: [...] "I want to see Paul and Rebecca be like Angie and Dirty Den. I think Rebecca is capable of that. She plays a fiery character and is a very strong. Paul needs somebody who is absolutely there for him and adores him, but will take no shit from him and stand up and fight as hard as she does." ...|$|E

Faced with the underdetermination of theory by evidence thesis and the continuity thesis, Duhem tried to account for the ability of scientists to choose theories that continuously grow to a natural classification. I will examine <b>the</b> concept of <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> and <b>the</b> problems that stem from it. I will also present a recent attempt by David Stump to link <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> to virtue epistemology.

In the light of this reconstruction of <b>good</b> <b>sense,</b> I will propose a possible way to interpret <b>the</b> concept of <b>good</b> <b>sense,</b> which overcomes <b>the</b> noted problems and fits better with Duhem 2 ̆ 7 s views on scientific method and motivation in developing <b>the</b> concept of <b>good</b> <b>sense...</b>|$|R

500|$|Commentators {{claimed that}} Chapman {{was not a}} subtle captain and lacked {{tactical}} astuteness. Even so, his record is better than most others who led England during Chapman's career. Pelham Warner believed that Chapman started well, but that in the later stages of 1930, his tactical sense markedly deteriorated. On the other hand, several of Chapman's contemporaries believed him {{to be one of}} the best captains. Arthur Gilligan, one of Chapman's predecessors, considered him to be a model for the role, and Bert Oldfield, who played against Chapman as Australia's wicket-keeper, thought that Chapman possessed an [...] "aptitude" [...] for leadership. Chapman's teams were usually harmonious and his sympathetic handling of his players often brought out the best in them. Writing in 1943, Robertson-Glasgow said: [...] "He knew his men as perhaps no other captain of modern times has known them." [...] Cricket writer E. W. Swanton believes that Chapman's cavalier reputation was misleading in assessing his effectiveness, and that [...] "underlying the boyish facade was both a shrewd cricket brain and <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> to ask advice from those of greater experience." ...|$|E

Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger called it [...] "one of the best, most moving scenes of the finale". Noel Murray from The A.V.

The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought their decision not to participate [...] "all but solidified them as the 'Adam and Eve' [...] from the caves", although this was shown {{not to be the}} case in season six.

[...] From 1899, he was librarian of the Carol I Academic Foundation and Professor of Aesthetics and Art History at the National School of Fine Arts. As Tzigara later acknowledged, his introduction to royalty came through {{a relationship with the}} Kremnitzes, his neighbors on Polonă Street, Dorobanți. This period saw the start of Tzigara's close relationship with Carol, whom the art historian later called [...] "my most generous protector" [...] and [...] "the sovereign [...] ". Received into royal circles, he was a confidant of the Queen Consort and cultural patron, Elisabeth of Wied, whom he called [...] "the animator of Romanian art". For a while, he was her private secretary, helping her fulfill her literary ambitions under the Carmen Sylva signature.
