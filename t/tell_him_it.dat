5|$|Scully debriefs the FBI {{panel and}} {{explains}} that Mulder {{was a victim}} of an elaborate conspiracy and that she was given a fatal disease by someone in the room. As she is about to present her evidence, her nose bleeds and she collapses. Mulder brings the vial he found to the Lone Gunmen, who <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> is not a cure, only deionized water.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{brings the}} device to the Lone Gunmen, who <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> is {{emitting}} some kind of signal. Mulder contacts Scully, who is growing increasingly paranoid. Hearing possible clicks while {{on the phone with}} Mulder, she frantically searches her hotel room for monitoring devices. When Mulder knocks at her door, Scully fires her weapon at it and runs off. Mulder believes her to be suffering from paranoid psychosis. The Lone Gunmen believe {{the device to}} be some sort of subliminal mind control device. Mulder was not affected due to his color blindness. The police find a body they believe to be that of Scully, but Mulder confirms that it is not her. Mulder is unable to contact Scully's mother, leading him to go to her house. He finds Scully there, who aims a gun at him. Scully claims Mulder never trusted her and blames him for her abduction and her sister's murder. Scully's mother calms her down, and she is hospitalized.|$|E
25|$|If {{the reader}} has also {{received}} {{the benefit of}} the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> <b>It</b> will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.|$|E

500|$|Miles Morales first {{appears in}} Ultimate Comics: Fallout #4, which was {{published}} in August 2011, in which he foils a murder by Kangaroo, a short time after Peter Parker's death. He wears a Spider-Man costume similar to Peter Parker's, but considers changing it when spectators <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> is in [...] "bad taste".|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{accounts}} in apocryphal literature {{built on the}} accounts of the crucifixion darkness. The Gospel of Peter, probably from the second century, expanded on the canonical gospel accounts in creative ways. As one writer puts it, [...] "accompanying miracles become more fabulous and the apocalyptic portents are more vivid". In this version, the darkness which covers the whole of Judaea leads people to go about with lamps believing it to be night. The fourth century Gospel of Nicodemus describes how Pilate {{and his wife are}} disturbed by a report of what had happened, and the Judeans he has summoned <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was an ordinary solar eclipse. Another text from the fourth century, the purported Report of Pontius Pilate to Tiberius, claimed the darkness had started at the sixth hour, covered the whole world, and during the subsequent evening the full moon resembled blood for the entire night. In a fifth- or sixth-century text by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the author claims to have observed a solar eclipse from Heliopolis {{at the time of the}} crucifixion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film press}} reported, {{around the time}} of the North American release of The Ninth Gate, {{creative}} friction between Depp and Polanski. Depp said, [...] "It's the director's job to push, to provoke things out of an actor". Polanski said of Depp, [...] "He decided to play it rather flat, which wasn't how I envisioned it; and I didn't <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> wasn't how I saw it". Visually, in the neo-noir genre style, rare-book dealer Dean Corso's disheveled grooming derives from Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's quintessential literary private investigator.|$|E
2500|$|Major Rodney Grierson and his wife, Janet, are at Evensong. She is praying desperately for {{a miracle}} cure for their son, Alan, who is {{thirteen}} and mildly retarded. Arriving home after the service, Alan greets them with a strange creature he has found in the garden. Part frog, it has wings and feathers and is a mutation caused by a leak some time ago from a local research station on the downs. Alan tells them he has named the creature a [...] "Raphion" [...] and he has named it and other strange creatures {{with the help of}} his [...] "friend" [...] who is down the bottom of the garden. Alan wants to know where they have been and what a [...] "church" [...] is. His parents <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> is God's house. After supper, Alan asks permission to go back down to the bottom of the garden and help his [...] "friend" [...] continue to name the new species. His parents say yes and Alan meets up with his [...] "friend" [...] again. As they continue to name the new animals, Alan asks Him if He is God. He says yes and when asked if he lives in a church, he replies, [...] "I live in many places… But sometimes, in the cool of the evening, I walk in a garden – with a friend and talk about the New World…” ...|$|E
