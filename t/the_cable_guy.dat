40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} a guyed tower is presented. A computer program is developed to analyze, design, and estimate the mass and {{the total cost of}} a guyed tower. Matrix stiffness method is used for the static analysis of the mast. The non-linearity due to axial loads is accounted for by using the geometric stiffness matrix. <b>The</b> <b>cable</b> analysis including <b>the</b> change in sag of a <b>guy</b> <b>cable</b> due to change in tension is presented. An iterative procedure is adopted to satisfy compatibility conditions of guy attachment points. Four loading conditions are considered in the design. Structural steel angles are considered for the design of members of the mast. Guy strands and bridge strands are considered for <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>cables</b> and deadman anchorages are adopted for guy anchorages. Variation in the mass and the total cost of a guyed tower due to the variation in (a) inclination of diagonal web members, (b) radial distance of guy anchor points, (c) height of guy connection points, and (d) size of the mast, are studied.

They learn that they must protect a symbolic Daisy mannequin from several sharp-shooting paintballers as they take it from the limo, to the [...] "red carpet", and then to the [...] "stage door". The men are divided into three teams of four and the teams must run their Daisy mannequin from location to location and the team with the least damaged Daisy mannequin will win the challenge and a date with Daisy. The Beige Team goes first with Cage as the first runner. Cage tries to protect the mannequin, but after getting hit so many times with paintballs, he says he begins to black out and the mannequin splits in half. Cage hands it to Brooklyn, who screams and soon hands it off to 6 Gauge. 6 Gauge hands it off to <b>Cable</b> <b>Guy</b> and <b>Cable</b> <b>Guy</b> actually falls on top of the mannequin, crushing many of its parts.

The Black Team defends the mannequin the best so, Sinister, London, Chi Chi and 12 Pack all win a date with Daisy and grants Sinister a VIP date for his good performance. After the challenge, Brooklyn thanks Daisy for his second chance, but says he lied to Daisy because he was drunk and says he is still in love with his ex-girlfriend. He says he is [...] "throwing in the towel". Riki becomes infuriated and accuses Brooklyn of lying and criticizes him for hurting Daisy. Daisy says he was just wasting her time and that she does not need him. Daisy decides to bring all the guys to a club where they can all [...] "let loose". While most of the guys battle for her attention and spend time with her, she forgets Sinisters VIP date, but he says he will let it go because it was the [...] "rockstar thing to do". She also gets angry with Fox because she says that everyone was trying to spend time with her except for him. When confronted about it, Fox told her {{he does not want to}} compete with twelve other guys. The next day, Daisy has a romantic art date with 12 Pack, Sinister, Chi Chi, and London, where she paints on their bodies and they paint on her. 12 Pack opens up a lot and talks about his past love life. Sinister connects with Daisy and kisses her, which makes Chi Chi jealous. Chi Chi then kisses Daisy all over her body, which she found creepy. London connects very well with Daisy and she says he could be the one she is looking for. After <b>the</b> date, <b>Cable</b> <b>Guy</b> connects with Daisy and she likes his honesty, but says that he is not aggressive enough for this competition. Flex and Daisy share one-on-one time, and he makes her laugh a lot and Daisy forms a strong connection with him. Toolbox gets drunk and tells the other contestants that he is not [...] "feeling Daisy for shit" [...] and does not have a connection with her, which angers Flex. At elimination, she gives the first chain to Flex, followed by Sinister, London, 6 Gauge, 12 Pack, Big Rig, Cage, Chi Chi, and Fox. She sends home <b>Cable</b> <b>Guy</b> due to his lack of aggression. She was going to give Tool Box the last chain, but is informed by Flex that Tool Box said he did not have a connection with her.
