40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2016. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 53 - 55). Government is implementing e-GP to improve transparency and efficiency in Public Procurement. As a Government Organization, Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) is using e-GP in procurement activity to ensure transparency and accountability of using public fund. It is a great responsibility for the Executive Engineers to ensure utilization of public funds properly. Failure in Procurement process operation may increase cost and time and slow down development of Bangladesh. In DPHE, Executive Engineers act as Procurement Entities and Assistant Engineers & Sub-assistant Engineers participate in evaluation and <b>tender</b> <b>opening</b> process as members. Most of the Sub-Assistant Engineers have lacked computer literacy and not all Assistant and Sub-Assistant Engineers have computer and internet facility. Evaluating the inefficiencies in procurement process operation will help to identify the knowledge gaps and will help to mitigate the issues identified. Qualitative Research was conducted to address the research questions. The study was limited on the Executive Engineers of Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) due to time constrain. After analyzing the interviewed documents {{it was found that}} all respondents talked about Server Incapability, Unplanned Training, and troublesome BOQ uploading process as Procurement Process Operation inefficiency. Other inefficiencies were Supplier Selection failure due to Corrupted File Upload, Lengthy Document Verification, lack of knowledge, lack of logistics Support and reinventing the wheel for two tenders having same documenting. Generally causes behind these inefficiencies were uncertain server downtime, unplanned training, lack of training database, lack of motivation, lack of computer literacy, lack of computer availability and internet facility, absence of conversion software, lengthy manual evaluation. The consequences of these inefficiencies were lengthy procurement cycle, extra workload on Procuring Entities, <b>tender</b> <b>opening</b> failure leading to extra added step like time extension approval in procurement cycle, lack of confidence, Lack of reliability of work, slowness of procurement activity, typing error, extra step of corrigendum for correcting typing error, lack of competition and litigation issue, prolonged tender preparation time, violation of code of ethics, risk of erroneous and biased evaluation and litigation problem and added extra cost and time in tender preparation. The mitigation of these inefficiencies include controlling number of tenders to be floated in e-GP system each year, upgrading server, planned training, proper motivation and use of reward power, developing a cloud document verification and storage system, implementing Central Technical Support Service at DPHE and ensuring computer and internet facilities.

60|$|Here, too, was the breeding-place of the {{beautiful}} black-and-white stilt, and of other species too many to mention. But my greatest delight was in finding breeding in this place a bird I loved {{more than all the}} others I have named--a species of marsh trupial, a bird {{about the size of the}} common cowbird, and like it, of a uniform deep purple, but with a cap of chestnut-coloured feathers on its head. I loved this bird for its song--the peculiar delicate <b>tender</b> <b>opening</b> notes and trills. In spring and autumn large flocks would occasionally visit our plantation, and the birds in hundreds would settle on a tree and all sing together, producing a marvellous and beautiful noise, as of hundreds of small bells all ringing at one time. It was by the water I first found their breeding-place, where about three or four hundred birds had their nests quite near together, and nests and eggs and the plants on which they were placed, with the solicitous purple birds flying round me, made a scene of enchanting beauty. The nesting-site was on a low swampy piece of ground grown over with a semi-aquatic plant called durasmillo in the vernacular. It has a single white stalk, woody in appearance, two to three feet high, and little thicker than a man's middle finger, with a palm-like crown of large loose lanceolate leaves, so that it looks like a miniature palm, or rather an ailanthus tree, which has a slender perfectly white bole. The solanaceous flowers are purple, and it bears fruit the size of cherries, black as jet, in clusters of three to five or six. In this forest of tiny palms the nests were hanging, attached to the boles, where two or three grew close together; it was a long and deep nest, skilfully made of dry sedge leaves woven together, and the eggs were white or skim-milk blue spotted with black at the large end.|$|R

In the opera, the aria {{is placed in the}} third act, after Gérard's aria [...] "", another famous aria which showcases the baritone playing Gérard. Comprising a range between C4 to B5, the tessitura of the aria lies in the octave between F4 and F5, with the second section lying higher than the first section. The instrumentation of the aria is especially effective, for example the string tremolo which suggested the fires that destroyed Maddalena's home. The aria itself is divided into two sections: a <b>tender</b> melancholic <b>opening</b> part which recalls Maddalena's misadventures; and a heroic second part, full of high arching phrases, which suggested the voice of the god of love. An oppure was written by Giordano as alternative to accommodate the climactic top B, providing shorter phrases and two full measure rests. A performance takes about five minutes.|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to discuss}} the process of {{concluding}} contracts resulting from public tender, and its comparison with the draft law on procurement procedures approved by the Czech government. The thesis describes the current legislation on concluding contracts resulting from public tender and its subsequent amendments in three separate chapters. The first chapter briefly defines the basic terminology of the public procurement procedure, which is crucial for {{the whole process of}} concluding public procurement contracts. The second chapter deals with selected aspects of conclusion of public procurement contracts in open procedure. These aspects are commencing of tender procedure, boundness of the submission of <b>tender,</b> security, <b>opening</b> of envelopes with submissions, and the selection of the best submission and obligations of public authorities after conclusion of public procurement contract. Chapter three is the most detailed part of the thesis, which deals with changes in public procurement contracts.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 58 - 59). Transparency, efficiency, accountability, competitiveness, equitable treatment and free & fair competition are essential for using public funds. To streamline these objectives through public procurement, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2006 and thereafter issued Public Procurement Rules (PPR) 2008. The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) is continually monitoring the compliance procurement activities in 04 target agencies {{in the light of}} 45 predetermined Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Among the four target agencies, LGED and RHD are the largest in terms of budget allocation against the projects in the Annual Development Programme (ADP). It is generally said that a total of 80 % of ADP allocation are spent for procurement of goods, works and services. Thus, {{it seems to be a}} good consideration to have a look at the compliance issues of PPR 2008 in RHD and LGED’s procurement activities. The present study seeks to provide an assessment of the current procurement performance of LGED & RHD and to find out the gap of compliance with scope of improvement for implementation of PPR 2008. A semi structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data from randomly selected 60 procurement practitioners working in LGED (30) and RHD (30). The Responses were analyzed by using SPSS 17 version package. The related literatures and reports, particularly from LGED and SRGB, have been thoroughly reviewed before conducting the main research work. The key findings of these reports have been compared and analyzed to draw conclusion of the study. The highest proportion of the respondent was middle aged and male. Majority of them were from engineering background with post graduate education and were trained in public procurement. The study found that LGED performed better in respect of KPI 4 (Percentage of Tenders following Development Partner Rules), KPI 6 (Average number of days between publishing of advertisement and Tender submission deadline), KPI 7 (Percentage of Tenders having sufficient tender submission time), KPI 10 (Ratio of number of Tender submission and number of Tender document sold), KPI 11 (Percentage of cases TOC included at least ONE member from TEC) and KPI 12 (Percentage of cases TEC formed by Contract Approving Authority) and KPI 13 (Percentage of cases TEC included two external members outside the Ministry or Division), KPI 14 (Average number of days between <b>Tender</b> <b>opening</b> and completion of evaluation), KPI 15 (Percentage of cases Tender evaluation has been completed within timeline), KPI 16 (Average number of responsive Tenders), KPI 19 (Average number of days taken between submission of Tender Evaluation and approval of contract), KPI 22 (Percentage of cases contract award decision made within timeline by Contract Approving Authority after submitting Tender Evaluation Report), KPI 23 (Percentage of cases TER reviewed by person/ committee other than the Contract Approving Authority), KPI 25 (Average number of days between final approval and Notification of Award (NOA), KPI 27 (Average number of days between Invitation for Tender (IFT) and Notification of Award), KPI 32 (Percentage of Contracts fully completed and accepted). On the other hand RHD complied better on KPI 8 (Average number of Tenderers purchased Tender Documents), KPI 17 (Percentage of cases TEC recommended for Re- Tendering), KPI 20 (Percentage of Tenders approved by the proper financial delegated authority), KPI 24 (Percentage of Tenders approved by higher tier than the Contract Approving Authority), KPI 28 (Percentage of Contract awards published in CPTU’s website), KPI 34 (Percentage of cases (considering each installment as a case) with delayed payment), KPI 38 (Percentage of cases complaints have been resolved), KPI 41 (Percentage of Contracts with unresolved disputes), and KPI 44 (Percentage of procuring entity which has at least one trained/ certified procurement staff). The perceptions of the respondents regarding procurement performance need to investigate more cautiously as there are ambiguity among the findings of present study, individual consultant’s reports and SRGB’s report. The scenario may be more or less similar in other target agencies. Although LGED is being complied better than RHD against most of the KPIs, there is scope and need for improvement to have a 100 % compliance of PPR 2008 in both of the organizations. Abu Sayed Md.

50|$|For the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, a {{total of}} eight sports venues were used.

After the 1976 Games, the venues have remained in use, hosting events in Nordic skiing and the sliding sports.

6000|$|Nor is Dr. Currie's {{performance}} censurable {{from these}} considerations alone; for information, {{which would have}} been of absolute worth if in his capacity of biographer and editor he had known when to stop short, is rendered unsatisfactory and inefficacious through the absence of this reserve, and from being coupled with statements of improbable and irreconcileable facts. We have the author's letters discharged upon us in showers; but how few readers will take the trouble of comparing those letters with each other, and with the other documents of the publication, in order to come at a genuine knowledge of the writer's character!--The life of Johnson by Boswell had broken through many pre-existing delicacies, and afforded the British public an opportunity of acquiring experience, which before it had happily wanted; nevertheless, at the time when the ill-selected medley of Burns's correspondence first appeared, little progress had been made (nor is it likely that, by the mass of mankind, much ever will be made) in determining what portion of these confidential communications escapes the pen in courteous, yet often innocent, compliance--to gratify the several tastes of correspondents; and as little towards distinguishing opinions and sentiments uttered for the momentary amusement merely of the writer's own fancy, from those which his judgment deliberately approves, and his heart faithfully cherishes. But the subject of this book was a man of extraordinary genius; whose birth, education, and employments had placed and kept him in a situation far below that in which the writers and readers of expensive volumes are usually found. Critics upon works of fiction have laid it down as a rule that remoteness of place, in fixing the choice of a subject, and in prescribing the mode of treating it, is equal in effect to distance of time;--restraints may be thrown off accordingly. Judge then of the delusions which artificial distinctions impose, when to a man like Doctor Currie, writing with views so honourable, the social condition of the individual of whom he was treating, could seem to place him at such a distance from the exalted reader, that ceremony might he discarded with him, and his memory sacrificed, as it were, almost without compunction. The poet was laid where these injuries could not reach him; but he had a parent, I understand, an admirable woman, still surviving; a brother like Gilbert Burns!--a widow estimable for her virtues; and children, at that time infants, with the world before them, which they must face to obtain a maintenance; who remembered their father probably with the <b>tenderest</b> affection;--and whose <b>opening</b> minds, as their years advanced, would become conscious of so many reasons for admiring him.--Ill-fated child of nature, too frequently thine own enemy,--unhappy favourite of genius, too often misguided,--this is indeed to be 'crushed beneath the furrow's weight!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Town {{were now}} {{a force to}} be {{reckoned}} with in the Northern League and they won the League Challenge Cup in 1993-94, when they beat Blyth Spartans 2-0 in the final at Brandon. But this was to be the last game that Northallerton Town Football Club was to play. Disaster struck during the summer of 1994 when they were declared financially insolvent in the High Court and were ordered to close down. Had this happened during the playing season then there is not much doubt that the club would have folded. Fortunately there was still time before the new season started for a local businessman to come forward and rescue the club, this despite vandals breaking into the ground and daubing slogans on the stand walls and breaking all the windows in the clubhouse. [...] A new committee was formed and the club was able to kick off the 1994-95 season under the new name of Northallerton F.C. 1994. Still in the First Division of the Northern League, the opening game was Northallerton, League Cup winners, against Durham City, League Champions, in the annual Cleator Cup. After playing a 1-1 draw after extra time, Durham won the cup on penalties.With no money available to reimburse players there was a mass exodus, and many players from local football leagues were brought in. Although these players gave their all it was no surprise when they were relegated at the end of season 1994-95. [...] During season 1995-96, the Club gradually got back on its feet, but after a poor <b>opening</b> the <b>Committee</b> decided that players could once again be reimbursed and many of the club’s former players returned resulting in the Club finishing in a respectable 5th place in the league. During the summer of 1996 the Club was allowed to reinstate the name “Town” to once again become Northallerton Town Football Club (1994), and under the joint guidance of the management duo of Mickey Sell and John Woods, they won promotion back to the First Division when they won the Second Division Championship. For personal reasons both Sell and Woods resigned as joint managers at the end of 1996-97, although both remained at the club, Woods as assistant manager and Sell as an occasional player. [...] After making a disastrous start to life back in the First Division (winning just three points from the first twelve games) the Club appointed former Bristol Rovers, Middlesbrough, Carlisle United and Darlington star Archie Stephens as their manager. But they fared no better, and, after finishing second bottom, they were relegated back to the Second Division. Stephens, and his assistant Woods, left the club by mutual consent at the end of the season. [...] Peter Mulcaster was appointed manager at the start of the 1998-99 season, and he guided the club to a commendable fourth place in the league. But in the February of his second season (1999-00), with the club lying in third place and one of the favourites for promotion, he surprised the club with his shock resignation in order to take the vacant manager’s job at Spennymoor United. [...] He was replaced as manager by the experienced ex-Guisborough Town boss Micky Hodgson, but after failing to win promotion at the first attempt, Hodgson and his assistant Peter Bell left the club at the end of season 2000-01. [...] Peter Mulcaster returned to take over for his second spell as team manager at the start of the 2001-02 season, but after two seasons in charge and failing to get the team promoted, it was mutually agreed that he should leave the club at the end of season 2002-03. The very experienced former Whitby Town captain Paul Burton was appointed manager at the start of the 2003-04 season. Under Burton, Town regained First Division status when they finished runners-up in Division Two at the end of the 2005-06 season, where they also reached the final of the North Riding Senior Cup for the first time in their history - losing 3-1 to York City at Bootham Crescent. [...] The following season (2006-07) they again reached the Senior Cup final - losing 5-0 to a strong Middlesbrough side at Billingham Synthonia. Burton surprised the club at the end of the season by handing in his resignation for what he claims were personal reasons. [...] He was replaced by the vastly experienced Andy Toman, who lives in the Town, but he resigned after just the one season. Toman was replaced by Alan Robinson, but on the eve of the season Robinson shocked the club with his resignation as he was going to start a new life in Thailand. [...] Ex-Doncaster Rovers player Martin Speight and former Norton & Stockton Ancients manager Stuart Dawson - who were to have been Robinson’s assistants - were appointed as joint managers, but following a run of poor results, Dawson left the club in early January. [...] Speight was then appointed sole manager but results failed to improve and, following the heavy 5-1 home defeat by Ashington at the end of March, he also resigned. [...] Mark Fanning, who had been part of the coaching staff at Darlington FC, took over and was at the Club for 4 season as manager. In 2012-13 Fanning guided the club to their first silverware in 18 years when they came from behind to beat Second Division champions Team Northumbria 3-2 in the final of the Ernest Armstrong Cup. Fanning and his assistant Martin Collins resigned in March 2013 so Peter Mulcaster returned to take over for a third time, initially until the end of the season. But following a good run of results which saw the club reach the final of the Ernest Armstrong Cup again, Mulcaster was offered the job on a permanent basis. Unfortunately Northallerton were beaten 3-1 in the final by West Allotment Celtic.|$|R
