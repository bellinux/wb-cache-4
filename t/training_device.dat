25|$|In the Pacific War, bombing {{missions}} were effectively {{conducted by}} both Japan and the Western Allies. Early in the war, Japanese carrier aircraft successfully destroyed or disabled the battleships of the United States Pacific Fleet at anchor in Hawaii, and they destroyed {{the great majority}} of bombers and defensive aircraft there and in the Philippine Islands. The US military were unable to make effective use of the single radar installation based in Hawaii (it was used part-time as a <b>training</b> <b>device)</b> and visual spotters in the Philippines that should have provided an early warning to their fighter squadrons. In later stages, US bombers effectively destroyed many Japanese cities with conventional or incendiary bombs before the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E

500|$|McMillan {{joined the}} Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory [...] near San Diego in August 1941. There {{he worked on}} a device called a polyscope. The idea, which came from Lawrence, was to use sonar {{to build up a}} visual image of the {{surrounding}} water. This proved to be far more difficult that doing so with radar, because of objects in the water and variations in water temperature that caused variations in the speed of sound. The polyscope proved to be impractical, and was abandoned. He also, however, developed a sonar <b>training</b> <b>device</b> for submariners, for which he received a patent.|$|E
500|$|In her 2006 book The Modern Amazons: Warrior Women On-Screen, Dominique Mainon {{writes that}} the film has anti-establishment themes and, unlike many comic-book {{adaptation}} films which feature [...] "gratuitous sexual objectification" [...] of women, Tank Girl stands out as being [...] "stridently feminist", {{with the exception of}} the [...] "cliché victim/avenger complex". According to Mainon, the film makes fun of female stereotypes, as shown by Tank Girl's repeated emasculation of Kesslee with witty comebacks while she is being tortured, and by her response to the computer <b>training</b> <b>device</b> telling her how to present herself to men at the Liquid Silver club. The device provides seductive clothing and tells Tank Girl to remove her body hair and to wear make-up and a wig. Tank Girl completely ignores the advice and modifies the clothes to create her own style.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} 747 was fully assembled, testing began on many {{components}} and systems. One important test involved {{the evacuation of}} 560 volunteers from a cabin mock-up via the aircraft's emergency chutes. The first full-scale evacuation took {{two and a half}} minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and several volunteers were injured. Subsequent test evacuations achieved the 90-second goal but caused more injuries. Most problematic was evacuation from the aircraft's upper deck; instead of using a conventional slide, volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel. Tests also involved taxiing such a large aircraft. Boeing built an unusual <b>training</b> <b>device</b> known as [...] "Waddell's Wagon" [...] (named for a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) that consisted of a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck. While the first 747s were still being built, the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper-deck position.|$|E

[...] The full-fidelity MTDS provides a true-to-life environment for training and evaluating the maintainers of multiple subsystems on the CH-53K platform. It supports maintenance training as well as remove-and-replace training for avionics systems, electrical systems, hydraulic systems, and other mechanical subsystems. [...] The HEMT uses a 3D virtual environment to support maintenance training scenarios. It will provide Marine CH-53K Enlisted Aircrew and maintainers with an accurate environment to train functional tests, fault isolation, troubleshooting, and remove and installation for 27 subsystems.|$|E

Seventy schools responded. The results show that 1) the use of <b>training</b> <b>devices</b> is more prevalent in FAA approved flight schools than other schools, 2) there is some confusion about device certification requirements, 3) training time {{does not appear to be}} correlated with the use of these devices, and 4) most of the tasks taught are focused on instrument pilot certification, 5) some schools appear to be using <b>training</b> <b>devices</b> for non-instrument tasks...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{suite of}} <b>training</b> <b>devices</b> for Army aviators {{is composed of}} single cockpit, stand-alone devices designed to support training appropriate for an individual aviator or a single crew. These <b>training</b> <b>devices,</b> while completely appropriate for individual aviator and crew training do not possess the networking and interoperability capability necessary to address collective, unit-level training of multiple crews. This inability to provide company/troop level collective training is to be corrected with the development and procurement of AVCATT-A. This paper will {{provide an overview of}} the total AVCATT-A training solution to meet stringent Army aviation collective training requirements. The AVCATT-A represents a different approach to both the level of training addressed and the fidelity of the <b>training</b> <b>devices.</b> AVCATT-A is intended to provide company/troop level training for Army aviation reconnaissance, attack, assault and support units via six networked, reconfigurable cockpits interacting with a rich synthetic battlespace housed in a mobile facility.
