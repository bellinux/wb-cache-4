40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} shows that a variety of washing procedures <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>external</b> contamination from hair have been proposed, but as yet no standardised procedures are available. In this study, methods for the pre-treatment and determination of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and selenium in human hair by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are developed. Investigations of various washing procedures <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>external</b> contaminants show that in unexposed hair samples cadmium, lead and mercury are significantly removed from hair using a 0. 1 M HCl wash, with 87, 73 and 5 %, respectively being washed-off. The removal of antimony, arsenic and chromium from unexposed hair is, however, more efficient with 1 % (v/v) sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), with 43, 40 and 13 % of each element, respectively being washed-off. Selenium is not removed from the hair by any of the washing methods studied. For the digestion of hair samples a digestion mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide is used. Experiments with simulated sweat spiked with each of these elements show that exogenously bound chromium, cadmium and lead are removed after washing with 0. 1 M HCl. In contrast, antimony, arsenic, selenium and mercury irreversibly bind and, thus, are not removed with any of the washing solutions investigated.

40|$|Hair has {{a number}} of {{advantages}} over more conventional sample types, such as serum, whole blood and urine, as an indicator of the intake and exposure to trace elements. While the analysis of these conventional sample types can only be used as a measure of recent exposure, hair, in contrast, can provide an historical record of exposure episodes. Furthermore the levels of trace elements in hair are higher than in blood and as a result small changes in intake are magnified. In addition, the collection of hair samples is non-invasive and the samples are easy to store. However, the difficulty in differentiating surface bound contamination from trace elements incorporated into the hair matrix complicates the interpretation of the hair analysis results. A review of the literature showed that a variety of washing procedures <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>external</b> contamination have been proposed but as yet no standardised procedures are available. In this study, methods for the pretreatment and determination of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and selenium in human hair by ICP-MS were developed.

The signal space separation (SSS) is accomplished by calculating individual basis vectors for each term of the functional expansion solution to create a signal basis covering all measurable signal vectors.

A total of 20 carcasses were selected from three packing plants across the United States, and round and loin subprimals from these carcasses were collected and transported to Texas A&M University. These subprimals were fabricated 14 to 21 d postmortem, dissected either raw or cooked, and divided to determine the amount of separable lean, separable fat, and refuse amounts per cut. Separable lean from these cuts was homogenized and proximate analyses were conducted in order to determine percent total chemical fat, protein, moisture, and ash. Cooking yields and fat retention values were determined for the cuts that were grilled and roasted. Cuts with <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> had higher cooking yields than cuts with <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> <b>removed.</b> Cuts with <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> had higher fat retention values than the cuts with no <b>external</b> <b>fat.</b> Dissection data indicated that cuts trimmed to lower levels of <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> had the highest values for percent lean and the lowest values for percent seam and <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> and bone-in cuts had the lowest values for percent lean and the highest values for percent refuse.

This thesis represents the third in a series of MSc theses on StructuralComponents, which as its general problem definition concerns providing more adequate early-stage design tools and dealing with imprecision and uncertainty. Both previous theses allowed the user to create a structural concept using the parametric and associative design paradigm. This thesis proposes a rewritten prototype implementation with similar functionality, and further incorporates new concepts.

A method {{based on a}} single, photosynthetic organism, where host effects are minimised, should offer more precision than carbon isotope studies of bulk lake sediments. Here we report {{the development of a}} systematic method for use on fossil lacustrine diatom frustules, adapted from previous studies in marine environments. A step-wise cleaning experiment on diatomaceous lake sediments from Lake Challa, near Mount Kilimanjaro, was made to demonstrate the necessary treatment stages <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>external</b> sedimentary carbon. Changes in soluble carbon compounds during these cleaning experiments were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

Carbon isotope analyses of diatom samples containing different species mixtures were performed and suggested that differences existed, although the effects lay within current experimental error and require further work. Unlike what was found in work on oxygen and silicon isotopes from diatom frustules, mineral contamination had no discernible impact on the diatom carbon isotope ratios from these sediments.

Current literature about decontamination strategies is mainly focused on external cocaine contamination and no consensus on the best decontamination procedure for hair samples containing cannabinoids has been reached so far. In this study, different protocols with solvents, both organic as well as aqueous, were tested on blank and drug user hair for their performance on <b>removing</b> <b>external</b> cannabis contamination originating from either smoke or indirect contact with cannabis plant material. Smoke contamination was mimicked by exposing hair samples to smoke from a cannabis cigarette and indirect contact contamination by handling hair with cannabis contaminated gloves or hands. Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels in the hair samples and wash solvents were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis. Aqueous surfactant solutions removed more THC contamination compared to water, but much less than organic solvents. Methanol, dichloromethane and chloroform were most efficient in removing THC contamination. Due to its lower environmental impact, methanol {{was chosen as the}} preferred decontamination solvent. After testing of different sequential wash steps on externally contaminated blank hair, three protocols performed equally well, removing all normal level and more than 99 % of unrealistically high levels of external cannabis contamination. Thorough testing on cannabis users’ hair, both as such and after deliberate contamination, showed that using these protocols all contamination could be washed from the hair while no incorporated THC was removed from truly positive samples. The present study provides detailed scientific evidence in support of the recommendations of the Society of Hair Testing: a protocol using a single methanol wash followed by a single aqueous SDS solution wash, followed by a Milli-Q water rinsing step, is suggested as the preferred decontamination protocol <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>external</b> cannabis contamination from hair while preserving the incorporated compounds...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{and urine}} {{are the most}} {{commonly}} used matrices for illicit drug testing, but since 1979 there has been an increasing interest in the development of analytical methods in alternative matrices such as hair [1]. Hair has the advantage of a substantially longer detection window (months to years) which enables retrospective investigation of chronic consumption. In addition, hair is a durable and stable matrix difficult to adulteration in which toxic substances are preconcentrated and remain for a long time without significant alterations; furthermore the sampling is not invasive. Indeed hair analysis of illicit drugs has recently been codified in the Italian legislation as a monitoring tool in the field of workplace safety. The critical step is certainly the extraction phase, usually performed by solid liquid extraction for multiclass methods; the main drawback is the long contact time (from 16 to 20 hours) between hair and solvent necessary to have good recoveries. Times are greatly reduced if the extraction is assisted by ultrasonic or increased temperature. Pressurized Liquid Extraction (PLE) was applied to significantly reduce extraction time since there are no PLE applications in this field. So a method based on HPLC-ESI-MS/MS has been developed and validated for multiresidual determination of illicit drugs from hair: amphetamine, methamphetamine, mescaline, MDA, MDMA, MDEA, cocaine, benzoylecgonine, nor-cocaine, ketamine, phencyclidine, diacetylmorphine, morphine, 6 -monoacetylmorphine, codeine. PLE led to reduce the analysis time and automate the extraction process, taking into account sample washing <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>external</b> contamination and the clean-up of the extracts.

Vizioli and colleagues examined the effect of face recognition impairment while subjects process same race (SR) or other race (OR) pictures. The research team devised a N170 experiment {{based on the premise that}} visual expertise plays a critical role in inversion, hypothesizing that viewers' greater level of expertise with SR faces (holistic processing) should elicit a stronger FIE compared to OR face stimuli. The authors recorded EEGs from Western Caucasian and East Asian subjects (two separate groups) who were presented with pictures of Western Caucasian, East Asian and African America faces in upright and inverted orientations. All the facial stimuli were cropped <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>external</b> features (i.e. hair, beards, hats, etc.). Both groups displayed a later N170 with larger amplitude (over the right hemisphere) for inverted than upright same-race (SR) faces, but showed no inversion effect for OR and AA photo stimuli. Moreover, no race effects were observed in regard to the peak amplitude of the N170 for upright faces in both groups of participants. The results also found no significant latency differences among the races of stimuli, but facial inversion did increase and delay the N170 amplitude and onset respectively. They conclude that the subjects' lack of experience with inverted faces makes processing such stimuli more difficult than pictures shown in their canonical orientation, regardless of what race the stimulus is.|$|R

At the present time, when increasing numbers of our population are being exposed to radiation because of the great increase in availability and use of radioactive isotopes {{and because of the}} potential exposure of much greater numbers of people to radiation following a possible atomic bomb burst or from disseminated radioactivity, the need for development of adequate therapy is becoming an increasingly pressing medical problem. In a consideration of possible approaches to therapy, one must distinguish between radiation front sources external to the body and radiation which results from radioactive materials which by some means or other have gained access into the body. Internally deposited radiation emitters can be particularly insidious since so many of them become fixed in the skeleton and are eliminated at very slow rates. While it is possible <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>external</b> sources of damaging radiation once the hazard is recognized, the internal radiation emitters often are not readily displaced and the body remains exposed to prolonged continued radiation. Where long-lived elements, such as plutonium with a biological half-life of the order of 100 years or radium with one of 45 years, are involved, the body can be subject to continuous radiation for the remainder of its lifetime. Moreover, because the radiation persists for such long periods of time, only minute amounts of certain radioelements, i. e., plutonium and radium, need have entered initially to produce considerable injury. The effects of this type of chronic exposure to radiation are well documented in the case reports on radium poisoning in workers in the luminous dial industry. The damage is manifest in various forms, i. e., severe anemia, osteitis, and osteogenic sarcoma.

40|$|The {{ability to}} measure the {{kinetics}} of vesicle release can help provide insight {{into some of the}} basics of neurotransmission. Here we used real-time imaging of vesicles labeled with FM dye to monitor the rate of presynaptic vesicle release. FM 4 - 64 is a red fluorescent amphiphilic styryl dye that embeds into the membranes of synaptic vesicles as endocytosis is stimulated. Lipophilic interactions cause the dye to greatly increase in fluorescence, thus emitting a bright signal when associated with vesicles and a nominal one when in the extracellular fluid. After a wash step is used <b>to</b> help <b>remove</b> <b>external</b> dye within the plasma membrane, the remaining FM is concentrated within the vesicles and is then expelled when exocytosis is induced by another round of electrical stimulation. The rate of vesicles release is measured from the resulting decrease in fluorescence. Since FM dye can be applied external and transiently, it is a useful tool for determining rates of exocytosis in neuronal cultures, especially when comparing the rates between transfected synapses and neighboring control boutons...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{existence}} of a trypsin-like enzyme (TLE) in acrosomes ofepididymal spermatozoa was confirmed and was further demonstrated {{to be present in}} acrosomes of ejaculated and capacitated spermatozoa. TLE rapidly removes the zona pellucida of the ovum. Extracts of acrosomes of ejaculated spermatozoa contain an inhibitor that is separated from the TLE by purification of the TLE. The inhibitor of TLE is also present in seminal plasma. This enzyme=m- enzyme inhibitor relationship appears analogous to the corona-removing enzyme-decapacitation factor relationship and part of capacitation very likely involves removal of the inhibitor from TLE and decapacitation factor from the corona-removing enzyme. TLE is inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor and less effectively by mercaptoethanol. Yamane (1935 a, b) showed that canine sperm extracts obtained by toluene treatment had the ability <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the <b>external</b> layers of ova and contained a trypsin-like enzyme (TLE). Buruiana (1956) also reported the presence of trypsin activity in spermatozoa of several species...|$|R
