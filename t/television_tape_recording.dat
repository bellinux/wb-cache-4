50|$|The {{original}} company, Radio H. Mende GmbH, {{was founded}} in 1923 by Otto Hermann Mende (1885-1940) in Dresden. Following {{the destruction of the}} plant during the bombing raids in 1945, Martin Mende (the founder's son) created a new company in Bremen in 1947, in a former Focke-Wulf plant, under the name Norddeutsche Mende-Rundfunk GmbH. The name was subsequently changed to Nordmende: subsequently the company became one of the prominent German manufacturers of radios, <b>televisions,</b> <b>tape</b> recorders and <b>record</b> players in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|The great {{advances}} in electronics during World War II were finally available to consumers and {{industry in the}} late 1940s. These included <b>television,</b> FM radio, <b>tape</b> <b>recording,</b> Hi-Fi audio. Industry saw advanced test equipment, early computers, and improved communication systems. The two leading technical radio magazines changed their names to reflect this. In 1948 Radio-Craft became Radio-Electronics and Radio News became Radio & Television News (August 1948). It was shortened to Radio & TV News in May 1957. Both magazines had covered similar topics but Radio-Electronics emphasized repair and service while Radio & Television News emphasized design and engineering.|$|R
50|$|Besides hard cuts (switching {{directly}} {{between two}} input signals), mixers can also generate {{a variety of}} transitions, from simple dissolves to pattern wipes. Additionally, most vision mixers can perform keying operations and generate color signals (called mattes in this context). Most vision mixers are targeted at the professional market, with newer analog models having component video connections and digital ones using Serial Digital Interface (SDI). They are used in live <b>television</b> with video <b>tape</b> <b>recording</b> (VTR) and video servers for linear video editing, even though the use of vision mixers in video editing has been largely supplanted by computer based Non-linear editing systems (NLE).|$|R
