5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. <b>The</b> <b>puddle</b> will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
5|$|Tapping felt {{acting on}} the new show went a little easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1. She said another factor that made acting on Atlantis easier was the welcoming cast and crew of the series. Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed them in front of <b>the</b> <b>puddle</b> jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of <b>the</b> <b>puddle</b> weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E
40|$|Drainage {{water quality}} in rice paddies was {{strongly}} influenced by <b>the</b> <b>puddling</b> of soil in the paddy fields by tractors {{and in response to}} opening of drainage gates. The concentrations of contaminants in drainage water increased rapidly when <b>the</b> <b>puddling</b> process began and were maintained at high concentrations throughout <b>the</b> <b>puddling</b> period. Moreover, <b>the</b> high concentrations did not decrease immediately after <b>the</b> <b>puddling</b> procedures ceased. Additionally, the ratio of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous to total nitrogen and total phosphorous increased daily during the last half of <b>the</b> <b>puddling</b> period, due to discharge of chemical fertilizers with the drainage water. Also, the loads of particulate nitrogen and phosphorus discharged during <b>the</b> <b>puddling</b> period were larger than the loads discharge during irrigation. The discharge from paddy fields during <b>puddling</b> also increased <b>the</b> total annual contaminant load. Drainage water Load discharge Puddling and transplanting period...|$|R

2500|$|The Bessemer {{and open}} hearth {{processes}} {{were much more}} efficient than making steel by <b>the</b> <b>puddling</b> process because they used the carbon in the pig iron {{as a source of}} heat.

25|$|An {{interesting}} possible {{origin of}} the name of <b>the</b> <b>Puddle</b> ford at Irvine is 'holy steps' ('pas de Dieu'), referring to the stepping stones the Carmelite Priory monks made their way across on their way to Church. Some of the stepping stones may have come from the stone circle, later removed, of which the Grannie stone is the last survivor. Use of the Puddleford by horses was prohibited in 1836 to safeguard access to the Puddly Well, one of the public wells all of which were repaired at about that time.|$|E
25|$|The welder must add {{the filler}} rod to the molten puddle. The welder must also keep the filler metal {{in the hot}} outer flame zone when not adding it to <b>the</b> <b>puddle</b> to protect filler metal from oxidation. Do not let the welding flame burn off the filler metal. The metal will not wet into the base metal and will look {{like a series of}} cold dots on the base metal.

40|$|The {{effect of}} soil {{puddling}} on soil physical properties of 3 different textured soils (clay, loam, and silty loam) {{and growth of}} rice (Oryza sativa) on these soils was investigated under glasshouse conditions. Puddling intensity was expressed as the ratio of soil volume subjected to <b>the</b> <b>puddling</b> implement and <b>the</b> total soil volume in <b>the</b> <b>puddled</b> layer, thus integrating the effects of speed and time of <b>the</b> <b>puddling</b> operation. This parameter was well related to soil dispersion, bulk density, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. However, following prolonged periods of submerged conditions during rice growth, saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with a decrease in soil dispersion, in contrast to an expected reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity with increased dispersion. There was indication that continuous waterlogging reduced the effect of soil puddling, in particular on heavy-textured soils...|$|R

When questioned by the parliamentary committee about the composition of <b>the</b> <b>puddle</b> he frequently referred to in his evidence, he had a mass of clay brought into the committee room.

[...] Later, when asked to produce a drawing of the bridge or aqueduct he proposed to build, he replied that he had no representation of it on paper but would demonstrate his intention by use of a model. He then went out and bought a large round of Cheshire cheese, which he divided into two equal halves saying [...] "Here is my model". Then, to the amusement of the committee, he used the two halves of cheese to represent the semicircular arches and laid a long, rectangular object over the top to demonstrate the position of the river flowing under the aqueduct and the canal flowing over it.|$|E

500|$|The name Puddletown means 'farmstead on the River Piddle'. It {{derives from}} the Old English pidele, a river-name meaning fen or marsh, and tūn, meaning farmstead. Several {{settlements}} along the river derive their names from it. In the river's upper reaches Piddletrenthide and Piddlehinton retain the piddle spelling, whereas downstream Puddletown, Tolpuddle, Affpuddle, Briantspuddle and Turners Puddle use puddle. Both piddle and puddle {{have been used in}} Puddletown's name over the years. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as Pitretone, and in 1212 it was Pideleton. John Speed used Puddletown for his county map of 1610. In 1848 Samuel Lewis used Piddletown in his A Topographical Dictionary of England. In 1906 Sir Frederick Treves used Puddletown in Highways & Byways in Dorset—describing it as [...] "the Town on the River Puddle" [...] and a [...] "curiously named place". In 1946 Piddletown was the name used on the voters lists. One explanation for the preference of using Puddletown over Piddletown is that Major-General Charles William Thompson, who lived at what was Ilsington Lodge after returning from the Great War, pushed through <b>the</b> <b>puddle</b> variant because piddle had a particular meaning in army circles. The broadcaster and writer Ralph Wightman (1901–71), a native of the Piddle Valley and one-time Puddletown resident, believed it was due to Victorian [...] "refinement", as he recalled that in his youth elderly aunts referred to Piddletrenthide as just [...] "Trenthide". Roland Gant in Dorset Villages stated more explicitly that the Victorians used puddle because piddle [...] "became a euphemism for 'piss'". The use of Puddletown rather than Piddletown was officially preserved in the late 1950s, when, according to Wightman, [...] "a long County Council debate solemnly decided Piddletown should be Puddletown".|$|E

2500|$|As an example, the {{radioactive}} decay of carbon-14 is exponential with a half-life of 5,730 years.

After another 5,730 years, one-quarter of the original will remain. On the other hand, the time {{it will take a}} puddle to half-evaporate depends on how deep <b>the</b> <b>puddle</b> is.

But on the second day, {{there is no reason to}} expect that one-quarter of <b>the</b> <b>puddle</b> will remain; in fact, it will probably be much less than that.

40|$|We {{investigated}} <b>the</b> {{effects of}} <b>puddling</b> on percolation and rice yields in rainfed lowland paddy cultivation.
