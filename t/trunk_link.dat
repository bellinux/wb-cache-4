50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex trunk circuit, {{outgoing}} trunks are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each trunk circuit provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its <b>trunk</b> <b>link</b> frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle trunks in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the <b>trunk</b> <b>link</b> frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle trunk and then connect to that trunk through the <b>trunk</b> <b>link</b> connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a trunk group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|E

However the construction took a considerable time, and it opened fully to goods trains in September 1886 and for all traffic on 1 December 1886.

50|$|Trunk Roads were broadly {{equivalent}} to the present National Roads, and Link Roads to the present Regional Roads. Most of the National Primary and National Secondary routes had been Trunk Roads and generally they followed the routes of these Trunk roads, albeit with a different numbering system. However, some National Primary and Secondary roads also incorporated Link Roads and unclassified roads into their routes. Furthermore, many Trunk Roads were downgraded to Regional roads, effectively 'de-trunked'. Some newer National Primary routes were built as new roads in the 1990s and therefore did not incorporate former <b>Trunk,</b> <b>Link</b> or unclassified roads into their routes.|$|E
50|$|A channel from {{a line to}} a trunk {{consisted}} of three links of switching fabric: line link, junctor, and <b>trunk</b> <b>link.</b> In a 10x20 or larger office, ten channels, numbered 0 to 9, were available from any line to any trunk. The line junctor switch number and the trunk junctor switch number {{are the same as}} the channel number. Logic in the marker compares the ten links of each kind to obtain a clear channel. The lack of a channel is called a mismatch and resulted in picking another trunk, or another line, or the use of the ALL where that exists, or giving up and letting the caller try again.|$|E

50|$|Junctors are wired from LLF {{through the}} junctor {{grouping}} frame to {{the levels of}} trunk junctor switches in the <b>trunk</b> <b>link</b> frame (TLF). Unlike earlier designs, the junctors have no supervisory relays or other active hardware, all such functions being assigned to trunk circuits. The basic design of the TLF has ten junctor switches with their horizontal multiples split in half, hence two hundred junctors, and two hundred trunk links to the ten trunk switches. The banjo wiring of the trunk switch was not split, but a discriminator level trick devoted two levels to doubling {{the use of the}} other eight, thus allowing each trunk switch to connect sixteen trunks to its twenty trunk links. This results in the TLF having a 0.8:1 trunk concentration ratio (TCR). This degree of deconcentration eventually turned out to provide too few trunk appearances for the variety of trunk types needed. The final 1970s 5XB offices had type C trunk switches with twelve levels, using two for discrimination, leaving a TCR of unity.|$|E

40|$|Walking {{humanoid}} machines, once {{only seen}} or read in science fiction, became reality with the intensive {{research of the}} last four decades. However, there is {{a long way to go}} in the direction of technical achievements before humanoid robots can be used widely as human assistants. The design of a controller which can achieve a steady and stable walk is central in humanoid robotics. This control cannot be achieved if the reference trajectories are not generated suitably. The Zero Moment Point (ZMP) is the most widely used stability criterion for trajectory generation. The Center of Mass (CoM) reference can be obtained from the ZMP reference in a number of ways. A natural ZMP reference trajectory and a Fourier series approximation based method for computing the CoM reference from it, was previously proposed and published for the Sabanci University Robotics ReseArch Laboratory Platform (SURALP), for a straight walk. This thesis improves these techniques by modifying the straight walk reference trajectory into an omnidirectional one. The second contribution of this thesis is controller designs in order to cope with the changing slopes of the walking surface. The proposed controllers employ the <b>trunk</b> <b>link</b> rotational motion to adapt to the ground surface. A virtual pelvis link is introduced for the robots which do not posses roll and pitch axis in pelvis link. The proposed reference generation and control algorithms are tested on the humanoid robot SURALP. The experiments indicate that these methods are successful under various floor conditions...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{explosive}} growth of mobile data traffic and the shortage of spectral resources, 5 G networks are envisioned to have a densified heterogeneous network (HetNet) architecture, combining multiple radio access technologies (multi-RATs) into a single holistic network. The co-existing of multi-tier architectures bring new challenges, especially on resource management and security provisioning, {{due to the lack}} of common interface and consistent policy across HetNets. In this thesis, we aim to address the technical challenges of data traffic management, coordinated spectrum sharing and security provisioning in 5 G HetNets through the introduction of a programmable management platform based on Software-defined networking (SDN). To address the spectrum shortage problem in cellular networks, cellular data traffic is efficiently offloaded to the Wi-Fi network, and the quality of service of user applications is guaranteed with the proposed delay tolerance based partial data offloading algorithm. A two-layered information collection is also applied to best load balancing decision-making. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes exploit an SDN controller 2 ̆ 7 s global view of the HetNets and take optimized resource allocation decisions. To support growing vehicle-generated data traffic in 5 G-vehicle ad hoc networks (VANET), SDN-enabled adaptive vehicle clustering algorithm is proposed based on the real-time road traffic condition collected from HetNet infrastructure. Traffic offloading is achieved within each cluster and dynamic beamformed transmission is also applied to improve <b>trunk</b> <b>link</b> communication quality. To further achieve a coordinated spectrum sharing across HetNets, an SDN enabled orchestrated spectrum sharing scheme that integrates participating HetNets into an amalgamated network through a common configuration interface and real-time information exchange is proposed. In order to effectively protect incumbent users, a real-time 3 D interference map is developed to guide the spectrum access based on the SDN global view. MATLAB simulations confirm that average interference at incumbents is reduced as well as the average number of denied access. Moreover, to tackle the contradiction between more stringent latency requirement of 5 G and the potential delay induced by frequent authentications in 5 G small cells and HetNets, an SDN-enabled fast authentication scheme is proposed in this thesis to simplify authentication handover, through sharing of user-dependent secure context information (SCI) among related access points. The proposed SCI is a weighted combination of user-specific attributes, which provides unique fingerprint of the specific device without additional hardware and computation cost. Numerical results show that the proposed non-cryptographic authentication scheme achieves comparable security with traditional cryptographic algorithms, while reduces authentication complexity and latency especially when network load is high...|$|E
