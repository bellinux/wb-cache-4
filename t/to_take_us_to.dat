As a young girl, Song wanted to do ballet, while her younger brother wanted to take taekwondo. She said, [...] "My mom only wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> one place," [...] so they settled on taekwondo. Although Song cried all the way through her first class, she now holds a black belt in taekwondo. Song was named an All-American Scholar in the ninth grade. She was homeschooled and earned a high school diploma at age 16, then took courses at a community college and online from the University of California, Berkeley, with a major in psychology and a minor in business.|$|E
2500|$|Ja’far {{was famous}} for his acts of charity in Medina. Abu Hurairah recalled: “The most generous {{of all the people}} to the poor was Ja’far ibn Abi Talib. He used <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> his home and offer us what was {{available}} therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.” ...|$|E

60|$|I {{agreed to}} the {{proposed}} disposition of our boat, and asked Captain Jabe if I could not hire him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> direct <b>to</b> Brimley.|$|R

6000|$|... "If we strike I shall {{take the}} boat, land with the men, {{and leave the}} cutter to her fate. The Avenger will suffice <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> back <b>to</b> Sandy Cove." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Highness {{will be so}} {{good now}} as to follow me," [...] Domiloff directed. [...] "A {{carriage}} is waiting <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} wish to get {{home as soon as}} possible," [...] said Mr. Harrison, as we boarded a street-car <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> his hotel.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Fitzjocelyn!' she screamed, 'tell him so--tell him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the cellars. Why will he {{not put the}} {{mattresses}} {{against the}} windows before they fire?' ...|$|E
60|$|At noon, {{we hired}} a Kanaka <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> down <b>to</b> the ancient ruins at Honaunan in his canoe--price two dollars--reasonable enough, for a sea voyage of eight miles, {{counting}} both ways.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told them}} I was the proud father of ten children," [...] he replied. [...] "That seemed to stagger them, {{but only for}} a moment. They offered <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> all <b>to</b> the Louvre." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the most}} {{delightful}} idea!" [...] she exclaimed, as Granet held the door open. [...] "Do you really mean {{that you are going}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> down <b>to</b> Portsmouth and come and see Ralph?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the island. We can't walk under water, in {{the river}} bed, as the Glass Cat did, so we must float atop the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Jack, hadn't {{we better}} ask him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the Hall first?" [...] whispered Fred to his cousin. [...] "Maybe Colonel Colby can fix this up for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Elementary, Watson, elementary," [...] replied Bridge. [...] "We are {{captured}} by bandits, {{and they are}} going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> their delightful chief who will doubtless have us shot at sunrise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} is most delightful, Robert," [...] said Laura. [...] "Remember, you have promised <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> up <b>to</b> the Hall. And he evidently wishes <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go soon. Don't you think we might go this afternoon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Do it at once,” Will said. “They evidently prefer <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> prisoners <b>to</b> killing <b>us,</b> {{which they}} could do without difficulty. We have been caught in a regular trap, and must {{make the best of}} it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose not," [...] {{answered}} Dick [...] "You {{can have}} the old tire repaired and send the bill to me. And now I want somebody <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> up <b>to</b> Brill just {{as quickly as it}} can be done. It is getting late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wordsworth Road," [...] said my companion. [...] "Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane. Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest {{does not}} appear <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> very fashionable regions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will surrender, if {{you will}} swear <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> Bhurtpoor and hand us over to the rajah. If you will not do so, we will defend {{ourselves}} to the last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, sir,' {{said the}} children; 'but mother did, and she promised one day <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see the baby, {{for it was}} so pretty--so white, {{that she had never}} seen the like.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he gets in}} the auto-stage, {{we might}} hire a jitney," [...] {{suggested}} Fatty. [...] "There are six of us, and we could {{get one of the}} jitneys <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> over <b>to</b> the Hall, baggage and all, for half a dollar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, George, then it {{is quite}} settled that you and Anna are to go off with the luggage {{directly}} the wedding is over. You will come ashore with the gig and meet us at eight o'clock at the station, with a carriage <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> down <b>to</b> the boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here! here he is, Papa!' cried Alda. 'He {{is going}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> all out <b>to</b> a picnic in the Castle woods; and won't you come, Papa?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{waste your}} breath by talkin'," [...] he said peremptorily. [...] "We'll need all our wind <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> Benedict, an' once there I'll give {{some of you}} a chance for tongue-waggin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, fool," [...] I exclaimed, shaking him, [...] "you can die if you like, but we don't mean <b>to.</b> <b>Take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{some place}} where we shall be safe from this god." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's it!" [...] chorused his listeners, [...] "we'll go;" [...] and [...] "Now," [...] {{said their}} {{spokesman}} to the driver, [...] "I dare say you didn't know that Liverpool Wharf was so near; but I don't think you've earned your money, and you ought <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> on <b>to</b> the Old Colony Depot for half-fares at the most." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} put half in his boots, {{and give the}} other half to my wife to hide about her clothes. We shall want some money, if we are robbed, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> down <b>to</b> Lima. With the gold dust {{we could get a}} couple of mules and enough {{provisions}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> down there. We should be in a very awkward position if we found ourselves penniless." ...|$|R

60|$|At the inn {{we found}} Mr. Boythorn on horseback, waiting {{with an open}} {{carriage}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> his house, which was a few miles off. He was overjoyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then come on," [...] went on Tom to his brothers. [...] "We {{can hire}} a {{carriage}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> Ashton {{and to the}} college. Some farmer will be glad of the chance to earn the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll get a taxi <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> down <b>to</b> the hotel," [...] said Dick, {{and soon}} the {{brothers}} were in a taxicab, with the suitcases in front, next to the driver. [...] "Outlook Hotel," [...] he ordered, and away they moved, out of the maze of vehicles, for certain thoroughfares of the metropolis are crowded nearly every hour out of the twenty-four.|$|R

A time where women were what men said they could be. A slut is used by some boys and some men and even some ecologist women to put women down. When those who use the word slut, what they mean is the same.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you'd better rouse {{out your}} hired man, Mrs. Charnock," [...] he said awkwardly. [...] "I've got your husband here, but it's going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> two of <b>us</b> <b>to</b> bring him in." ...|$|R
