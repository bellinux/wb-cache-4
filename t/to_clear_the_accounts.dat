50|$|In most jurisdictions, {{passing a}} cheque for {{an amount of}} money the writer knows is not in <b>the</b> <b>account</b> at <b>the</b> time of {{negotiation}} (or available for overdraft protection) is usually considered a violation of criminal law. However, the general practice followed by banks has been to refrain from prosecuting cheque writers if the cheque reaches the bank after sufficient funds have been deposited, thereby allowing it <b>to</b> <b>clear.</b> But <b>the</b> <b>account</b> holder is normally held fully liable for all bank penalties, civil penalties, and criminal charges allowable by law in the event the cheque does not <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> bank.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the design of}} an intraday market-based mechanism for coordinated scheduling of gas-fired electric generation, intra-day natural gas purchases, sales and deliveries, and underlying pipeline operation. The mechanism {{is based on an}} exchange of physical and pricing data between participants in each market, with price formation in both markets being fully consistent with the physics of energy flow. In organized nodal electricity markets, prices are consistent with the physical flow of electric energy in the power grid because the economic optimization used <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> market <b>accounts</b> for <b>the</b> physics of power flows. In the gas system, the proposed physical operation and pricing will be based on the transient optimization approach that accounts for physical and engineering factors of pipeline hydraulics and compressor station operations. The paper provides theoretical foundations for the market mechanism...|$|R
6000|$|Peruvian mails were {{anticipated}} in {{the family}} with a feeling most akin to dread. The notice of a vessel coming in was the signal for growlings at everything, from the post-office down to his dinner; {{and the arrival of}} letters made things only worse. As Clara said, the galleons were taken by the pirates; the Equatorial Company seemed to be doing the work of Caleb Balderston's thunderstorm, and to be bearing the blame of a deficit such as Oliver could not charge on it. The whole statement was backed by Mr. Ponsonby, whose short notes spoke of indisposition making him more indebted than ever to the exertions of Robson. This last was gone to Guayaquil <b>to</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> up <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> of <b>the</b> Equatorial Company, leaving the office at Lima in the charge of Madison and the new clerk, Ford; and Mr. Dynevor was promised something decisive and satisfactory on his return.

5000|$|The Israeli report offered three {{conflicting}} options. The {{first was}} to begin a military investigation into the suspected unlawful fire, <b>the</b> second <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> soldiers on <b>account</b> of violence {{that had taken place}} earlier in the day, and the third to issue disciplinary measures without a criminal investigation. Col. Ron chose the second <b>the</b> option, <b>clearing</b> <b>the</b> soldiers of any wrong doing. In a letter to B'Tselem, Ron stated that [...] "Under the circumstances we did not find that there is suspicion of criminal behavior by soldiers, nor justification for starting a criminal investigation." [...] B'Tselem's research director said of the letter that [...] "it indicates that lying is legitimate in the military prosecutor's office {{in order to protect the}} troops." ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{constructed}} a standard {{computable general equilibrium}} (CGE) model to explore {{the economic impact of}} increased spending on infrastructure in six African countries: Benin, Cameroon, Mali, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. The basic elements of the model are drawn from EXTER, adjusted to accommodate infrastructure externalities. Seven sectors were considered: food crop agriculture, export agriculture, mining and oil, manufacturing, construction, private services, and public services. Four sets of simulations were conducted: baseline nonproductive investments, roads, electricity, and telecoms. For each set of simulations, five funding schemes were considered: reduced public expenditure; increased value-added taxes; increased import duties; funding from foreign aid; and increased income taxes. In general, the funding schemes had similar qualitative and quantitative effects on macro variables. For road and electricity investment, there were relatively large quantitative differences and some qualitative differences among funding schemes at the macro level. Sectoral analysis revealed further disparities among countries and investment types. The same type of investment with the same funding sources had varying effects depending on the economic structure of the sector in question. The authors find that few sectors are purely tradable or non-tradable, having instead variable degrees of openness to trade. If <b>the</b> current <b>account</b> needs to be balanced, funding investment through foreign aid produces the strongest sectoral effects because strong price and nominal exchange rate adjustments are needed <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> current <b>account</b> balance. In addition, the capital/labor ratio of each sector {{plays an important role in}} determining its winners and losers.
