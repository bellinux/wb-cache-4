5|$|Alarmed by the {{establishment}} of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of anti-fascism, and {{was close to the}} French Communist Party (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by Kurt Schwitters in Hanover, works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, ration stamp with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he briefly left France and joined the Republican forces. Alongside Soviet reporter Ilya Ehrenburg, Tzara visited Madrid, which was besieged by the Nationalists (see Siege of Madrid). Upon his return, he published the collection of poems Midis gagnés ("Conquered Southern Regions"). Some of them had previously been printed in <b>the</b> <b>brochure</b> Les poètes du monde défendent le peuple espagnol ("The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors and activists, Nancy Cunard and the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze how places can be marketed through tourism <b>brochures.</b> <b>The</b> study is based on a {{discourse}} analysis and texts and pictures from three brochures, which come from the region of Småland in Sweden, have been analyzed. <b>The</b> first <b>brochure</b> is from Visit Småland, the second from Vetlanda municipality and the third from Värnamo municipality. With the rise of globalization one of the consequences has been the increased opportunity for tourists to visit places all over the world, which also resulted in a greater competition between places than before. One reaction to this has been the increased marketing of each place unique characteristics in <b>the</b> tourist <b>brochures.</b> To define a place and write texts about a place is hard, because a place consists of human beings and relations which are not static. This means that it is complicated to give the whole picture of a place in a <b>brochure</b> and therefore <b>the</b> producers make a selection of which pictures and texts that should be presented in <b>the</b> <b>brochures.</b> Further on are not all the characteristics of the place attractive, and spots and attractions are therefore being excluded. The question this study examines is what kind of selections that have been made in <b>the</b> <b>brochures</b> from Småland. <b>The</b> analysis showed that the primal subject that all three brochures deal with is the nature. Further on all of them contains information about the places history, the charming little towns, the people, the spirit of the entrepreneurs, and the magical touch of Småland. On of the conclusions, is that the nature is used to attract the tourists, and by the descriptions of the nature it becomes commercialized. Additional there is an inconsistency from the producers, because attractions from outside the geographical region are being presented in <b>the</b> <b>brochures,</b> probably in order to make the actual place even more attractive. The last conclusion made is that there is not only one discourse about Småland. In <b>the</b> <b>brochures</b> there are plenty different descriptions, and all together <b>the</b> <b>brochures</b> are also just one way of talking of Småland as a place...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the subject matter of visual communication in presentation brochures of two Swedish regions: Region Halland and Region Dalarna. My focuses are the following questions: what is the aim of <b>the</b> <b>brochures</b> and in what ways does the visual material relate to that aim? How can strategic communication be defined through a visual perspective and in what ways is it useful in the context of presentation <b>brochures</b> of <b>the</b> regions? What sort of communicational functions are specific for the visual material in relation to the written language of <b>the</b> <b>brochures?</b> Lead by these questions, I start by analyzing <b>the</b> <b>brochures</b> through a textual analysis and a social semiotic approach. The result shows that the aim seems to be both political and commercial, but that the visual elements relate more strongly to the commercial aim than to the political aim by the way they strive to present a positive image of the region. The visual elements work in strategic ways that I define as visual strategies. This concept is further defined by three different aspects of it: visual strategies seen as a visual communication chain, visual strategies as a subcategory to strategic communication and finally visual rhetoric and social semiotics as tools for working with visual elements strategically, as well as analyzing them. Finally, the result shows that visual elements and written language have specific characteristics and that the way these are combined make up a communicational entirety that differs between <b>the</b> <b>brochures...</b>|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} is to explore how native mythological tales have been portrayed in tourism marketing. As part of the {{assessment}} this research examines the values ingrained in the native myths and the parts of the traditional stories which have been selected for inclusion and commoditisation in tourism brochures. Content analysis of the representation of myths associated with Mount Kinabalu and the legendary warrior named Monsopiad was carried out. Findings show that Mount Kinabalu’s myth has been included in <b>the</b> <b>brochures</b> published from 1969 - 2015 while the legend associated with Monsopiad has been represented in <b>the</b> <b>brochures</b> published from 2007 - 2015.

It was reflected via the projection of two tales that the Kadazan Dusuns are intimately linked to nature, their ancestors and supernatural worlds. Lastly, the findings of this study contribute to understanding of the representation tourism and mythology by demonstrating that in addition to cultural heritage sites, myths and legends have also been included in the promotion of natural sites and natural resources.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Many {{patients}} {{diagnosed with}} cancer are unaware that treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation may have detrimental effects on future reproductive abilities. To raise awareness about options for preserving fertility among pediatric oncology patients, researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center partnered with All Children’s Hospital to develop an educational brochure. METHODS: Individual {{interviews were conducted with}} teenage cancer patients, parents, and physicians. Participants were shown two brochures for females and two for males, then asked to evaluate the aesthetic quality of <b>the</b> <b>brochures,</b> as well as the clarity and helpfulness of the content. RESULTS: Teen cancer patients and their parents tended to have similar perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>brochures,</b> but a few disparities in opinion were apparent. Parents considered the terminology too advanced, while the teens held that it was understandable and necessary. Parents commonly suggested the addition of age ranges, cost information, and resources about adoption agencies to <b>the</b> <b>brochures.</b> Physicians recommended that the content be more “empowering,” stressing hopefulness after treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings enabled the successful production of a brochure which promotes awareness about fertility preservation options for pediatric oncology patients.

Chandler was arrested for the murders on September 24, 1992. His handwritten directions on a brochure found in the Rogers' vehicle, and a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on <b>the</b> <b>brochure,</b> were the primary clues that led to him being named a suspect. Local police posted images of Chandler's handwriting on <b>the</b> <b>brochure</b> on billboards in the Tampa Bay area, leading to a call from a former neighbor who provided a copy of a work order that he had written.
