Despite remaining in power, Lissouba failed to fully implement <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> signed {{at the end of}} the war, as the country's militias retained their weapons. High unemployment rates, an atmosphere of political uncertainty, and the steady flow of firearms coming from regional conflicts contributed to the rise of the militia movement within the country. Violent disputes continued with each faction preparing for the upcoming 1997 elections.|$|E

This provision came into effect on March 2, and the new mission was to guard borders and homelands to serve as military police, under the name of a new military unit: the Special Brigade of Military Security of the Military of El Salvador, based on agreement N ° 59 of the Executive Branch, dated June 25, 1992.

25|$|Over {{the ensuing}} months, because of regular visits {{by the army}} during which they were threatened, harassed, and intimidated, most of the {{survivors}} abandoned the village for the mountains, other towns and villages, or Guatemala City. In 1985, they began to trickle back and were allowed to resettle in Plan de Sánchez and work their land, provided that they served in the PACs and remained subject at all times to military oversight. By 1987, some 20 families were again living in the village, albeit under strict orders from the military not to discuss the massacre. The harassment and threats from the military and paramilitaries continued, and the requirement that they patrol with the PACs was enforced, until <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> were signed and the civilian self-defence patrols were dissolved in 1996.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of an}} {{initiative}} started under a 1991 National Conference, <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> of 15 April 1995 with all Tuareg (and some Toubou) rebel groups were negotiated with Government of Niger in Ouagadougou, the final armed group signing up in 1998. The peace deal repatriating thousands of refugees and fighters, mostly from camps across the Libyan border. Large numbers of fighters were integrated into the Nigerien Armed Forces and, with French assistance, help others return to a productive civilian life. Controversy continued to revolve around Tuareg leaders brought into government, with the arrest of the Minister of Tourism Rhissa ag Boula in February 2004 and his March 2005 release after being held in jail {{for more than a}} year on suspicion of involvement in a political murder, while Mano Dayak, a Tuareg leader and negotiator who led the Tuareg rebellion in the Tenere region died in a suspicious plane crash in 1995. Niger's Tuaregs continued to watch the development and economic activities of the government closely, especially in regards the Aïr Mountains' burgeoning tourist trade, and Arlit's recovering uranium industry. By 2000, sporadic banditry and attacks, ascribed to disaffected ex-combatants, began in the north. In 2007, a unified force of ex-combatants repudiated the 1995 accords and declared the formation of the MNJ.|$|E

2500|$|Genocidal killings {{began the}} {{following}} day. Soldiers, police, and militia quickly executed key Tutsi and moderate Hutu {{military and political}} leaders who could have assumed control in the ensuing power vacuum. Checkpoints and barricades were erected to screen all holders of the national ID card of Rwanda (which contained ethnic classification information introduced by the Belgian colonial government in 1933) in order to systematically identify and kill Tutsi. These forces recruited and pressured Hutu civilians to arm themselves with machetes, clubs, blunt objects, and other weapons to rape, maim, and kill their Tutsi neighbors and to destroy or steal their property. The breakdown of <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> led the RPF to restart its offensive and rapidly seize control of {{the northern part of}} the country before capturing Kigali in mid-July, bringing an end to the genocide. During these events and in the aftermath, the United Nations (UN) and countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Belgium were criticized for their inaction and failure to strengthen the force and mandate of the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) peacekeepers. Other observers criticized the government of France for alleged support of the Hutu government after the genocide had begun.|$|E

5000|$|In 1996 {{the last}} 17 peace accords were signed after nine years. The process was {{considered}} a model due to civil society having a formal consultative role, which was never seen before in peace talks. [...] Indigenous issues and rights became a central issue of the peace talks and the signing of <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> symbolized {{the height of the}} movement. International organizations that supported the movement also played a role in engaging in <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> and pushing for change in Guatemala. <b>The</b> <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> included an accord on indigenous rights, the Accord on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which was signed in 1995. This accord called Guatemala a multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual nation and called for reforms to help the indigenous populations.

Though the conflict was between the Tamil and Sinhalese people, India and Sri Lanka signed <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>accord</b> instead of India influencing both parties to sign a <b>peace</b> <b>accord</b> among themselves. <b>The</b> <b>peace</b> <b>accord</b> assigned a certain degree of regional autonomy in the Tamil areas, with Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) controlling the regional council and called for the Tamil militant groups to surrender.
