50|$|Maximum {{range is}} {{achieved}} by using the slowest possible speed, but for grouped flashes, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> <b>off</b> lenses and rotate the mechanism faster. So, for example, for The Cuckolds Light, whose characteristic is group flashing two every six seconds, {{all but two of}} the six panels are blanked off and the mechanism rotates at ten RPM.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after the}} first two {{examples}} were introduced into traffic the class {{was found to be}} unstable at high speed and prone to derailment, due to water surging in the large side tanks. As a result the two locomotives were soon rebuilt to provide a large well tank between the axles, and <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> <b>off</b> the upper portion of the side tanks. This had the effect of lowering the centre of gravity of the locomotive.Once modified the first two locomotives proved to be most successful, but further deliveries were delayed by the onset of the First World War. Five more examples were built between October 1921 and April 1922. No. 333 Remembrance was the last new locomotive built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, before it became a part of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923. It was named in honour {{of the members of the}} railway killed in the war.|$|E

Roberts had a Coke vending machine rolled onto the stage while he was speaking. As he finished his speech, he reached down, picked up a machine gun, and blasted the Coke machine.

40|$|Results {{obtained}} from elaboration of a procedure for estimating replacement terms for the condenser tube systems of steam turbine installations are presented. Censored data processing methods {{are used in}} performing statistical assessment of replacement terms. The service life of condenser tubes <b>blanked</b> <b>off</b> {{in the course of}} turbine operation is assumed to be known (complete operation time), and that for tubes <b>blanked</b> <b>off</b> during the turbine repair process is assumed to be undetermined (censored operation time). The criterion for estimating the replacement term for a condenser tube system is defined as the ratio between the number of tubes <b>blanked</b> <b>off</b> during a repair {{and in the course of}} turbine operation. The procedure is validated by the results from a study on analyzing the damageability of tubes made of different materials for the condensers of 11 turbines with capacities ranging from 25 to 500 MW.
