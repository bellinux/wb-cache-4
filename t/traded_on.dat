5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, the River Aire was navigable to Knottingley, and boats {{carrying}} up to 30tons <b>traded</b> <b>on</b> the river, which was tidal {{up to this}} point. The traders of Leeds were keen to have a navigable link to the town, to make easier the export of woollen cloth, but bills presented to Parliament in 1621 and 1625 had failed. William Pickering, who was mayor of Leeds, had made further attempts to obtain an act of Parliament for improvements to the river in 1679, again without success. As the 1600s drew to a close, a number of bills were passed for other rivers, and there was general support for river navigations. A bill was drawn up in 1698, with support from wool traders in Leeds and general merchants in Wakefield. John Hadley surveyed the Aire, and Samuel Shelton surveyed the Calder. Although the bill {{had a lot of}} support, it was opposed by the City of York, who feared that the River Ouse would be damaged by the scheme.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are <b>traded</b> <b>on</b> an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
