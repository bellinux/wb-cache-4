5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> as equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and {{while it is true that}} Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Protestant missionaries {{on a large}} scale {{beginning}} in 1814 was a primary contributor to the development of political awareness among Sri Lankan Tamils. Activities by missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and Methodist and Anglican churches led to a revival among Hindu Tamils who created their own social groups, built their own schools and temples, and published their own literature to counter the missionary activities. The success of this effort led to a new confidence for the Tamils, encouraging them <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> as a community, and it paved the way for their emergence as a cultural, religious, and linguistic society in the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|In the Padma Purana, {{the curse}} of the sages fails. In retribution, Shiva casts a curse on the sages so that they, like Bhikshatana, will become beggars with matted hair and be devoid of knowledge. Those who would still worship him would gain knowledge, wealth, and progeny, and be reborn into good families. In the Skanda Purana, the sages of the Deodar Forest are {{performing}} rituals and start <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> as gods. To humble these arrogant sages, Shiva takes the form of Bhikshatana—an attractive young beggar—and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, the women wildly chase Shiva. When the sages regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger), and a dwarf, all of which attack Shiva, who overpowers them. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja, the Cosmic Dancer. The same legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some differences. This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja. The ceiling of the Shivakamasundari shrine in the Nataraja temple complex illustrates this legend in a series of frescos, where Bhikshatana is depicted as a white naked mendicant accompanied by a scantily-scad Mohini.|$|E

In polls taken across Europe 2006, British Muslims hold the most negative view of westerners out of all Muslims in Europe, whilst overall in Britain 63% of British hold the most favourable view of Muslims out of all the European countries (down from 67% the year before).|$|E

25|$|The {{process whereby}} the {{indigenous}} population of 'Wales' came <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> as Welsh is not clear. There is plenty of evidence {{of the use of}} the term Brythoniaid (Britons); by contrast, the earliest use of the word Kymry (referring not to the people but to the land—and possibly to northern Britain in addition to modern day territory of Wales) is found in a poem dated to about 633. The name of the region in northern England now known as Cumbria is derived from the same root. Only gradually did Cymru (the land) and Cymry (the people) come to supplant Brython. Although the Welsh language was certainly used at the time, Gwyn A. Williams argues that even at the time of the erection of Offa's Dyke, the people to its west saw themselves as Roman, citing the number of Latin inscriptions still being made into the 8th century. However, it is unclear whether such inscriptions reveal a general or normative use of Latin as a marker of identity or its selective use by the early Christian Church.|$|E

500|$|Great Britain {{controlled}} the whole island by 1815, and unified the country administratively in 1833 with a legislative council that acted as {{advisor to the}} Governor. The council was composed of three Europeans and one representative each of the Sinhalese, the Sri Lankan Tamils, and the Burghers. But this situation changed in 1919 {{with the arrival of}} British Governor William Manning, who actively encouraged the idea of [...] "communal representation". He created the reformed legislative council in 1921 and its first election returned thirteen Sinhalese and three Tamils, a significant loss in representation for the Tamils when compared to the previous council based on direct appointment by the governor. Because of this, the Tamils began to develop a communal consciousness and <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> as a minority community. They focused on communal representation in the council rather than national representation, and decided that their delegates should be leaders from their own community. [...] This new sense of community identity changed the direction of Tamil nationalism. Starting in the mid-1920s, [...] their developing national awareness transformed into a more active national consciousness, with a heightened determination to protect the interests of the Ceylon Tamil community. Influenced heavily by political history and, perhaps more importantly, Colombo-centered developments of the British administration, this emerging Tamil national consciousness led to the establishment of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress headed by Tamil politician, G. G. Ponnambalam.|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the first phase is to psychologically break down the recruit. At this point, {{civilian}} thoughts and habits are considered detrimental to training, so they are squashed during this period by intense physical training, unchanging routines, strict discipline and heavy instruction. The process is designed to enable recruits to learn to survive in combat situations and generally to adapt and overcome any unexpected situation. One of the principal ideals learned during this period is that recruits are not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> as individuals—they {{are not permitted to}} use first person or second person pronouns. Instead, recruits are required to use third-person referrals, such as referring to themselves as [...] "This recruit" [...] and accomplish all tasks with teamwork. Any actions that put the benefit of an individual over the benefit of the other recruits are not permitted and recruits are expected to conform to a standard that does not tolerate personal deviance or eccentricities. Speed, intensity and volume when speaking are valued as well.|$|E

50|$|The theoretic {{basis of}} alienation, within the {{capitalist}} mode of production, {{is that the}} worker invariably loses the ability to determine life and destiny, when deprived <b>of</b> the right <b>to</b> <b>think</b> (conceive) <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> {{as the director of}} their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define relationships with other people; and to own those items of value from goods and services, produced by their own labour. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being, as an economic entity, this worker is directed to goals and diverted to activities that are dictated by the bourgeoisie, who own the means of production, in order to extract from the worker the maximum amount of surplus value, in the course of business competition among industrialists.|$|R

40|$|Managers like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> well <b>of</b> <b>themselves,</b> and <b>of</b> {{the firms}} that employ them.

These distorted attributions stem from the idea that product quality better serves the manager's motivation for self-enhancement and self-presentation than price: product quality is seemingly more central to the firm, less susceptible to external market forces, and more stable over time. We position our theory in the psychology of attribution, define self-serving behavior and provide experimental and survey evidence of this phenomenon, and develop a model of price-quality competition that incorporates the empirical findings. In particular, we first study the natural benchmark equilibrium provided by unbiased decision makers. We then introduce self-serving behavior {{in the presence of}} myopic principals, or of forward-looking principals who anticipate the limitations of managers and set first-period decisions accordingly...|$|R
