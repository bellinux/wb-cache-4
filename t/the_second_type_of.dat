This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths.

5|$|Both {{species of}} Knoetschkesuchus {{have only two}} {{distinct}} types of teeth, uniquely among atoposaurids. Other atoposaurids have a third type of leaf-shaped teeth. The first type of teeth, found {{near the front of}} the jaw, are conical, slightly constricted at the base, and curved slightly inwards. A subtype is represented by the canine-like or pseudocaniniform teeth. They are the fourth and fifth maxillary teeth, and are enlarged (about twice the size of the other maxillary teeth), more pointed, and more constricted at the base. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> teeth, which constitutes the rest of the teeth, are shaped like thin lanceheads, with a wide base and a narrower tip; in K. guimarotae all of the tips are sharp, but in K. langenbergensis they gradually become blunter.|$|E

The ships incorporated significant improvements over the previous Nassau type, including more powerful main guns and an improved propulsion system. The Helgolands were easily distinguished from the preceding Nassaus by the three funnels that were closely arranged, compared to the two larger funnels of the previous class. The ships retained the unusual hexagonal main battery layout of the Nassau class.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{was named}} in 1825 by English {{geologist}} Gideon Mantell, based on fossil specimens {{that are now}} assigned to Therosaurus and Mantellodon.

The genus Iguanodon belongs to the larger group Iguanodontia, along with the duck-billed hadrosaurs. The taxonomy of this genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long-standing ones reassigned to other genera.|$|E
5|$|Ebla was a polytheistic state. During {{the first}} kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon {{of the first}} Ebla {{included}} pairs of deities {{and they can be}} separated into three genres; in the first and most common one, there were the couples, such as the deity and his female consort. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> pairs was the divine twosomes, such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos, like in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons. The third type included divine pairs who were actually a single deity that had two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first genre of pairs included Nidakul, who was exclusive to Ebla, and his consort, Belatu ("his wife"); Rasap and his consort Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his consort Barama. The third genre included the artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain Gods; Shahar as the morning star and Shalim as the evening star.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> press {{design is}} the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter {{to increase the}} volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The {{two types}} of {{inheritance}} during Han included the common inheritance of property from the deceased, which all social groups (except for slaves) participated in, and the inheritance of titles, which only the people of twenty ranks, nobility, and royalty could enjoy. In the first form, officials and commoners bequeathed an equal share of property to each of their sons in their will. This excluded daughters, who married into other families and thus did not carry on the family name. However, daughters did receive {{a portion of the}} family property in the form of their marriage dowries, which were sometimes equal to a brother's share of wealth in the will. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> inheritance involved the practice of primogeniture, where the official title was inherited by only one son. This was as true of the emperor as it was for any king, marquess, or commoner of the twenty ranks. However, to limit the power of the kings while still upholding primogeniture, an imperial edict of 127 BCE stated that kings had to divide the territories of their kingdoms between the chosen successor (i.e. heir apparent) and the kings' brothers, who were made marquesses, thus establishing new marquessates and effectively reducing the size of every kingdom with each generation.|$|E

30|$|The {{severity}} of disturbances {{in a network}} {{that leads to the}} first and <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> stresses can be quantified using different metrics. One of the metric {{that can be used to}} quantify the stress is the level of shed-load. This is because if a network experiences a stress that cannot be eliminated without shedding loads, the ultimate decision of a network operator is to initiate the load shedding. The constraint violation in a network can also be considered as an early indication of a system that heads towards a stressed operating condition, however, it is a tentative indication of stress because not all constraint violations lead to load shedding.|$|R
