I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E

5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves {{the notion that there}} is <b>too</b> much luck involved, especially concerning possessing <b>too</b> many or <b>too</b> few lands. Early in the game especially, <b>too</b> many or <b>too</b> few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land count is automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.|$|E

40|$|Investigating {{assimilate}} contribution {{and grain}} filling pattern in winter wheat is importance under drought stress condition. This {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the relationship between drought stress on grain filling and yield of 4 cultivars including MV 17 (dwarf), Alvand, Shahryar (semi-dwarf) and <b>Toos</b> (tall). Experimental design was randomized complete block with three replications. Drought stress assigned to main plots and cultivars to sub plots. Growth curve sampling started at 7 days after anthesis with 4 days interval. In pre-anthesis drought stress Alvand produced highest yield, while it was 29. 14 % less than control treatment. The yield of <b>Toos</b> cultivar was lowest at pre-anthesis drought stress. Rate of grain filling of <b>Toos</b> cultivar did not change at pre-anthesis drought stress. Drought stress treatment at post-anthesis decreased rate of grain filling in all cultivars as compared to control, but it was significant only <b>Toos</b> c. v. In pre-anthesis drought stress grain filling duration increased in Alvand but decreased in <b>Toos.</b> Alvand with higher rate of grain filling produced highest grain yield (3850 kg/ha). It can be concluded that, drought stress decreases grain filling duration and rate of grain filling...|$|R

The citizens believed that Cerezeda wished to abandon Trujillo, and appealed to the audiencia of Santo Domingo, and to the Crown, for supplies and a Crown-appointed governor.|$|E

Okada, while commenting on what improvements would {{be made for the}} next game, stated that there were <b>too</b> many useless items in the game. Niino felt that the game's pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E
