These programs, which typically last {{three to five}} days, are customised by subject or <b>target</b> <b>group.</b> Around 50 to 60 programs are conducted every year. A one-year General Management program is offered through virtual classroom. As a combined initiative with the Ministry of Defence, a six-month General Management Programme is conducted for Defence officers to assist their career transition to the corporate sector.|$|E
5|$|The USAAF {{assessed}} {{that the}} firebombing campaign had been highly successful, {{and noted that}} American losses during these attacks were much lower than those incurred during day precision raids. Accordingly, the Joint <b>Target</b> <b>Group</b> (JTG), which was the Washington, D.C.-based organisation responsible for developing strategies for the air campaign against Japan, developed plans for a two-stage campaign against 22 Japanese cities. The JTG also recommended that precision bombing attacks on particularly important industrial facilities continue in parallel to the area raids, however. While this campaign was intended to form part of preparations for the Allied invasion of Japan, LeMay and some members of Arnold's staff believed that it alone would be sufficient to force the country's surrender.|$|E

40|$|Lifestyle {{factors and}} {{determinants}} of behaviour in specific <b>target</b> groupsomic <b>groups</b> are important <b>target</b> <b>groups</b> for health promotion. Those in low socio-economic groups have, comparatively speaking, the most unfavourable profile {{when it comes}} to lifestyle. In health policy documents, the need for focusing on specific <b>target</b> <b>groups,</b> in particular, migrants and low socio-economic groups, is emphasised. There is, however, a gap between proposed actions in health policy and actual local practice, where interventions take place. Important reasons for there being insufficient attention paid to specific <b>target</b> <b>groups</b> are the lack of political support for health promotion at the local level, and insufficient funds and professional capacity. In the near future, to cut across the unfavourable trends in risk behaviour in several specific <b>target</b> <b>groups,</b> changes in health promotion policy and practice are needed. Health Promotion can react to these unfavourabl trends, offering tailor-made services to specific <b>target</b> <b>groups.</b> In cooperation with the different parties involved, authorities should be able to create an environment where people are capable of making healthy choices and empowered to take their own responsibility in healthy and happy living...|$|R

2500|$|Many brands are now heavily {{using this}} mobile app {{to boost their}} {{marketing}} strategy. Instagram {{can be used to}} gain the necessary momentum needed to capture the attention of the market segment that has an interest in the product offering or services. As Instagram is supported by Apple and android system, it can be easily accessed by smartphone users. Moreover, it can be accessed by the Internet as well. Thus, the marketers see it as a potential platform to expand their brands exposure to the public, especially the younger <b>target</b> <b>group.</b> On top of this, marketers do not only use social media for traditional Internet advertising, but they also encourage users to create attention for a certain brand. This generally creates an opportunity for greater brand exposure. Furthermore, marketers are also using the platform to drive social shopping and inspire people to collect and share pictures of their favorite products. Many big names have already jumped on board: Starbucks, MTV, Nike, Marc Jacobs, and Red Bull are a few examples of multinationals that adopted the mobile photo app early. Fashion blogger Danielle Bernstein, who goes by @weworewhat on Instagram, collaborated with Harper's Bazaar to do a piece on how brands are using Instagram to market their products, and how bloggers make money from it. Bernstein, who currently has one and a half million followers on Instagram, and whose [...] "outfit of the day" [...] photos on Snapchat get tens of thousands of screenshots, explained that for a lot of her sponsored posts, she must feature the brand in a certain number of posts, and often cannot wear a competitor's product in the same picture. According to Harper's Bazaar, industry estimates say that brands are spending more than $1 billion per year on consumer-generated advertising. Founder of Instagram Kevin Systrom even went to Paris Fashion week, going to couture shows and meeting with designers to learn more about how style bloggers, editors, and designers are currently dominating much of the content on his application.|$|E
