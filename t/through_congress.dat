5|$|A {{commission}} {{run by the}} Federal Council of Churches in America sought {{issuance of}} a half dollar to mark the anniversary, and the bill passed <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> without opposition in 1923 and was signed by President Warren G. Harding. Sketches were prepared by commission chairman Rev. John Baer Stoudt and converted to plaster models by the Mint's aging chief engraver, George T. Morgan. The models were initially rejected by the Commission of Fine Arts, which required revisions {{under the supervision of}} Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser.|$|E
5|$|After President Nixon {{was elected}} in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an {{advocate}} for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program {{for state and local}} governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing <b>through</b> <b>Congress,</b> and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Jackson {{supported}} the Ho-Chunk tribe's {{proposal for a}} casino within his district in Lynwood, Illinois. The proposal was to build the largest casino in the state {{as part of an}} entertainment complex. In 2005, Jackson sponsored a bill for the creation and acquisition of a life-size statue of Rosa Parks to be placed in Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol. The bill approving the funding for the statue was signed by President Bush on December 1, 2005. Jackson was active in funding AIDS service organizations that serve blacks <b>through</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E

5|$|In early 1957, Nixon {{undertook}} {{another major}} foreign trip, {{this time to}} Africa. On his return, he helped shepherd the Civil Rights Act of 1957 <b>through</b> <b>Congress.</b> The bill was weakened in the Senate, and civil rights leaders were divided over whether Eisenhower should sign it. Nixon advised the President to sign the bill, which he did. Eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in November 1957, and Nixon gave a press conference, assuring the nation that the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower's brief illness.|$|E
5|$|Through 1935, as {{the breakup}} {{legislation}} wound <b>through</b> <b>Congress,</b> and litigation through the courts, Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly {{passed a bill}} for the breakup, Willkie {{made a series of}} speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and a storm of letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress to pass a bill requiring the breakup to take place within three years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{by the end}} of 1837 the Arms Company {{had made}} over 1,000 weapons, there were no sales. Following the Panic of 1837, the company's {{underwriters}} were reluctant to fund the new machinery that Colt needed to make interchangeable parts, so he went on the road to raise money. Demonstrating his gun to people in general stores did not generate the sales volume he needed, so with another loan from his cousin, Selden, he went to Washington, D.C., and demonstrated it to President Andrew Jackson. Jackson approved of the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. Presidential approval in hand, Colt pushed a bill <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> endorsing a demonstration for the military, but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon. A promising order from the state of South Carolina for fifty to seventy-five pistols was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough.|$|E

5|$|Groves {{hoped that}} a new, {{permanent}} agency {{would be created}} {{to take over the}} responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project in 1945, but passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The act that was signed by President Harry S. Truman on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, but the commissioners were not appointed until October, and AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, the Military Appropriation Act of 1946 gave the Manhattan Project $72.4 million for research and development, and $19 million for housing and utilities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette, when captured, {{had tried}} to use the American {{citizenship}} he had been granted to secure his release, and contacted William Short, United States minister in The Hague. Although Short and other U.S. envoys very much wanted to succor Lafayette for his services to their country, they knew that {{his status as a}} French officer took precedence over any claim to American citizenship. Washington, who was by then president, had instructed the envoys to avoid actions that entangled the country in European affairs, and the U.S. did not have diplomatic relations with either Prussia or Austria. They did send money for the use of Lafayette, and for his wife, whom the French had imprisoned. Secretary of State Jefferson found a loophole allowing Lafayette to be paid, with interest, for his services as a major general from 1777 to 1783. An act was rushed <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> and signed by President Washington. These funds allowed both Lafayettes privileges in their captivity.|$|E
5|$|MD7 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US40 {{just west of}} Havre de Grace.

MD7 veers east to enter the street grid at Bloomsbury Avenue. The state highway turns north onto Union Street, which heads south as MD490, adjacent to Harford Memorial Hospital. The route heads through the Havre de Grace Historic District, passing through a residential area about four blocks from the Susquehanna River waterfront <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> Street, where the highway begins to approach the waterfront. Immediately after passing under the Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge, MD7 turns west onto Otsego Street. The highway reaches its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with Otsego Street, MD155 (Ohio Street), and US40 (Pulaski Highway), which crosses the Susquehanna River a short distance to the east on the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Russell Mallory (1812 – November 9, 1873) {{served in}} the United States Senate as Senator (Democrat) from Florida from 1850 to the secession of his home state and the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War. For much of that period, he was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. This was a time of rapid naval reform, and he insisted that the ships of the United States Navy should be as capable as those of Great Britain and France, the foremost navies in the world at that time. He also wrote a bill, and guided it <b>through</b> <b>Congress,</b> that provided for compulsory retirement of officers who did not meet the standards of the profession.|$|E
5|$|The Restudy {{came with}} a plan to stop the declining {{environmental}} quality, and this proposal was to be the most expensive and comprehensive ecological repair project in history. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) proposed more than 60construction projects over 30years to store water that was being flushed into the ocean, in reservoirs, underground aquifers, and abandoned quarries; add more Stormwater Treatment Areas to filter water that flowed into the lower Everglades; regulate water released from pumping stations into local waterways and improve water released to Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Areas; remove barriers to sheetflow by raising the Tamiami Trail and destroying the Miami Canal, and reuse wastewater for urban areas. The cost estimate for the entire plan was $7.8billion, and in a bipartisan show of cooperation, CERP was voted <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> with an overwhelming margin. It was signed by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{storm of}} {{criticism}} from scientists, particularly those at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Leó Szilárd and Harold Urey were particularly notable critics. The bill created a powerful administrator and deputy administrator, and specifically stated {{that they might be}} members of the armed forces. It was feared that they would dominate the part-time commissioners. The fact that the bill emphasized that the administrator had to keep the deputy fully informed further aroused suspicion that the administrator would be an Army officer and the deputy a Navy officer. The secrecy provisions also frightened many scientists; it contained severe penalties of up to ten years imprisonment and $10,000 in fines for security breaches. The Chicago Sun headline accused the War Department of attempting to railroad the legislation <b>through</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E

5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women’s votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E
5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative {{to provide health}} coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in {{the years of the}} Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E

5|$|There {{had been}} coin {{shortages}} beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production {{to try to}} meet demand. The early 1960s {{was a time of}} increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money if the price of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but government stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly <b>through</b> <b>Congress,</b> and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E
5|$|Though {{there were}} {{attempts}} {{to bridge the}} differences between North and South, ultimately Lincoln's victory prompted seven southern slave states to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House. The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to rally behind the Union. As {{the leader of the}} moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp, anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political patronage, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory. His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. He suspended habeas corpus, leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision, and he averted potential British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of generals, including his most successful general, Ulysses S. Grant. He made major decisions on Union war strategy, including a naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery, and pushed <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which permanently outlawed slavery.|$|E
25|$|Naturally, in America {{everyone}} knew that from 1846 to 1861 a free trade system prevailed, and that Representative Morrill carried his protectionist tariff <b>through</b> <b>Congress</b> only in 1861, after the rebellion had already broken out.
