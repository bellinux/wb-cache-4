25|$|Initial {{reaction}} to <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> by various commentators was of {{surprise at the}} apparent poor prospects for the Liberal Democrats because it was at odds with many opinion polls undertaken in the previous weeks.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} pre-election opinion polls, which had been fairly consistent; this led many pundits and MPs to speculate that <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> was inaccurate, and that the final result would have the two main parties closer to each other. Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown vowed to [...] "eat his hat" [...] and former Labour [...] "spin doctor" [...] Alastair Campbell promised to [...] "eat his kilt" [...] if <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll,</b> which predicted huge losses for their respective parties, was right.|$|R

25|$|When {{the polls}} {{around the country}} closed at 19:00 RTL and Nova TV {{published}} the results of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> conducted by Ipsos PULS. They predicted a landslide win for Josipović, giving him an advantage of almost 30 percentage points, significantly larger {{than all of the}} second-round polls. This shifted much of the political commentary and rendered much of the expected drama moot. The Josipović headquarters started celebrating immediately after the polls closed claiming that the difference is too large for Bandić to overcome and <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> don't feature such a large statistical margin of error. The Bandić campaign said they'll wait for official results, but admitted it would be very hard for Bandić to overtake Josipović's 30 point lead even when the votes from abroad were tallied. <b>The</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> predicted the outcome well as the ratio between the two candidates was 9 to 1 for Bandić abroad, where there were no exit polls, which narrowed Josipović's victory to a final difference of 21 percentage points.|$|E
25|$|Although HRT {{admitted}} {{they crossed the}} line two weeks ago when they reported the results of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> conducted by RTL and Nova TV, they once again 'borrowed' {{the results for the}} second round election night. This caused a stir within HRT against the main editor of the news program Hloverka Novak-Srzić who was faced with scandals long before the election night incident. Finally, exactly nine days after the election, on 19 January, she was released of her duties as chief editor.|$|E
25|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> Josipović {{won more}} than 90% of Vesna Pusić's voters and 70% of Nadan Vidošević's voters. He also managed to {{consolidate}} the traditionally centre-left voters winning 90% of his party's {{as well as more}} than 80% of HNS voters and more than 70% of the centrist HSLS and centre-right HSS voters, at the same time appealing to every fourth HDZ voter. Bandić won almost 80% of all Hebrang voters as well as 57% of Primorac's voters and obtained 3 quarters of all HDZ voters, confirming the assumption that Bandić mostly appealed to the right.|$|E

5000|$|The 20,000 {{responses}} in <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> produced {{a large amount}} of data, leading to an extremely low sampling error. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, because the chance of sample error in <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> was so low and observers did not find any signs of fraud, {{it may have been the}} survey's methodology that led to the discrepancy in results. PSB was criticized in the press for how the poll was carried out because the company used members of a Venezuelan group called Súmate for fieldwork. The group had been involved in organizing the recall and were considered anti-Chávez by the Venezuelan government. In a paper published in academic journal Latin American Perspectives, Daniel Hellinger stated that the results of the poll [...] "were very likely skewed by overrepresentation of voters in areas where Súmate volunteers were willing to conduct their interviews." [...] However, at the time, the company stated that the issues were with the voting, not <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll.</b> Following <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll,</b> Penn replaced Schoen as PSB's representative for Venezuela.|$|R
50|$|In Egypt, the Egyptian {{center for}} public opinion {{research}} (baseera) conducted in 2014 two <b>exit</b> polls; <b>the</b> constitution referendum <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> and <b>the</b> presidency elections <b>exit</b> <b>polls.</b> These <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> are considered <b>the</b> first <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> {{to be conducted}} not only in Egypt {{but also in the}} Middle East (www.baseera.com.eg).|$|R
25|$|The {{final result}} (49.8% Union vs 49.7% House of Freedoms) was about 3% {{different}} from almost all polls (including all <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls)</b> reducing the expected 5% {{gap between the}} coalition to a difference of about 0.1%. On Italian TV some tried to explain this discrepancy claiming that some House of Freedoms voters were ashamed {{to admit that they}} planned to vote for them. Others claimed that the last week of electoral campaign, dominated by Berlusconi's proposal of cutting ICI and by the media's insistence on the alleged new taxes advocated by The Union, persuaded a large number of Italians, usually uninterested to politics, to cast a vote for the House of Freedoms.|$|E
25|$|Powell's {{experience}} in military matters {{made him a}} very popular figure with both American political parties. Many Democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters, while many Republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past Republican administrations. Put forth as a potential Democratic Vice Presidential nominee in the 1992 U.S. presidential election or even potentially replacing Vice President Dan Quayle as the Republican Vice Presidential nominee, Powell eventually declared himself a Republican and began to campaign for Republican candidates in 1995. He was touted as a possible opponent of Bill Clinton in the 1996 U.S. presidential election, possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in Iowa and even leading New Hampshire polls for the GOP nomination, but Powell declined, citing a lack of passion for politics. Powell defeated Clinton 50–38 in a hypothetical match-up proposed to voters in <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> conducted on Election Day. Despite not standing in the race, Powell won the Republican New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary on write-in votes.|$|E
25|$|As all {{the polls}} around the country closed at 7p.m., the first exit polls were {{published}} by the major television networks. They showed Ivo Josipović easily claiming first place, but failing to obtain an outright majority winning 32%. The polls showed Milan Bandić, Andrija Hebrang and Nadan Vidošević in a statistical tie with each of them achieving 14%, 12% and 11% respectively. Andrija Hebrang's third place {{was seen as a}} great success as most opinion polls before the first round showed him with only single-digit approval, while Nadan Vidošević's placing was seen as a disappointment since most polls before the vote showed him battling for second place with Milan Bandić. The polls predicted Vesna Pusić and Dragan Primorac would be the only other candidates to pass 5% with each of them collecting 7% and 5% respectively. In 2007, during the parliamentary election, all exit polls predicted SDP would narrowly win, when in the reality HDZ turned out as the victor. With that in mind, Andrija Hebrang expressed conviction that when actual results were published, he would overtake Bandić and qualify for second round. He claimed that exit polls do {{not take into account the}} votes coming from the citizens living abroad and that conservative voters do not participate in exit polls as much as liberal voters. However, <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> predicted the outcome almost perfectly as the country's electoral commission's results later confirmed.|$|E

50|$|In {{retirement}} Ashdown {{became a}} regular {{voice for the}} Liberal Democrats. At the 2015 General Election he appeared on the BBC soon after the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> which predicted that the Liberal Democrats would be reduced from 57 MPs to 10. Ashdown stated that he would eat his hat if <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> was correct. <b>The</b> actual result was that the Liberal Democrats returned eight MPs but the technical difference from <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> {{was not enough to}} save him from several requests to carry out his vow. Some commentators suggested humorously that this was an example of Liberal Democrats breaking their promises in response to u-turns conducted while in coalition government. However, Ashdown did keep his promise one day following the election on the BBC's Question Time programme, in which he was presented with a chocolate hat that he later ate.|$|R
25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech after <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> were {{announced}} {{saying he was}} confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters {{just a couple of minutes}} before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results {{were announced}} he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He said he would be an independent president, not a remote-control of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched to hear what he had to say.|$|E
2500|$|The {{profile of}} {{corruption}} in <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> was bigger than I'd expected ... Abramoff, lobbying, Foley and Haggard added to the general distaste that people have for all things Washington, and it just reached critical mass... Iraq mattered, {{but it was more}} frustration than it was an explicit call for withdrawal. If this was a get-out-now call for withdrawal, then Lamont would not have been beaten by Lieberman. Iraq does play a role, but not the critical, central role.|$|E
2500|$|Bush won {{solid support}} from Republicans in Congress and from {{conservative}} voters in his 2004 reelection campaign. Exit polls in 2004 showed that 34% {{of the voters}} identified themselves as [...] "conservatives" [...] and they voted 84% for Bush. By contrast, 21% identified as [...] "liberals," [...] of whom 13% voted for Bush; 45% were [...] "moderates" [...] and they voted 45% for Bush. Almost the same pattern {{had appeared in the}} 2000 exit polls. <b>The</b> <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> show Bush won 57% of the rural vote, 52% of the suburban vote and 45% of the urban vote.|$|E
5000|$|A {{question}} in <b>the</b> Michigan <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> conducted by <b>the</b> news media asked the respondents {{how they would}} have voted if the names of Barack Obama, John Edwards and Bill Richardson {{were added to the}} ballot. The results obtained for that question are tabulated below. The first column of the table shows that according to <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll,</b> Clinton, Obama, Edwards and Richardson would have received 46%, 35%, 12% and 1% respectively with such an expanded ballot. Except for the [...] "% Total" [...] column, the numbers in this table should be read horizontally. For example, the row for Barack Obama tells us that of the 35% he <b>polled</b> in <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll,</b> 18% would've come from Clinton voters, 1% from Gravel voters, 2% from Kucinich voters and 79% would've been from Uncommitted voters.|$|R

40|$|At 10 pm on {{election}} day, the ballots will close, and the counting will begin. It may be many hours {{before it becomes}} clear which party has the most seats in the new parliament, and many days until we know which parties will form the next government. However, shortly after the 10 o’clock deadline, broadcasters will release a forecast based on <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll,</b> which will give the first insight into how voters have actually voted in the general election. In this post, Jouni Kuha explains the detail behind <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> forecast, and indicates some of the difficulties in putting together a forecast under considerable time pressures...|$|R
50|$|The {{projected}} {{shares of}} the vote in Great Britain were Labour 35% (down 6% on 2001), Conservatives 33% (up 1%), Liberal Democrats 22% (up 4%) and other parties 8% (up 1%). The Conservatives were expected to make the biggest gains, however — 44 seats according to <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> — with <b>the</b> Liberal Democrats expected to take as few as two. Whilst the Lib Dems' vote share predicted by <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> was accurate (22.6% compared to the actual 22.0%) they did better in some Lib Dem-Labour marginals than predicted {{on the basis of the}} national share of the vote, and achieved a net gain of 11 seats.|$|R
5000|$|However {{the actual}} results showed a {{stronger}} {{performance by the}} Conservatives, which gave them an overall majority, since Labour also had a weaker performance than the polls had suggested. When <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> was initially presented, some commentators and politicians doubted it, with Paddy Ashdown even declaring [...] "If this poll is correct I will publicly eat my hat on your programme" [...] {{in response to the}} apparently poor results for the Liberal Democrats. <b>The</b> <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> was eventually proved to have in fact overestimated the Liberal Democrats' performance. If the Survation telephone poll (6 May) had been published it would have produced results within 1% of the election results.|$|R
