5|$|Following {{the first}} {{skirmish}} in Pakrac in March, a predominantly Serb-populated area {{east of the}} town, straddling the Pakrac–Bučje–Požega road, remained generally {{beyond the control of}} Croatian authorities. In early July, the insurrection spread to the entire area between the towns of Pakrac and Požega and north to the northern slopes of Papuk and Bilogora. This development threatened to interdict the Croatian use of the Varaždin–Osijek road, as it was within range of Croatian Serb artillery near Slatina. After the Serb rebels declared the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Western Slavonia (SAO Western Slavonia) and expanded the territory under their control to include the town of Okučani, the most significant transport route between Zagreb and Slavonia—the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška—was severed. SAO Western Slavonia comprised no major settlements. In order to address this deficiency, Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive early on 19 August. The objectives of the offensive were to capture the towns of Grubišno Polje, Daruvar, Pakrac and Lipik, and consolidate the territory of SAO Western Slavonia. The offensive failed after the arrival of Croatian reinforcements from Zagreb and Bjelovar, but <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> remained in close proximity to the four towns.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{territory}} in dispute is {{in the vicinity of}} the town of Apatin, while the Island of Šarengrad and the Island of Vukovar are cited as particularly contentious parts of the dispute. Further disputed areas are located near the town of Bačka Palanka, and in the municipality of Sombor, at the tripoint of Croatia, Hungary and Serbia. Croatia claims that the cadastre-based boundary was adopted by the Đilas Commission, set up in 1945 to determine the borders between federal constituents of Yugoslavia, while Serbia claims that the same commission identified the boundary as the course of the Danube in 1945. In 1991, the Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia ruled that the border between federal units of Yugoslavia became inviolable international borders, without referring to locations of any specific claim or line. The opinion was rendered at the request of Serbia. Prior to the ruling, Serbia asserted that the borders were subject to change following the breakup of Yugoslavia and the independence of Croatia. Since the Croatian War of Independence, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> coincides with the Serbian claim.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{violations}} of <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> have occurred, including incursions by insurgents and Pakistani armed forces at Kargil {{leading to the}} Kargil war. There have also been sporadic clashes on the Siachen Glacier, where <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> is not demarcated and both countries maintain forces at altitudes rising to , with the Indian forces serving at higher altitudes.|$|E

25|$|In Paris Favre {{requested}} {{an officer}} {{to help him}} negotiate the technical articles of the formal armistice. He and General Charles de Beaufort d'Hautpoul returned to Versailles on 27 January, but, according to German accounts, the latter got drunk at the dinner celebration and Favre {{had to get a}} postponement of the final negotiations to the next day (28 January). On this second try a more competent officer, Charles Horix de Valdan, chief of staff to the commander of Paris, Joseph Vinoy, was sent along. Lacking sources of information on the disposition of his own troops at the time, Valdan relied on that supplied by von Moltke in demarcating <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two sides. Both sides were to withdraw ten miles from <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and <b>the</b> area between the German siege works and the disarmed Parisian forts was to be neutral. When Valdan had completed the technical military matters, Favre and Bismarck signed the final document on 28 January 1871. It immediately came into effect in Paris, and on 31 January in the other pertinent areas.|$|R

25|$|In late December, both {{countries}} moved ballistic missiles closer to each other's border, and mortar and artillery fire {{was reported in}} Kashmir. By January 2002, India had mobilized around 500,000 troops and three armored divisions on the Pakistan's border concentrated along <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> in Kashmir. Pakistan responded similarly, deploying around 300,000 troops to that region.|$|E

This was the second major military standoff between India and Pakistan following the successful detonation of nuclear devices by both countries in 1998 and the most recent standoff between the nuclear rivals.

Jammu province region has a 70:30 Hindu-Muslim ratio. Parts of the region were hit by militants, but violence has ebbed there, along with the Valley, after India and Pakistan started a peace process in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The war {{marked the}} {{resumption}} of warfare between the two kingdoms that had been dormant since 1665. The inconclusive nature of this war would lead to more wars that would go on until 1854. From a geopolitical standpoint, Burma now had a firmer, though still by no means complete, hold on the upper Tenasserim coast. Still, the southward shift of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was strategically important. The Burmese would launch their next invasion from Tavoy in 1765, (not Martaban {{as was the case}} in 1759).|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} major phases to the Kargil War. First, Pakistan {{infiltrated}} forces into the Indian-controlled section of Kashmir and occupied strategic locations enabling it to bring NH1 {{within range of}} its artillery fire. The next stage consisted of India discovering the infiltration and mobilising forces to respond to it. The final stage involved major battles by Indian and Pakistani forces resulting in India recapturing most of the territories held by Pakistani forces and the subsequent withdrawal of Pakistani forces back across <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> after international pressure.|$|E

In addition, he served as a Brigadier in the UN mission in Congo and as a brigade commander in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Indira Gandhi {{administration}} {{decided that}} a full-fledged second security service was needed. R. N. Kao, then a {{deputy director of the}} Intelligence Bureau, submitted a blueprint for the new agency. Kao was appointed as the chief of India's first foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing. The R was given the responsibility for strategic external intelligence, human as well as technical, plus concurrent responsibility with the Directorate-General of Military Intelligence for tactical trans-border military intelligence up to a certain depth across <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> (LOC) and the international border.|$|E
25|$|Well over US$ 5.4 billion (400 billion Pakistani rupees) in aid {{arrived from}} all around the world. US Marine and Army {{helicopters}} stationed in neighbouring Afghanistan quickly flew aid into the devastated region along with five CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the Royal Air Force that were deployed from the United Kingdom. Five crossing points were opened on <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> (LOC), between India and Pakistan, to facilitate the flow of humanitarian and medical aid to the affected region, and aid teams from different parts of Pakistan and around the world came to the region to assist in relief.|$|E
50|$|Though {{fighting}} {{continued for}} the next several years, {{by the time of the}} Korean War <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> were sharply drawn: the Communist-led People's Republic of China government in Beijing <b>controlled</b> most <b>of</b> mainland China, while the Kuomintang-led Republic of China government, now in Taipei, <b>controlled</b> the island <b>of</b> Taiwan, some surrounding islands, and a number of islands off the coast of Fujian. This stalemate was enforced with the assistance of the United States government which began deterring an invasion of Taiwan after the start of the Korean War.|$|R
50|$|Alauddin Khilji was an {{original}} thinker and brilliant as a strategist. He sent plundering armies under the veteran general Ghazi Malik to Kandhar, Ghazni and Kabul. These offensives effectively crippled <b>the</b> Mongol <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> leading to India.|$|R

25|$|Commonly {{known as}} the Kargil War, or Operation Vijay in India, this {{conflict}} {{between the two countries}} was mostly limited. During early 1999, Pakistani troops infiltrated across <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> (LoC) and occupied Indian territory mostly in the Kargil district. India responded by launching a major military and diplomatic offensive to drive out the Pakistani infiltrators. Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges that were encroached by the infiltrators. According to official count, an estimated 75%–80% of the intruded area and nearly all high ground was back under Indian control.|$|E
25|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Indian Canberras flew a {{strategically}} important sortie {{against the}} Karachi oil tanks, this {{had the effect}} of helping the Indian Navy in their own operations, a series of missile boat attacks against the Pakistani coast. On 21 May 1999, prior to the commencement of the Kargil War, the Indian Air Force Air HQ assigned a Canberra PR57 aircraft on a photographic mission near <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control,</b> where it took a severe blow from a FIM-92 Stinger infrared homing missile on the starboard engine; the Canberra successfully returned to base using the other engine.|$|E
25|$|The Indian army {{launched}} its final {{attacks in the}} last week of July; as soon as the Drass subsector had been cleared of Pakistani forces, the fighting ceased on 26 July. The day has since been marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas (Kargil Victory Day) in India. By the end of the war, Pakistan had to withdraw under international pressure and due to pressure from continued fighting at battle front and left India in control of all territory south and east of <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control,</b> as was established in July 1972 as per the Simla Agreement.|$|E
