5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Walker's Chief of Staff, Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), whom Frank {{recommended}} for the job. She reveals {{that she and}} Walker have decided to rescind their promise to nominate him as Secretary of State because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> remain in Congress and use his political expertise to get the President-elect’s education reform agenda passed. Frank is initially incensed, but when Linda asks if {{he will continue to}} be an ally to the future President he says that he will. Linda reveals that Senator Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner) has been chosen for the position instead. Despite his statement to the contrary, Frank feels personally betrayed and, with Claire’s encouragement, begins to formulate a plot for revenge, which he shares with his Chief of Staff, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Mrs. Underwood, meanwhile, is forced to downsize the non-profit organization she manages, the Clean Water Initiative, which had been promised a large donation upon her husband’s confirmation as Secretary, without which the organization is forced to substantially curtail its budget.|$|E
500|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. [...] In this episode, traveling salesman Todd Packer (David Koechner) comes to Dunder Mifflin looking for a desk job in the office. However, the office is unsure if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> work there due to his previous behavior. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) eventually team up and develop a scheme that rids the office of Packer. Meanwhile, after dealing with computer problems, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) confronts Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) about getting a new computer.|$|E
500|$|... : An old {{man has a}} lump or tumor on his face. In the {{mountains}} he encounters a band of tengu making merry and joins their dancing. He pleases them so much that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> join them the next night, and offer a gift for him. In addition, they take the lump off his face, thinking that he will want it back and therefore have to join them the next night. An unpleasant neighbor, who also has a lump, hears of the old man's good fortune and attempts to repeat it, and steal the gift. The tengu, however, simply give him the first lump {{in addition to his}} own, because they are disgusted by his bad dancing, and because he tried to steal the gift.|$|E
60|$|Everybody got up {{and stood}} about him and talked confusingly. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{take them to the}} flying-machine at once.|$|R
5000|$|Fired: Lorenzo Lamas - {{for taking}} full {{responsibility}} for the loss as project manager. No-one on the team said <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be fired, but Trump could not pin the blame on anyone else.|$|R
60|$|The {{matter was}} talked over {{a good many}} times, and fully twenty of the cadets came to Jack and told <b>him</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> run {{for the office of}} major. And finally he consented.|$|R
500|$|Writing [...] "The Sleeper" [...] {{sees the}} {{characters}} in a different light. Although they are the protagonists who work to prevent terrorist threats, the episode sees the MI5 team going {{to great lengths to}} get the sleeper agent, Fred Roberts, to do what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do so that the producers can make the audience sympathise with the character, as well as despise the main characters on some level for their methods. There were other instances of the main character going through great lengths to solve the case, including Adam's interrogation methods, brinking on torture, in [...] "Frequently Asked Questions". [...] "Love and Death" [...] sees Danny and Zoe ordered to carry out an assassination. Wolstencroft did not want to do it lightly, as he wanted somebody like Danny going through [...] "something dreadful." [...] He previously did it before with the death of Helen Flynn in [...] "Looking After Our Own", but [...] "Love and Death" [...] did this in {{the point of view of}} the killer, not the victim. [...] "Celebrity" [...] introduces a new plot style, which does not involve terror threats. Brenton wrote it as a more light-hearted episode that saw the characters emmeshed in a world they cannot handle. Despite this, Collins stated that MI5 do other duties other than fighting terrorism, though they would not gain as much media attention. Penhale also stated MI5 in the episode are in a way protecting the country, as if a national icon is under threat, the country's morale could drop. [...] "Who Guards the Guards?" [...] and [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] were considered for the second series, but because there was not room for them, the producers bumped the episodes back to the third series.|$|E
2500|$|Narked by {{constant}} {{claims that}} Campese is {{better suited to}} the wing, Jones shot back: 'New Zealanders {{are trying to get}} into Campo's mind. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> feel flawed and erratic when he plays fullback.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Antonio’s uncles – Juan, Lucas, Mateo, and Pedro Luna [...] – [...] María’s {{brothers}} are farmers. They struggle with Gabriel {{to lay a}} claim to Antonio’s future. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become a farmer or a priest, but Gabriel wants Antonio to be a vaquero in the Márez tradition. Antonio’s uncles are quiet and gentle, and they plant their crops by the cycle of the moon.|$|E
5000|$|According to Vasili Mitrokhin, {{when the}} KGB {{found out about}} Guillaume, they ordered Wolf <b>to</b> pull <b>him</b> out because Brandt {{had been a good}} friend to the Soviet Union and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay in power.|$|R
60|$|MRS GILBEY. Indeed Bobby {{is not a}} mollycoddle. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go in for singlestick at the Young Men's Christian Association; but, of course, I couldnt allow that: {{he might}} have had his eye knocked out.|$|R

2500|$|... "He's {{easily the}} most sought-after Eagle... No player was, or is, as popular as Ben. His appeal is so diverse. Kids want his {{autograph}} and photograph. Sponsors want him {{to sit next to}} them. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> push their product... If Ben's well managed, the sky's the limit for him... They've got to find the balance between his commercial potential and his contribution to the community. The club offers protection, but it's up to Ben what demands he puts himself under." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{role was}} {{originated}} on October 29, 1993, by eleven-year-old Jonathan Jackson. Rumors circulated that Jackson’s contract negotiations {{were not going}} well in 1996, and again in 1998, when Jackson responded that he was considering college and had given the series six months notice of his consideration in accordance with his contract. In January 1999, {{it was reported that}} the series had worked out a deal, and Jackson stated he had briefly extended his contract to allow the character's popular romance to continue. His contract allowed him to leave if he received a feature film role, and Jackson left in April, shooting pre-taped scenes that appeared through late May. Jackson explained to Soap Opera Weekly: [...] "I kind of feel that the fact of how much work they've given me this year, at this stage as an actor, they just maxed out quite a bit of what I would do for the show. And I'm at a better age now to go out. There are more projects for people my age or a little older than there were a few years ago. Hollywood's the kind of town where you kinda have to strike while the iron's hot." [...] Jackson's manager Tony Monziotti released the statement: [...] " [...] has told GH and made it very clear to me that he wants to periodically go back to GH. It's a question of if the storyline warrants it and <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come back; Jonathan would be more than happy to." [...] In early 2000, Jackson stated he would enjoy reprising the role but his schedule would not allow it. He suggested a short-term return that could coincide with the departure of co-star Rebecca Herbst (who plays Lucky's love interest Elizabeth Webber) should she not renew her contract, allowing for periodic returns from the couple later on. Although Herbst expressed interest, the show opted to keep the characters on canvas.|$|E
6000|$|They {{talked at}} arm's {{length of the}} weather; and then Suzette said abruptly, [...] "Of course, Louise, your father {{will have to do}} what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to,</b> against--papa. I {{understand}} that." ...|$|E
60|$|Talking matters {{over in the}} inn of the town, the Glass and Glacier, the {{citizens}} {{came to the conclusion}} that they ought to appoint three spokesmen to go and explain to Tell just what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} Henry Betzalel Zafir in Sochi. He was {{attracted}} to art from early age. He got support and encouragement from his parents, even though <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be a doctor, because they understood this is his destination.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, {{following}} {{the fighting in}} the MPLA, Viriato da Cruz went to Beijing, China, where he was well known as having helped create the MPLA. At first, the Chinese government welcomed him; <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> help them bring Maoist socialism to Africa.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, why did <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do it? Not as a {{business}} matter, for these arrangements are usually verbal, {{and there was no}} earthly business reason why this should be an exception. Don't you see, my young friend, that they were very anxious to obtain a specimen of your handwriting, and had no other way of doing it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Warrington said, bitterly; [...] "Shandon {{accommodates}} {{himself to}} a cage pretty well. He ought to be wretched, but he has Jack and Tom to drink with, and that consoles him: {{he might have a}} high place, but, as he can't, why, he can drink with Tom and Jack;--he might be providing for his wife and children, but Thomas and John have got a bottle of brandy which <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> taste;--he might pay poor Snip, the tailor, the twenty pounds which the poor devil wants for his landlord, but John and Thomas lay their hands upon his purse;--and so he drinks whilst his tradesman goes to gaol and his family to ruin. Let us pity the misfortunes of genius, and conspire against the publishing tyrants who oppress men of letters." ...|$|E
60|$|Besides, {{many who}} have no ear for {{literature}} or for music are accessible to architecture, to pictures, to statues, to dresses, and to the arts of the stage. Every device of art should {{be brought to bear}} on the young; so that they may discover some form of it that delights them naturally; for there will come to all of them that period between dawning adolescence and full maturity when the pleasures and emotions of art will have to satisfy cravings which, if starved or insulted, may become morbid and seek disgraceful satisfactions, and, if prematurely gratified otherwise than poetically, may destroy the stamina of the race. And it must be borne in mind that the most dangerous art for this necessary purpose is the art that presents itself as religious ecstasy. Young people are ripe for love long before they are ripe for religion. Only a very foolish person would substitute the Imitation of Christ for Treasure Island as a present for a boy or girl, or for Byron's Don Juan as a present for a swain or lass. Pickwick is the safest saint for us in our nonage. Flaubert's Temptation of St Anthony is an excellent book for a man of fifty, perhaps the best within reach as a healthy study of visionary ecstasy; but for the purposes of a boy of fifteen Ivanhoe and the Templar make a much better saint and devil. And the boy of fifteen will find this out for himself if he is allowed to wander in a well-stocked literary garden, and hear bands and see pictures and spend his pennies on cinematograph shows. His choice may often be rather disgusting to his elders when <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> choose the best before he is ready for it. The greatest Protestant Manifesto ever written, as far as I know, is Houston Chamberlain's Foundations of the Nineteenth Century: everybody capable of it should read it. Probably the History of Maria Monk is at the opposite extreme of merit (this is a guess: I have never read it); but it is certain that a boy let loose in a library would go for Maria Monk and have no use whatever for Mr Chamberlain. I should probably have read Maria Monk myself if I had not had the Arabian Nights and their like to occupy me better. In art, children, like adults, will find their level if they are left free to find it, and not restricted to what adults think good for them. Just at present our young people are going mad over ragtimes, apparently because syncopated rhythms are new to them. If they had learnt what can be done with syncopation from Beethoven's third Leonora overture, they would enjoy the ragtimes all the more; but they would put them in their proper place as amusing vulgarities.|$|E
60|$|I {{called on}} the old ladies, some time after this, and found them alone. They were {{generally}} alone in the evenings now. We talked about Pepton's engagement, and I found them resigned. They were sorry <b>to</b> lose <b>him,</b> but <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be happy.|$|R
50|$|His next {{attempt was}} at the 1977 British Grand Prix where he failed to pre-qualify {{following}} an accident avoiding Rupert Keegan during practice. Kozarowitzky broke {{his hand in the}} accident and left the team after <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> try to qualify in the spare car despite his injury. His Formula One plans for 1978 came to nothing due to lack of funds, and he then retired from the sport.|$|R
60|$|The last of February drew nigh, {{which was}} the time fixed upon for Josey to go home. He had {{remained}} with his uncle much longer than his father had at first intended; but now <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return, before the roads broke up in the spring.|$|R
5000|$|The novel ends on a {{somewhat}} elaborate joke. The Judean slaves attempt to send Falco {{on a quest}} to recover a missing artifact. At first, Falco is afraid that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> raid the treasures brought back after the conquest. However, they then tell Falco that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> look for a [...] "Lost Ark". Falco demurs, and says someone who {{is more of a}} daredevil than he would have to perform that particular quest, alluding to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E
