5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
