This is because the shell and tube heat exchangers are robust due to their shape.Several thermal design features must be considered when designing the tubes in the shell and tube heat exchangers:There can be many variations on the shell and tube design.

Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to plenums (sometimes called water boxes) through holes in <b>tubesheets.</b> The tubes may be straight or bent {{in the shape of}} a U, called U-tubes. [...] In nuclear power plants called pressurized water reactors, large heat exchangers called steam generators are two-phase, shell-and-tube heat exchangers which typically have U-tubes. They are used to boil water recycled from a surface condenser into steam to drive a turbine to produce power. Most shell-and-tube heat exchangers are either 1, 2, or 4 pass designs on the tube side. This refers to the number of times the fluid in the tubes passes through the fluid in the shell. In a single pass heat exchanger, the fluid goes in one end of each tube and out the other. [...] Surface condensers in power plants are often 1-pass straight-tube heat exchangers (see Surface condenser for diagram). Two and four pass designs are common because the fluid can enter and exit on the same side. This makes construction much simpler. There are often baffles directing flow through the shell side so the fluid does not take a short cut through the shell side leaving ineffective low flow volumes. These are generally attached to the tube bundle rather than the shell in order that the bundle is still removable for maintenance.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPrototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) {{is first}} of its kind 500 MWe pool type, sodium cooled nuclear reactor which is {{presently}} in advanced stage of construction at Kalpakkam, India. Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) is a shell and tube type, counter current, sodium to sodium heat exchanger. IHX is a very important, massive, over dimensional (∼ 42 tones in weight, ∼ 2 meters in diameter and ∼ 18 meters in length) and critical component of reactor, as it transfers heat from the radioactive primary circuit sodium to non-radioactive secondary circuit sodium forming the boundary between these two circuits. The principal material of construction of IHX is austenitic stainless steel grade 316 LN. Each IHX has 3600 nos. of straight seamless tubes which are rolled and then welded to the either ends of top and bottom <b>tubesheets</b> by autogenous pulsed Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) process. The shell welding around the tube bundle is extremely difficult and challenging task due to small gap between the tube bundle and shell inside diameter. Special arrangements were made to avoid arc strike or fusion on the tube during shell welding around the tube bundle. A mechanical hardfaced seal arrangement at the interface of the IHX outer shell and the inner vessel stand pipe is the chosen design concept to ensure leak tightness in the IHX penetrations. Based on radiation dose rate & shielding considerations during maintenance, handling and decommissioning, nickel based ENiCr-B hard facing alloy (Colmonoy- 5) was chosen to replace the traditionally used cobalt based stellite alloys to improve the resistance to high temperature wear, especially galling of mating surfaces in sodium environment. The more versatile Plasma Transferred Arc Welding (PTAW) and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) were used for deposition of Colmonoy- 5. The hardfacing on the seal ring is really challenging task, as the diameter is too large and thickness & width is too small and which has hardfacing on all mating surfaces. Extensive varieties of trials were conducted on the mockup to optimize the hardfacing process along with heat treatment cycle to obtain minimum distortion deploying special tools and fixtures. Intermediate Heat Exchanger involves 10 mm and 28 mm thick borated stainless steel components around the tube bundle and bottom portion confirming to ASTM 887, Type 304 B 4, Grade B classification to reduce the radiation level in secondary sodium system while flowing through the IHX. Various types of welding trials were conducted on the test coupons for welding procedure qualification of borated stainless steel components using versatile grades of welding consumables.
