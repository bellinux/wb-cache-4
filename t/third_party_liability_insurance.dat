Evaluation of insurance technical provisions {{for the kinds of}} insurance, such as Motor <b>Third</b> <b>Party</b> <b>Liability</b> (MTPL) <b>Insurance,</b> Property Insurance and some others, have difficulties in assessing the impact of the losses from insurance claims incurred requiring a longer time for the settlement of insurance claims. These insurance requirements are mainly associated with health insurance in the MTPL Insurance, losses related to compensation for moral injuries, as well as on life care and life-long pension. To run these payments, you need to know the financial indicators for the period of settlement of loss (such as the effective interest rate, investment income, etc.) In the article the procedures for the most accurate forecast possible losses for the expected excess of loss amount for a treaty year are provided, using the loss experience of the previous years of the occurrence with their development. However, certain adjustments should be made to take account of the impact of losses from previous years for the current period.

40|$|In {{the second}} part of the 20 th century it became clear to {{insurers}} that any nuclear accident has catastrophic potential. The characteristics of the nuclear risks made the coverage unattractive to individual insurers. The insurance industry was challenged to create structural and legal mechanisms, in order to be able to deal with the new hazard. The most important mechanism is the insurance pool which has contributed to the insurance industry remaining an essential part of the development of the nuclear industry and the nuclear <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>liability</b> regime. Today, the insurance market, through the insurance pools, is involved in the parallel creation of legislation and insurance policies in the two most important types of nuclear insurance: - Insurance of physical damage or first <b>party</b> <b>liability</b> that will provide coverage for all the operator’s assets on the nuclear facility. This damage consists of various types of actual damage and future damage or loss of income which results from the actual damage - Nuclear <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>liability</b> policy or <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> covers all aspects of off-site nuclear damage suffered by people, businesses and other property not directly related to the nuclear site.

Thus, the greater {{attention is paid to}} customer retention creating a business value. Subject of the research is a creation of „BTA“ business value through customer loyalty. Objective of the research is to perform the assessment of influence of customer loyalty to „BTA“ business value. Tasks of the research: 1. 	To reveal the issues of increased insurance business value; 2. 	To provide theoretical aspects of customer loyalty and business value relations; 3. 	To identify the main methods of business value determination; 4. 	To determine the influence of „BTA“ managed insurance portfolio to business value; 5. 	To perform the assessment of „BTA“ insurance customers lifetime; 6. 	To perform the assessment of customer loyalty influence to business value. It has been determined that BTA insurance takes leading position in the insurance market by signing the biggest number of agreements of general liability, contractual obligations, vehicle owner <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>liability</b> and Casco <b>insurance.</b> It can be stated that BTA business value could not be created without the following types of insurance, because correlation coefficients of provided insurance types are very strong and strongly affects all insurance markets. Indicator of customer lifetime value showed that attraction of new customers is not profitable as the retention of old customers, thus expenses for the creation of customer loyalty (to increase reversibility) give more profit than expenses for the attraction of new customers. Customer lifetime is the most important aspect for the general sales of BTA insurance company; this also affects general creation of business value. Chosen criteria such as Customer retention index, Customer lifetime value and Net present value (NPV) makes a direct impact to BTA sales, because correlation analysis showed strong and very strong mutual relations...|$|R

With increasing levels of economic well being of the population leads to the development of transport and increase the volume of traffic on the road.

40|$|This paper {{treats the}} {{differences}} in terms of insurance between optional and compulsory third party liability insurances. It also treats {{the purpose of the}} compulsory third party liability insurances and their accordance with that purpose. The primary purpose of the optional <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is to ensure the policyholder financial resources to cover possible claims for damages. The primary purpose of the compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is to render possible the compensation of a third party for damage done. The policyholders financial ability to pay damages is of subordinate interest, and the purpose of compulsory third party liability insurances is thus twofold. Estate agents, insurance agents and accountants are required by law to have a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> linked to their enterprises. The terms of the compulsory third party liability insurances are, unlike the optional insurances, dictated by the legislator. As a result, the compulsory insurance has not been developed at the same pace as the optional. This is a consequence of an unwillingness on behalf of the authorities, to compromise and to adapt the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> {{in order to make it}} more in accordance with its purpose. Therefore, the insurance companies have also been less inclined to grant insurance on the exposed premises, which has resulted in the above-mentioned enterprise-owners risking insurance distress. The legislation of each trade offers the possibility to leave other security than the holding of a compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> to protect the third party. According to this paper, this possibility has not been enough emphasised. The conception"third party protection"should, according to the author, be emphasised in each legislation, irrespective of the form chosen. The risk exposure the enterprise-owners are exposed to can cause problems for the insurance companies in determining what liabilities should be covered by the compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> Damage prevention activities are carried out to different extent within each trade organisation, but compulsory third party liability insurances are better suited within legislations where the insurance companies have good control over the proportions of the damages and as a result can assess the risk of damage more easily...|$|E

An impor- tant element in provision calculating is the simulation of future life expectancy of the insured, i. e. random generation of life expectancy based on generational mortality data. Characteristics of the distribution of reserves are derived from simulations. Furthermore, we compare the results of stochastic and determi- nistic approach of computing the reserves.
