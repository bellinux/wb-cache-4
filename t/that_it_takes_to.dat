25|$|All Canadian {{nurses and}} {{prospective}} nurses are heavily {{encouraged by the}} Canadian Nurses Association {{to continue their education}} to receive a baccalaureate degree. They believe that this is the best degree to work towards because it results in better patient outcomes. In addition to helping patients, nurses that have a baccalaureate degree will be less likely to make small errors because they have a higher level of education. A baccalaureate degree also gives a nurse a more critical opinion, which gives him or her more of an edge in the field. This ultimately saves the hospital money because they deal with less problematic incidents. All Canadian provinces and territories except for the Yukon and Quebec require that all nurses must have a baccalaureate degree. The basic length of time <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> obtain a baccalaureate degree is four years. However, Canada does have a condensed program that is two years long.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} investment-based {{crowdfunding}} platform for startups {{was launched in}} Feb. 2010 by Grow VC, followed by the first US. based company ProFounder launching model for startups to raise investments directly on the site, but ProFounder later decided to shut down its business due regulatory reasons preventing them from continuing, having launched their model for US. markets prior to JOBS Act. With the positive progress of the JOBS Act for crowd investing in US., equity crowdfunding platforms like SeedInvest and CircleUp started to emerge in 2011 and platforms such as investiere, Companisto and Seedrs in Europe and OurCrowd in Israel. The idea of these platforms is to streamline the process and resolve the two main points that were {{taking place in the}} market. The first problem was for startups to be able to access capital and to decrease the amount of time <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> close a round of financing. The second problem was intended {{to increase the amount of}} deal flow for the investor and to also centralize the process.|$|E

500|$|When {{an animal}} is ritually {{slaughtered}} (shechted) the raw meat is traditionally cut, rinsed and salted, prior to cooking. Salting of raw meat draws out {{the blood that}} lodges on the inner surface of the meat. Salting is made with any coarse grain of salt, while the meat is laid over a grating or colander to allow for drainage, and where the salt is allowed {{to remain on the}} meat for the duration of time <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> walk one biblical mile (appx. 18– 24 minutes). Afterwards, the residue of salt is rinsed away with water, and the meat cooked. Meat that is roasted requires no prior salting, as fire acts as a natural purgatory of blood.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Zofia Burr, {{who calls}} Angelou's poetry [...] "unabashedly public in its ambitions", connects Angelou's lack of {{critical}} acclaim {{to both the}} public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one. Bloom agrees, stating that Angelou's acclaim has been public rather than critical. Critic James Finn Cotter, in his review of Oh Pray, calls it an [...] "unfortunate example {{of the dangers of}} success" [...] and states that Angelou's fame has [...] "muted the private and personal quality <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> be essential to poetry". Critic John Alfred Avant, {{despite the fact that the}} volume was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, states that Diiie [...] "isn't accomplished, not by any means". Even critics who value poetry as an oral tradition devalue Angelou's poetry; critic Bryan D. Bourn, who praises her for using African oral tradition, states that she [...] "slips into banality when she abandons" [...] them and criticizes her for not catering to poetry critics. Scholar Joanne Braxton asserts that [...] "Angelou's audience, composed largely of women and blacks, isn't really affected by what white and/or male critics of the dominant literary tradition have to say about her work. This audience does not read literary critics; it does read Maya Angelou". Burr condemns Angelou's critics for their narrow view of poetry, which has resulted in their negative reviews of her poetry, and for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: [...] "to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional".|$|E

2500|$|There is {{also the}} closely linked area of Diophantine approximations: given a number , how well can it be {{approximated}} by rationals?

This question is of special interest if [...] is an algebraic number. If [...] cannot be well approximated, then some equations do not have integer or rational solutions. Moreover, several concepts (especially that of height) turn out to be crucial both in Diophantine geometry and in the study of Diophantine approximations. This question is also of special interest in transcendental number theory: if a number can be better approximated than any algebraic number, then it is a transcendental number. It is by this argument that [...] and e {{have been shown to be}} transcendental.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Chris Watters scored it 6.5 out of 10, writing [...] "Deadlight draws you in {{with its}} rich, {{pervasive}} atmosphere, but doesn't give you {{much to do}} once you're there", calling the game [...] "an alluringly dark, but disappointingly shallow experience." [...] He praised the graphics, arguing [...] "the artistic elements work in harmony to make Deadlight a visually compelling game." [...] However, he was critical of the gameplay, writing [...] "linearity isn't inherently negative, but performing the same few moves to progress down a clearly marked path doesn't hold its appeal for long." [...] He concluded [...] "In the three or so hours <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> complete the game, you feel less like you are trekking through a dangerous world, and more like you are acting out a script. Deadlights engrossing visuals make it fun to play the part, but you'll wish you had more lines." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{scene in}} the 1981 film Chariots of Fire recreates a race in which the runners attempt to round the {{perimeter}} of the Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge {{in the time it takes}} the clock to double strike the hour at midday or midnight. Many have tried to run the [...] around the court in the 43.6 seconds <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> strike 12 o'clock. Known as the Great Court Run, students traditionally attempt to complete the circuit on the evening of the matriculation dinner. The only persons recognised to have actually completed the run in time are David Cecil in 1927 and Sam Dobin in 2007. It was thought that Coe had succeeded when he beat Steve Cram in a charity race in October 1988 in a time of 42.53 seconds. A video of the race, however, apparently shows that Coe was 12 metres short of the finish line when the last chime sounded, so Trinity College never officially accepted his time.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of technologies—including active {{suspension}} and ground effect aerodynamics —are banned under the current regulations. Despite this {{the current generation of}} cars can reach speeds in excess of [...] at some circuits. The highest straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was , set by Juan Pablo Montoya during the 2005 Italian Grand Prix. A Honda Formula One car, running with minimum downforce on a runway in the Mojave desert achieved a top speed of [...] in 2006. According to Honda, the car fully met the FIA Formula One regulations. Even with the limitations on aerodynamics, at [...] aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car, and the oft-repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough downforce to [...] "drive on the ceiling", while possible in principle, has never been put to the test. Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed. The downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering. Consequently, the driver's head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of 20kg in corners. Such high lateral forces are enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to maintain their focus for the one to two hours <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> complete the race. A high-performance road car like the Ferrari Enzo only achieves around 1g.|$|E

[...] Filmfare {{described}} her acting style, writing, [...] "...when it comes to style, sexiness or sheer onscreen presence, she's unparalleled... a fierce, raw, flinty performer with unbridled honesty. Her acting isn't gimmicky." [...] Critic Khalid Mohamed commends her technical control: [...] "She knows how to give and to what degree. She has all <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> be a director. There is a kind of vulnerability in her control. She explores when she is acting." [...] Shyam Benegal, who directed her in two movies, believes she is [...] "a director's actress". M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune wrote, [...] "Rekha's flowering as an actress post Ghar and Khubsoorat climaxed in [...] Umrao Jaan. As a tragic courtesan she gave a performance of consummate artistry, adopting a much-admired huskiness and despondency of tone. Rekha communicated much with a delicately raised eyebrow. In 2010, Filmfare included two of her performances—from Khubsoorat (1980) and Umrao Jaan (1981)—in their list of [...] "80 Iconic Performances".
