In 1903 the Cary house and the land {{surrounding}} it were purchased by William Procter, grandson of the Procter & Gamble co-founder, <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> <b>to</b> the Traders.

During both times, however, McCliesh was [...] "sore afflicted with ailments" [...] when he arrived, {{and had to}} return to England. On 26 December 1735, the Moose factory was destroyed by fire, to which Adams responded in a written note to the company's committee: [...] "We have strained ourselves to the utmost to assist them." [...] In 1737, Adams retired and was replaced at Albany by Thomas Bird. Adams died on 29 September 1737, shortly after returning to England with his three-year-old daughter Mary, whose mother was a Native Canadian.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a review of the {{knowledge}} about the trust concept and its application within the accounting research context. This is done by examining the different ontological and epistemological assumptions that accounting research are based on, by relating these assumptions to various conceptions of <b>trust</b> used <b>in</b> accounting research, and by revealing the explicit and implicit role that is <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> accounting research. The review is based on articles published between 1995 and 2002 in eleven influential accounting journals. The results show that few accounting articles are explicitly related to trust. Our review supports observations regarding the absence of empirical research made in previous research. Our classification of epistemological and ontological assumptions resulted in an even distribution between the mainstream and alternative approaches. The use of <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> the selected articles showed four different types reflecting an increasing role of <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> explaining accounting phenomena. To summarise, our review produces a dissociated impression of the role of <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> accounting research...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the <b>trust</b> {{development}} <b>in</b> the dyadic relationship of CEO and chair of the board. Design/methodology/approach A narrative approach is adopted to examine the meanings that CEOs and chairpersons <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> their relationship, and to explore trust as an evolving phenomenon that can increase or decline over the course of the relationship. The data include 16 CEO-chair dyads from Finnish limited companies. Findings The results suggest that trust may exist on different levels and evolve in various ways during the course of the relationship. Integrity and agreement on company strategy are proposed to form the foundation for <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> the CEO-chair relationship, whereas ability and benevolence are necessary for trust to develop to a higher level. Research limitations/implications Studying trust development based on the data generated at one point of time and in only one country are the major limitations of the study. Practical implications It is proposed that the level of trust influences value creation in the relationship. Originality/value The study adds to the limited number of previous studies on the CEO-chair relationship and contributes to the literature on trust development by making visible the viewpoint of both partners, and the meaning of the different components of trust...|$|R

The abbey was closed in 1536, as part of the dissolution of the monasteries. Nine years later the surviving structures, together with the manor of Norton, were purchased by SirRichard Brooke, who built a Tudor house on the site, incorporating part of the abbey. This was replaced in the 18thcentury by a Georgian house. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was partially demolished in 1928.

5000|$|Such was the {{prevailing}} attitude towards children when Lady Lucinda Musgrave {{became the first}} patroness of the Hospital for Sick Children. Lady Musgrave was an enthusiastic Patroness, attending monthly Hospital Committee meetings and [...] "doing much by her loving example to interest others". The idea of a sanatorium was proposed in 1883 and she took up the scheme with energy, personally securing the land at Shorncliffe which was <b>given</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> by the government. The choice of the Shorncliffe site for the sanatorium was in keeping with prevailing ideas about health. The widespread acceptance of the miasmic theory of disease meant that fresh air and well ventilated, well lit buildings were considered essential for recuperation and recovery from illness. Bayside suburbs which offered sea bathing and outdoor enjoyment in addition to fresh air, were considered ideal for therapeutic purposes.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} social {{preferences}} {{are determined by}} hormones. We do this by investigating whether markers for the strength of prenatal testosterone exposure (finger length ratios) and current exposure to progesterone and oxytocin (the menstrual cycle) are correlated with choices in social preference games. We find that subjects with finger ratios indicating high prenatal testosterone exposure <b>give</b> less <b>in</b> the <b>trust,</b> ultimatum and public good games and return a smaller proportion <b>in</b> the <b>trust</b> game. The choices of female subjects vary over the menstrual cycle according to a pattern consistent with a positive impact of oxytocin on <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> the <b>trust</b> and ultimatum games and a positive impact of progesterone on altruism. We find no impact for subjects taking hormonal contraceptives. We conclude that both prenatal and current exposure to hormones {{play an important role}} in shaping social preferences. social preferences, 2 D: 4 D, testosterone, progesterone, oxytocin...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are several}} ways to evade the rules against purpose <b>trusts.</b> <b>In</b> Re Denley, land was <b>given</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> <b>to</b> provide a sports ground [...] "primarily {{for the benefit of the}} {{employees}} of [...] company and secondarily for the benefit of such other persons as the trustees shall allow to use the same". Although for the benefit of a purpose, the wording identified a class of beneficiaries, which allowed the courts to find it valid. One way to evade the rule, therefore, is to create a trust that benefits a group of people but is confined to a purpose. The judgment of Lloyd LJ, <b>given</b> <b>in</b> R v District Auditor, ex parte West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council, seems to indicate that the test of certainty for Denley trusts is the same as for discretionary trusts. A second way of evading the rules is found in Re Tyler, where money was donated to a charity, with a request to maintain the donor's family vault; if this vault was not maintained, the money would go elsewhere. Because there was no obligation to maintain the vault, it was not considered a purpose trust. The existence of the Denley exception has enabled the purpose trust to be proposed as one way of holding rights associated with an unincorporated association.|$|R
