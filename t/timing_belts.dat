2500|$|Powertrain {{detail of}} the Audi V8 {{featured}} one of two all-new, all-aluminium alloy engines – both petrol engines, and both in V8 configuration with 32 valves (four valves per cylinder) with dual valve springs, and four overhead camshafts (DOHC). The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was grey cast iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar toothed timing belt, driven {{from the front of}} the crankshaft operated only the exhaust camshaft in each bank. [...] The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex roller chain from the exhaust camshaft – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the timing belt. This method reduced the complexity of the timing belt layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and lead to easier and less costly maintenance of the timing belt and associated components. [...] The intervals for changing the <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> varied; the 3.6V8 (PT) required changing every , whereas the 4.2V8 (ABH) had a longer interval at [...] A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars. [...] This not only provided forced airflow for the engine coolant radiator, but also for the smaller engine oil cooler.|$|E
50|$|The SOHC EJ Subaru boxer engines were non-interference engines through 1995, run by {{a single}} <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> driving both cams (both sides of the engine) and the water pump. Because they are non-interference engines, if the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> fails, the engine of the models up to 1995 will not be damaged. The oil pump is driven {{directly}} from the crank shaft and the waterpump by the <b>timing</b> <b>belt.</b> All DOHC and 1998-up SOHC EJ engines are interference engines, if the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> fails the valves will likely be damaged.|$|R
40|$|The loss {{of energy}} in gear with <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> is a reason of belt destruction. The {{analysis}} of coupling between <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> and pulley lets us point out the most important cause for lost {{of energy in}} gears with <b>timing</b> <b>belt.</b> Due to circumferenial force and pre-tension friction forces and centrifugal forces as well as transverse and lonigitudinal forces in cords evoked by vibrations there are many complex stresses occurring in the gear...|$|R
50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>belt,</b> <b>timing</b> chain or cambelt {{is a part}} of an {{internal}} combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft(s) so that the engine's valves open and close at the proper times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes. In an interference engine the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or chain is also critical to preventing the piston from striking the valves. A <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> is usually a toothed belt -- a drive belt with teeth on the inside surface. A timing chain is a roller chain.|$|R
5000|$|Aftermarket <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> {{may be used}} {{to alter}} engine performance. OEM <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> may stretch at high rpm, {{retarding}} the cam and therefore the ignition. [...] Stronger, aftermarket belts, will not stretch and the timing is preserved. [...] In terms of engine design, [...] "shortening the width of the timing belt reduces weight and friction".|$|E
50|$|<b>Timing</b> <b>belts</b> with a helical offset tooth design are available. The helical offset tooth design forms a {{chevron pattern}} and causes the teeth to engage progressively. The chevron pattern design is {{self-aligning}} {{and does not}} make the noise that some <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> make at certain speeds, and is more efficient at transferring power (up to 98%).|$|E

50|$|For the B230 engines 1993, piston cooling, oil {{squirting}} jets {{were added}} to help alleviate piston slap problems on the turbo motors.

50|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine application the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or chain connects the crankshaft to the camshaft(s), which in turn control the opening and closing of the engine's valves. A four-stroke engine requires that the valves open and close once every other revolution of the crankshaft. The <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> does this. It has teeth to turn the camshaft(s) synchronised with the crankshaft, and is specifically designed for a particular engine. In some engine designs the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> may also be used to drive other engine components such as the water pump and oil pump.|$|R

50|$|Most modern {{production}} automobile engines use a {{timing belt}} or chain to synchronize crankshaft and camshaft rotation; some engines instead use gears to directly drive the camshafts. The {{use of a}} timing belt or chain instead of direct gear drive enables engine designers to place the camshaft(s) further from the crankshaft, and in engines with multiple camshafts a timing belt or chain also enables the camshafts to be placed further from each other. Timing chains were common on production automobiles through the 1970s and 1980s, when <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> became the norm, but timing chains have seen a resurgence in recent years. Timing chains are generally more durable than <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> - though neither is as durable as direct gear drive - however, <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> are lighter, less expensive, and operate more quietly.|$|E
50|$|On 22 June 2007, Pearson, Simon, Soter, Warshaw & Penny, LLP and the Law Office of Robert L. Starr filed a {{class action}} lawsuit against Volkswagen Group of America, alleging that the <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> for model year 1999-2003 Audi and Volkswagen {{vehicles}} equipped with a 1.8-litre turbocharged engine fail prematurely. The vehicles included are the Audi TT, Audi A4 and Volkswagen Passat. The complaint alleged that the <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> failed prior to the service interval, {{as stated in the}} owner's manual. The parties have reached a class-wide settlement, and preliminary approval of the settlement was granted by the court on 19 May 2008.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> {{is the need}} for regular replacement of the belt. Recommended belt life varies between designs; belts made from neoprene for older vehicles might have a recommended life of around 20000 mi while newer designs with lower torque loading and made from hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) may have a recommended life of 60000 mi or more. By 2004, the range for timing belt life for new engine designs was 60000 - 100000 mi, with some designs having no fixed replacement schedule but with continued use based on visual inspection. Torque loading, vibration, oil, heat and dirt reduce belt life. <b>Timing</b> <b>belts</b> are regularly replaced during engine overhauls.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Timing</b> <b>belts</b> (also {{known as}} toothed, notch, cog, or {{synchronous}} belts) are a positive transfer belt and can track relative movement. These belts have teeth that {{fit into a}} matching toothed pulley. When correctly tensioned, they have no slippage, run at constant speed, and are often used to transfer direct motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used instead of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary. Camshafts of automobiles, miniature timing systems, and stepper motors often utilize these belts. <b>Timing</b> <b>belts</b> need the least tension of all belts and {{are among the most}} efficient.
