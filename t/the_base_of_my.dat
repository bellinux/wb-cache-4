40|$|In {{the first}} part of the thesis I {{analysed}} the main concepts such as homosexuality, family, discrimination and homophobia.

Firstly I focused on the history of homosexuality in Slovenia and in the rest of the world and on the homosexuality itself. I could debate more on that subject, but I did rather focus on the more and more famous problem of the same-sex families. I described that more from the legal site. In the second part I transferred the problem directly to the child and education. At this point I was quite shocked because of the lack of the literature, so I include not only kindergarten problems, but also primary school. The last part my research was the biggest, because it’s most challenging to include homosexuality and same-sex families into the kindergarten. My biggest finding is that homosexuality and family life associated with it is still a big taboo that pre-school teachers like to avoid. Homosexuality, when mentioned connected to kindergarten, is always negative and not even mentioned in the key literature for the pre-school teachers. That is why all the activities that I wrote about in the last part are customized, and some ideas and tips are my own...|$|R

So {{far from}} it that I believe no interpretations of Greek {{religion}} have ever been so affectionate, none of Roman religion so reverent, as those which will be found at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> art teaching, and current through the entire body of my works. But {{it was from the}} Bible that I learned the symbols of Homer, and the faith of Horace; the duty enforced upon me in early youth of reading every word of the gospels and prophecies as if written by the hand of God, gave me the habit of awed attention which afterwards made many passages of the profane writers, frivolous to an irreligious reader, deeply grave to me. How far my mind has been paralysed by the faults and sorrow of life,--how far short its knowledge may be of what I might have known, had I more faithfully walked in the light I had, is beyond my conjecture or confession: but as I never wrote for my own pleasure or self-proclaiming, I have been guarded, as men who so write always will be, from errors dangerous to others; and the fragmentary expressions of feeling or statements of doctrine, which from time to time I have been able to give, will be found now by an attentive reader to bind themselves together into a general system of interpretation of Sacred literature,--both classic and Christian, which will enable him without injustice to sympathize in the faiths of candid and generous souls, of every age and every clime.|$|E
60|$|HOTCHKISS. At that, yes. But {{there was}} {{something}} worse. Judge of my horror when, calling on the coal merchant to make a trifling complaint at finding my grate acting as a battery of quick-firing guns, and being confronted by his vulgar wife, I felt in her presence an extraordinary sensation of unrest, of emotion, of unsatisfied need. I'll not disgust you with details of the madness and folly that followed that meeting. But it {{went as far as}} this: that I actually found myself prowling past the shop at night under a sort of desperate necessity to be near some place where she had been. A hideous temptation to kiss the doorstep because her foot had pressed it made me realize how mad I was. I tore myself away from London by a supreme effort; but I was on the point of returning like a needle to the lodestone when the outbreak of the war saved me. On the field of battle the infatuation wore off. The Billiter affair made a new man of me: I felt that I had left the follies and puerilities of the old days behind me for ever. But half-an-hour ago--when the Bishop sent off that ring--a sudden grip at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart filled me with a nameless terror--me, the fearless!

40|$|This {{thesis is}} titled Time {{perception}} at {{children in the}} fourth and fifth class; its main focus is put on the problems of perception the time at pupils in the second educational period. In the first part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work one can find presentation of the cognitive development of a child, ways of presenting the child's perception, different ways of teaching conceptions, theories of forming these perceptions and a few problems arising from teaching these notions. Together with descriptions there are also goals and standards copied from the official teaching plan for the fourth {{as well as for the}} fifth class. In the next part the research about time perception of pupils is presented. I have analysed those features at pupils of a few elementary schools in Ljubljana. The main attention was put on the ways of their expression in a certain historical period or their way of naming it. Furthermore, it was also observed, how they arranged the sketches chronologically, the way of arranging them and their ability of matching a certain person with the suitable historical period. In the end, the perceptions of the fourth-graders and fifth-graders were also compared. <b>The</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> research were topics in the student's books for subject Society in the 4 th and 5 th class that are connected with historical periods. By analysing them thoroughly I have tried to find out what starting-point can the children get in their books. The research has shown that there are quite big differences between the pupils in the fourth and the fifth grade in connection to the history periods and time location. ...|$|R

40|$|The reason I {{started this}} paper with the {{intention}} <b>of</b> writing <b>my</b> impressions, experiences and memoirs about how I became acquainted with library in mid- 1950 ’s and librarianship in late 1950 ’s, was my wish to explain what library and librarianship meant {{to me in my}} childhood and teenage years. Then I wanted to give an idea about <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> undergraduate education in Ankara University, Faculty of Languages, History and Geography, Department of Librarianship where I attended between 1962 - 1966 and wished to touch upon some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> memories during this period. This paper contains some professional and personal memories about my working life in Hacettepe University Libraries (Ankara) which lasted 26 years between 1966 - 1992 and my library practices supported by education during this period. I worked in Medical Books Cataloging Department of Hacettepe University Library between 1966 - 1975 and when the university divided into two basic parts as Hacettepe Medical Center and Beytepe Campus (the main central university), I worked in Reference Department of the Medical Center Library between 1975 - 1985. The information about how the basic jobs, tasks and processes were applied and by whom they were applied in these departments takes place in this paper with emphasis on my own professional practices, while talking about the practices in regard to each job or task stage I added some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> opinions and memories about each. Then I included some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> experiences in the university’s Beytepe Campus Library where I worked as a manager between 1985 - 1992. The paper contains memories about some events and circumstances that affected me during my management experience. I spent over a quarter century (1966 - 1992) in Hacettepe University Libraries. My own professional experience might give an idea about the work environment and conditions in university libraries in Turkey during the mentioned period. I aimed to illuminate the whole picture for certain period of time through presenting a personal professional profile or section. Actually, I made an effort to reflect the positive effects of further professional knowledge, which is gained through postgraduate library science education and several continuous professional education activities; these educational activities had a positive impact on my own library practices. I aimed to indicate that accompanying educational activities certainly feed and support the professional practices. The present paper tries to express the importance of such companionship through some memories. While writing about our past library experiences I may not have been very successful in remembering many practices. Therefore, my past bosses, colleagues or instructors can correct my mistakes or errors if any and enlighten us when they write their own professional experiences and memories...|$|R
