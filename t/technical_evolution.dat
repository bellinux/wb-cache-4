Beginning with his work at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), Kahn discusses his involvement as the ARPANET proposal was being written and then implemented, and his role in the public demonstration of the ARPANET. The interview continues into Kahn's involvement with networking when he moves to IPTO in 1972, where he was responsible for the administrative and <b>technical</b> <b>evolution</b> of the ARPANET, including programs in packet radio, {{the development}} of a new network protocol (TCP/IP), and the switch to TCP/IP to connect multiple networks.|$|E
2500|$|The 15th-century wares that {{initiated}} maiolica as an {{art form}} were the product of a long <b>technical</b> <b>evolution,</b> in which medieval lead-glazed wares were improved by the addition of tin oxides under the initial influence of Islamic wares imported through Sicily. [...] Such archaic wares are sometimes dubbed proto-maiolica. [...] During the later 14th century, the limited palette of colors was expanded from the traditional manganese purple and copper green to embrace cobalt blue, antimony yellow and iron-oxide orange. Sgraffito wares were also produced, in which the white tin-oxide slip was decoratively scratched to produce a design from the revealed body of the ware.|$|E

He concedes that there are biological systems which are irreducibly complex in Behe's sense but suggests that [...] "An irreducibly complex system can be built gradually by adding parts that, while initially just advantageous, become — because of later changes — essential".

To come home without the shield was the mark of a deserter; rhipsaspia or [...] "dropping the shield", was a synonym for desertion in the field.
