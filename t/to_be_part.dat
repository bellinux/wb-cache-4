5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of the back of the skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges on the inside of the nasal cavity and a ridge at the back of the lower jaw are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of the Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very {{similar to those of the}} lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of fighting, the division was based around Aulnoye-Aymeries in France.

Instead, it was demobilised {{over a period of}} months. The first 3,000 soldiers were sent home during December, and the division ceased to exist by March 1919. Prior to the division's disbandment, the remaining men were visited by Edward Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII).|$|E

5|$|After the meal, Starling {{tries to}} attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She {{handcuffs}} his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, his arm in a sling.

5|$|Although MUS81 is a {{component}} of a minor crossover pathway in the meiosis of budding yeast, plants and vertebrates, in the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, MUS81 appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of an essential, if not the predominant crossover pathway.

5|$|Although {{drivers were}} not listed, Tom Kristensen's {{injury in the}} opening round of the 2007 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season made his {{participation}} in the race questionable.

Fellow Audi DTM driver Mattias Ekström was nominated as his possible replacement by Audi. However, on 11 June 2007 Kristensen was cleared by doctors to race, leaving Ekström's services unneeded.|$|E

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about it. Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of a love triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau knew {{he would return to}} Lost at some point; he felt there was more to tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E
5|$|Although the A303 as a {{whole is}} {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of a route from London to Exeter, a popular alternative is to take the M4 motorway to Bristol, followed by the M5.

5|$|An {{archaeological site}} on the Trinity River at Cox Bar, with spear points dating from 3000–6000 BC, {{has some of the}} oldest {{evidence}} of human habitation in Northern California.

Archaeological evidence in the Whiskeytown area also indicates human presence as early as 5000 BC, although it is uncertain at what point the ancestors of modern Native American tribes arrived here.|$|E
