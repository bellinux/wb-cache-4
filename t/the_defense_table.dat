2500|$|Harry Strauss and Martin Goldstein {{were put}} on trial for the September 4, 1939, {{strangulation}} murder of bookmaker Irving Feinstein, whose body was set on fire and left in a vacant lot after Feinstein had been strangled. The trial started in September 1940 with Strauss feigning insanity. Abe Reles, the chief prosecution witness, testified that Feinstein was murdered on orders of Albert Anastasia, since he supposedly [...] "crossed" [...] Vincent Mangano. Reles testified that he, Goldstein and Strauss murdered Feinstein in his house.

She also testified hearing Strauss say that he had been bitten.

Soon after his acceptance, Roselli discovered an elaborate card-cheating operation run by one of his Las Vegas friends, Maury Friedman, and asked for his cut. The cheating was finally discovered in July 1967 by FBI agents tailing Roselli. Scores of wealthy men including millionaire Harry Karl, the husband of actress Debbie Reynolds, and actor Zeppo Marx, were bilked out of millions of dollars. Grant B.

50|$|Malcolm took as {{her subject}} the popular non-fiction writer Joe McGinniss; McGinniss {{had become a}} best-selling author with his 1969 work The Selling of the President 1968. After an {{interview}} with the accused murderer, Jeffrey MacDonald, MacDonald proposed that McGinniss write a book of his story, and asked for a share of the revenue from the book as a way to fund his legal battle. McGinniss agreed. Having received a sizable advance payment for the true crime project that would become Fatal Vision, McGinniss struck up a close friendship with the accused murderer Jeffrey MacDonald. Later, to assuage the uneasiness of other members at <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>table,</b> lead counsel Bernard Segal had McGinness sign a contract, under terms of which McGinness would not divulge defense strategy to outsiders and would put a positive spin on MacDonald's story.|$|E

Leonard Peltier was named by the FBI as a suspect in the case and placed on the agency's List of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. While driving Peltier's station wagon in Kansas several months later, ammunition in the car exploded, seriously injuring Robideau and other AIM members in the car. Robideau was arrested and tried together with Darrelle Dean Butler in a Federal court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa for the killings of the FBI agents and was acquitted. Defense attorney Lewis Gurwitz showed the jury a sacred pipe during opening arguments and stated that the pipe would be kept on <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>table</b> during the trial as a sign that the Native American's religion forbids murder.|$|E

50|$|Two {{events at}} the {{courthouse}} in 1977 gained national attention. The previous year singer Claudine Longet had been {{arrested and charged with}} murder after fatally shooting her boyfriend, skier Spider Sabich. She claimed it had been an accident. Her trial at the courthouse in early 1977 garnered international media attention, particularly because of the presence at the trial of celebrities who had begun making Aspen a second home. One, Jack Nicholson, a friend of Longet's, sat prominently behind <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>table</b> in the courtroom every day of the trial. She was ultimately found guilty of a misdemeanor charge of negligent homicide, and spent three weeks in jail. Many longtime residents, in addition to believing Longet had been punished too lightly, came to consider the attention drawn to Aspen by the trial, and Nicholson's presence in particular, as the beginning of Aspen's conversion from a plain, unpretentious ski town to glamorous Hollywood satellite community.|$|E

5000|$|Bailey {{joined the}} O. J. Simpson defense team {{just before the}} {{preliminary}} hearing. Bailey held numerous press conferences to discuss {{the progress of the}} case.

[...] His famous cross-examination of Fuhrman is {{considered by many to be}} the key to Simpson's acquittal. In front of a jury composed predominantly of people of color, Bailey got the detective to claim, [...] "marine to marine", he never used the word nigger to describe blacks at any time during the previous ten years, a claim the defense team easily found evidence to refute. Ultimately, the statement that Bailey drew from the detective forced Fuhrman to plead the Fifth in his next courtroom appearance, thereby undermining his credibility with the jury and the otherwise devastating evidence he allegedly found. Bailey also attracted minor attention for keeping a silver flask on <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>table,</b> which fellow defense attorney Robert Kardashian claimed contained only coffee.|$|E

McGinniss shared housing with his book's subject, exercised with him, and sat beside him at <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>table</b> during his trial. As Malcolm writes, [...] "They clothed their complicated business together in the mantle of friendship—in this case, friendship of a particularly American cast, whose emblems of intimacy are watching sports on television, drinking beer, running, and classifying women according to their looks." [...] Within a month of MacDonald's conviction, the journalist began a series of letters. Malcolm quotes McGinniss' expressions of sympathy—"any fool can recognize within five minutes that you did not receive a fair trial...it was utter madness"—as well as his tacit assurances that the book would help win his release: [...] "it's a hell of a thing—spend the summer making a new friend and the bastards come and lock him up.

5000|$|On October 27, 2016, Ammon Bundy and {{six other}} {{defendants}} were found not guilty of conspiracy to impede federal officers and possession of firearms in a federal facility by a jury.

The judge released five of the defendants, but returned Ammon and Ryan Bundy to federal custody because they also face trial related to the 2014 Bundy standoff in Nevada. At the end of the trial, Marcus Mumford, Ammon Bundy's lawyer, argued with the judge that Bundy should be released immediately {{on the grounds that the}} court did not have a detainer, and the United States Marshals Service had no document authorizing Bundy's detention. Both of the Bundy brothers had been ordered to be held without bail in January when they were charged. After the judge admonished him for yelling at the bench, six U.S. Marshals surrounded <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>table</b> and then tackled Mumford and tased him when he resisted.
