5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges.

Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report.

In 1921, he removed the Woodford County jailer from office because he allowed a black inmate to be lynched and offered a reward of $25,000 {{for information leading to}} the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. Citizens of Versailles were more outraged that the jailer had been removed from office than that the prisoner had been lynched. The locals refused to aid in <b>the</b> <b>investigation,</b> <b>and</b> the lynchers were never arrested or charged.

5|$|Alice and Hugh I {{married in}} the first half of 1210, with Alice {{receiving}} the County of Jaffa as the agreed upon dowry. Alice's sister, Philippa, married Erard of Ramerupt, who laid claim to Champagne and Brie on Philippa's behalf in 1213. Blanche of Navarre soon approached the Holy See to demand an investigation into the validity of the second and third marriage of Alice's and Philippa's mother, stating that her first marriage to Humphrey IV of Toron had not been canonically annulled. The inquiry conducted by Cardinal Robert of Courçon at the pope's order concluded that both Humphrey IV and Isabella I had protested against the annulment of their marriage, which suggested that Isabella I's two subsequent marriages were unlawful. However, the Holy See did not complete <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> thus the legitimacy of Alice (and her sister) was not questioned.|$|E
5|$|Although Smith {{maintained}} his innocence, detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran's death {{and those of}} the other two women.

At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him: a motorist who saw him buying petrol, and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance. Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight, although he had no visible signs of injury.|$|E
5|$|Among Beshear's other {{activities}} as lieutenant governor was {{his participation in}} an investigation of Kentucky Utilities' coal-buying practices.

Beshear had clashed with the company over similar issues during his term as attorney general. The company attempted to block Beshear's participation in the investigation, but the Kentucky Public Service Commission rejected the attempt. Due {{to the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> the number of appeals filed, the matter was not fully adjudicated until 1992, well past the end of Beshear's term.

5|$|At first, {{there was}} only one {{political}} party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The party was, however, broken into three divisions that would later split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly over the issue of slavery, but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was dominant in the beginning. The Noble party was in favor of slavery, and the Hendricks party was generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried to impeach Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's.
