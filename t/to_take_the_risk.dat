5|$|His {{success in}} Gruban v Booth allowed Hastings to switch his {{practice}} {{from the county}} courts to the High Court, and {{at the beginning of}} Hilary term 1919 he applied to become a King's Counsel (KC). Becoming a KC was a risk; he would go from competing with other junior barristers to coming up against the finest minds in the profession. Despite this he decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk,</b> and he was accepted later that year.|$|E
5|$|Tara {{finds her}} {{strength}} in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start {{spending most of}} their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat would not want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk,</b> and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts {{that she is a}} realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his own sake.|$|E
25|$|The {{raising of}} capital in Rotterdam did not go so smoothly. A {{considerable}} part originated from inhabitants of Dordrecht. Although it did not raise as much capital as Amsterdam or Middelburg-Zeeland, Enkhuizen had the largest input in the share capital of the VOC. Under the first 358 shareholders, there were many small entrepreneurs, who dared <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk.</b> The minimum investment in the VOC was 3,000 guilders, which priced the Company's stock within the means of many merchants.|$|E

25|$|The German fleet {{would only}} sortie into the North Sea thrice more, with {{a raid on}} 19 August, one in October 1916 and another in April 1918.

25|$|This {{election}} {{was the first}} since 1995 in which no independent candidates were elected, mostly because the HDP decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of running as a party. Former footballer and AKP MP Hakan Şükür, who resigned from his party following the 2013 government corruption scandal, came the closest to being elected with around 32,000 votes, running in İstanbul's 3rd electoral district. Osman Pamukoğlu, {{the leader of the}} Rights and Equality Party, ran as an independent to bypass the election threshold and won around 15,000 votes, submitting a complaint to the Electoral Council over the results.|$|E
25|$|Although the Archers {{claimed they}} were a normal, happily-married couple, by this time, {{according}} to the journalist Adam Raphael, Jeffrey and Mary Archer were living largely separate lives. The editor of the Daily Star, Lloyd Turner, was sacked six weeks after the trial by the paper's owner Lord Stevens of Ludgate. Adam Raphael soon afterwards found proof that Archer had perjured himself at the trial, but his superiors were unwilling <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of a potentially costly libel case. The News of the World later settled out-of-court with Archer, acknowledging they, too, had libelled him.|$|E
25|$|Although the 6600 and 7600 {{had been}} huge successes in the end, both {{projects}} had almost bankrupted the company {{while they were}} being designed. The 8600 was running into similar difficulties and Cray eventually decided that the only solution was to start over fresh. This time Norris was not willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk,</b> and another project within the company, the CDC STAR-100 seemed to be progressing more smoothly. Norris said {{he was willing to}} keep the project alive at a low level until the STAR was delivered, at which point full funding could be put into the 8600. Cray was unwilling to work under these conditions and left the company.|$|E

25|$|Another of Ybor’s {{modifications}} to the company town model was that his community was not a one-(or even two-) company town. To {{increase the number of}} jobs (and thus the pool of available workers), Ybor encouraged other cigar manufacturers to move to his new colony by offering cheap land and a free factory building if they agreed to meet certain job-creation quotas. Even with these inducements, cigar workers and other cigar manufacturers were slow in coming to what was still a primitive settlement - few were willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of moving to and buying a home in a new place that might not last.|$|E
25|$|Schätzl {{could not}} remove her still intact PIP breast {{implants}} {{as a precaution}} (as recommended by Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices) because she announced in January 2012 that she was five months pregnant and therefore did not want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of a general anaesthetic in fear of harming her unborn child. Schätzl raised awareness about the problems women with the toxic implants faced; however, she never sold her interviews about this issue or her pregnancy for money to the press but helped with her media partners several women, who couldn't afford the operation, to have their implants replaced for free.|$|E
25|$|A team {{of federal}} agents and {{officers}} from police forces {{from outside of}} Chicago was formed, along with {{a very small number}} of Chicago police officers. Among them was Sergeant Martin Zarkovich, the officer to whom Sage had acted as an informant. At the time, federal officials felt that the Chicago police had been compromised and therefore could not be trusted; Hoover and Purvis also wanted more of the credit. Not wanting <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of another embarrassing escape of Dillinger, the police were split into two groups. On Sunday, one team was sent to the Marbro Theater on the city's west side, while another team surrounded the Biograph Theater at 2433 N. Lincoln Avenue on the north side.|$|E

60|$|Signals were {{exchanged}} {{between the two}} English vessels, and {{in a very short}} time they were steaming toward the repeller. It was a dangerous thing for two vessels of their size to come close enough together for both to ram an enemy at the same time, but it was determined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> and do this, if possible; for the destruction of the repeller was obviously the first duty in hand.|$|R

25|$|The last {{missing in}} {{this list of}} saints is St. John Sarkander (Czech Jan Sarkander), whose statue (holding a lily {{as a symbol of}} purity) is on the second stage. John Sarkander was a priest who was {{tortured}} to death in Olomouc prison {{in the beginning of the}} Thirty Years' War, because he, as the legend says, refused to break the seal of confession. The decision to place him here violated the tradition, since Sarkander had not been canonized and not even beatified in that time yet, which could have resulted in problems with the Holy See. However, his following was so strong here that the craftsmen decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk.</b> Sarkander was beatified in 1859 and canonized in 1995 on the occasion of the visit of Pope John Paul II in Olomouc.|$|E
25|$|Capturing {{them would}} deal a deathblow to the Egyptian's {{strategic}} {{operation in the}} entire Peninsula. The capture of these four objectives were hoped to be {{the means by which}} the entire Egyptian Army would rout and fall back into Egypt proper, which British and French forces would then be able to push up against an Israeli advance, and crush in a decisive encounter. On 24 October, Dayan ordered a partial mobilization. When this led to a state of confusion, Dayan ordered full mobilization, and chose <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that he might alert the Egyptians. As {{part of an effort to}} maintain surprise, Dayan ordered Israeli troops that were to go to the Sinai to be ostentatiously concentrated near the border with Jordan first, which was intended to fool the Egyptians into thinking that it was Jordan that the main Israeli blow was to fall on.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{misfeasance}} provision reflects {{causes of}} action vested in the company, any money recovered under it is held {{so that it}} will go to pay off creditors in their ordinary order of priority. In Re Anglo-Austrian Printing & Publishing Union this meant that a liquidator who had successfully sued directors for £7000 had to give up the funds to a group of debenture holders, who had not yet been paid in full, so there is no discretion to apply the assets in favour of unsecured creditors. A potential benefit is that because the causes of action are vested in the company, they may be assigned to third parties, who may prefer <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> and reward of pursuing litigation over the liquidator or administrator. These features are the reverse for money recovered through the statutory based causes of action of fraudulent and wrongful trading.|$|E
50|$|Ross Frank {{has argued}} that the {{painting}} is a political satire directed at the participants in the first stages of the Dutch Revolt (1568-1648), where the roasted fowl represents the humiliation and failure of the nobleman (who would otherwise form the fourth spoke of the wheel) in his leadership of the Netherlands, and the overall scene depicts the complacency of the Netherlandish people, too content with their abundance <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> that would bring about significant religious and political change.|$|R
50|$|A Human Rights Watch report {{released}} in January 2013 found that Nevsun Resources failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> of forced labour seriously and then struggled to address allegations of abuse connected to its company’s Bisha mine in Eritrea. Eritrea’s government maintains a “national service” program that conscripts Eritreans into prolonged and indefinite terms of forced labor, generally under abusive conditions. It is through this forced labor program that mining companies run <b>the</b> most direct <b>risk</b> {{of involvement in}} the Eritrean government’s human rights violations.|$|R
50|$|Research institutes {{associated}} with or organized as constituent parts of productive enterprises were quite rare and represented {{the smallest of}} the five systems of research institutes. Only the largest mines, oil fields, or factories, such as the Anshan iron and steel complex in Liaoning Province or the Yanshan petrochemical complex in Beijing, had their own research units, dedicated to solving immediate problems in production in the late 1980s. Enterprises concentrated on production, and their managers had little incentive <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> {{associated with}} innovation.|$|R
25|$|Tatsuro Udo, battle {{programmer}} for Eternia, Rebirth and Graces, {{helped design}} the battle system. During {{the beginning of}} development, the team had to recreate the basic gameplay from the Xillia games to work off, which proved a difficult task for the team. The battle system was intended to combine familiar elements from previous installments with new ideas intended to refresh the series. Creating the seamless transition between exploration and combat, as well as implementing Armitization, proved to {{be difficult for the}} team. The idea of encountering and fighting enemies in the same space as exploration was designed to help evoke a fresh sense of adventure for players, as the team felt the previous method of transferring to a separate battle arena was limiting the series' development. Until the battle system's completion, development of other systems related to it was slow. As part of this development, a completely new engine had to be developed for the game, rather than just modified their old engine {{as they did in the}} past. Because of a staff shortage, developing the game was harder than previous titles and took a longer time. The PlayStation 3 was chosen as the original platform of release as the next generation of gaming hardware had yet to take off in Japan in terms of sales, and Bandai Namco was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of releasing on platforms with low install bases.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July, Archduke Charles {{finally decided}} not to fight the enemy near the Danube and retreated to the higher ground {{overlooking}} the Marchfeld. This was a major decision, as it meant that the earlier plan to man the 16 redoubts next to the Danube and fight the enemy there was abandoned. Instead, Archduke Charles occupied both the Bisamberg heights and the Wagram plateau behind the Russbach river, covering the retreat routes to Bohemia and Moravia respectively, thus occupying a sound strategic position. Although the army was {{not strong enough to}} occupy both positions and no earthworks were provided for the new position, it was thought that, given that the two heights were placed at an angle to one another, any enemy force attacking would find itself placed between two pincers. There was perhaps further justification for this choice on a tactical level: the broken and wooded terrain in the immediate proximity of the Danube was adapted to fighting in open order formations, which were insufficiently mastered by his men, and at which the French were adept. This was, without a doubt, one of the bitter lessons that the Austrians learned at Aspern and Essling. But above all, the cautious Archduke Charles was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of committing his forces in such an advanced position, knowing that he {{would have a hard time}} extricating them, should retreat have become necessary. He also planned not to face the enemy on the flat plains of the Marchfeld, an ideal cavalry terrain, where the numerically superior French horse would quickly gain the upper hand. The two influential staff officers, Wimpffen and Grünne, had been actively advocating for this position for weeks and this time Charles finally acquiesced to their point of view.|$|E

500|$|Chaplin {{spent two}} years {{developing}} the script, and began filming in September 1939 – six days after Britain declared war on Germany. He had submitted to using spoken dialogue, partly out of acceptance {{that he had no}} other choice, but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message. Making a comedy about Hitler was seen as highly controversial, but Chaplin's financial independence allowed him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk.</b> [...] "I was determined to go ahead," [...] he later wrote, [...] "for Hitler must be laughed at." [...] Chaplin replaced the Tramp (while wearing similar attire) with [...] "A Jewish Barber", a reference to the Nazi party's belief that he was Jewish. In a dual performance, he also played the dictator [...] "Adenoid Hynkel", who parodied Hitler.|$|E

[...] "The pressure {{to come up with}} singles was, as always, immense.

500|$|In 2005, Todd Lasance {{auditioned for}} the role of Jack Holden; however, actor Paul O'Brien secured the role. The serial's {{producers}} called Lasance back, offering him the part of Aden, which was a guest role lasting six weeks. Aden was brought into the serial to play a part of Cassie Turner's (Sharni Vinson) storylines. Lasance had not previously watched the serial, but upon learning of his part he said he watched it [...] "religiously" [...] and carried out research on the net. In April 2007, The Newcastle Herald announced that Lasance would return to filming with Home and Away. He was signed another guest contract. While filming the stint programme, bosses decided that Aden should become a regular character and Lasance signed a new contract. At the time there was a possibility of Lasance securing a role in the television series The Pacific. However, he chose to re-join Home and Away because did not want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of losing both roles.|$|E
50|$|That leapfrogging {{can arise}} because an {{established}} monopolist has a somewhat reduced incentive to innovate {{because he is}} earning rents from the old technology. This is somewhat based on Joseph Schumpeter's notion of ‘gales of creative destruction’.

No vendor, however, was willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks.</b> Finally, there was an initial public offering, and the new Emperor personally signed for 350 of them, inspiring others to do the same.
