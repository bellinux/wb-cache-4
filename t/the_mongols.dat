5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> of the Ilkhanate {{continued}} {{to move towards}} the Holy Land, city after city fell to <b>the</b> <b>Mongols.</b> The typical Mongol pattern was to give a region one chance to surrender. If the target acquiesced, <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> absorbed the populace and warriors into their own Mongol army, which they would then use to further expand the empire. If a community did not surrender, <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> forcefully took the settlement or settlements and slaughtered everyone they found. Faced with the option of subjugation to or combat with the nearby Mongol horde, many communities chose the former, including some Christian realms.|$|E

50|$|In a valley, <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> is {{sharpening}} his Ild sword. Nearby, the Comanche cautiously {{makes his}} {{way to the top of}} the ridge overlooking <b>the</b> valley. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol,</b> feeling as if he's being watched, looks to the top of the ridge. Seeing nothing, he goes back to sharpening his Ild. Back up on the ridge, the Comanche readies his bow and arrow and fires downward to <b>the</b> unsuspecting <b>Mongol.</b> <b>The</b> arrow lands a foot away from <b>the</b> <b>Mongol,</b> startling him. He stands up and looks to the source of the arrow, but is unable to make it out due to the Comanche standing against the sun. Using this opportunity, the Comanche fires two more arrows at the blinded Mongolian, one which flies past him and another which lands right in front of him. The Comanche raises his bow and gives off a loud war cry and falls back. Gathering his senses, <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> sheaths his Ild and mounts his horse, while the Comanche thrusts his War Lance into the ground and slings his War Hawk on his back. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> reaches <b>the</b> top of the hill, but is confused when he only finds the Comanche's horse. Hanging off the side of the horse, the Comanche pulls himself up to reveal himself, takes aim with his bow and arrow, and shoots <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> in <b>the</b> chest. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> is saved by his lamellar breastplate however, as he angrily thrusts his glaive into the ground and pulls out the arrow. The Comanche rides ahead to set up another attack while <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> pulls out his bow and arrow. The Comanche rides past as <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> fires another shot, which barely misses him. The Comanche rides up to his War Lance, which he pulls out of the ground and hides into <b>the</b> bushes. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> rides up to his glaive and pulls it out, seeing the Comanche's horse up on the rocky outcropping. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> starts to ride to the abandoned horse when the Comanche ambushes him by tackling him from a rock, throwing him from his horse. The Comanche assumes a battle stance while <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> gathers himself and his Glaive. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> swings his glaive but is parried by the Comanche's War Lance. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> counters by slashing at the Comanche's back. The Comanche rolls, dropping his lance as he also avoids a circular slash. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> goes in for a thrust, but the Comanche grabs the glaive and avoids the attack and counters with an elbow strike to <b>the</b> <b>Mongol's</b> head. <b>The</b> Comanche stomps on the glaive, breaking it as <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> gets back up and unsheathes his Ild. The Comanche pulls out his War Hawk and the two warriors clash. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> deflects a swing and counters, slashing the Comanche's forearm. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> goes in for a follow-up swing while the Comanche is still stunned, but the Comanche counters by grabbing the arms of <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> and hitting <b>the</b> Ild out of his hands, then spinning around and digging the War Hawk into the back of <b>the</b> <b>Mongol.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> pushes <b>the</b> War Hawk away as the Comanche gets it out and front kicks the Comanche, knocking him to the ground. The Comanche recovers and runs off into a cave while <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> runs back to his horse to retrieve his Flanged Mace and follows the Comanche into the cave. Inside <b>the</b> cave, <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> slowly searches out the Comanche, who has his back to a wall and is holding his War Hawk as well as a Scalping Knife. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> spots <b>the</b> Comanche and swings his mace, which impacts on the cave wall as the Comanche dodges. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> takes aim and swings the heavy mace again, hitting the floor as the Comanche dodges and gets set up for a counter-attack. The Comanche goes in for a swing with the War Hawk, but <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> counters with a swing that hits the Native American in the back, sending him reeling. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> swings again, but the Comanche ducks under and quickly stabs <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> in <b>the</b> side with his Scalping Knife. <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> goes in for another swing, but misses as the Comanche ducks and goes in for two more stabs. While <b>the</b> <b>Mongol</b> is stunned, <b>the</b> Comanche grabs his War Hawk and buries it into the neck of <b>the</b> <b>Mongol.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mongol</b> slumps to <b>the</b> cave floor, dead as the Comanche removes his hat and cuts off <b>the</b> <b>Mongol's</b> scalp with his Scalping Knife. Victorious, the Comanche stumbles out of the cave mouth, shouting as he holds the bloody scalp on high.|$|R

5|$|Contact between Europeans and Mongols began around 1220, with {{occasional}} {{messages from the}} papacy and European monarchs to Mongol leaders such as the Great Khan, and subsequently to the Ilkhans in Mongol-conquered Persia. Communications tended to follow a recurring pattern: the Europeans asked <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> to convert to Western Christianity, while <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> responded with demands for submission and tribute. <b>The</b> <b>Mongols</b> had already conquered many Christian and Muslim nations in their advance across Asia, and after destroying the Muslim Abbasid and Ayyubid dynasties, {{for the next few}} generations fought the remaining Islamic power in the region, the Egyptian Mamluks. Hethum I, king of the Christian nation of Cilician Armenia, had submitted to <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> in 1247, and strongly encouraged other monarchs to engage in a Christian-Mongol alliance, but was only able to persuade his son-in-law, Prince Bohemond VI of the Crusader State of Antioch, who submitted in 1260. Other Christian leaders such as the Crusaders of Acre were more mistrustful of <b>the</b> <b>Mongols,</b> perceiving them as the most significant threat in the region. The Barons of Acre therefore engaged in an unusual passive alliance with the Muslim Mamluks, allowing Egyptian forces to advance unopposed through Crusader territory to engage and defeat <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> at the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{cooperation}} between <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> and their Christian subjects in Antioch, other Christians in the Levant regarded the Mongol approach with unease. Jacques Pantaléon, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, saw <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> as a clear threat, and {{had written to}} the Pope to warn him about them in 1256. The Franks did, however, send the Dominican David of Ashby {{to the court of}} Hulagu in 1260. In Sidon, Julian Grenier, Lord of Sidon and Beaufort, described by his contemporaries as irresponsible and light-headed, took an opportunity to raid and plunder the area of the Beqaa Valley in Mongol territory. One of <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> killed was Kitbuqa's nephew, and in retaliation, Kitbuqa raided the city of Sidon. These events added to the level of distrust between <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> and the Crusader forces, whose own center of power was now in the coastal city of Acre.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Gaozong and the {{emergence}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mongols,</b> the Song dynasty formed a military alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> in the hope of finally defeating the Jin dynasty. Several tens of thousands of carts full of grain were sent to the Mongol army during the siege. Following the destruction of the Jurchens in 1234, the Southern Song generals broke the alliance, proceeding to recapture the three historical capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang and Chang'an. However, the cities, ravaged by years of warfare, lacked economic capacity and yielded little defensibility. This breaking of alliance meant open warfare between <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> and the Song Chinese. Ögodei Khan's forces conquered fifty-four out of Sichuan's fifty-eight total districts by 1236, while ordering the slaughter of over a million people that inhabited the city of Chengdu, which was taken by <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> with ease.|$|E

5|$|Genghis Khan was {{declared}} Khaghan in 1206. <b>The</b> <b>Mongols</b> had united under his leadership, and defeated the rival tribes of the steppes.

The Tangut Western Xia ruled parts of the western China, while the Song Dynasty reigned over the south. <b>The</b> <b>Mongols</b> subjugated Western Xia in 1210. In that same year, <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> renounced their vassalage to the Jin. Hostilities between the Jin and Mongols had been building up. <b>The</b> <b>Mongols</b> coveted the prosperity of Jurchen territory.

5|$|Historians {{dispute the}} exact meaning of Urban's actions. The {{mainstream}} view, exemplified by British historian Peter Jackson, holds that Urban still regarded <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> as enemies at this time. This perception began changing {{a few years}} later, during the pontificate of Pope Clement IV (1265–68), when <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> were seen more as potential allies. However, the French historian Jean Richard argues that Urban's act signaled {{a turning point in}} Mongol-European relations as early as 1263, after which <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> were considered as actual allies. Richard also argues that it was in response to this forming coalition between the Franks, Ilkhanid Mongols and Byzantines, that <b>the</b> <b>Mongols</b> of the Golden Horde allied with the Muslim Mamluks in return. However, the mainstream view of historians is that though there were many attempts at forming an alliance, the attempts proved unsuccessful.|$|E
