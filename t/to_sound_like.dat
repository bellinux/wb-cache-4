5|$|Designed <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a 1980s record, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. was {{influenced}} by artists such as the Cure, Depeche Mode, Cyndi Lauper and Madonna. The album incorporates a diverse range of genres, including electropop, dance-rock, new wave, R, hip hop, soul, and disco, while lyrically, most of its songs are about fashion and wealth. Promotion of the album included the release of six commercially successful singles and the North American Harajuku Lovers concert tour. While promoting, Stefani was often accompanied by back-up dancers called the Harajuku Girls.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, {{in an effort to}} replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
5|$|Outside the Final Fantasy franchise, Lightning {{features}} in a minigame in , {{was part of}} a collaboration between the Final Fantasy series and Puzzle & Dragons alongside other established series characters, and versions of her outfit from XIII may be worn by protagonist Aya Brea in The 3rd Birthday and a character from arcade shooter Gunslinger Stratos 2. Maaya Sakamoto, who portrays both Aya and Lightning, voiced Aya <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Lightning when the outfit is equipped.|$|E

5|$|Bond later {{scales the}} walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two {{identical}} Blofelds, who use an electronic device <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, {{which turns out to}} be a look-alike. The real Blofeld pulls a gun on Bond, and instructs him into a elevator, where he is knocked out by gas. He is picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to Las Vegas Valley, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. The pipeline is buried the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin {{the difficult task of}} trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Front Mission 3, the third {{game of the}} main series and the fifth game of the total series, was {{composed}} by Koji Hayama and Hayato Matsuo, with one track contributed by Shigeki. Matsuo handled the orchestral pieces, while Hayama worked on the techno ones. The pieces were performed with synthesizers that were designed <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> higher-quality versions {{of the types of}} sounds used in the original Front Mission, rather than sounding more like the actual instruments they represented. Hayama worked for Square as an in-house composer prior to the game, and was the one who invited Matsuo, who was an independent composer, to meet the sound team and work on the game. An album of music from the game, titled Front Mission 3 Original Soundtrack, was released by DigiCube on September 22, 1999. The two-disc album has 47 tracks, is 2:30:00 long, and has a catalog number of SSCX-10035.|$|E

25|$|David Jacobs's {{ability to}} play {{a wide variety of}} characters, each with his own {{distinctive}} voice, resulted in him playing 22 different characters during the course of Journey Into Space. He used to mark up his script using different colour pencils, to help him remember what each character was supposed <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like.</b> In episode 1 of The Red Planet, Jet is interviewed by a group of newspaper reporters, all of whom were played by Jacobs.|$|E
25|$|Peak {{claimed that}} {{he lowered his voice}} to {{disguise}} it. Alternately, in his February 4, 1971 deposition, he claimed to have shouted and raised his voice <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> he was excited. In that deposition, he also {{claimed that he}} gave the 911 operator an address on Pratt Street and that the operator asked him his home phone number. In the weeks after the bombing, Peak's brother was said to have identified the voice as Peak's.|$|E
25|$|It was {{thanks to}} Culshaw's devotion to Wagnerian {{intentions}} – ever {{encouraged by the}} engineer who was at his right hand through the whole project, Gordon Parry, himself a devoted Wagnerian – that in the Solti Ring cycle one is able to hear the scores in a way literally impossible in the theatre. Siegfried's voice made <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Gunther's, the voice of Fafner from his cave, {{not to mention the}} splendour of anvils and rainbow bridge harps in Rheingold, all transcend what is heard in the opera-house.|$|E

25|$|Alpha mounted {{back up at}} 10:50am {{to drive}} back into town and try to assist Bravo Company. This request {{had come from the}} Ops Room and had been worded {{carefully}} so as not <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> an order; only the commander on the ground could assess whether or not Alpha could be of any use. As they expected, they came under contact with heavy fire almost immediately and they had to de-bus from the DAF truck. An RPG was fired at the truck, but was deflected {{just in front of the}} vehicle by an electricity cable.|$|E
25|$|To {{compose the}} music, Sakoda used real instruments, then notated {{the music on}} an MSX {{computer}} and converted it onto a PC-9800. Since he didn't like mechanical sounds, he programmed the virtual instruments <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> they were played by humans. Sakoda worked closely with sound effects programmer Masanobu Tsukamoto. Since the game had limited sound channels, he exercised caution not to create too many simultaneous sounds so the sound effects would not cut out the music. Sakoda only had four channels to use in any given song, {{one of which was}} always fixexd on drums. After the soundtrack was nearly finished. Compile leadership told Sakoda to change the music to something which fit the Japanese aesthetic. After hearing a new soundtrack with plucky Japanese instruments, leadership told Sakoda to revert back to his original music.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, during his {{conducting}} stint in Saint Paul, Minnesota, McGlaughlin often {{spoke to the}} audience before a performance, informally explaining the program and what to listen for. Garrison Keillor heard him, and invited McGlaughlin to fill in occasionally as host of his daily morning radio show on Minnesota Public Radio (MPR). MPR producer Tom Voegeli {{came up with the}} idea for a new show: Saint Paul Sunday Morning, with McGlaughlin as host. MPR had just received a public radio communications satellite uplink, as well as seed money to develop a few pilot shows for national distribution. Voegeli wanted a program which would present world-class musicians, in an informal live setting in MPR's new state-of-the-art studio, to a national audience. Voegeli also wanted McGlaughlin <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> himself — a musician — rather than like a broadcaster, and to share his own intimate, animated enthusiasm with listeners.|$|E
6000|$|Down {{went the}} heap of {{struggling}} men again and rolled over. There was, I am afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream of [...] "Mercy! Mercy!" [...] that died down swiftly <b>to</b> a <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> choking.|$|R
60|$|Lawrence {{referred}} <b>to</b> a <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> {{the drone}} of a giant mosquito, which proceeded from the negro's nose, for that worthy was a heavy sleeper-- when not in danger--and had not been disturbed {{by the arrival of}} the guide.|$|R
50|$|While {{the album}} {{continued}} in a psychedelic vein, the band also experimented with a folkier sound. Vestiges of a gothic rock sound remained, but the band continued <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> less <b>like</b> their previous outfit, Bauhaus.|$|R
500|$|On March 26, 2002, {{recording}} for Poodle Hat officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. By mid-2002, six originals—"Hardware Store", [...] "Party At The Leper Colony", [...] "Wanna B Ur Lovr", [...] "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?", [...] "Bob", and [...] "Genius In France"—had been recorded. The album's first original song is [...] "Hardware Store", which, {{as the title}} suggests, is about a new neighborhood hardware store {{and the things that}} can be purchased therein. The song was originally supposed to be a style parody of another (unspecified) artist, but it eventually evolved into its own, original composition. [...] "Party At The Leper Colony" [...] describes a party at a leper colony. The song makes heavy use of wordplay, using common English idioms to describe events wherein people literally lose body parts (e.g. [...] "Dance all night to a rotten band/Come on, people, let's give 'em a hand"). [...] "Wanna B Ur Lovr", a pastiche of Midnite Vultures-era Beck, consists of pick-up lines which become steadily more ridiculous and suggestive. Because the spelling of the song's title recalls the manner in which Prince titled many of his records, Yankovic specified on his website that the [...] "song is actually intended <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> me trying <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Beck trying <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Prince" [...]|$|E
500|$|Gillan pays {{particular}} interest to the lyrics in Deep Purple, and considers it his prime composing role within the band. Discussing the importance of lyrics, he said [...] "Words have to sound good. They have <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> an instrument, {{they have to have}} the right percussive value." [...] He described the words of 2003's Bananas as [...] "politics mostly." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{recording}} started, {{both parties}} organized a listening {{session with the}} musical material Hammond and Casablancas had brought to show the tone and energy they liked. One of the prerequisites mentioned at the meeting was to take {{what was happening in}} music at the time, and go in a completely different direction. Casablancas wanted Is This It <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a band from the past that took a time trip into the future to make their record". The approach for the album became more studied than that of The Modern Age. The group wanted the majority of songs <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> them playing live, while they requested a few others to be like [...] "a weird, in-studio production with a drum machine, even though no drum machine was used". The songs of the latter type were done track-by-track and were crafted into non-standard rock arrangements. Raphael's background in industrial music played a large part in the album's conception.|$|E
50|$|Until November 12, 2008, it {{broadcast}} {{an acoustic}} rock format. The Loft changed formats <b>to</b> what <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the now-defunct SIRIUS Disorder and Fine Tuning by that time, with the acoustic rock format broadcast on its sister channel, The Coffee House.|$|R
50|$|WVIB's new {{calls were}} WZZN (The Zone-slogan though not used) with a {{short-lived}} jazz and then short-lived classic rock format also via satellite except for its live morning show with Emily Anton. Both formats were unsuccessful. The station {{was moved to}} the WFAS studios in Hartsdale, New York and eventually changed its calls <b>to</b> WFAF (<b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> WFAS) <b>to</b> become a northern simulcast of WFAS-FM and its AC format. On February 29, 2012 Cumulus dropped the WFAS/WFAF simulcast and started simulcasting country WDBY on it, in essence returning it to what it had been during its Super Station years albeit now with country. The calls were changed <b>to</b> WDVY (<b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> WDBY).|$|R
5000|$|In Part C, the {{listener}} is taken <b>to</b> what <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a campfire vignette before being {{interrupted by a}} Native American rain dance followed by thunder and rain. The wordless vocal lines {{are similar to the}} [...] "Fire" [...] music from Smile.|$|R
500|$|AllMusic {{said that}} [...] "instead of doing {{something}} calculated like emulating Nirvana or Pearl Jam—or for that matter, Nine Inch Nails or Ministry—Slayer wisely refused <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> anyone but Slayer. Tom Araya and co. responded to the new environment simply by striving to be the heaviest metal band they possibly could." [...] By the album's release date, vocalist Tom Araya considered it to be their best album.|$|E
500|$|The album {{also takes}} aim at small {{companies}} {{put out of}} business by giant corporations. Cool made an example out of record shops closing when a national retailer makes it to town. [...] "It's like there's just one voice you can hear," [...] he said. [...] "Not <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a preachy person, but it's getting towards the Big Brother of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four— except here you {{have two or three}} corporations running everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Scott-Heron {{received}} top-billing for the release, Jamie xx worked {{solely on}} the remix project. For We're New Here, he remixed 13 of the original album's 15 songs, including its [...] "interlude" [...] cuts, mixing Scott-Heron's vocal tracks from the original recording sessions over his own beats and instrumentals, rather than the original music. Many of the remixes were created by Jamie xx on his laptop, while on tour with The xx. In a March2010 interview, {{he said that the}} label [...] "gave me the parts and let me do whatever I want, so I've been doing it on my laptop on tour. [...] only using [...] vocals, I'm not using any of the original music from it, which is very freeing". On his intentions for the album's music, he explained in an interview for The Irish Times, [...] "I wanted it <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> everything I had been listening to in London. I wanted it <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> something you’d hear on pirate radio. You hear so many different genres, and it’s all so convoluted and mixed-up, but it makes sense when you turn on the station".|$|E
60|$|It {{began to}} be strong, to move vigorously and freely, <b>to</b> make <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> words. It was a baby girl now. Already it knew his strong hands, it exulted in his strong clasp, it laughed and crowed when he played with it.|$|R
50|$|In {{the altered}} form of his name, Cannabas, Herwig Wolfram assumes a cacography {{of the name}} Cannabaudes, <b>to</b> make it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> cannabis.|$|R
5000|$|... "This Is Hardcore" [...] (Swedish Erotica Remix) playfully {{uses the}} {{original}} vocals played in reverse <b>to</b> make them <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the Swedish language.|$|R
