By checking {{peers in the}} sets P(D=i)and P(D=i- 1), we can find whether or not some peers in the set P(D=i)receive message from multiple (≥ 2) relay peers in the set P(D=i- 1). If a peer receives a message from multiple peers, we can select only the most trustworthy relay <b>peer</b> <b>to</b> deliver the message <b>to</b> the <b>peer.</b> Thus, we can not only more reliably deliver messages <b>to</b> <b>peers</b> but also reduce unnecessary message delivery.|$|R
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E
5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> {{down the length of}} the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|E

They are responsible for ensuring the safety of patrons and staff at sanctioned events and venues across the campus, enforcing governing regulations of the AMS and uphold regulations stipulated in the Liquor Licence Act of Ontario. Student Constables do not serve as the university's primary security service as they are legally not peace officers, nor are they registered as a private security service under the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services. The university's administration operates its own security service which is registered in Ontario as a private security service. As of March 2012, the Student Constables are funded through a mandatory $10 fee levied on undergraduates annually by the AMS.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the link between warmth and conflict in the sibling relationship and positivity and negativity in the parent-child relationship and the link between warmth and conflict in the sibling relationship on the attachment <b>to</b> <b>peers.</b> Method: Participants were 187 secondary school children {{in the age of}} 11 to 15 years who lived in the south of the Netherlands. Data were gathered through self-report questionnaires over two years. Results: The research questions were answered with regression analyses. Findings revealed that the sibling relationship has a positive and negative influence on the parent-child relationship and vice versa, and that attachment <b>to</b> <b>peers</b> has influence on the positive relationship between siblings. Discussion: In contrast to the expectation was the influence of attachment <b>to</b> <b>peers</b> on warmth in the sibling relationship stronger than the influence of warmth in the sibling relationship on attachment <b>to</b> <b>peers.</b> Suggestions for further research are given...|$|R

This was an attempt by the White House to increase motivation for children to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.

The player and the Blades travel to Alduin's Wall, a prophetic engravement, to learn that ancient Nords used a special shout against Alduin so they could engage him. To gain more information, the player meets the ancient dragon Paarthurnax, the leader of the Greybeards. Paarthurnax reveals that Alduin was cast into the {{currents}} of time by the use of an Elder Scroll in the hope that he would never reemerge. The player locates the Elder Scroll and uses it <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> through a window in time and learn the shout to combat Alduin.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} child and early adolescent relationships {{with parents and}} peers within the theoretical framework of attachment. A cross-sectional sample of 279 fourth, sixth, and eighth graders completed two self-report measures assessing attachment to parents and friends. Fourth graders described more trusting and communicative relationships with parents than sixth or eighth graders. Older early adolescents turned <b>to</b> <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> fulfill attachment functions of proximity seeking and safe haven more often than children, although all participants reported that parents primarily served secure base functions. Females reported more trust, communication, and overall attachment <b>to</b> <b>peers</b> than males. Grade, sex, and views of attachment relationships <b>to</b> parents and <b>peers</b> predicted the introduction of friends into the attachment hierarchy. Participants who viewed relationships with parents as less secure were more likely <b>to</b> select <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> fulfill attachment functions.
