40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of changes in various environmental parameters on the underwater foraging behaviour of the American mink, Mustela vison. The study was conducted in an indoor pool. The effects of changes in the following parameters were investigated: (i) Water Depth. This was altered from 0. 3 m to 1. 65 m. (ii) Current Flow. Presence of either a deep or a surface current was compared to no current flowing. (iii) Prey Density. Four prey densities were used, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %. (iv) Habitat Complexity. Hides were arranged in a regular, random or clumped pattern. The effects of habitat complexity were investigated in conjunction with prey density. Results are presented for gross changes in foraging behaviour, i. e. dive rate (number of dives per min), successful dive rate, hide visit dive rate, proportion of dives visiting a hide, proportion of successful dives and proportion of successful hide visits, and for finer changes within each dive, i. e. dive duration, <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>bottom,</b> number of hides visited per dive, mean time in hide, proportion of <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> spent hide searching, distance travelled underwater, proportion of direct to indirect dives, mean number of turns per dive, directionality of dives and revisiting of hides. The results showed that as depth increased, animals made fewer dives, but the dives were of longer duration. The extra <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> appeared to be used for locating hideswhich could no longer be located aerially before diving. Deep current was found to be not strong enough to seriously affect foraging behaviour. However, the surface disruption caused by the surface current, led to an increased dive rate, possibly in an attempt to locate hides that could no longer be located aerially, although other parameters such as proportion of dives visiting hides, dive duration etc., were generally unaffected by current flow. The conclusion was that mink were well able to continue foraging with current speeds of up to 0. 86 m s(^- 1). It was found that as prey density increased, animals, generally, made fewer dives of shorter duration, more of which were successful, although there was considerable individual variation. For habitat complexity, animals, generally, behaved similarly if hides were arranged randomly or in clumps, but when hides were regularly distributed, fewer hide visit dives were performed. However, mean <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> tended to be longer, resulting in little difference in foraging efficiency between the three conditions. A brief review of individual strategies revealed that there were considerable individual differences in foraging strategy. These were not related to sex, thus, some individuals consistently used a strategy of many short duration dives, generally visiting only one hide per dive. Others opted for fewer, longer duration, dives, generally involving more than one hide visit. Further, mean dive duration was not related to body weight. An investigation into the maximum underwater swimming speed achieved by mink showed that animals could reach speeds of over 1 m s(^- 1). However, comparison with swimming speeds of fish species preyed on by mink, revealed that the fish swam faster. A review of the habits of the fish eaten, however, revealed that most were sedentary, bottom dwellers. The implications from this are that commercially important fish, e. g. salmon and trout, may well be taken mainly as diseased or spent individuals. The overall conclusion reached was that mink are highly versatile mustelids, and have 'specialised' in the ability to utilize both terrestrial and aquatic habitats...|$|E

40|$|We {{annually}} {{monitored the}} abundance and size structure of herbivorous sea urchin populations (Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula) {{inside and outside}} a marine reserve in the Northwestern Mediterranean on two distinct habitats (boulders and vertical walls) {{over a period of}} 20 years, with the aim of analyzing changes at different temporal scales in relation to biotic and abiotic drivers. P. lividus exhibited significant variability in density over <b>time</b> <b>on</b> boulder <b>bottoms</b> but not <b>on</b> vertical walls, and temporal trends were not significantly different between the protection levels. Differences in densities were caused primarily by variance in recruitment, which was less pronounced inside the MPA and was correlated with adult density, indicating density-dependent recruitment under high predation pressure, as well as some positive feedback mechanisms that may facilitate higher urchin abundances despite higher predator abundance. Populations within the reserve were less variable in abundance and did not exhibit the hyper-abundances observed outside the reserve, suggesting that predation effects maybe more subtle than simply lowering the numbers of urchins in reserves. A. lixula densities were an order of magnitude lower than P. lividus densities and varied within sites and over <b>time</b> <b>on</b> boulder <b>bottoms</b> but did not differ between protection levels. In December 2008, an exceptionally violent storm reduced sea urchin densities drastically (by 50 % to 80 %) on boulder substrates, resulting in the lowest values observed over the entire study period, which remained at that level {{for at least two years}} (up to the present).

50|$|G. gangeticus {{is known}} to inhabit only freshwater, inshore marine, and estuarine systems in the lower reaches of the Ganges-Hooghly River system. The feeding habits are mostly unknown. The shark’s small eyes and slender teeth {{suggest that it is}} {{primarily}} a fish-eater and is adapted to turbid water. With such limited visibility typical of many tropical rivers and estuaries, other senses − such as hearing, smell and electroreception − are likely used for predation. Because its eyes are tilted towards its back rather than to the sides or bottom (as is the case in most carcharhinids), it is thought that the shark may swim along the bottom and scan the water above it for potential prey back-lit by the sun. However, in the Bay of Bengal, G. gangeticus was found to feed heavily on dasyatid stingrays, which spend much of their <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the <b>bottom.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{transient}} {{natural convection}} flow with thermal stratification in a rectangular cavity {{filled with fluid}} saturated porous medium obeying Darcy's law has been studied. Prior to the time t* = 0, the flow in the cavity {{is assumed to be}} motionless and all four walls of the cavity are at the same constant temperature. At time t* = 0, the temperatures of the vertical walls are suddenly increased which vary linearly with the distance y and at the same <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the <b>bottom</b> wall an isothermal heat source is placed centrally. This sudden change in the wall temperatures gives rise to unsteadiness in the problem. The horizontal temperature difference induces and sustains a buoyancy driven flow in the cavity which is then controlled by the vertical temperature difference. The partial differential equations governing the transient natural convection flow have been solved numerically. The local and average Nusselt numbers decrease rapidly in a small time interval after the start of the impulsive change in the wall temperatures and the steady state is reached quickly. The time required to reach the steady state depends on the Rayleigh number and the thermal stratification parameter...|$|R
50|$|The usual {{method of}} hunting is {{to walk in}} shallow water looking for prey. Prey is located {{differently}} depending on circumstances; if the water is clear it may hunt by sight, but if the water is very muddy it will probe their open bill into water or mud and shut it. It may shuffle one foot at a <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the <b>bottom</b> or suddenly open its wings to flush prey out of hiding. Prey caught in mud will be shaken before swallowing to clean it or, if available, taken to clearer water to do so. The species will also feed while in flight. A bird will fly slowly low over the water with legs dangling and head looking down, then dipping feet down and hovering momentarily when prey is sighted. The prey is then snatched with the bill and swallowed in flight. This method of hunting can be very successful, with one birds catching prey on 27 of 33 attempts during one 45 minute session. It is also opportunistic, and will feed on swarming termites when they conduct their nuptial flights, snatching as many as 47 alates (flying termites) in five minutes.|$|R

40|$|Patterns {{of habitat}} use by spider crab juveniles, Maja brachydactyla, from two {{geographic}} {{areas on the}} NW coast of the Iberian Peninsula were studied through the analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope relations in muscle and hepatopancreas. Main potential preys of spider crab juveniles in rocky and sandy habitats and different organic matter sources in coastal food webs were also analysed. Isotopic ratios showed no difference between rocky and sandy habitats. The use of carapace colour and epibiosis {{as an indicator of}} habitat use was not supported by our data. These results suggest that movements between the two habitats are much more frequent than suggested in previous studies. In the coastal food web, two main trophic compartments were identified according to their organic matter source: one based on plankton and seaweeds (rocky habitats), and one based on sedimentary particulate organic matter (sandy bottoms). By means of the model of Phillips and Gregg (2003), it was found that juveniles of Maja brachydactyla from both habitats consumed approximately two thirds of the preys in rocky habitats and one third in sedimentary habitats.

40|$|Many {{contaminants}} can {{attach to}} suspended particles. Their transport differs therefore from {{the transport of}} dissolved substances, especially in highly turbid environment like estuaries. In this paper, we show how the Constituent Age and Residence time Theory (CART — www. climate. be/CART) {{can be adapted to}} quantify in a rigorous manner the transport rate of contaminants that are present in both the dissolved and adsorbed phases. On the basis of numerical experiment using a 1 D model of the Scheldt estuary, it is shown that the interaction with suspended particles significantly affects the transport of contaminants with partition coefficients larger than 1000 ml/g. The mean transit time from Ghent to Vlissingen of such contaminants can reach 160 days while it is only 60 days for water and dissolved constituents. This increase of the transit time is mainly {{due to the fact that}} adsorbed constituents spend long periods of <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the <b>bottom.</b> Surprisingly, the downstream transport of adsorbed constituents in the water column appears more effective than that of dissolved constituents. This transport affects however a small fraction of the adsorbed constituent and is therefore not sufficient to compensate for the long resting phase <b>on</b> the <b>bottom</b> of the bulk of the constituent. The concept and methodology introduced in this paper are easily applicable to most model studies and provide powerful and flexible tools for the detailed understanding of the transport of contaminants in estuaries. In particular, the concept of age and modified ages taking into account specifically the time spent in the water column or in the bottom provide new diagnostic tools to understand and quantify the dynamics of contaminants.
