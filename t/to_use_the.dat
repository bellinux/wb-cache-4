40|$|This {{study focused}} on student 2 ̆ 7 s {{attitude}} <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> Internet at school. A questionnaire (the School Internet Attitude questionnaire) measuring student attitude <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> Internet at school incorporating three dimensions (cognitive, behavioural and affective) was administered twice {{to a sample of}} 64 Year 12 students from a Perth Metropolitan Independent school. The questionnaire was administered before and after a six lesson 2 ̆ 7 exposure 2 ̆ 7 (the limited classroom exposure) to the Internet. Pre and post test attitude measures of all students were compared using dependent sample t_ test to determine if there were significant differences in student 2 ̆ 7 s attitude after the limited classroom exposure <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> Internet at school and {{for each of the three}} dimensions of the School Internet Attitude questionnaire. Within the sample, the attitudes of current regular users of the Internet (students who <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Internet at least a few times a week) and current non-regular users of the Internet (students who have never <b>used</b> <b>the</b> Internet or <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Internet less than a few times a week) were compared before and again after the limited classroom exposure. A MANOV A design was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> student 2 ̆ 7 s attitude <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> Internet at school, the dependent variables were the cognitive, behavioural and affective dimensions of the School Internet Attitude questionnaire, with repeated measures on the independent variable, level of current <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> Internet. The study found that the limited classroom exposure caused no significant change in the student 2 ̆ 7 s attitude <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> Internet at school from the pretest to the post test nor was there a significant change in attitude in any of the three dimensions, cognitive, behavioural and affective of the School Internet Attitude questionnaire. However, there was a significant difference in <b>the</b> attitude <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> Internet at school of regular and non-regular Internet users in the pretest with the cognitive and affective dimension showing significant differences and in the post test with the cognitive, behavioural and affective dimensions showing significant differences. Regular Internet users showed a more positive attitude than non-regular Internet users <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> Internet at school in both the pretest and the post test and for all three of the dependent variables the cognitive, behavioural and affective dimensions of the School Internet Attitude questionnaire...|$|R
