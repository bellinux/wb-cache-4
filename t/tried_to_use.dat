5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle {{the pictures on the}} front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E
5|$|Jim Jones, {{the founder}} {{and leader of the}} Peoples Temple, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Branham's fame to boost himself into the limelight. Jones, who was later known for the mass murder and suicide at Jonestown in November 1978, {{organized}} a religious convention that took place June 11 through June 15, 1956, at Cadle Tabernacle in Indianapolis. To draw crowds, Jones needed a religious headliner, so he arranged to share the pulpit with Branham.|$|E

5|$|On January 25, 1776, Congress {{approved}} {{the establishment of}} a monument in memory of Montgomery. A state memorial service was also scheduled and carried out on February 19, 1776. Throughout the colonies, Montgomery was viewed as a hero, and Patriots <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his death to promote their cause in the war. Montgomery's name was used very often in literature; among the authors who used his name was Thomas Paine.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} trials {{following a}} refit, the Gnat {{met up with}} the Ladybird, who also had a ship's dog. However Judy had to be kept away as while he took a fancy to her, she did not care for him. In the early morning after the Ladybird departed, Judy alerted the ship {{to the presence of}} river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure.|$|E
5|$|Allegedly, Vattier {{had tried}} to take title {{to a piece of}} {{property}} in Cincinnati already owned by the Hinde family. Hinde challenged Vattier in court. Henry Clay represented Hinde in the Ohio State Court proceedings. Hinde claimed that Vattier <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the lot to pay Findlay by claiming to have a bill of sale and title that was superior to the Hinde family. After more than fifteen years, the case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1833. The Court ruled that Vattier took title to the property illegally and that the property belonged to Hinde and his children. Originally owned by Hinde's father-in-law, James Bradford, after his death the property passed to Hinde's wife, Belinda (Bradford) Hinde.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War {{the future}} park area {{was used as}} a {{training}} ground for Cuban exiles training for missions in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Elliott Key in particular was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a training area in the early 1960s in preparation for Bay of Pigs invasion. The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge, the only hotel ever built on the key. As late as 1988 a group of Cuban exiles were arrested when they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the key for a mock landing. Farther north, exiled Venezuelan president Marcos Pérez Jiménez kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Four Getaway Special {{payloads}} were carried. One {{studied the}} effects of cosmic rays on electronic equipment. The second studied {{the effect of the}} gas environment around the orbiter using ultraviolet absorption measurements, as a precursor to ultraviolet equipment being designed for Spacelab 2. A third, sponsored by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun newspaper, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> water vapor in two tanks to create snow crystals. This was a second attempt at an experiment first flown on STS-6, which had had to be redesigned after the water in the tanks froze solid. The last was similar to an experiment flown on STS-3, and studied the ambient levels of atomic oxygen by measuring the rates at which small carbon and osmium wafers oxidized.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{believed}} that kings should rule England in a dignified manner, surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual. He thought that his predecessors had allowed {{the status of}} the Crown to decline, and sought to correct this during his reign. The events of the civil war in Henry's youth deeply affected the King, and he adopted Edward the Confessor as his patron saint, hoping to emulate {{the way in which the}} Anglo-Saxon King had brought peace to England and reunited his people in order and harmony. Henry <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his royal authority leniently, hoping to appease the more hostile barons and maintain peace in England.|$|E

5|$|Historian Keith W. Olson {{has written}} that Nixon left a {{negative}} legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious {{than those of the}} incumbent. Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease {{in the power of the}} presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, The Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez. Both men <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{their size and}} power to control the match. Gonzalez used a reverse chinlock to wear The Undertaker down and {{attacked}} him outside the ring. The Undertaker regained control of the match and knocked Gonzalez onto his knees. Harvey Wippleman threw Gonzalez a rag soaked with chloroform, which Gonzalez used to knock The Undertaker unconscious. The referee disqualified Gonzalez for using a foreign object and awarded the match to The Undertaker. After the match, The Undertaker recovered and attacked Giant Gonzalez.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} match, Carlito faced Mankind, who {{was chosen by}} the fans' vote with 52%. The match began when Carlito {{performed}} a dropkick on Mankind. However, Mankind got the advantage over Carlito. Midway through the match, Mankind <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a steel chair on Carlito, but Carlito avoided, executeing drop toe-hold, sending Mankind into the steel steps. Mankind rose to his feet, which led Carlito to perform a standing dropkick, resulting in Mankind to hit {{the back of his}} head into the steel steps. Back in the ring, Mankind received the upper hand after delivering a DDT and forced Carlito to submit with the Mandible claw and win the match.|$|E

Jarrett <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this to his advantage by using the Figure Four leglock, but The Kid blocked the hold by using a small package to pin Jarrett for the victory. Upset at being eliminated from the tournament, Jarrett responded by performing three piledrivers on The Kid after the match.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Jarrett {{defended the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Monty Brown {{in the main}} event. Near the closing minutes, Brown grabbed a guitar, which Jarrett had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> earlier, and bashed Jarrett {{over the head with}} it. Jarrett {{retained}} the championship in the bout after performed a maneuver he named the Stroke three times by grabbing Brown's head, and tucking his leg between Brown's two. He follows by extending Brown's near arm and tripping him to force his face into the mat. Jarrett then pinned Brown to end the match.|$|E

5|$|One {{check on}} a magistrate's power was his collegiality. Each magisterial office {{would be held}} {{concurrently}} by at least two people. Another such check was provocatio. Provocatio was a primordial form of due process. It was a precursor to habeas corpus. If any magistrate <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{the powers of the}} state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to wait ten years before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their imperium extended. In effect, they would retain the powers of the office (as a promagistrate), without officially holding that office.|$|E

After a two-year prison sentence, he was deported to West Germany where he was tried for a wartime murder in 1979; he was given a suspended sentence for manslaughter.|$|E
