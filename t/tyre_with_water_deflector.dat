50|$|In response, the Rhodesians co-operated {{with the}} South Africans {{to develop a}} range of mine {{protected}} vehicles. They began by replacing air in <b>tyres</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> which absorbed some of the blast and reduced {{the heat of the}} explosion. Initially, they protected the bodies with steel deflector plates, sandbags and mine conveyor belting. Later, purpose built vehicles with V shaped blast hulls dispersed the blast and deaths in such vehicles became unusual events.|$|R
50|$|Ushu (in the Amarna Letters Usu) was {{an ancient}} {{mainland}} city that supplied <b>Tyre,</b> Lebanon, <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> supplies and burial grounds.

50|$|The outer bogies had two-pin swing {{links and}} {{laminated}} side control springs which provided {{for a total}} side-play of 7 in. The outer pairs of bogie wheels were arranged <b>with</b> <b>tyre</b> flange <b>watering</b> gear. The inner bissel trucks were of the radial-arm type with helical spring side control and a total side-play of 4 in. The bogies and bissels both had Timken roller bearing axle boxes. The front engine unit had two 21 in diameter vacuum brake cylinders, while the hind engine units were provided with steam and hand brakes.|$|R

5000|$|Using a {{technique}} {{which has never}} been duplicated, the streambed of the Eiskanal canoe slalom channel was made of sculpted concrete, with simulated boulders being {{an integral part of}} the uneven channel floor. This feature is easily seen in photographs of the channel without water. The shapes were planned using water flowing through a 25-meter-long scale model made of sheet metal. [...] Most of the simulated boulders are attached to the channel walls, but two stand alone in the middle of the channel. Five barn-door <b>water</b> <b>deflectors,</b> hinged to the channel sides, can be swung in or out to change the water flow at those locations.|$|R

5000|$|T-80 (1976): Initial model, with 1,000-hp {{gas turbine}} engine, {{coincidence}} rangefinder, and no missile capability. This model {{does not have}} fittings for explosive reactive armor. The turret is from the T-64A, and thus retains {{the use of the}} old coincidence rangefinder. Characteristics of this type are the V shaped <b>water</b> <b>deflector</b> on the front glacis, coincidence rangefinder in front of the commander's cupola, and Luna searchlight mounted in the same position as a T-64. Around 250 were produced, as the tank's armour was essentially obsolete when introduced. Turret vs APFSDS - 380 mm, Hull vs APFSDS - 500 mm (without reactive armor). Was in effect a pre-production model. Reportedly was fitted with an early version of the Shtora APS.|$|R

5000|$|In 1974, Pirelli {{invented the}} [...] "wide radial tyre", upon {{a request from}} the Lancia rally racing team for a tyre strong enough to {{withstand}} {{the power of the}} new Lancia Stratos. At that time, racing tyres were either slick <b>tyres</b> made <b>with</b> the cross ply technique (very wide <b>tyres</b> <b>with</b> a reduced sidewall height), or radial tyres, which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip. Both were unusable for the Lancia Stratos, as the radials were destroyed within 10 km, and the slicks too stiff. Lancia asked Pirelli for a solution, and in 1975 Pirelli created a wide <b>tyre</b> <b>with</b> a reduced sidewall height like a slick, but with a radial structure.|$|R
