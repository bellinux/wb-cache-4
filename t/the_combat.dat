5|$|Australian Submarine Corporation {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the delivery of the Rockwell combat system, but had little ability to enforce this. Rockwell was contracted to deliver <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> system by 9 September 1993, but was unlikely to do so. ASC's management board voted to issue a default notice to Rockwell as the American company had defaulted on the contract, but was ordered by the Department of Defence to retract the default notice and accept gradual delivery of partially completed versions of <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> system—referred to as 'releases' and 'drops'—until the complete system had been delivered. Sea trials of Collins were unable to commence until Release 1.5 of <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> system software was delivered; because of ongoing delays {{in the provision of}} the software, the early phases of the trials were completed using stand-alone equipment By March 1994, <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> system had become the major area of concern for the submarine project: assembly of the system was almost nine months behind schedule, and at least 20% of the software had not been compiled. <b>The</b> <b>combat</b> system continued to be a problem during the next few years, with progressive drops offering little improvements in performance over the previous version, and the completion date of Release 2—the designation for the full contractual realisation of <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> system software—was continually postponed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>combat</b> was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic. GameSpot compared <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, saying that it isn't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> remain spontaneous. GameZone said that <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> is not changed from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, but {{that this is a}} good thing since <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of <b>The</b> <b>Combat,</b> Etty {{continued}} with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and <b>The</b> <b>Combat)</b> all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, {{at that time the}} most prestigious honour available to an artist. <b>The</b> <b>Combat</b> was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.|$|E

5|$|Hudson {{explained}} {{that they wanted to}} evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of Knights of the Old Republic into a real-time third-person shooter interface. <b>The</b> <b>combat</b> was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface. It was also designed so that players would not need to press many buttons to pull off the squad's different attack combinations. The team worked closely with Microsoft on several elements of the interface to make sure <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> was tactical enough, and went through a lot of trial and error to balance <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> between role-playing game and shooter. Creating a great sense of discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations. Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, the tools and technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.|$|E

5|$|The {{two months}} {{following}} the verdict were ones of great activity {{between the two parties}} and the citizens of Paris.

Indeed, the event was so popular that when King Charles VI believed that his return to Paris in time for <b>the</b> <b>combat</b> would be held up in Flanders due to bad roads, he sent a fast messenger to Paris delaying the duel by a month in order that he would be present to witness it.
