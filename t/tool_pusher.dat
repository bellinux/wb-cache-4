50|$|Blankets, mats, and robes were woven on looms {{which were}} {{made up of}} two upright bars and were {{attached}} to two horizontal rollers. Some loom poles were also carved with figures illustrating supernatural characters or family history. Specially designed combs were used {{during the process of}} preparing the wool, and another <b>tool</b> <b>pushed</b> the weft during weaving.

Tubb of Crane County {{to establish the}} Trebol Oil Company. He worked eighteen-hour days as Trebol's <b>tool</b> <b>pusher,</b> pumper, and production supervisor. The company drilled fifty-two producing wells before it struck the first dry hole. Noël was so occupied in the pursuits of the business that {{he claimed to have}} been unaware that he had become a millionaire until several years after the accumulation of his early fortune.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mud logging}} company is {{normally}} contracted {{by the oil}} company (or operator). They then organize this information {{in the form of}} a graphic log, showing the data charted on a representation of the wellbore.1The oil company representative (Company Man or [...] "CoMan") together with the <b>tool</b> <b>pusher,</b> and well-site geologist (WSG) provides mud loggers their instruction. The mud logging company is contracted specifically as to when to start well-logging activity and what services to provide. Mud logging may begin on the first day of drilling, known as the [...] "spud in" [...] date but is more likely at some later time (and depth) determined by the oil industry geologist's research. The mud logger may also possess logs from wells drilled in the surrounding area. This information (known as [...] "offset data") can provide valuable clues as to the characteristics of the particular geo-strata that the rig crew is about to drill through.|$|E

The choice of diversified textual typologies, that have been defined “without adjectives”, and of encoding tools and methodologies are the key points: the adoption of the Text Encoding Initiative standards and the recourse to automatic segmenters and lemmatizers for computer aided annotation are the first steps towards the realization of this ambitious project. ...|$|R
40|$|Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Aim: To {{examine the}} {{internal}} and external responsiveness of the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (<b>PUSH)</b> <b>tool</b> for assessing the healing progress in acute and chronic wounds. Background: It is important to establish the responsiveness of instruments used in conducting wound care assessments to ensure that they are able to capture changes in wound healing accurately over time. Design: Prospective longitudinal observational study. Method: The key study instrument was the <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool.</b> Internal responsiveness was assessed using paired t-testing and effect size statistics. External responsiveness was assessed using multiple linear regression. All new patients with at least one eligible acute or chronic wound, enrolled in the Nurse and Allied Health Clinic-Wound Care programme between 1 December 2012 - 31 March 2013 were included for analysis (N = 541). Results: Overall, the <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool</b> was able to detect statistically significant changes in wound healing between baseline and discharge. The effect size statistics were large. The internal responsiveness of the <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool</b> was confirmed in patients with a variety of different wound types including venous ulcers, pressure ulcers, neuropathic ulcers, burns and scalds, skin tears, surgical wounds and traumatic wounds. After controlling for age, gender and wound type, subjects in the 'wound improved but not healed' group had a smaller change in PUSH scores than those in the 'wound healed' group. Subjects in the 'wound static or worsened' group had the smallest change in PUSH scores. The external responsiveness was confirmed. Conclusion: The internal and external responsiveness of the <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool</b> confirmed that {{it can be used to}} track the healing progress of both acute and chronic wounds.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} awareness {{that there is}} a need to protect genetic resources and traditional forest related knowledge (TFRK) to enable sustainable management of natural resources, forest-dependent communities and development of value-added natural products. A number of international instruments are being implemented to ensure that genetic resources and TFRK are protected. Other than these international instruments agreed by the nation parties, the market-driven forest certification has emerged as a glaring <b>tool</b> <b>pushing</b> the resource producing countries to manage their forest resources sustainably and thus also contribute to the protection and development of the TFRK. In forest certification, the key concept is sustainable forest management, which encompasses environmental sustainability (an ecosystem able to support its organisms, able to perpetuate itself, without loss in productivity), social sustainability (the activity should be socially acceptable and tolerable) and economic sustainability the benefits to the society should exceed the costs incurred, without loss to future generations). This paper examines Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) ’s principles and criteria and how they can contribute to the protection of genetic resources and TFRK. ...|$|R

The spoon {{acts as the}} main tool and the fork is the {{supporting}} <b>tool</b> <b>pushing</b> the food onto the spoon and the shared spoon is the main tool to scoop the food from shared dish to rice dish. Some people use their own spoon to scoop the food from the shared dish directly {{but it is not}} a good dining manner for Thais because they concern about sanitation issue. If the shared dish is curry, it is transferred to an individual little cup first. Then they sip the soup from the spoon. Sipping it from the cup directly is not proper, Moreover, making noise during eating and sipping is impolite in Thailand. On the other hand, talking during eating is not prohibited. However, Thai food menus is include a lot of fish and spices of which some parts are not for eating—splitting the food is the general behavior for Thais. Splitting on the spoon, and put them on the edge of the dish or provided dish for the trash is Thai general practice.|$|R

40|$|Low {{back pain}} has a {{relatively}} high prevalence during school years. If the causes and risk factors of back pain could be removed at an early stage, the opportunity for remedial action would be improved. Several authors have been reported {{a positive relationship between}} back pain and incorrect sitting and standing postures. There was also strong evidence for low back pain being associated with poor "lifting- pushing" habits. We recorded postural behavior and lifting, pushing and pulling habits in this study. Subjects were 438 teenagers (both sexes) that their mean age was 14. 55 years (Â± 3. 3). 41. 03 % of pupils selected correct answer in lifting of equipment. About half of them know correct method of <b>tools</b> <b>pushing</b> and only 34 % was informed about pulling methods. Sixty five percent of pupils have poor habit in standing. Approximately 63 % of students have bad sitting posture in time of study. The results indicate lake of student knowledge about correct body position. Majority of teenagers had poor sitting posture while reading and writing. About 62 % of students had incorrect situation (kyphosis) while standing. Furhtermore practice of pupils in lifting, pushing and pulling isn`t satisfactory.

40|$|Biomedical {{text mining}} {{promises}} to assist biologists in quickly navigating the combined knowledge in their domain. This would allow improved {{understanding of the}} complex interactions within biological systems and faster hypothesis generation. New biomedical research articles are published daily and text mining tools are {{only as good as}} the corpus from which they work. Many text mining tools are underused because their results are static and do not reflect the constantly expanding knowledge in the field. In order for biomedical text mining to become an indispensable tool used by researchers, this problem must be addressed. To this end, we present PubRunner, a framework for regularly running text mining tools on the latest publications. PubRunner is lightweight, simple to use, and can be integrated with an existing text mining tool. The workflow involves downloading the latest abstracts from PubMed, executing a user-defined <b>tool,</b> <b>pushing</b> the resulting data to a public FTP or Zenodo dataset, and publicizing the location of these results on the public PubRunner website. We illustrate the use of this tool by re-running the commonly used word 2 vec tool on the latest PubMed abstracts to generate up-to-date word vector representations for the biomedical domain. This shows a proof of concept that we hope will encourage text mining developers to build tools that truly will aid biologists in exploring the latest publications...|$|R
50|$|What {{remains is}} a {{difference}} in operating costs: for wells with an inclination of less than 40 degrees, tools to carry out adjustments or repair work can be lowered by gravity on cable into the hole.

A technique developed by experienced workers is a two-man team to overcome this obstacle of gravity: one operates the hammer and the second assists by holding the hammer either on his shoulders or cradled in his arms. Both use their combined weight to push the bit into the workface. This method is commonly referred to as horizontal jackhammering.|$|R

Prior theories proposed that children’s rapid acquisition of words is based on language-specific knowledge and constraints.

We argue that new theoretical insights, coupled with methodological <b>tools,</b> have <b>pushed</b> the field toward an appreciation of simple, content-free processes working together as a system to support the acquisition of words. We illustrate this by considering three central phenomena of early language development: referential ambiguity, fast-mapping, and the vocabulary spurt...|$|R
