50|$|A dustcap {{is a small}} cover used on {{the valve}} stem of a bicycle or car tire to prevent dust or other small {{particles}} from entering the valve and damaging it. The dustcap also forms a pressure seal, helping to prevent deflation of the tire due to slight gas seepage past the <b>tire</b> <b>valve.</b> Dustcaps are usually made from plastic but may occasionally be made of metal. The dustcap is internally threaded and is secured by screwing it onto {{the end of the}} stem. To prevent corrosion due to electrolysis and malfunction of the electronics in a direct TPMS and avoid costly repairs, metal valve caps without insulating plastic linings should not be used on direct-TPMS-equipped <b>tire</b> <b>valve</b> stems.|$|E
50|$|The Tire and Rim Association (T&RA) is a {{voluntary}} U.S. standards organization {{to promote the}} interchangeability of tires and rim and allied parts.

50|$|The {{repair of}} inner tubes may be {{necessary}} on the road. Several methods exist to locate a small puncture, including submersion in water with dish soap, but without a bowl of water available, the simplest method may be to inflate the tube until air can be felt escaping from the puncture. Once located, the puncture is cleaned, and a patch applied (see Louis Rustin for {{the invention of the}} puncture patch). Note that <b>tire</b> <b>valves</b> may also become damaged. In this case, repair of the inner tube will not be possible, and the tube should be replaced.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} a number of ted tire {{sealants}} which act {{in a similar way}} to self-sealing tires. These compounds are normally injected through the <b>tire</b> <b>valve.</b> The rotating force then distributes the compound onto the inner surface of the tire to act as a self-sealing lining within the tire.|$|E

50|$|The Schrader valve (also called American valve) {{is a type}} of {{pneumatic}} <b>tire</b> <b>valve</b> used {{on virtually}} every motor vehicle in the world today. The Schrader company, for which it was named, was founded in 1844 by August Schrader. The original Schrader valve design was patented in the United States in 1893.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>tire</b> <b>valves</b> to which the bicycle tire pump attaches. These are the Presta valve and the Schrader valve. Some pumps fit both types of valves, whereas others do not, but {{adapters}} are available that enable the pump to fit any type of valve. [...] "All valves adjustable connecting systems," [...] also known as AVACS, enable the pump to fit any type of valve found on a bicycle, and {{it also has the}} capacity to fit onto other universal inflatable products, such as balls, paddling pools, and rubber rings. The AVACS feature is commonly available on pump models and can also be bought as a separate valve attachment.|$|R
5000|$|The Schrader valve {{consists}} of a valve stem into which a valve core is threaded, and is used on virtually all automobile tires and motorcycle tires and most wider rimmed bicycle <b>tires.</b> The <b>valve</b> core is a poppet valve assisted by a spring.|$|R

50|$|Schrader valves {{consist of}} a valve stem into which a poppet valve is {{threaded}} with a spring attached. They are used on virtually all automobile and motorbike tires, and on wider rimmed bicycle tires. In addition to <b>tires,</b> Schrader <b>valves</b> of varying diameters are used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, plumbing, engine fuel injection, suspension systems, and SCUBA regulators, allowing the user to remove and attach a hose while in use.The Schrader valves in the fuel injector rail of many automobiles {{is used as a}} quick and easy point to check fuel pressure or connect an injector cleaner cartridge.|$|R

50|$|The bicycle pump {{compresses}} air. When {{the cylinder}} is compressed, air is pushed down the tube of the pump {{and then into}} the tire via the valve, which is forced open by the pressure of the air. When the handle is pulled up again, the valve shuts off automatically so that the air cannot escape from the tire, and new air is forced back into the cylinder so the process can be repeated. Some pumps have a gauge that shows the pressure of air that is forced into the tire. Once the tire is at the correct pressure, the pump valve can be removed from the tire, and the cap can be replaced on the <b>tire</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{much more}} active {{approach}} to monitoring tire pressures involves retrofitting a tire pressure monitor to your vehicle. Vehicles manufactured after model year 2007 {{are required to}} have tire pressure monitoring systems built-in, although many older vehicles might not have it. Tire rack, for example, offers aftermarket tire pressure monitors from various companies, including one that notifies {{the driver of the}} tire pressure in each wheel, as well as exactly which tire the system is displaying the pressure of. A much less expensive way to monitor tire pressures is to install valve stem caps that alert the driver to low tire pressure. These work by first setting the pressure on the cap matching the pressure you desire your tires to be at. Once installed on the <b>tire's</b> <b>valve</b> stem, the tip of these caps will change color (from green, to yellow, to red) when the tire becomes under-inflated. The benefit of this system is its low initial cost, but its disadvantages include questionable accuracy (even more so if the caps aren't tightened down enough) and {{that the only way to}} monitor them is from outside of the vehicle, looking directly at the cap. It's always a good idea to have a quality, reliable tire gauge on hand regardless of what system is installed in your vehicle, and to either check tire pressures yourself of by having someone else do it, as most tire pressure monitor systems will not alert the driver until the tire pressure falls below a certain amount, usually 20% below the recommended pressure.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to tube and tubeless <b>tires,</b> Schrader <b>valves</b> of varying diameters are used on many refrigeration {{and air conditioning}} systems to allow servicing, including recharging with refrigerant; by plumbers conducting leak-down pressure tests on pipe installations; as a bleeding and test port on the fuel rail of some fuel injected engines; on bicycle air shock absorbers to allow adjustment of air pressure according to the rider's weight; and in the buoyancy compensator (BC) inflators of SCUBA systems where the ability to easily disconnect an air hose (even underwater) without the loss of tank air is critical. Schrader valves are also widely used in high-pressure hydraulic systems on aircraft.Many domestic fire extinguishers use an internal valve identical to a Schrader valve, but with a lever on top to enable quick release of the pressurized content.|$|R
40|$|Skidding causes many traffic accidents. Streets and {{highways}} with skid-resisting surfaces {{reduce the incidence}} of such accidents. In fact, resurfacing roads to improve skid resistance is now required by federal law. Skid resistance is measured by road testing with specially equipped skid trailers. A project underway at NASA-Langley may considerably reduce the cost of skid trailers, thus making them more widely available to highway departments. For testing the skid resistance of aircraft runways, Langley engineers developed a relatively inexpensive test vehicle and a "pulsed braking" technique that is now being applied experimentally to road testing. The vehicle is a standard automobile modified to incorporate instrumentation, special test <b>tires</b> and <b>valves,</b> and a trailing fifth wheel for monitoring distance and velocity.

40|$|In December 2007, a male {{equipment}} operator was fatally {{injured by}} a metal lock ring propelled from a multi-piece wheel tire assembly he was inflating. The victim was employed by an excavating and snow removal company. At {{the time of}} the incident, he and a co-worker were getting their loaders ready to remove snow from a shopping mall parking lot. Soon after he started his loader, the victim noticed that his left front tire mounted on a multi-piece wheel was “soft”(under-inflated). The multi-piece rim wheel referring to the tire assembly consisted of six components: the rim base, valve assembly, tire, side ring, O-ring and lock ring. The function of the lock ring was to hold the tire in place by locking and securing the other wheel components when the tire was inflated. The victim asked the co-worker, whose loader had an air compressor, to put air in the tire. The initial tire pressure was not checked. The co-worker connected one end of an air hose to the quick-connect fitting on the air compressor and the clip-on chuck at the other end to the valve stem of the tire. The co-worker then went to his loader’s cab and used the throttle control to maintain the airflow. The air hose did not have an in-line pressure gauge. The victim checked the air pressure at the <b>tire</b> <b>valve</b> with a hand-held pressure gauge periodically as the tire was being inflated. The maximum cold tire inflation pressure specified by the tire manufacturer was 35 pounds per square inch (psi). After a few minutes, the victi...|$|E

25|$|A Schrader valve {{consists}} of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes {{a variety of forms}} depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush {{with the end of the}} valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic <b>tires.</b> Also, pressure <b>valves</b> can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant August Schrader, invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.|$|R
40|$|This NebGuide {{outlines}} good milking {{procedures to}} follow to assure {{high quality milk}} production while minimizing mastitis and other health problems. Milking, or harvesting the milk crop, is a critical step between planting crops, building facilities, and paying bills on a dairy farm. While highly productive cows and a properly functioning milking system are essential, how the cows are handled and the milking system is used are equally important. Proper milking procedures are necessary to assure a bountiful harvest of high quality milk. The nature of milk-secreting tissue and the anatomy of the udder make harvesting the milk crop impossible without the cow 2 ̆ 7 s cooperation. Stimulating the cow so she releases the 2 ̆ 2 let-down 2 ̆ 2 hormone oxytocin is critical. The effects of oxytocin last about 5 to 7 minutes. Milking should be done within this {{amount of time to}} be most effective. Remember [...] a milking system does not pull or squeeze milk out of the udder. Rather, it simply sets up the conditions (low pressure or vacuum) to allow a difference in pressure between the udder and milking system to force milk out through the teat orifice. In this respect, milking is much like letting air escape from a <b>tire</b> through the <b>valve</b> stem [...] if there is no difference in pressure between the inside and outside, there is no flow of air (or milk). There are many details that can be included under the general heading of milking procedures. This NebGuide addresses some of the more routine ones...|$|R
