5|$|<b>The</b> <b>collar</b> is worn on {{designated}} collar days over {{military uniform}} or morning dress by members attending formal events. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> is {{fastened to the}} shoulders with silk ribbons (or gold safety pins when worn with morning dress). Since <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> signifies the Order of the Garter, members can then wear the riband of any other order to which they belong. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> is only worn at specific occasions that warrant it.|$|E
5|$|Knights and Ladies may {{encircle}} {{their arms}} with the circlet (a green circle bearing the Order's motto) and <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> of the Order; {{the former is}} shown either outside or {{on top of the}} latter. The badge is depicted suspended from <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b> The Royal Arms depict <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> and motto of the Order of the Thistle only in Scotland; they show the circlet and motto of the Garter in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Blue Service Uniform (Class B)– {{identical}} to the service dress uniform, except without the dark blue jacket. The tie is optional when in short sleeves. Cadet enlisted and NCOs wear metal grade insignia on <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{wearing of}} buttonholes on <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> of <b>the</b> woolen and cotton cottons of {{military}} service and cadets was canceled, while the golden emblems (on cotton tunics - protective) were fastened {{in the corners of}} <b>the</b> <b>collars.</b>|$|R
40|$|A pair of spaced collars {{are mounted}} {{at right angles}} on a clamp body by {{retaining}} rings which enable <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> to rotate {{with respect to the}} clamp body. Mounting posts extend through aligned holes in <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> and clamp body. Each collar can be clamped onto the inserted post while the clamp body remains free to rotate about <b>the</b> post and <b>collar.</b> <b>The</b> clamp body is selectively clamped onto each post...|$|R
5000|$|A {{band collar}} is a {{standing}} band-shaped <b>collar</b> that encircles <b>the</b> neck without a full turndown or a collar [...] "cape". It {{can be any}} height or [...] "stand", but is usually under 2" [...] at the front, {{so as not to}} push up into the chin. Variations of <b>the</b> band <b>collar</b> are <b>the</b> clerical <b>collar,</b> <b>the</b> mandarin <b>collar</b> and <b>the</b> cadet <b>collar.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Great George, {{which is}} worn {{suspended}} from <b>the</b> <b>collar,</b> is a colourfully enamelled (sometimes jewelled) three-dimensional figure of St. George the Martyr on horseback slaying a dragon.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>collar</b> {{is made of}} {{gold and}} depicts thistles and sprigs of rue. It is worn over the mantle.|$|E
5|$|However, {{on certain}} collar days {{designated}} by the Sovereign, members attending formal events may wear the Order's collar over their military uniform, formal wear, or other costume. They will then substitute the broad riband of another order to which they belong (if any), since the Order of the Thistle is represented by <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b>|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>collars</b> and leashes {{were kept}} clean and odorless.|$|R
500|$|To {{make sure}} the {{students}} obey the rules and kill each other, <b>the</b> metal <b>collars</b> around their necks track their positions, and will explode if they linger in a [...] "Forbidden Zone", randomly selected areas of the island that increase as the Program goes on to force Students closer to each other, or attempt to remove <b>the</b> <b>collars.</b> <b>The</b> Forbidden Zones are randomly chosen areas of the map that increase in number as time goes on, re-sculpting and shrinking the battlefield and forcing the students to move around. <b>The</b> <b>collars</b> secretly transmit sound back to {{the organizers of the}} game, allowing them to hear the students' conversations, root out escape plans, and log their activities. <b>The</b> <b>collars</b> will explode if the students go a full day without anyone dying.|$|R
50|$|The Guides wore scarlet facings on <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> and cuffs {{of their}} khaki uniforms from their {{establishment}} in 1846. Accordingly both The 10th Guides Cavalry (FF) and the 2nd Battalion (The Guides) of the Frontier Force Regiment of the Pakistan Army still wear red piping on <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> of their modern dress uniforms.|$|R
5|$|Members of the Corps {{wore the}} uniform of the Russian Imperial Army from 12 September 1941 to 30 November 1942 {{as well as the}} Czechoslovakian helmet. The uniform was {{sometimes}} worn with pips of the Royal Yugoslav Army, alongside special rank insignia on <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b> Wehrmacht uniforms and insignia were adopted on 1 December 1942, but the old uniforms continued to be worn for some time.|$|E
5|$|The St Andrew, {{also called}} the badge-appendant, is worn {{suspended}} from <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b> It comprises a gold enamelled depiction of St Andrew, wearing a green gown and purple coat, holding a white saltire. Gold rays of a glory are shown emanating from St Andrew's head.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>collar</b> {{was made}} of gold, {{consisting}} of Tudor roses and harps attached with knots. The two roses which comprise the Tudor rose were alternately enamelled white within red, and red within white. The central harp, from which the badge of the Order was suspended, was surmounted by a crown.|$|E
5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} {{improvement of the}} ancient breast harness was <b>the</b> horse <b>collar.</b> <b>The</b> horse <b>collar</b> was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) mural at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature <b>the</b> essential <b>collar</b> cushion behind <b>the</b> cross bar, though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) mural of about 851 accurately displays <b>the</b> cushioned <b>collar</b> behind <b>the</b> cross bar. An earlier painting of the Sui Dynasty (581–618) accurately depicted <b>the</b> horse <b>collar</b> as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>collar,</b> worn only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross, {{is made of}} {{gold and}} weighs 30 troy ounces (933 g). It {{consists}} of depictions of nine imperial crowns and eight sets of flowers (roses for England, thistles for Scotland and shamrocks for Ireland), connected by seventeen silver knots.|$|E
5|$|Burnley did {{not play}} any {{pre-season}} friendly games other than a practice match between the first team and the reserves, which was watched by a crowd of around 10,000 at Turf Moor. The team's last competitive match had ended in a 0–2 defeat against Manchester United in the Lancashire Senior Cup on 8May 1920, almost four months earlier. The strip for 1920–21 was very little changed {{from that of the}} previous season; the claret jersey with light blue sleeves and a light blue stripe around <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> was kept along with the white shorts, but the claret socks were replaced by black.|$|E
5|$|Colonels wore three gold {{stars of}} the same size on their collar; the same as generals, but without the wreath. While {{lieutenant}} colonels wore two stars on their collars, majors wore one star, which was placed in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b> Captains had three gold horizontal bars, first lieutenants wore two bars, and second lieutenants wore one bar. However, the Confederate Congress often created new commissions, and did not always standardize rank insignia immediately.|$|E

5|$|For females, {{short hair}} must be neat {{and may not}} extend past the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>collar,</b> while long hair must be pulled back into a tight bun, and may be {{contained}} by a hairnet. Very long hair may be braided or worn as a bun. Hair elastics, bobby pins and hairnets {{should be the same}} colour as the cadet's hair. When braided the cadets hair may be worn in either double or single French braids and in both cases the braids must fall behind the shoulders and not extend past the bottom of the armpit.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the show}} was set aside {{for a series of}} funny, colorful, puppet {{characters}} living on the titular street. These included Grover, Bert and Ernie, Cookie Monster, Elmo, Oscar the Grouch, and Big Bird. Henson performed the characters of Ernie, game-show host Guy Smiley, and Kermit, who appeared as a roving television news reporter. It was around this time that a frill was added around Kermit's neck to make him more frog-like. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> was functional as well: it covered the joint where the Muppet's neck and body met.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of milled coinage, hammered coinage, which resulted in a relatively crude product of irregular shape and size, predominated in European mints. In , an Augsburg goldsmith named Max Schwab created a new technique for striking coins, which included the use of rolling mills, presses to cut the coinage blanks and the coinage press. After learning about the invention via the French ambassador, King Henry II dispatched the Comptroller of Finance Guillaume de Marillac and François Guilhem, Master of the Mint in Lyon, to observe the machinery. Schwab's press was turned with a weighted wooden handle, which exerted even pressure across the coinage blank, creating a sharper and more precise strike than hammering. De Marillac requested that Anne de Montmorency send him an engineer capable of creating a similar machine; he sent the engineer Aubin Olivier. Olivier viewed the machine, and introduced his own version to France, to which he later added a segmented collar. This allowed for the expanding metal to fill <b>the</b> <b>collar,</b> creating reeding, designs or edge lettering {{at the same time as}} the obverse and reverse images were struck onto the coin. The segments of <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> were then removed, and the coin ejected. Such lettering was used to aid in detecting coins which were debased by clipping metal from their edges, a problem frequently encountered in hammered coinage. Olivier's method of striking coins was considered costly relative to the previously utilised method, as the upper coinage die often came into contact with <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> on its downward descent, causing expensive damage. Milled coinage was thus abandoned in 1585 in favour of hammering.|$|E

5|$|The Roundels Argent {{charged with}} a Cross Gules (white circles with a red cross) allude to the badge of office of Rouge Croix. Planché used his coat of arms on his bookplate, and the crest alone on his writing paper. When he was {{promoted}} to Somerset Herald, Planché surrounded the crest on his writing paper with a collar of Esses. While he was entitled to <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> by his appointment as herald, its inclusion in his armorial bearings was considered somewhat unusual.|$|E
5|$|The {{batteries}} in OR–7's Global Positioning System tracking unit expired in October 2015. Officials decided to replace <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> {{in order to}} keep track of the pack, which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts to trap OR-7 or other members of the pack failed, and further tracking of OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four steers were killed by wolves in Wood River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR–7 was last seen, biologists said efforts to trap and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with the pack in Wood River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements and behaviors of the pack.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> of the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment {{and a better}} seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> usekh broad <b>collar</b> was draped {{around and}} {{supported}} by the neck and shoulders. It is typically adorned with closely placed rows of colored stone beads, or it is made entirely of metal. <b>The</b> <b>collars</b> were connected with clasps of gold.|$|R
50|$|Rank {{insignia}} for lieutenants are gold bars worn on <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> of <b>the</b> {{shirt and}} {{the shoulders of}} the jacket. Rank insignia for sergeants are gold chevrons worn on <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> of <b>the</b> shirt and embroidered chevrons worn on the upper sleeves of shirts and jackets. Tenured officers will have gold hash-marks or stars on the lower left side of their long-sleeved shirts and jackets. Each mark represents five years of service. A star represents twenty years of service.|$|R
50|$|All rank {{insignia}} {{are worn}} on <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> of <b>the</b> shirt, except for sergeant, which is worn on each sleeve, below the department patch.|$|R
