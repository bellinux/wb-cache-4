5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>ones.</b> Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|E
25|$|Hunter's first studio {{album of}} the 1980s was Short Back 'n' Sides (1981), {{produced}} in collaboration with Ronson and Clash guitarist Mick Jones. Ronson's input on Hunter's next album, All of <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Ones</b> Are Taken (1983), was restricted to playing guitar on a single track. The title track became a minor hit in the US, after MTV put the song's video into heavy rotation. In the same year, Ronson travelled to Canada to produce the Payolas' album Hammer on a Drum, to which Hunter contributed backing vocals.|$|E
25|$|John Donne {{was under}} the matronage of Lucy Russell {{during the time that}} Boulstred fell ill and died. As {{previously}} mentioned, he visited her when she was sick and concluded that she was suffering from hysteria. After she died, he wrote two poems in her honor, “Elegy on Mistress Boulstred” and “Elegy Upon the Death of Mistress Boulstred.” The former poem characterizes Death as an “all-consuming glutton who swallows the good” and argues that Boulstred was one of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>ones.</b> The latter poem says that Death is no longer needed because Boulstred was the epitome of virtue, and now that she is dead, it is like the entire world is dead. Donne most likely wrote these elegies in the hopes of getting a reward from his literary matron Lucy Russell.|$|E

500|$|Olds had {{a highly}} publicized career and life, {{including}} marriage to Hollywood actress Ella Raines. As a young man he was also recognized for his athletic prowess in both high school and college, being named an All-American as a lineman in college football. Olds expressed his philosophy regarding fighter pilots in the quote: [...] "There are pilots and there are pilots; with <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>ones,</b> it is inborn. You can't teach it.

In the chorus, Robyn sings [...] "I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before/I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music noted that Robyn sings [...] "tough and knowing" [...] and [...] "pessimistically optimistic" [...] lines, but manages {{to make it sound}} romantic for the listener. Emma Gaedekke of Billboard commented on the lyrical content, saying, [...] "Robyn's heartfelt vocal turn {{prevents}} the backing music from overwhelming her story of a love connection found at the tail-end of heartbreak." ...|$|E

[...] They can also start their songs production with a [...] "Levine beat, a Mars guitar melody or a lyric snippet from Lawrence.

[...] Corrales later clarified in the Wildcard Round that she said such a statement because of the low turnout in the Davao auditions and the even lower Gold Pass output.

500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} were strong. Many critics noted a step-up in quality {{from the first}} season. Newsdays Verne Gay called stated [...] " [...] "Skies" [...] has made the bad guys intriguing, and now if it can only get serious about {{character}} development with <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>ones</b> -- humans -- then the second season {{will be a big}} improvement." [...] Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post compared the episode to the first season by saying [...] "Season 2 is a different animal, a much leaner and meaner machine that allows sentiment to be present but unexpressed and depicts a darker world in which innocence is a luxury that no one can truly afford." [...] Chuck Barney declared [...] "Sunday's explosive two-hour opener boldly delivers on the promise by TNT producers to rev up both the pace and the firepower in Season 2." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic called the episode a [...] "strong start overall to Falling Skies Season 2," [...] and continued by praising the performances of Wyle, Patton and Cunningham. Screen Rant's Anthony Ocasio praised the episode. [...] "While further episodes will reveal more, the type of character development, intriguing storylines and exciting action that will be contained in Falling Skies season 2 , there’s no doubt that TNT’s hit drama will likely become an epic adventure, spanning many seasons," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|The Tarzan {{books and}} movies employ {{extensive}} stereotyping {{to a degree}} common in the times {{in which they were}} written. This has led to criticism in later years, with changing social views and customs, including charges of racism since the early 1970s. The early books give a pervasively negative and stereotypical portrayal of native Africans, including Arabs. In The Return of Tarzan, Arabs are [...] "surly looking" [...] and call Christians [...] "dogs", while blacks are [...] "lithe, ebon warriors, gesticulating and jabbering". One could make an equal argument that when it came to blacks that Burroughs was simply depicting unwholesome characters as unwholesome and <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>ones</b> in a better light as in Chapter 6 of Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar where Burroughs writes of Mugambi, [...] "...nor could a braver or more loyal guardian have been found in any clime or upon any soil." [...] Other groups are stereotyped as well. A Swede has [...] "a long yellow moustache, an unwholesome complexion, and filthy nails", and Russians cheat at cards. The aristocracy (except the House of Greystoke) and royalty are invariably effete. In later books, Africans are portrayed somewhat more realistically as people. For example, in Tarzan's Quest, while the depiction of Africans remains relatively primitive, they are portrayed more individualistically, with a greater variety of character traits (positive and negative), while the main villains are white people. Burroughs never loses his distaste for European royalty, though.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} {{critically}} acclaimed by music critics, although Snow Patrol guitarist Nathan Connolly admitted in November 2008 {{that he still}} had not heard the song: [...] "Nothing against her, but I don't know if I'm going to endorse it either. It is what it is." [...] The following month, Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody described Lewis's version of the song as [...] "phenomenal". He told the Scottish newspaper The Daily Record: [...] Music Radar said that [...] "The two versions couldn't be more different. Snow Patrol's rendering is dark and moody, while Leona Lewis's is big-time pop", and quoted Gary Lightbody as saying [...] "That's what you want a song to do ... Different interpretations and meanings. Songs aren't monolithic, at least <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>ones</b> aren't. What Leona Lewis has done has touched hearts." [...] Newsround highly praised Lewis' cover version, stating that [...] "the full gospel choir and orchestra easily match Leona's powerful pipes – and remind listeners why the song made people cry when she first performed it on Radio 1's Live Lounge last year". [...] "Run" [...] received three stars out of five from Digital Spy, who said that Lewis [...] "wrings every last drop of emotion out of Gary Lightbody's lyrics, channeling her inner Mariah for some almighty warbling at the crescendo". The Sentinel described the single as [...] "so much better" [...] than Snow Patrol's original song. [...] "It's powerful, painful and the choir behind it takes it on to another level." [...] Radio presenter James Daniels concurred, saying [...] "Leona just takes it {{to a whole new}} level, which is a phrase I hate to use – but it's true".|$|E
