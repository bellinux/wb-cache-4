40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{development}} of legal and institutional framework of <b>the</b> public <b>procurement</b> in <b>the</b> Czech Republic from 1993 to 2011 and {{on the basis of}} this analysis to determine their influence on rent seeking in <b>the</b> public <b>procurement.</b> <b>The</b> main problems of <b>the</b> public <b>procurement</b> in <b>the</b> CR are also discussed in this thesis. The process of awarding and execution of <b>the</b> public <b>procurement</b> is very topical. A hundred of billions from public funds are yearly spent through <b>the</b> public <b>procurement</b> in <b>the</b> CR. Currently, the intense debate about the influence and importance of <b>the</b> public <b>procurement</b> act amendment are taking place. The theoretical part covers the general theory of rent seeking. The basic characteristic together with the economical aspects of <b>the</b> public <b>procurement</b> are also explained here. The analytical part is focused on the development of legal framework of <b>the</b> public <b>procurement</b> from 1993 to 2011. The main accent is put on the defining of the space for rent seeking during awarding, execution and follow-up control of <b>the</b> public <b>procurement.</b> <b>The</b> development of institutional framework of <b>the</b> public <b>procurement</b> arrangements in <b>the</b> CR, namely the activities of the Office for the Protection of Competition, the Supreme Audit Office and the Ministry of Regional Development, are defined in this part.

The thesis uses the method of comparison of <b>the</b> different public <b>procurement</b> acts which were implemented during the years 1993 - 2011 including the comparison of the institutional framework in order to detect the positive and negative influence on the rent seeking in <b>the</b> public <b>procurement...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{airframe}} of the Hunter {{consists of}} six interchangeable major sections: the forward fuselage (housing {{the cockpit and}} armament pack), center fuselage (including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes), rear fuselage, tail unit assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult; manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and <b>the</b> <b>procurement</b> of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.|$|E

5|$|Between 1978 and 1980, the DoD and USN {{repeatedly}} {{attempted to}} terminate the AV-8B program. There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary issues. At the time, the USN wanted to procure A-18s for its ground attack force and, to cut costs, pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly-designed F-18 fighter instead of the AV-8B to fulfill the role of close air support (both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole F/A-18 Hornet). Despite these bureaucratic obstacles, in 1981, the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five-year defense plan. The USN declined to participate in <b>the</b> <b>procurement,</b> citing the limited range and payload compared with conventional aircraft.|$|E

5|$|By late 1961, Hawker {{had been}} able to {{demonstrate}} the validity of its design concept, despite a lack of support from the RAF and little from the Her Majesty's Civil Service. In early 1962, official support emerged {{in the form of the}} Operational Requirements branch of the Ministry of Aviation, which approached the Treasury seeking its sanction of a batch of nine production-standard aircraft to be operated by an evaluation unit to be administered by the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with <b>the</b> <b>procurement</b> of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, {{aeronautical}} designers {{looked to}} variable-geometry wing designs {{to gain the}} manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings {{with the speed of}} swept wing designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled <b>the</b> <b>procurement</b> of the TSR-2 and subsequent F-111K aircraft, and was still looking for a replacement for its Avro Vulcan and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. Britain and France had initiated the AFVG (Anglo French Variable Geometry) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967. Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG, and sought new partners to achieve this.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of both the TSR-2 and P.1154 programmes, the RAF were still left with a requirement to replace both the Canberra and Hunter in the long-range strike, close air support and reconnaissance roles. This resulted in <b>the</b> <b>procurement</b> of two aircraft, the General Dynamics F-111K, intended for the long-range interdiction roles {{carried out by the}} Canberra, and the F-4M Phantom, which would be used in the close air support role undertaken by the Hunter. The F-111K was cancelled within a year of being ordered, but the order for 150 Phantoms went ahead alongside the Phantom order for the Royal Navy; the final 32 units of the RAF order were eventually cancelled. The RAF Phantom, given the designation FGR.2, was broadly similar to the naval version, with some minor variations in terms of engines, avionics and structure, which related to its use as a land-based, rather than carrier-based aircraft.|$|E
