25|$|The {{acids in}} wine are an {{important}} component in both winemaking and the finished product of wine. They are present in both grapes and wine, having direct influences on the color, balance and taste of the wine {{as well as the}} growth and vitality of yeast during fermentation and protecting the wine from bacteria. The measure of the amount of acidity in wine is known as the “titratable acidity” or “total acidity”, which refers to the test that yields the total of all acids present, while strength of acidity is measured according to pH, with most wines having a pH between 2.9 and 3.9. Generally, the lower the pH, the higher the acidity in the wine. However, there is no direct connection between <b>total</b> <b>acidity</b> and pH (it is possible to find wines with a high pH for wine and high acidity). In wine tasting, the term “acidity” refers to the fresh, tart and sour attributes of the wine which are evaluated in relation to how well the acidity balances out the sweetness and bitter components of the wine such as tannins. Three primary acids are found in wine grapes: tartaric, malic and citric acids. During the course of winemaking and in the finished wines, acetic, butyric, lactic and succinic acids can play significant roles. Most of the acids involved with wine are fixed acids with the notable exception of acetic acid, mostly found in vinegar, which is volatile and can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity. Sometimes, additional acids, such as ascorbic, sorbic and sulfurous acids, are used in winemaking.|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, H-bonding was postulated {{as a mechanism}} of adsorption for aromatics on oxygen-containing activated carbon. To verify this, the adsorption of phenol, aniline, benzene, and nitrobenzene was studied {{as a function of}} surface oxygen groups. It was determined that there is a linear correlation between <b>total</b> surface <b>acidity</b> and adsorption capacity for H-bonding adsorbates in cyclohexane. Flow microcalori-metry (FMC) and ultrasonic desorption tests also indicate stronger and less reversible adsorption bonds for H-bonding adsorbates. Reversibilit...|$|R
