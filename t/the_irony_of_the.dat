As a result of another relationship, he provided a stipend to a former lover, actress Louise Brooks, {{for the rest of}} her life. In his later years, he enjoyed keeping company with several women. Paley was included in a list of the ten most eligible bachelors compiled by Cosmopolitan magazine in 1985; <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> octogenarian Paley being on the list was an inspiration for Late Night with David Letterman's nightly Top Ten lists.|$|E
25|$|Inheritance was by descent, {{but could}} be further {{restricted}} by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In {{the case of the}} Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and her future children. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel's opening line, therefore, is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband in order to have prosperous life.|$|E

25|$|The oral {{tradition}} {{of that time}} depicted <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rivalries and adversities attracted to the Ado Township and the Ewi when describing her quest for expansion in Ekiti as popularly recounted thus: ‘Ogun yeye, b’Ewi ja, Ajase I loo Ewi’ Meaning ‘Many are the adversity of the King of Ado-Ekiti (Ewi), but the power of triumph lies in his hands.’ The continuous opposition to Ewi’s paramountcy by {{a large number of}} Ekiti royalties across the country is a pointer to the fear inherent in Ewi’s notable imperial ambitions from 17th to 19th century, which became threats on the status and economy of other notable towns, who were also aiming at prominence and equality within the regional power sharing structure of Ekiti country. No doubt, the characteristics of town formation in Ado-Ekiti area distinguish the mother town (the metropolis) where the most important chiefs reside from the subordinate towns where other rulers existed.|$|E

The triptych endures in popularity because it shows Vojvodina's past diversity and cosmopolitanism, which declined significantly during and after World War II, and the subsequent expulsion of the region's ethnic German population. This led one observer to remark on <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triptych celebrating diversity and coexistence in Vršac though descendants of the Germans depicted in the painting are unlikely to be living there today.

30|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ubiquity <b>of</b> methodological {{nationalism}} {{is that it}} has discouraged investigation into the actual political functions of nationhood.

Margaret Canovan (1996) suggests we should view nationhood as a battery that energizes much of politics, and like all batteries, it can be highly charged or more or less depleted, and it can be used to power diverse projects, progressive and regressive. Scholars of migration are typically conscious of one particular function of nationhood: namely, when it is a highly charged battery used for <b>the</b> regressive purpose <b>of</b> excluding immigrants. But a fuller analysis would reveal that nationhood can also serve as an effective battery for many social justice claims.|$|R

Beginning with the idea of characters as grotesques whose [...] "...grotesqueness is not merely a shield of deformity; it is also a remnant of misshapen feelings, what Dr. Reefy in the sketch 'Paper Pills' calls 'the sweetness of the twisted apples'". <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sweet, but twisted (meaning, in the sentimental Victorian tradition, internally inferior), apples is that they are compared to Dr. Reefy's own knuckles that make a habit of stuffing crumpled notes bearing his thoughts unread into his pockets (itself a symbol of the [...] "ineffectuality of human thought"). Wing Biddlebaum, the subject of the story [...] "Hands", likewise was [...] "...forever striving to conceal [...] in his pockets or behind his back". [...] For Wing, his hands were [...] "...the very index of his humanity", with the potential to symbolize a continuum going from a general fear of sexuality to sublimated homosexuality. Wing Biddlebaum and Dr. Reefy are just two examples of how throughout Winesburg, Ohio, Anderson builds myriad themes by adding symbolic significance to gestures, weather conditions and time of day, and events, among other features of the stories.|$|E

500|$|... "I'll Make a Man Out of You" [...] is {{performed}} by Captain Li Shang during Mulans training montage, which {{has also been}} identified as the film's [...] "boot camp sequence." [...] The scene explores Shang's attempt to train his newly recruited squadron of incompetent soldiers {{in the hopes of}} ultimately transforming into a skilled army. Occupying {{a significant portion of the}} film's plot, Shang promises to turn his team of [...] "rag-tag recruits" [...] into men. The musical number is used to [...] "compress dramatic time or narrate" [...] in a more compelling way than had solely dialogue been used. The scene begins with Shang shooting an arrow into the top of a tall pole and challenging all of his soldiers to retrieve it, each of whom fail until Mulan eventually succeeds. According to the book Into the Closet: Cross-Dressing and the Gendered Body in Children's Literature and Film by Victoria Flanagan, Mulan is successful in retrieving the arrow because she uses [...] "an ingenuity that is based upon her ability to incorporate aspects of femininity into her masculine performance." [...] By the end of the scene, all of the soldiers have improved dramatically and the results of their practice and training are finally revealed. In what Joshua and Judges author Athalya Brenner called [...] "a humorous reversal toward the end of the movie," [...] Mulan and her male comrades disguise themselves as concubines in order to infiltrate the palace and rescue the emperor while [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You" [...] reprises in the background.Critics have observed ways in which the scene explores Mulan's growth and transformation as the character evolves from a clumsy, inexperienced recruit into one of the army's most skilled soldiers, in spite of her gender. According to the book Literacy, Play and Globalization: Converging Imaginaries in Children's Critical and Cultural Performances, the montage depicts Mulan's gender as [...] "an obstacle to overcome." [...] Author Phyllis Frus wrote in her book Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works, [...] "The need for inexperienced young men to go through a rigorous training results in a sequence common to many films," [...] and that the scene [...] "show's the challenges Ping/Mulan faces due to her" [...] inexperience. As observed by Juanita Kwok in the book Film Asia: New Perspectives on Film for English, <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene lies within the fact that [...] "Mulan proves herself more competent than any of the men." [...] The author also observed that the scene's first refrain accompanies shots of Shang, while its second [...] "coincides with Mulan climbing to the top of the pole." [...] Additionally, while the earlier, all-female musical number [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] "functions as an account of the constructedness of female gender," [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You" [...] "juxtaposes and makes explicit the contention that gender is a cultural product," [...] according to Johnson Cheu, author of Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability. The Representation of Gender in Walt Disney's [...] "Mulan" [...] believes that the song emphasizes desirable masculine traits, namely [...] "discipline ... tranquility, celerity, strength and fearlessness," [...] while Shang, according to Putting the Grail Back into Girl Power: How a Girl Saved Camelot, and why it Matters, [...] "views [...] as comparable to weakness." [...] In her article Disney's [...] "Mulan"—the [...] "True" [...] Deconstructed Heroine?, Lisa Brocklebank argued the song explores themes such as othering, ostracism and abjection.|$|E
