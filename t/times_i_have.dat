500|$|In 1963 the Doubleday {{publishing}} company asked Haley {{to write a}} book about the life of MalcolmX. American writer and literary critic Harold Bloom writes, [...] "When Haley approached Malcolm with the idea, Malcolm gave him a startled look ..." [...] Haley recalls, [...] "It was one of the few <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever seen him uncertain." [...] After MalcolmX was granted permission from Elijah Muhammad, he and Haley commenced work on the Autobiography, a process which began as two-and three-hour interview sessions at Haley's studio in Greenwich Village. Bloom writes, [...] "Malcolm was critical of Haley's middle-class status, as well as his Christian beliefs and twenty years of service in the U.S. Military." ...|$|E
500|$|Thanks to the media, {{people have}} started taking boxing seriously {{over the past}} two years. Everyone knows my name now because my {{achievements}} have been highlighted. Lekin boxing ka toh kuch promotion hi nahin hota India mein. (But boxing is still not promoted in India!) We don’t have boxing academies, we don’t even have proper boxing rings. I have lost count of the <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> approached the government and the sporting authorities for support, but nothing has happened. [...] In this country, everyone is hung up on cricket. Forget about boxing, India is doing so well in other sports too. Saina Nehwal is a great badminton player, the Indian tennis team has just won a Davis Cup tie, lekin hamare liye support kahan hai? (but where is the support for all of us?) ...|$|E
500|$|With Somerset runners-up in the English 2009 Twenty20 Cup, Trescothick and his county {{travelled}} to India {{to partake}} in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. Though both Kieswetter and Hildreth were anticipated as successes, it was Trescothick who {{was described as}} having [...] "been in sparkling form all season" [...] and began the tournament under media scrutiny given his previous difficulties playing on tour. There was much speculation regarding any [...] "recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006", as {{this was to be}} his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the BBC World Service which read [...] "I know the risk and I know what happens when it goes wrong. In the last couple of <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> tried to go on tour it's failed, so of course ... Let's try and break the tradition of what has happened over the last few times... I can only try. It's a big competition for the players and for the club. I have got to try and make it happen." [...] Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was dismissed for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, [...] "after offering a fleeting glimpse of his talent" [...] according to ESPNcricinfo.|$|E

"I {{believed}} that it was so clear that axiomatisation in terms of sets was not a satisfactory ultimate foundation of mathematics that mathematicians would, for the most part, not be very much concerned with it. But in recent <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen to my surprise that so many mathematicians think that these axioms of set theory provide the ideal foundation for mathematics; therefore {{it seemed to me that}} the time had come for a critique."

2500|$|In her memoirs Sasse {{described}} {{preparing the}} role with Verdi:I have always loved working with authors and composers {{listening to their}} instructions trying to grasp their meaning ... Ah, {{but it was not}} the same as singing to Wagner or Meyerbeer! They were always patient, most careful to in no way hurt the feelings of an artiste. How different Verdi! He was exigeant hard, at times, I say it, almost cruel. Sharp words escaped him, and many <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> cried {{at the end of one}} of these hearings.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the nature}} of her songwriting, Amos stated: [...] "My songs might be confessional, but I don’t like giving away too many details. One of the reasons I’ve made ten albums and {{maintained}} my family life is that I respect my own privacy." [...] She confessed, [...] "At <b>times,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> used made-up characters to keep the media at bay." [...] During an interview, she commented: [...] "I guess the girl that released Little Earthquakes was not a mother, {{and she was in}} her 20's, {{and there were a lot}} of things that she really did discover. She found her voice...and then nine records later, the woman who is putting out Abnormally Attracted to Sin knows what she did with her voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hunt {{has also}} been criticised for the prejudiced views he propagates. Writing for The Times, Tim Teeman {{expressed}} concern over an episode of Ashes to Ashes which focused on overt homophobia, writing: [...] "No doubt the justification here is that it's Gene Hunt, everyone knows he's a bigot, that's what he'd say. And he and his mates were shown to be fools. But it was said with lip-smacking relish. Gene Hunt is {{on the brink of}} becoming a kind of icon of the sniggering, unreconstructed lad." [...] Ashley Pharoah, co-creator of both Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes, has also voiced concern on this issue, commenting: [...] "There have been <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> wondered: have we created a pin-up boy for the Daily Mail? That wasn't our intention." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a written}} {{statement}} to Army Air Forces (AAF) intelligence the following day (July 12), Arnold several times referred to the objects as [...] "saucer-like." [...] At {{the end of the}} report he drew a picture of what the objects appeared to look like at their closest approach to Mt. Rainier. He wrote, [...] "They seemed longer than wide, their thickness was about 1/20th their width." [...] (document with Arnold's drawing at right) [...] As to motion, Arnold wrote, [...] "They flew like many <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> observed geese to fly in a rather diagonal chain-like line as if they were linked together. They seemed to hold a definite direction but rather swerved {{in and out of the}} high mountain peaks." [...] He also spoke of how they would [...] "flip and flash in the sun." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Isaac Asimov {{recounted in}} his second autobiographical volume In Joy Still Felt seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954, during which he sang very cleverly about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, [...] "and {{after a while you}} {{gathered}} the 'it' to be venereal disease [...] Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every perversion known to mankind without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable (in those days) outside a nightclub." [...] Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the Boston subway system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to the subway song in his book. [...] "I haven't gone to nightclubs often," [...] said Asimov, [...] "but of all the <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> gone, it was on this occasion that I had by far the best time." ...|$|E

2500|$|During early production, Age of Empires Online was {{originally}} called Age of Empires IV. The development team {{had noticed that}} many other RTS game developers had {{moved away from the}} [...] "economic game". The team felt that [...] had blended the economic and military aspects of the game perfectly, so they decided to play test it with hindsight. They noticed that many features had been lost or changed over time. It was during this time the team decided to do an [...] "Age of Kings style gameplay in an Age of Empires setting". The designers were surprised that fans of the series were most fond of the simpler aspects of the previous titles. Former Age of Empires II lead designer Ian M. Fischer stated, [...] "When we started floating some of the early [...] out to people other pieces fell into place – I cannot tell you how many <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had someone email me or talk to me at a show and mention how much they loved the villagers carrying big hunks of meat in the original Age or the priest [...] "wololo"". From that point on, one of the goals was to invoke nostalgia from fans of the series when playing the game, despite the newer and updated features.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after he}} turned 18, Garðar {{decided he wanted}} to be a singer. [...] "I loved acting but I {{realised}} I couldn't live without music. What decided me was the amount of <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> cried over a phrase in an opera or the piano. In opera you can combine the two and, apart from Domingo, there aren't that many singers who are good actors." [...] He spent four years at his father's school in Reykjavík and then won a scholarship to the , or University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna, but left after six months to study privately with Professor Andrei Orlowitz in Copenhagen. For the next five years he spent two weeks in Denmark, then flew home to earn enough to pay the tuition and the airfares. He sang at funerals and weddings, appeared as Tony in West Side Story at the National Theatre in Reykjavík in 1995, and for five summers worked with disabled people. At the opera he was the toilet cleaner, the usher and the doorman. Recalling his father's advice about the hardships of a musical career, Garðar has commented: [...] "Even though he told me it was difficult, I still wanted to pursue this road. But looking back, you realise he was right, it is bloody difficult! Excuse the language." ...|$|E
