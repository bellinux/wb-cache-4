5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E
5|$|After this event, Vanille remains with Fang {{in crystal}} stasis within the pillar: from there, the two end up seeing {{everything}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, remaining {{unaffected by the}} changes in the timeline. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, though still held in the pillar, Vanille and Fang appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in. At the end of the game, they are rescued from the collapsing pillar. In Lightning Returns, Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang, gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead. She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order, a religious organization devoted to the deity Bhunivelze. Because of her ability, Vanille is key to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process: not knowing the truth about the ritual, she decides to go through with it to atone for her past actions. On the final day, Lightning and Fang persuade Vanille to use her power to free the dead and enable them to be reborn.|$|E

25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, {{leaning back in his}} chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.|$|E

Kwan and Bryant are close friends, and he subtly manipulates her encounters with Hamilton. After resisting Hamilton because she's returning to the United Kingdom, Bryant {{falls in love with}} him. Discovering that the Communist Chinese are arming the PKI, Bryant passes this information to Hamilton to save his life, but he wants to cover the Communist rebellion that will occur when the arms shipment reaches Jakarta. Shocked, Kwan and Bryant withdraw their friendship from Hamilton, and he is left with the American journalist Pete Curtis (Michael Murphy), and his own assistant and driver Kumar (Bembol Roco), who is secretly PKI. Kumar, however, remains loyal to Hamilton and tries to open his eyes to all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes {{result in the}} creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.|$|E
25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going.</b> Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

Apparently De Mauro was convinced that he had got hold of a story of a lifetime.
