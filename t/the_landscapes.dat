40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on <b>the</b> European <b>Landscape</b> Convention's {{implementation}} in landscape planning and then the process of determination <b>the</b> target <b>landscape</b> characteristics {{in cooperation with the}} public. At the same time, the issues of participatory planning and its involvement in the planning processes are discussed.

The practical part concentrates on processing <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> analysis of <b>the</b> territory. The next step is determining the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> in cooperation with the public.

5|$|Notable post-war artists {{included}} Robin Philipson (1916–92), who {{was influenced}} by the Colourists, but also Pop Art and neo-Romanticism. Robert MacBryde (1913–66), Robert Colquhoun (1914–64) and Joan Eardley (1921–63), were all graduates of the Glasgow School of Art. MacBryde and Colquhoun were influenced by neo-Romanticism and the Cubism of Adler. The English-born Eardley moved to Glasgow and explored <b>the</b> <b>landscapes</b> of Kincardineshire coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets. Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the St Ives School were Wilhelmina Barns-Graham (1912–2004) and Margaret Mellis (1914–2009).|$|E

5|$|Beato pioneered {{and refined}} the {{techniques}} of hand-colouring photographs and making panoramas. He may have started hand-colouring photographs {{at the suggestion of}} Wirgman, or he may have seen the hand-coloured photographs made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew. Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than <b>the</b> <b>landscapes,</b> are appraised as excellent. As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive view. The complete version of his panorama of Pehtang comprises seven photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres (6 1/2ft).|$|E

5|$|Escher, who {{had been}} very fond of and {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>landscapes</b> in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published {{as part of the}} book Escher on Escher.

Princess Mononoke was produced with an estimated budget of ¥2.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million), making it the most expensive film by Studio Ghibli at the time. Approximately fifteen minutes of the film uses computer animation: about five minutes uses techniques such as 3D rendering, digital composition, and texture mapping; the remaining ten minutes uses digital ink and paint. While the original intention was to digitally paint 5,000 of the film's frames, time constraints doubled this.|$|E
5|$|Landscape was a {{secondary}} concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare {{and when they}} did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often <b>the</b> <b>landscapes</b> were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.|$|E

40|$|Landscape {{is usually}} {{classified}} into cultural and natural part.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} Scottish landscape painting {{are in the}} tradition of Scottish house decoration for burgesses, lairds and lords, that arose after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, partly {{as a response to the}} loss of religious patronage. Most were of heraldry, classical myths and allegory, but there were a number of painted landscape scenes. These included <b>the</b> <b>landscapes</b> of four seasons in the Skelmorlie Aisle (1638) in the memorial chapel of the Montgomery family in Largs undertaken by James Stalker (fl. 1632–38). They indicate an awareness of contemporaneous Dutch landscape painting. The Flemish artist Alexander Keirincx (1600–52) was active in England and Scotland where he undertook commissions for Charles I, mainly of royal castles in Northern England and Scotland. These included one showing Seton House (1636–37) in its landscape, which is often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland. The theme of house decoration with landscapes was taken up in the eighteenth century by James Norie (1684–1757), who worked beside the architect William Adam (1689–1748). Norie, with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with capriccios or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes, bringing to Scotland the influence of French artists such as Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. The Nories were also important figures in professionalisation of Scottish art and the development of art education.|$|E
5|$|The {{shift in}} attitudes to a romantic {{view of the}} Highlands {{at the end of}} the 18th century had a major impact on Scottish art. Romantic depictions can be seen in the work of 18th-century artists {{including}} Jacob More, and Alexander Runciman. and the next generation of artists, including the portraits of Henry Raeburn (1756–1823), and <b>the</b> <b>landscapes</b> of Alexander Nasmyth (1758–1840) and John Knox (1778–1845). The Royal Scottish Academy of Art was created in 1826, allowing professional painters to more easily exhibit and sell their works. Andrew Geddes (1783–1844) and David Wilkie (1785–1841) were among the most successful portrait painters. The tradition of highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as Horatio McCulloch (1806–67), Joseph Farquharson (1846–1935) and William McTaggart (1835–1910). Aberdeen born William Dyce (1806–64), emerged as one of the most significant figures in art education in the United Kingdom. The Glasgow School, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the Celtic Revival the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Japonisme, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style. Among the most prominent members were the loose collective of The Four: acclaimed architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, his wife the painter and glass artist Margaret MacDonald, her sister the artist Frances, and her husband, the artist and teacher Herbert MacNair.|$|E
