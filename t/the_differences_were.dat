5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different orangutan field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the animals from the different sites. They found the different orangutan populations behaved differently. The evidence suggested <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> cultural: first, {{the extent of the}} differences increased with distance, suggesting cultural diffusion was occurring, and second, the size of the orangutans' cultural repertoire increased according to the amount of social contact present within the group. Social contact facilitates cultural transmission.|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E
5|$|In a 2003 article, Milner {{noted that}} the teeth of Baryonyx were {{very similar to those}} of the genus Suchosaurus and {{suggested}} that their remains represented the same animal. The type species of the genus, S. cultridens, was named in 1841 based on teeth from Tilgate Forest in Sussex; a second species, S. girardi, was named in 1897 based on jaw fragments and a tooth from Boca do Chapim. In 2007 Buffetaut considered the teeth of S. girardi very similar to those of Baryonyx (and S. cultridens) except for the stronger development of the crown ribs, suggesting that the remains belonged to the same genus. Buffetaut agreed with Milner that the teeth of S. cultridens were almost identical to those of B. walkeri, but with a ribbier surface. The former taxon might be a senior synonym of the latter (since it was published first), depending on whether <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> within a taxon or between different ones. According to Buffetaut, since the holotype specimen of S. cultridens is one worn tooth and that of B. walkeri is a skeleton it would be more practical to retain the newer name. In 2011 Portuguese palaeontologist Octávio Mateus and colleagues agreed that Suchosaurus was closely related to Baryonyx, but considered both species in the former genus nomina dubia (dubious names) since their holotype specimens were not considered diagnostic (lacking distinguishing features) and could not be definitely equated with other taxa.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{requires}} that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or slates) are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms {{in the media}} (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8hours of news on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis of news coverage indicated evenly-matched coverage of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on one side, and the main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of coverage and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government, while RTL gave more coverage to the SDP. However, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less coverage. HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the coverage, HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent coverage. The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates.|$|E
5|$|The {{quarries}} at Stonesfield, {{which were}} worked until 1911, continued to produce Megalosaurus bucklandii fossils, mostly single bones from the pelvis and hindlimbs. Vertebrae and skull bones are rare. In 2010, Roger Benson counted {{a total of}} 103 specimens from the Stonesfield Slate, from a minimum of seven individuals. It has been contentious whether this material represents just a single taxon. In 2004, Julia Day and Paul Barrett claimed {{that there were two}} morphotypes present, based on small differences in the thighbones. In 2008 Benson favoured this idea, but in 2010 concluded <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> illusory. A maxilla fragment, specimen OUM J13506, was, in 1869 assigned, by Thomas Huxley, to M. bucklandii. In 1992 Robert Thomas Bakker claimed it represented a member of the Sinraptoridae; in 2007, Darren Naish thought it was a separate species belonging to the Abelisauroidea. In 2010, Benson pointed out that the fragment was basically indistinguishable from other known M. bucklandii maxillae, to which it had in fact not been compared by the other authors.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the breed}} had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working dog. In the early 20th century the breeders {{on either side of the}} Atlantic had created {{different}} breed standards for the Cocker Spaniel and the breed gradually diverged from one another, with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer and the dogs overall were lighter and smaller. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the English Cocker Spaniel Club and restricted breeding between the two types of spaniel. The two types of Cocker Spaniel in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognised the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of such proposed generalizations are isomorphic {{to a simple}} game of modular arithmetic, where half <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> wins for player one. For instance, rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard (note the different order {{of the last two}} moves) may be modeled as a game in which each player picks a number from one to five. Subtract the number chosen by player two from the number chosen by player one, and then take the remainder modulo 5 of the result. Player one is the victor if <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> one or three, and player two is the victor if <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> two or four. If <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> zero, <b>the</b> game is a tie.|$|R

After gaining his freedom, he finally married Gulielma Springett in April 1672, after a four-year engagement filled with frequent separations. Penn stayed close to home but continued writing his tracts, espousing religious tolerance and railing against discriminatory laws. A minor split developed in the Quaker community between those who favoured Penn's analytical formulations and those who preferred Fox's simple precepts. But the persecution of Quakers had accelerated and <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> overridden; Penn again resumed missionary work in Holland and Germany.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1960-1961 {{in the wake}} of the Great Smog of 1952 compared 293 London residents with 477 residents of Gloucester, Peterborough, and Norwich, three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis. All subjects were male postal truck drivers aged 40 to 59. Compared to the subjects from the outlying towns, the London subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms (including cough, phlegm, and dyspnea), reduced lung function (FEV1 and peak flow rate), and increased sputum production and purulence. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> more pronounced for subjects aged 50 to 59.

25|$|This {{conclusion}} was challenged by Robert Martin (after Jacob's death the leading {{proponent of the}} microcephaly hypothesis) and Alan Thorne. Martin noted that no {{research has been done}} on wrists of microcephalic people. Thorne maintained that <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> small and that similar variation could occur with living modern humans. He also pointed out that the carpal bones had been found scattered in the cave and it was not certain that they all belonged to the same individual. Project leader Morwood countered that there were also other features, such as the stature, body proportions, brain size, shoulder, pelvis, jaw, and teeth which suggested that H.nbsp&floresiensis is a separate hominin species that evolved in isolation on the island.|$|E
25|$|Tito thus {{separated}} Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia {{after the}} war. It became a republic {{of the new}} federal Yugoslavia (as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia) in 1946, with its capital at Skopje. Tito also promoted {{the concept of a}} separate Macedonian nation, as a means of severing the ties of the Slav population of Yugoslav Macedonia with Bulgaria. Although the Macedonian language is very close to Bulgarian, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> deliberately emphasized and the region's historical figures were promoted as being uniquely Macedonian (rather than Serbian or Bulgarian). A separate Macedonian Orthodox Church was established, splitting off from the Serbian Orthodox Church, but it has not been recognized by any other Orthodox Church, including the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Communist Party sought to deter pro-Bulgarian sentiment, which was punished severely; convictions were still being handed down as late as 1991.|$|E
25|$|While {{initially}} {{the idea of}} ordering two similar but technically different series of ships for the same purpose was to gain operational experience for the future arctic freighters, shortly after the deal was made public the shipyards approached Sudoimport {{to agree on a}} uniform design. Not only was running two parallel development projects wasting effort and resources for the shipyards, but constructing a single type of ships instead of two would bring savings to the customer in form of reduced maintenance and spare part costs. Wärtsilä's design was chosen as the standard for further development since it was ahead in the production schedule. However, despite the co-operative measures some dissimilarities between the ships built by Wärtsilä and Valmet remained, resulting in the crews considering of them as separate types of ships as <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> most obvious from the operator's point of view.|$|E
