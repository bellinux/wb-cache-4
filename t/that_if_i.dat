5|$|I {{will not}} {{disguise}} {{it in the}} least... the fact is, I most eagerly aspire after future eminence in literature, my whole soul burns most ardently after it, and every earthly thought centres in it... I am almost confident in believing, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can ever rise in the world it must be by the exercise of my talents in the wide field of literature.|$|E
5|$|I've {{had a great}} time, but I'm frightened <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{stick around}} too long, I'll end up unable to do {{anything}} else. It's not about money, it's about doing other things and not wanting Mike to pale into insignificance.|$|E
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

25|$|In May 2013, Jake and Amir {{started the}} podcast If I Were You as an advice show where they take {{listener}} questions {{and try to}} answer them in a helpful but funny way. Hurwitz said <b>that</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Were You was partially inspired by the NPR show Car Talk, in that their audience listens for the banter between the two hosts, not necessarily the questions themselves.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued <b>that</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Were You {{is part of a}} trend of Ayckbourn's adult plays taking {{inspiration}} from his family plays (in this case, The Jollies, which also deals with the adjustments and insights of being someone else) – the first example being Improbable Fiction and its derivation from The Boy Who Fell into A Book and My Very Own Story.|$|E

25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for me. It was a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with him, and I went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head.

25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

25|$|Baudrillard is not disputing the trivial {{issue that}} reason remains {{operative}} in some actions, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> want {{to arrive at}} the next block, for example, I can assume a Newtonian universe (common sense), plan a course of action (to walk straight for Xmeters), carry out the action, and finally fulfill my goal by arriving at the point in question. What is in doubt is that this sort of thinking enables a historically informed grasp of the present in general. According to Baudrillard, it does not. The concurrent spread of the hyperreal through the media and the collapse of liberal and Marxist politics as the master narratives, deprives the rational subject of its privileged access to truth. In an important sense individuals are no longer citizens, eager to maximise their civil rights, nor proletarians, anticipating the onset of communism. They are rather consumers, and hence the prey of objects as defined by the code.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
500|$|... {{some little}} {{inconsistency}} in the defense, {{and the main}} part of it is this: There will be conversations here where Mr. Glasser wasn't present, where people have seen Mr. Kretske and they have talked about, that they gave money to take care of Glasser, that is not binding on Mr. Glasser, and there is a divergency there, and Mr. Glasser feels <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would represent Mr. Kretske the jury would get an idea that they are together [...] [...] [...] [...]|$|E

On joining the club, Haber said that [...] "The club were pretty straightforward with me from day one.

500|$|Despite its {{relative}} antiquity by 1970, the song's lyrics lent themselves {{well to the}} themes of spiritual salvation and friendship that define All Things Must Pass, being consistent with the karmic subject matter {{of much of the}} album.

500|$|The X-Files {{has spawned}} one sequel, a 2008 film {{entitled}} [...] released {{six years after}} the series ended. The film performed modestly {{at the box office}} and received a less positive response than the first film. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Chris Carter announced <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> Want to Believe proved successful, he would propose that a third movie go back to the television series' mythology and focus on the alien invasion foretold within the series, due to occur in December 2012. No third movie appeared; instead, the TV series was revived in 2016.|$|E
500|$|Also in January 2006, Brown {{approved}} a $50,000 budget for JC's Girls for the year. By April, seven strippers had attended Sandals Church because of JC's Girls and strippers {{from across the}} United States had contacted the organization looking for local churches. In an attempt to dispel accusations that the JC's Girls message might be motivated by jealousy, Veitch lost weight and became more physically fit. She said that she wanted strippers [...] "to know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to, I could be a stripper again, but I choose {{to live my life}} for the Lord." ...|$|E
