Currently, <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of heterogeneous materials is determined by standards developed for homogeneous materials. The fracture behaviour of heterogeneous materials differs from fracture behaviour of homogeneous materials.

Fracture resistance has been quantified by the fracture strain in uniaxial tension, epsilon(-f), the fracture toughness at cracking initiation, J(1 c). and by the essential work of fracture, w(e). The fracture mechanisms were characterized by microscopic observations and by profilometric measurements of the crack lip necking process typical in thin sheet fracture. The fracture toughness at cracking initiation of TRIP-aided steels corresponds to an equivalent Dual Phase steel in which martensite replaces retained austenite and is thus not affected by the retained austenite stability. The ductile <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of TRIP-aided steels, quantified by w(e), increases significantly with the retained austenite stability.

40|$|The {{permanence}} of printed documents and books {{appears to be}} primarily dependent on paper stability. Other researchers implicate pH as {{a major factor in}} the deterioration rate of paper and acidity as major the cause of this deterioration. During the lithographic printing process, ink is in direct contact with fountain solution, which can be acidic or alkaline. Fountain solution is a mixture of water and chemicals used to keep the non-image areas of a lithographic plate moist. On press the intimate contact of ink with fountain solution creates a fountain solution-in-ink emulsion. The emulsion used here is a stable suspension of fountain solution droplets within the ink. The objective of this study was to determine if ink/fountain solution emulsion, which is printed on paper during lithographic printing, affects the rate of deterioration of paper. The stability of four commonly available papers was observed. These paper types were groundwood, publication grade, coated book, and uncoated book. Samples of the four paper groups were printed with four different ink formulations. The ink formulations were ink, ink and distilled water, ink and acidic fountain solution, and ink and alkaline fountain solution. Samples of the unprinted and printed paper were subjected to an accelerated - aging process by heating the samples for 72 hours at 100 C. The properties of unaged and aged papers were evaluated by pH determination, folding endurance, and <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance.</b> On the basis of statistical analysis of the data, inferences were made about the effect of the ink formulations on the paper properties. This experiment indicates that ink/fountain solution emulsion did affect the paper pH, but this effect is due to the ink with little change in pH due to the addition of acidic or alkaline fountain solution to the ink. The results of folding endurance and <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> tests after accelerated aging established no clear pattern of variance that would indicate the differences observed in these properties were due to the pH change associated with the ink/fountain solution emulsions. Several unexpected occurrences were exhibited by this experiment. These include: groundwood was the paper least affected by the aging process; the pH of coated paper increased with the application of ink/fountain solution emulsion; a decrease in <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> was associated with alkaline fountain solution...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{studies of}} the near tip fields and the effects on void growth rates for a steadily advancing crack through a ductile metal {{in the presence of}} hydrogen, under plane-strain and quasi-static conditions. The computational model determines directly the deformation history of a steadily propagating crack without the need for a priori (transient) analysis that considers blunting of the pre-existing stationary crack and subsequent growth through the associated initial plastic zone. The present approach enables straightforward investigation over a range of geometric constraint configurations encountered in test specimens and structural components by application of a far field KI-T loading. The ductile crack propagation simulated in these studies represents that observed in a high-solubility model material, where the diffusion rate can sustain equilibrium of the hydrogen concentration ahead of the steadily propagating crack tip. The constitutive model accounts for the influence of hydrogen on the elastic–plastic regimes of material response at the continuum level, e. g. hydrogen-induced material softening. The model reflects the amount of hydrogen in the material under stress and the intensity of hydrogen-induced softening in the material. The hydrogen influenced, crack front fields serve as input to an exponential-based characterization of void growth rates which provides qualitative estimates for the impact of hydrogen on <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> curves. The analyses suggest significantly higher void growth rates exist in a hydrogen-charged material than in a hydrogen free material, with a corresponding reduction in <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> in the presence of hydrogen regardless of the level of imposed constraint...|$|E
