5|$|Unlike Love's Last Shift, {{which never}} again {{performed}} after the 1690s, The Relapse has retained its audience appeal. In the 18th century, however, its tolerant attitude towards actual and attempted adultery gradually became unacceptable to public opinion, {{and the original}} play was for a century replaced on the stage by Sheridan's moralised version A Trip to Scarborough (1777). On the modern stage, The Relapse has been established {{as one of the}} most popular Restoration comedies, valued for Vanbrugh's light, throwaway wit and <b>the</b> <b>consummate</b> acting part of Lord Foppington, a burlesque character with a dark side.|$|E
5|$|On the hardwood, he was {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>consummate</b> defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win. Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds. Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. Russell “was the smartest player ever {{to play the game}} ” according to Bill Bradley, Russell’s erstwhile Knicks opponent writing in 2009. He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points. He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops. However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never {{the focal point of the}} Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.|$|E

500|$|Downes {{said that}} his voicing for Master Chief was based entirely on Bungie's written {{character}} description provided, which specified a character similar to Clint Eastwood and of few words. In a podcast interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, {{he was given a}} fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality. In the games, Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him an almost silent protagonist. Even during cut scenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as [...] "so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [...] apply their own personality." [...] Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described Master Chief as [...] "pretty much <b>the</b> <b>consummate</b> professional. He does his job, walks off, doesn't even get the girl, he's that cool he doesn't need her." [...] Although the Master Chief is usually depicted as calm, quiet, and wryly cynical, some reviewers stated that Eric Nylund's portrayal of the character in Halo: The Fall of Reach deviates significantly from the treatment found in the games and other media. Alternatively, William C. Dietz's portrayal of the Chief in [...] was occasionally blasted by fans as too radical a departure from Nylund's template.|$|E
500|$|Leroux was {{the number}} one pick by the Atlanta Beat in the 2012 WPS Draft, though the league folded before she could play for the team. During the summer of 2012, Leroux joined fellow U.S. {{national}} team players, Hope Solo, Alex Morgan, Stephanie Cox, and Megan Rapinoe on the Seattle Sounders Women in the W-League. Sounders Women head coach, Michelle French, said of the signing, [...] "Sydney is <b>the</b> <b>consummate</b> goal scorer with an incredible attacking attitude. She not only shows tireless effort on the offensive side of the ball, but she is very unique in that she prides herself on her defensive recovery and ability to win the ball back. She makes an impact no matter where she plays on the field." [...] Due to her national team commitments and preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Leroux made only two regular season appearances for the club. She scored two goals and served one assist in her 168 minutes on the pitch. With the national teammates' presence on the team, the Sounders sold out nine of their ten home matches at the 4,500 capacity Starfire Stadium. Average attendance during the 2012 season for the Sounders Women was four {{times higher than the}} next closest team.|$|E

Nonetheless, his heart belongs to one woman alone, the stunning Nikki Reed. Despite true love and good intention, the relationship between Victor and Nikki has always been troubled by poor timing and miscommunication." [...] In 1990, The Washington Times wrote that, [...] "Victor Newman's sudden marriage to Ashley Abbott fooled us all." [...] In 1995, Sports Illustrated wrote of Victor's marriage to Hope, saying a [...] "man with that much power could have married anyone, but he fell in love with a blind woman. Not for what she is, but who she's about." [...] In 2002, Entertainment Weekly wrote that the soap opera was [...] "keeping it real" [...] with Victor and Nikki's third wedding.

[...] I have no doubt whatever on that point. They were of almost incalculable value to the public service." [...] George G. Evans, in his late 19th century history of the Mint, described Peale, [...] "his mildness, integrity, gentlemanly bearing and high moral and mental culture constituted him a model officer". Walter Breen deemed Peale, [...] "brilliant but unscrupulous". Burdette writes of Peale and his effect on the Mint, [...] "during the generation from about 1830 to 1855, the greatest influence to operations and production came from one man: Benjamin Franklin Peale. He was <b>the</b> <b>consummate</b> 'machinist' of the {{day at a time}} when this term encompassed imaginative design, planning, construction and improvement of working processes... While he had the complete support of mint directors Moore and Patterson, he was also held in high esteem by the common mint workers and Philadelphia's scientific elite. Results of many of his ideas lasted a century or more, until growth in population made nineteenth century engineering insufficient for modern coinage needs." [...] According to Bowers, [...] "today Peale is one of several Mint people who can be viewed from many different angles, each perspective sometimes leading certain writers to draw widely differing conclusions." ...|$|E
500|$|The Civil War brought {{economic}} disturbances {{which resulted}} in the removal of some coins, including the base-metal cent, from circulation. [...] Paper currency (valued as low as three cents), postage stamps, and private tokens, filled the gap. [...] Many of the tokens were cent-sized, but thinner and made of bronze. Mint authorities took notice that these metal pieces were successfully circulating, and obtained legislation for a bronze cent. [...] Longacre's Indian head design continued in its place with the new metal; later in 1864 he engraved his initial [...] "L" [...] in the headdress. [...] The act which authorized the bronze cent also issued a two-cent piece; Longacre furnished a design, which Lange calls a [...] "particularly attractive composition" [...] with arrows and a laurel wreath flanking a shield. [...] However, art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that elements of the design [...] "need only flanking cannon to be <b>the</b> <b>consummate</b> expressions of Civil War heraldry." [...] Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase favored placing an expression of the nation's faith in God {{in a time of war}} on the coinage, and wrote to Mint Director Pollock, [...] "You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest tersest terms possible this national recognition." [...] Several mottos were considered by Pollock, including [...] "God Our Trust" [...] and [...] "God and Our Country". Longacre's two-cent piece was the first coin inscribed [...] with [...] "In God We Trust".|$|E
500|$|During Maria Arena Bell's {{tenure as}} {{executive}} producer and head writer, the character's storyline underwent {{a change in}} creative direction, inciting unfavorable reviews. Bell had promised to make the character into a [...] "stronger woman", but Jillian Bowe of Daytime Confidential criticized Bell for {{not living up to}} her pledge: [...] "Has transforming Sharon into a promiscuous, recovering kleptomaniac, who never considers what her sexual choices will mean for her children, really made her stronger in 's eyes?" [...] She also contended that the beloved character was being [...] "utterly assassinated, via one ill-conceived storyline and/or romance after another". Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that the character turned from heroine to a [...] "psycho slut-nut" [...] when she's [...] "not channeling Joan Crawford in the Pepsi board room." [...] Another writer from Daytime Confidential praised Case for giving [...] "one wonky storyline after another" [...] her best efforts in a character that was [...] "once beloved" [...] but had been [...] "royally assassinated". A September 2012 scene (in which Sharon wore white to husband Victor's funeral) was described by co-star Joshua Morrow as [...] "one of the best and funniest scenes" [...] in the show's history. Tommy Garrett of Canyon News wrote, [...] "Maria Bell knows that consummate actress Sharon Case plays <b>the</b> <b>consummate</b> heroine Sharon Newman with aplomb." [...] By the end of 2012, Aaron Hagey-MacKay of GlobalTV compared the [...] "tortured soul" [...] of Sharon to the character Nicole Walker on Days of Our Lives, writing: [...] "Who had it worse this year, Sharon or Nicole?" ...|$|E
