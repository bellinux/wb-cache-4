40|$|The {{integration}} of separate, yet complimentary, cortical pathways appears {{to play a}} role in visual perception and action when intercepting objects. The ventral system is responsible for object recognition and identification, while the dorsal system facilitates continuous regulation of action. This dual-system model implies that empirically manipulating different visual information sources during performance of an interceptive action might lead to the emergence of distinct gaze and movement pattern profiles. To test this idea, we recorded hand kinematics and eye movements of participants as they attempted to catch balls projected from a novel apparatus that synchronised or de-synchronised accompanying video images of a throwing action and ball <b>trajectory.</b> <b>Results</b> revealed that ball catching performance was less successful when patterns of hand movements and gaze behaviours were constrained by the absence of advanced perceptual information from the thrower's actions. Under these task constraints, participants began tracking the ball later, followed less of its trajectory, and adapted their actions by initiating movements later and moving the hand faster. There were no performance differences when the throwing action image and ball speed were synchronised or de-synchronised since hand movements were closely linked to information from ball <b>trajectory.</b> <b>Results</b> are interpreted relative to the two-visual system hypothesis, demonstrating that accurate interception requires {{integration of}} advanced visual information from kinematics of the throwing action and from ball flight trajectory...|$|E

The DF + H product channel is found to behave essentially classically: the present quantum-mechanical angular distributions for this channel are in good agreement with both the earlier quasi-classical <b>trajectory</b> <b>results</b> of Aoiz and co-workers on the same potential-energy surface {{and the results of}} the molecular beam experiment.

The main quantum-mechanical effect that is identified in the calculations is a reactive scattering resonance that gives rise to a pronounced forward-scattering peak in the calculated F + HD(v = 0, j = 0) → HF(v′ = 3) + D differential cross-section.
