[...] Foreign sales are also an option, but the MQ-1 may be subject to limitations of the Missile <b>Technology</b> <b>Control</b> Regime because it can be armed. [...] Export markets are also limited by the Reaper as well. Given the Predator's phasing out and low size, weight, and power availability, the Air Force decided not to look into upgrades to make it more effective in contested environments and found its only use in defended airspace would be to be shot down while drawing fire away from other aircraft. Due to needed airborne surveillance after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) invaded Iraq, the Predator's retirement was pushed to 2018. [...] MQ-1s will probably be placed in non-recoverable storage at the Boneyard and not sold to allies, although antenna, ground control stations, and other components may be salvaged for continued use on other airframes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{business}} and accounting, information <b>technology</b> <b>controls</b> (or IT controls) are specific activities performed by persons or systems {{designed to ensure}} that business objectives are met. They are a subset of an enterprise's internal control. IT control objectives relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and the overall management of the IT function of the business enterprise. IT controls are often described in two categories: IT general controls (ITGC) and IT application controls. ITGC include controls over the Information Technology (IT) environment, computer operations, access to programs and data, program development and program changes. IT application controls refer to transaction processing controls, sometimes called [...] "input-processing-output" [...] <b>controls.</b> Information <b>technology</b> <b>controls</b> have been given increased prominence in corporations listed in the United States by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The COBIT Framework (Control Objectives for Information Technology) is a widely used framework promulgated by the IT Governance Institute, which defines a variety of ITGC and application control objectives and recommended evaluation approaches.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. This topic has been widely addressed by the researches in the United States of America (US) after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act due to the increase of responsibilities on these controls. Italy has followed the US regulation with the law number 262 of 2005 and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting have become of {{the interest of the}} regulators and of the companies that have to implement their evaluation. The thesis aims to analyze the effectiveness of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. The effectiveness can be analyzed looking at the output of the Internal Controls over Financial Reporting evaluation or looking at the procedures used in this evaluation. The outputs of the evaluation are the Internal Control Deficiencies found and disclosed to the market by the responsible for Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, that usually is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Literature based on Sarbanes-Oxley Act usually uses this approach because in US is possible to have public data on Internal Control Deficiencies disclosed to the market. In Italy this kind of disclosure is limited, thus one part of the thesis analyzes the Internal Control Deficiencies found by the companies but not disclosed to the market because under the materiality level. The thesis looks at the Internal Auditor Detection Process to understand where are the problems that bring to more severe and persistent Internal Control Deficiencies and look for the type of Internal Control Deficiencies more severe and persistent. The idea under this research is to find the more problematic issues where the companies have to focus to increase the effectiveness of their Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Because of this difficulty in data availability for Internal Control Deficiencies, the effectiveness have been analyzed looking at the procedures used to evaluate the Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. The procedures have been analyzed looking at the quality of each phase of the audit cycle. The Internal Controls over Financial Reporting have been divided in its components of Entity Level Controls, Account-specific <b>Controls</b> and Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls.</b> Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls</b> Quality has been then related to audit risk and audit fees to see the relation between internal controls and external controls performed by external auditors. The idea under this research is that if the internal controls are effective and assure a higher reliability of financial reporting, the external auditors can reduce their work. Finally Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls</b> have been deeply investigates in their relevant component of outsourced controls. Based on specific frameworks, one part of the thesis address the Audit Quality of Outsourced Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls,</b> that is of significant interest nowadays. The idea under this research is that the evaluation of these controls without going directly in the outsourcers’ location is not enough to assure the effectiveness and the reliability of financial reporting that use the information <b>technology</b> <b>controlled.</b> Even if the standards let to use indirect evaluation or service auditors’ attestations, the thesis proposes to use the direct evaluation for a better effectiveness. Thus, the thesis is structured in three studies: 1. 	Audit Quality of Outsourced Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls.</b> 2. 	Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls</b> Quality and Audit Fees: Evidence from Italy. 3. 	Internal Auditor Detection Process and Internal Control Deficiencies Types.
