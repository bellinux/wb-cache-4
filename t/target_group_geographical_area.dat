40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} a growing concern world- wide, and obesity rates are higher in certain groups in the {{developed}} world, including Aus- tralian Aboriginal people. Community-based obe- sity prevention interventions (CBOPI) can help to address obesity, however the approach of such programs to reach diverse groups, includ- ing Aboriginal people, must be considered. This paper considers one mainstream 1 CBOPI, the eat well be active (ewba) Community Programs in South Australia, which was delivered in two communities and sought to reach Aboriginal people as part of the overall program. This paper considers how well this approach was received by the Aboriginal people living and working in those communities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine Aboriginal workers who had some connection to the ewba program, and seven ewba project staff. Qualitative data analysis was performed and factors found to af- fect how well the program was received by Abo- riginal people include relationships, approach and project <b>target</b> <b>group,</b> including <b>geographical</b> <b>area.</b> A different response was observed in the two communities, with a more positive response being observed in the community where more relationships were developed between ewba and Aboriginal staff. For any CBOPI seeking to work with Aboriginal (or other Indigenous) communi- ties, it is vital to consider and plan how the pro- gram will meet the needs and preferences of Aboriginal people in all stages of the project, in order to reach this group.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was commissioned by}} the Scottish Government to explore statistical evidence from survey data to establish whether taking part in culture in Scotland depends both on {{who you are and}} where you live. Previous descriptive analyses had suggested that some socio-demographic factors were associated with cultural choices. This research quantifies the relative importance of each of these factors and provides a useful addition to existing quantitative and qualitative research evidence in this area. The research provides strong evidence that some demographic factors (e. g. education) are more important than others. Using this information, {{it will be possible to}} target those individuals who may be at a disadvantage in terms of engaging with culture. In this report, we analyse the cultural data from the Scottish Government's Scottish Household Survey Culture (and Sport) Module, examining both attendance and participation in different cultural activities. The Scottish Government aims to overcome and remove barriers that exist for some people to engage with culture, given that evidence suggests that such engagement enhances socialisation and a sense of belonging. Our aim is to look at whether people can be categorized on the basis of their cultural consumption, and then examine whether belonging to those categories can be explained by the socio-demographic characteristics of the individual and wider geographical influences. This information will identify <b>target</b> <b>groups</b> and <b>geographical</b> <b>areas</b> where new initiatives to encourage engagement in culture could be piloted...|$|R

Two multiple logistic regression models were {{used to evaluate the}} time trend of DKA frequency considered as present versus absent and severe versus absent, adjusted for gender, age <b>group</b> and <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> of residence at diagnosis. Overall, 9, 040 cases were ascertained. DKA frequency was 40. 3 % (95 %CI: 39. 3 - 41. 4 %), with 29. 1 % and 11. 2 % for mild/moderate and severe DKA, respectively. Severe DKA increased significantly during the period (OR = 1. 03, 95 %CI: 1. 003 - 1. 05). Younger-age children and children living in Southern Italy compared to Central Italy were at significantly higher risk of DKA and severe DKA.

40|$|This paper proposes the {{application}} of a widely used approach, known as stated preference discrete choice experiments, to estimate the value of personal information in three real-life contexts and situations. The paper develops three experiments describing hypothetical situations in which respondents considered varying aspects of their personal information (e. g. storage, sharing with third parties) when (a) purchasing online a product, (b) a service or (c) conducting pure search online. The survey was carried out with sample quotas pre-specified in order to match the profile of the Internetuser population in the UK with respect to gender, age <b>group,</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> of residence and personal annual income. The results from the experiment provide new insights in the value and influence of attributes of personal information when conducting online transactions. In particular, main results show that there was little interest by respondents to pay in order to introduce control over their personal data, that the extend of sharing of personal information with third parties was seen the most important aspect when choosing online retailers and search engines, and that an unspecified duration of data storage was received as badly as the data storage beyond several years for online retailers and worse than shorter durations...|$|R

We use the National Baseline Household Surveys (NBHS) of 2009 to measure poverty {{incidence}} in education, consumption, {{access to public}} assets and possession of private assets across these two countries. We differentiate between children/teenagers aged six to fourteen years and adults aged fifteen years or older. We apply a counting method for measuring multidimensional poverty {{at the individual level}} and perform dominance tests to check for the robustness of the poverty comparisons. Our findings show regional and sub-population differences in the unidimensional and multidimensional poverty status of people in Sudan and South Sudan. Poverty in Sudan is generally less severe than in South Sudan, with a pattern showing (i) lesser unidimensional incidence of poverty; (ii) lower multidimensional poverty indices and prevalence, but similar breadth, in Sudan than in South Sudan, both for adults and children. This pattern also points towards Khartoum and Western Equatoria as the states with the least poverty, and Northern Darfur, and Warap as the states with the greatest poverty, both for adults and children, in Sudan and South Sudan, respectively. Policy intended at reducing poverty in each of the two countries should recognize the poverty profile differences across age <b>groups,</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>areas</b> and dimensions...|$|R
40|$|Reported {{are updated}} data on {{poliomyelitis}} surveillance in Bombay {{for the period}} 1982 - 87 and estimates of the efficacy of oral poliovaccine (OPV) calculated by the case exposure method, using two approaches. The first, a screening technique that used only data on the reported number of doses of vaccine administered and the immunization status of all poliomyelitis cases, appeared to underestimate the true vaccine efficacy. In the more rigorous second technique, which used data for children {{of the same age}} <b>group,</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>areas,</b> and study year, obtained from immunization coverage surveys, and information on the immunization status of poliomyelitis cases, the results indicate that the OPV vaccine efficacy for fully immunized children aged 12 - 23 months exceeded 90 %. These findings show that the estimated efficacy of OPV is high in Bombay and that, in general, vaccine efficacy should be re-estimated using more rigorous techniques if preliminary screening estimates indicate a lower than expected efficacy. In Bombay, poliomyelitis therefore results primarily from a failure to fully vaccinate all eligible children rather than as a result of vaccine failure. Furthermore, the age distribution of cases suggests that the strategy of focusing immunization activities on children aged under 1 year is epidemiologically correct...|$|R

Through consideration of these indicators, differences in health status of different social <b>groups</b> and different <b>geographical</b> <b>areas</b> can be shown in different periods and based on that, effective interventions can be designed. This study is carried out through a main workshop and expert panels and final consensus on selected indicators. The first draft of indicators and inequity stratifying variables were prepared and then revised by working groups consisting of experts inside and outside Health system. Finally ideas were accepted or rejected after presenting enough reasons and deep examination through the Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making (COMD) model. Fifty two indicators have been determined as health equity indicators in five areas including health, social and human development, economic development, physical environment and infrastructure and governance. Furthermore, for each indicator the proper and practical stratifying variables of inequity were identified. By calculating such indicators, it becomes possible to determine differences in health status of different social <b>groups</b> and different <b>geographical</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Large {{cities are}} often claimed to display more {{distinct}} geographical and socioeconomic health inequalities than other areas due to increasing residential differentiation. Our {{aim was to}} assess whether geographical inequalities in mortality within the capital (City of Helsinki) both exceeded that in other types of <b>geographical</b> <b>areas</b> in Finland, and whether those differences were dependent on socioeconomic inequalities. Methods We analysed the inequality of distribution separately for overall, ischemic heart disease and alcohol-related mortality, and mortality amenable (AM) to health care interventions in 1992 – 2008 in three types of <b>geographical</b> <b>areas</b> in Finland: City of Helsinki, other large cities, and small towns and rural areas. Mortality data were acquired as secondary data from the Causes of Death statistics from Statistics Finland. The assessment of changing geographical differences over time, that is geographical inequalities, was performed using Gini coefficients. As some of these differences might arise from socioeconomic factors, we assessed socioeconomic differences with concentration indices in parallel {{to an analysis of}} geographical differences. To conclude the analysis, we compared the changes over time of these inequalities between the three <b>geographical</b> <b>areas.</b> Results While mortality rates mainly decreased, alcohol-related mortality in the lowest income quintile increased. Statistically significant differences over time were found in all mortality <b>groups,</b> varying between <b>geographical</b> <b>areas.</b> Socioeconomic differences existed in all mortality <b>groups</b> and <b>geographical</b> <b>areas.</b> In the study period, geographical differences in mortality remained relatively stable but income differences increased substantially. For instance, the values of concentration indices for AM changed by 54  % in men (p[*]<[*] 0. 027) and by 62  % in women (p[*]<[*] 0. 016). Only slight differences existed in the time trends of Gini or in the concentration indices between the <b>geographical</b> <b>areas.</b> Conclusions No <b>geographical</b> or income-related differences in the distribution of mortality existed between Helsinki and other urban or rural areas of Finland. This suggests that the effect of increasing residential differentiation in the capital may have been mitigated by the policies of positive discrimination and social mixing. One of the main reasons for the increase in health inequalities was growth of alcohol-related mortality, especially among those with the lowest incomes...|$|R

Joint replacement of the hip (THR) and knee (TKR) are common elective procedures making a substantial contribution to public health; hence are important equity indicators. The aim of this thesis is to develop a methodology whereby routine data sources can be used to provide local health planners with small area estimates of need and provision for THR and TKR. These estimates are then combined together in a single statistical model to explore equity in access to care. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Cigarette {{consumption}} {{has increased}} steadily throughout this century in Italy. There were marked increases in three periods: in the 1920 s, in the 1950 s possibly {{due to the}} spread of smoking among young men, and in the 1970 s in part due to smoking among women. The average number of cigarettes per adult per day sold legally in 1980 was 6. 9 but, taking smuggling into account, the actual average number of cigarettes smoked per day is likely to range between eight and nine. Data from a national sample-based survey conducted in 1980 showed that smoking prevalence in men was broadly similar within age <b>groups,</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>area,</b> education, and socioeconomic groups. Smoking in women, on the other hand, was concentrated in younger and more educated women living in larger towns and in richer areas of the country. This pattern is typical of a recent rapid spread of smoking among women. The average tar yield of Italian cigarettes in 1983 - 4 was about 17 mg. Tar yield was strongly and negatively correlated with price (r = - 0. 55). This abnormality should be urgently reversed by government intervention. No material increase in lung cancer mortality in young women was evident up to the lat 1970 s. Lung cancer death rates in men correlated closely with the observed changes in cigarette consumption. The highest mortality rates (about 7, 20, and 50 / 100 000 respectively in the age groups 35 - 39, 40 - 44, and 45 - 49) were reached by the generation born around 1927 - 30, and the rates have remained fairly constant around these maximum levels for those born up to 1940.
