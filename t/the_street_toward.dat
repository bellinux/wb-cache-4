5|$|At 3:55am on December 9, 1981, in Philadelphia, {{close to}} the {{intersection}} at 13th and Locust streets, Philadelphia Police Department officer Daniel Faulkner conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle belonging to and driven by William Cook, Abu-Jamal's younger brother. Faulkner and Cook became engaged in a physical confrontation. During the traffic stop, Abu-Jamal who was driving his cab in the vicinity, observed the altercation, parked, and ran across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> Cook's car. Faulkner was shot from behind and in the face. He shot Abu-Jamal in the stomach. Faulkner died at the scene from the gunshot to his head.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented four {{witnesses to}} the court. Robert Chobert, a cab driver who testified he was parked behind Faulkner, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter. Cynthia White, a prostitute, testified that Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner. Michael Scanlan, a motorist, testified that from two car lengths away, he saw a man, matching Abu-Jamal's description, run {{across the street from}} a parking lot and shoot Faulkner. Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who did not see the shooting, testified to seeing Faulkner pull over Cook's car. As Abu-Jamal started to cross <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> them, Magilton turned away and lost sight of what happened next.|$|E
500|$|After the gunshots ended, Altgens saw several {{armed men}} {{running up the}} grassy slope between Elm Street and the {{railroad}} tracks; he crossed <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> the activity {{to see if he}} could get a picture of anyone being arrested. When they came back without a suspect, Altgens hurried back to the AP wirephoto office in the Dallas Morning News building on Houston Street to file his report and have the film developed. He telephoned the news office, leading to one of the first news bulletins of the shooting: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 170 {{travelers}} {{passed the}} gates in safety and marched down the green marble pavement of <b>the</b> wide <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> royal palace.|$|R
60|$|Summoning her maid and chauffeur, she issued {{instructions}} rapidly. Ten {{minutes later}} she was being whisked through <b>the</b> crowded <b>streets</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> railway station.|$|R
60|$|One mild winter day, as {{he walked}} along <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Academy, which stood upon a small eminence, {{surrounded}} by native growth--some venerable in its appearance, others young and prosperous--all seemed inviting, {{and seemed to be}} the very place for learning as well as for genius to spend its research beneath its spreading shades. He entered its classic walls in the usual mode of southern manners.|$|R
500|$|The [...] route begins running on-street at York Place, in {{the city}} centre. It turns into North St Andrew Street, crosses St Andrew Square. From the square, it heads {{southeast}} into Princes Street, and west along <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> Haymarket, via Shandwick Place, Atholl Place and West Maitland Street At Haymarket, the route heads onto a segregated track parallel to the Glasgow to Edinburgh mainline. It follows the railway line west for about , to Edinburgh Park railway station. There, it leaves the railway line on a segregated track and heads north to Gogar Roundabout from where it heads northwest via Ingliston Park and Ride to Edinburgh Airport, where it terminates.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} were diligent {{in ensuring}} the boys' security. O'Mahoney explained: [...] "They were under very strict security rules {{when they were}} filming. They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing {{that there could be a}} secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if they see me with a camera they will take me to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{rang the}} bell once--waited till he had passed the window--and then looked after Tom. There was my jewel of a boy on the {{opposite}} side of the street, just setting his top going in the most playful manner possible. Mr. Davager walked away up <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> the market-place. Tom whipped his top up <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> the market-place, too.|$|E
60|$|We {{shall have}} good company, too, in our walk; for here comes Campbell fresh from his morning's swim, {{swinging}} up <b>the</b> silent <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> Frank Headley's lodging.|$|R
60|$|Both men {{turned toward}} the village, where a jabbering mob of half-caste Japanese had {{suddenly}} appeared in <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> hurrying <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> hut of Oda Yorimoto.|$|R
60|$|A moment later, Louis and I {{were driving}} through <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>toward</b> my hotel. It was already light, and {{we passed a}} great train of market wagons {{coming in from the}} country. Along the Boulevard, into which we turned, was {{sprinkled}} a curious medley of wastrels of the night, and men and women on their way to work. It had been raining a little time before, but as we turned to descend the hill a weak sunshine flickered out from behind the clouds.|$|R
60|$|Jolnes and I {{went out}} and up <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> the corner, where we were to catch a surface car.|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned up}} <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> the high {{hill to the}} south, and she kept step with him. As she did not speak, he asked: [...] "What did you expect to do out here?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{broke off}} suddenly, and, {{wringing}} my hand, he vaulted into the saddle. He growled at his pack-pony, and drove {{him out of}} the corral. Then he set off at a steady trot down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> the open country.|$|E
60|$|When {{the gates}} had been once more secured the {{self-confidence}} of the savages returned, and as Tarzan walked up <b>the</b> village <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> chief's hut {{he was surrounded}} by a host of curious men, women, and children.|$|R
60|$|But now he heard, outside, {{the sounds}} of many voices, and long mournful howls, and mighty wailing. He was startled. Had he {{remained}} too long? Quickly he reached the doorway and peered down <b>the</b> village <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> village gate.|$|R
60|$|On this night, {{after the}} usual meal at the Carabine d'Or, he strolled with his {{companion}} down <b>the</b> dim old <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|R
60|$|As {{we stood}} on deck, {{regardless}} {{of the possibility that}} some of the enemy might come that way, a man ran down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> the water's edge, waving his arms about and otherwise acting as if nearly beside himself with joy or grief.|$|E
60|$|Dora {{thought this}} a good opinion, {{but before she could}} say {{anything}} on the subject, she lifted her eyes, and beheld Ralph Haverley walking down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> them. He was striding along at a fine pace, and looked as if he enjoyed it.|$|E
60|$|He {{went out}} and glanced down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> {{the center of the}} town. He did not see any one he could take for the innkeeper's assailant. Then he looked up the street, and he saw the young fellow about a block away, hurrying along and gazing back.|$|E
60|$|Half {{a minute}} later several men rushed out on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> post office building. Ralph mingled with the crowd. It {{was not long before}} {{the truth of the matter}} was revealed. The post office safe had been blown open and robbed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{me out of}} here!" [...] she besought Kells, and he led her out instantly. They {{went through}} the gambling-hall and into <b>the</b> crowded <b>street,</b> back <b>toward</b> camp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{much of a}} haul, but a {{good deal}} better than nothing," [...] he chuckled to himself, and {{disappeared}} down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> which led <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ferries.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Bushrod, {{aided by}} his hickory stick, impeded by his rheumatism, hurried down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> the {{railroad}} station, {{where the two}} lines touching Weymouthville met. As he had expected and feared, he saw there Mr. Robert, standing {{in the shadow of}} the building, waiting for the train. He held the satchel in his hand.|$|E
60|$|He dashed down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> a {{group of}} people who, he could see in the moonlight, were engaged in a sharp struggle. One man was {{defending}} himself against four, and the oaths and exclamations of these showed that they were Mexicans. Just as he reached them the man they were attacking was struck down, and two of his assailants threw themselves upon him.|$|E
60|$|He was {{thinking}} over these matters one morning when, to his surprise, he saw Brand crossing <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> him. They had not met since {{the evening of}} their encounter with Davies at the Grange, and Harding was sensible of some constraint. Brand was a reserved man whom he had neither understood nor liked, but he had thought him honorable until he learned the price he had demanded for helping Mowbray.|$|E
60|$|At {{twenty minutes}} past six the church bells were ringing {{for the evening}} service, and soon the {{congregation}} was streaming along Orchard <b>Street</b> in <b>the</b> mellow sunset. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> opened <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west. The red half-sunken sun shed a solemn splendour on the everyday houses, and crimsoned the windows of Dempster's projecting upper storey.|$|R
60|$|Horse, camel, and {{elephant}} trod helpless {{women and}} children beneath their feet. A common soldier dragged a general from his mount, and, leaping to the animal's back, fled down <b>the</b> packed <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west. A woman seized a gun and brained a court dignitary, whose horse had trampled her child to death. Shrieks, curses, commands, supplications filled the air. It was a frightful scene--one that will be burned upon my memory forever.|$|R
60|$|It {{was three}} or four months later when Ida was carried swiftly westward through <b>the</b> London <b>streets</b> <b>toward</b> twelve o'clock one night. The motor purred and clicked smoothly, {{slinging}} bright beams of light in front of it as it twisted eel-like through the traffic. The glass that would have sheltered Ida from the cool night breeze was down, but she scarcely noticed the roar of the city or the presence of Arabella and Mrs. Kinnaird.|$|R
6000|$|Lane walked thoughtfully down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> Doctor Bronson's office. As long as {{he walked}} slowly he managed not to give any hint of his weakness. The sun was shining with steely {{brightness}} and the March wind was living up to its fame. He longed for summer and hot days in quiet woods or fields where daisies bloomed. Would he {{live to see the}} Indian summer days, the smoky haze, the purple asters? ...|$|E
6000|$|Hanscom {{was now in}} {{the grasp}} of {{conflicting}} emotions. In spite of Brinkley's refusal to interfere, he could not deny a definite feeling of pleasure {{in the fact that}} Helen was returning and {{that he was about to}} see her again. [...] "Anyhow, I have another opportunity to serve her," [...] he thought, as he turned down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> the station. [...] "Perhaps after the verdict she will not feel so eager to leave the country." ...|$|E
6000|$|That evening, as I was {{standing}} on the hotel porch, my attention was attracted to a man mounted on a spirited gray horse, riding up <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> the hotel. There was something so noble in the proud arch of this horse's neck, something so powerful in the fling of his hooves that I exclaimed to the landlord, [...] "There is the kind of saddle-horse I am looking for! I wonder if by any chance he is for sale?" ...|$|E
60|$|The ape-man {{threw the}} body across {{one of his}} broad {{shoulders}} and, gathering up the fellow's gun, trotted silently up <b>the</b> sleeping village <b>street</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> tree that gave him such easy ingress to the palisaded village. He bore the dead sentry into {{the midst of the}} leafy maze above.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{postcard}} of {{a street}} view in Sendai. Buildings line both sides of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> that extends {{through the center of}} the photo. Power lines and poles are on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in front of the buildings. A large group of people are on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in front of the buildings on the left. One person is on the right side of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> walking <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> left. A pull cart is parked in front of a building in the bottom right corner of the photo...|$|R
60|$|Eventually {{they entered}} the town, which was all alight, but deserted; only the women and {{children}} remained, and they were off <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Straight <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> jail the criminal held his way. Straight up to the main entrance he walked, laid his hand upon the knob of the heavy iron door, pushed it open without command, entered and found himself {{in the presence of a}} half-dozen armed men. Then he turned. Nobody else entered.|$|R
