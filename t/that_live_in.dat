5|$|A few {{bacteria}} have {{chemical systems}} that generate light. This bioluminescence often occurs in bacteria <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> association with fish, {{and the light}} probably serves to attract fish or other large animals.|$|E
5|$|Smilodon {{and other}} saber-toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored coats and with spotted {{patterns}} (which {{appears to be}} the ancestral condition for feliforms), both of which are considered possible. Studies of modern cat species have found that species <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the open tend to have uniform coats while those <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> more vegetated habitats have more markings, with some exceptions. Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{as a whole}} exhibit {{varying levels}} of fluency in the Khmer and Vietnamese languages. Vietnamese <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> {{self-contained}} fishing communities along the Tonle Sap use Vietnamese in their day-to-day conversations and have individuals that have limited Khmer language skills {{and those that are}} bilingual in both languages. On the other hand, Vietnamese <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> predominantly Khmer-speaking neighbourhoods send their children to public schools, and as a result the children are able to speak Khmer fluently but show very limited understanding of Vietnamese.|$|E

5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is common}} and {{widespread}} among beetle families, {{especially those that}} feed on wood or vegetation, such as leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae, which are often green) and weevils. In some species, sculpturing or various coloured scales or hairs cause beetles such as the avocado weevil Heilipus apiatus to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many beetles <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> sandy environments {{blend in with the}} coloration of that substrate.|$|E
5|$|Feral {{horses are}} born {{and live in}} the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist {{throughout}} the world. Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses, as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> domesticated conditions.|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{is caused}} by a number of human activities. Marine mammals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> coastal environments {{are most likely to be}} affected by habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{aquarium}} {{stated that it}} takes no official position on the controversy of captive killer whales or other cetaceans. The aquarium was not constructed to house cetaceans, instead utilizing the 27 species of marine mammals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> or travel through Monterey Bay {{as one of its}} exhibits by offering the opportunity to see wild marine mammals from decks that overlook the bay.|$|E
5|$|In 2154, {{humans have}} {{depleted}} Earth's natural resources, {{leading to a}} severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — unobtanium — on Pandora, a densely forested habitable moon orbiting the gas giant Polyphemus in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, a species of , blue-skinned, sapient humanoids <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> harmony with nature and worship a mother goddess named Eywa.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red {{because of the}} haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|The greater noctule bat also {{interacts with}} parasites <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> {{the trees that}} they roost in and {{transfer}} themselves to the bats while they are sleeping. The greater noctule bat also interacts with the few nocturnal flying predators in its area, mainly owls that are {{much larger than the}} bat. Evidence of greater noctule bat bones have been found in owl pellets.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{voracious}} predators, eating most {{living things}} that are smaller than they are. Their staple diet is mostly bloodworms and other insect larvae, but they also feed on tadpoles and small fish. A few species, especially those <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> temporary waters, are likely to leave water. Nymphs of Cordulegaster bidentata sometimes hunt small arthropods {{on the ground at}} night.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} large {{herbivore}} is the black-tailed deer, a subspecies of the mule deer. Elk and moose are less common. Mountain goats are well-adapted to steep terrain and cold temperatures, {{and are not}} usually found at lower elevations. There are eight species of bats <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the North Cascades.|$|E
5|$|The only {{primates}} <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Canada are humans. The species {{originated in}} east Africa and is unrelated to South American primates. Humans {{first arrived in}} large numbers to Canada around 15,000 years ago from North Asia, and surged in migration starting 400 years ago from around the world, especially from Europe.|$|E
5|$|Transparency is common, even dominant, {{in animals}} {{of the open}} sea, {{especially}} those <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> relatively shallow waters. It is found in plankton of many species, as well as larger animals such as jellyfish, salps (floating tunicates), and comb jellies.|$|E

5|$|Woodpeckers {{are part}} of the family Picidae, a group of near-passerine birds that also consist of piculets, wrynecks, and sapsuckers. Members of this family are found worldwide, except for Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, Madagascar, and the extreme polar regions. Most species live in forests or {{woodland}} habitats, although a few species are known <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> treeless areas, such as rocky hillsides and deserts, and the Gila woodpecker specialises in exploiting cacti.|$|E
5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the forest and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species {{are present in the}} forest, with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E
5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species. One species—the North Atlantic right whale—is Endangered {{with only}} around 400(±50) {{individuals}} left, and four more are also classified as Endangered (North Pacific right whale, the blue whale, the fin whale, and the Sei whale), and another 5 ranked as Data deficient (Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, Omura's whale, Southern minke whale, and pygmy right whale). Species <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> polar habitats {{are vulnerable to}} the effects of ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice, as well as ocean acidification.|$|E
