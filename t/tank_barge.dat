50|$|The North Cape Oil Spill {{occurred}} on January 18, 1996 when the <b>tank</b> <b>barge</b> North Cape and the tug Scandia grounded on Moonstone Beach in South Kingstown, Rhode Island after the tug caught fire in its engine room during a winter storm. An estimated 851,928,000 gallons of home heating oil was spilled. Oil spread throughout {{a large area}} of Block Island Sound, including Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge, resulting in the closure of a 250 sq mi area of the sound for fishing.|$|E
50|$|The {{residual}} passenger {{service on}} the Forest section of the Severn and Wye Railway was from Lydney Town to Berkeley Road, crossing the River Severn. On the night of 25 October 1960 an oil <b>tank</b> <b>barge</b> collided with a pier of the Severn Bridge causing a partial collapse of the bridge, and suspension of the train service over it. At first {{this was to be}} temporary, but in fact the closure of the passenger {{service on the}} Lydney side of the river became permanent.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} probabilities of vessel safety and {{pollution}} inspections {{by type of}} vessel by the U. S. Coast Guard based upon individual vessel inspections for the years 1992 - 2001. Probit estimates of vessel safety (versus pollution) inspection equations suggest that fishing, passenger, recreation and tug boats are less (more) likely to be inspected for safety (pollution), whereas <b>tank</b> <b>barges</b> and U. S. flag vessels are more (less) likely to be inspected for safety (pollution). Also, vessel safety and pollution inspection probabilities by vessel type vary by Coast Guard district and time. The probability of a U. S. flag vessel being inspected for safety has increased over the time period of the study. The results bring into question {{the effectiveness of the}} Coast Guard in reducing the oil-spill pollution of <b>tank</b> <b>barges</b> and improving the safety of fishing boats. 1 I...|$|R
50|$|However, with Gamajet tank {{cleaning}} machines, {{confined space}} entry is greatly reduced eliminating danger to workers. Manual tank cleaning is dangerous {{in a number}} of ways. While <b>tank</b> <b>barges</b> can be cleaned in port, shipboard tanks are generally cleaned at sea. This is largely due to risks of fire and explosion inside the tanks.|$|R
50|$|On Sunday April 27, 2003, the <b>Tank</b> <b>Barge</b> Bouchard No. 120 struck rocks {{south of}} Westport, Massachusetts. This {{resulted}} in a puncture of the barge's hull about twelve feet in length. As a result, the cargo of the barge, number 6 fuel oil, spilled into the waters of Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. While the spill was much smaller than many oil spills, the environmental impacts were felt for years. Estimates of the total amount spilled range from 22,000 to 98,000 gallons of oil according to a publication by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{ships are}} {{launched}} using {{a series of}} inflated tubes underneath the hull, which deflate to cause a downward slope into the water. This procedure has the advantages of requiring less permanent infrastructure, risk, and cost. The airbags provide support to the hull {{of the ship and}} aid its launching motion into the water, thus this method is arguably safer than other options such as sideways launching. These airbags are usually cylindrical in shape with hemispherical heads at both ends.The Xiao Qinghe shipyard launched a <b>tank</b> <b>barge</b> with marine airbags on January 20, 1981, the first known use of marine airbags.|$|E
50|$|As {{the crisis}} subsided, Abiqua was {{returned}} to the Maritime Administration and struck from the Navy list on 30 September 1957. Following her deactivation, Abiqua returned to the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Co., Mobile, Ala. The afterpart of Abiqua was joined to the forepart of SS Windsor (formerly Bear Paw) to form a dry cargo ship which retained the name Abiqua. The old forepart of Abiqua was joined to the afterpart of Windsor to form a storage vessel which was renamed Bear Paw. The bow and midbody from Abiqua were towed to the Bethlehem Steel Co., at Beaumont, Tex., and converted into a <b>tank</b> <b>barge,</b> which was renamed Tide Mar XIX.|$|E
25|$|The first ocean-going oil-tank steamer, the Vaderland, was {{designed}} and built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company of the United Kingdom for the American-Belgian Red Star Line in 1873, although the vessel's use was soon curtailed by the authorities citing safety concerns. By 1871, the Pennsylvania oil fields were making limited use of oil <b>tank</b> <b>barges</b> and cylindrical railroad tank-cars {{similar to those in}} use today.|$|R

50|$|The only {{completely}} new hardware development {{to be required}} for the HLV was the side-mounted carrier. All other components used on the HLV were previously in use with the Space Shuttle. According to John Shannon's proposal the first several flights (up to 6 flights) of the vehicle would have reused spare parts of the retired Space Shuttle fleet and salvaged functioning hardware from the orbiters, including existing avionics modules, the Flight Software and the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) (Block I flights). Virtually no change to the existing Space Shuttle infrastructure, from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the External <b>Tank</b> <b>barge</b> to the launch pads was to be required.|$|E

The [...] "jumbo" [...] <b>tank</b> <b>barge</b> of 195 ft. by 35 ft. became the industry standard. Ashland was growing from a small Eastern Kentucky refinery into a Forbes 500 company by relying on barges to bring in crude oil and deliver refined products to independent marketers. In the process, Ashland soon operated the nation's largest inland towing fleet and in 1953 the Port of Huntington-Tristate exceeded Pittsburgh as the busiest port on the Ohio River.|$|E
5000|$|On 15 January 2006 Valour began {{a voyage}} from Delaware to Texas pushing the fully loaded, [...] <b>tank</b> <b>barge</b> M 192. Prior to {{departure}} the tug's fuel, potable water and wash water tanks were topped off. All of the ballast tanks were empty. At 11:30 on the 17th, {{in anticipation of}} heavy weather, the captain ordered that the tug {{be taken out of}} the notch and transitioned into towing the barge astern. By 15:00 (3pm) that afternoon, with Valour making 7 kn on a course of 200-225° true, and the wind having increased to 25 - 35 kn from the SSW with 5 - 7 ft seas, the chief mate noticed that a slight port list had developed.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{determinants}} {{of the oil}} spillage, vessel damage, and other-property damage costs of U. S. inland waterway <b>tank</b> <b>barge</b> accidents and their relationships. The tobit estimation of a three-equation recursive model suggests that type of accident, cause of accident, operating conditions, vessel characteristics, and regulation are determinants. Collision accidents incur the largest oil spillage and vessel damage costs, whereas fire/explosion accidents incur the largest other-property damage costs. A dollar of vessel damage cost increases other-property damage cost by $ 0. 51, whereas a dollar of oil spillage increases this cost by $ 9. 13. An important result for formulating <b>tank</b> <b>barge</b> accident cost-reduction policies is that a given determinant might cause an increase in one damage cost but reduce another.

40|$|A {{recent case}} in the Court of Federal Claims was the first test by owners of oil tankers and <b>tank</b> <b>barges</b> of section 4115 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90), {{otherwise}} known as the vessel construction requirement. The Court held that Maritrans, Inc., owners of thirty-seven <b>tank</b> <b>barges</b> affected by the Act 2 ̆ 7 s double hull requirement, was premature in claiming that the requirement exacted a regulatory taking of their property. The court used a standard of review that deviated in part from U. S. Supreme Court takings guidelines and instead followed a more conservative script dictated by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal District. This Note will first provide a historical foundation by analyzing the background, statutory content, and intended effect of OPA 90, {{as well as a}} short summary of the evolution of takings decisions in both the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit courts. Following that discussion will be a consideration of the Maritrans opinion itself. This Note concludes with a discussion of the peculiar tailoring of the court 2 ̆ 7 s analysis and the effect this opinion may have on both vessel owners and triers of fact in future considerations of OPA 90. This Note will also examine an alternative test of regulatory takings that may have provided guidance for the Maritrans court in reaching its conclusion that OPA 90 did not exact a taking of vessels out of compliance with the Act 2 ̆ 7 s construction requirement...|$|R
