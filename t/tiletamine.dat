After administration of 1.0 (mg/kg sc) MK-801 to rats, these neurotoxic changes became more apparent until about 12 hours post-dose, but the morphology of most cells appeared normal by light microscope about 24 hours post-dose. With 10 (mg/kg sc) doses of MK-801, the vacuolation reaction was still visible by light microscope 48 hours post-dose.

50|$|Levomethadone is a μ-opioid {{receptor}} agonist with higher intrinsic activity than morphine, but lower affinity. Dextromethadone {{does not affect}} opioid receptors but binds to the glutamatergic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, and thus acts as a receptor antagonist against glutamate. Methadone {{has been shown to}} reduce neuropathic pain in rat models, primarily through NMDA antagonism. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. NMDA receptors have a very important role in modulating long-term excitation and memory formation. NMDA antagonists such as dextromethorphan (DXM), ketamine (a dissociative anaesthetic, also M.O.A+.), <b>tiletamine</b> (a veterinary anaesthetic) and ibogaine (from the African tree Tabernanthe iboga, also M.O.A+.) are being studied for their role in decreasing the development of tolerance to opioids and as possible for eliminating addiction/tolerance/withdrawal, possibly by disrupting memory circuitry. Acting as an NMDA antagonist may be one mechanism by which methadone decreases craving for opioids and tolerance, and has been proposed as a possible mechanism for its distinguished efficacy regarding the treatment of neuropathic pain. The dextrorotary form (d-methadone) acts as an NMDA antagonist and is devoid of opioid activity: it has been shown to produce analgesia in experimental models of chronic pain. Methadone also acted as a potent, noncompetitive α3β4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist in rat receptors, expressed in human embryonic kidney cell lines.|$|E

40|$|The {{anatomy and}} {{physiology}} of reptiles and mammals are in many ways different, and will therefore possibly complicate anesthetic administration. Lizards are ectothermic and one {{should keep in mind}} that a decrease in the lizard’s environmental temperature may result in reductions in anesthetic metabolism. Respiratory depression is a profound problem because lizards lack a diaphragm, making inhalation and expiration completely active processes. This, in combination with cardiac shunting and breath holding makes the effects of anesthesia unpredictable. Since lizards have a renal-portal-system, anesthetics injected in the caudal half of the body may be eliminated at a different speed than if injected elsewhere. Premedication may be used to facilitate handling, injection and to reduce stress and high usage of anesthetics. Inhalant anesthetics are safe to use and provides easily controlled depth and duration. Isoflurane is commonly used and has a rapid induction and recovery period but may cause decreased blood pressure and suppress spontaneous ventilation. Sevoflurane gives an even faster induction than isoflurane. Inhalant anesthetics in general have short duration, does not give adequate analgesia or depth, and require constant maintenance. Injectable anesthetics often have long duration and thus give longer recovery in comparison to inhalant anesthetics. Most commonly used are ketamine, propofol and <b>tiletamine</b> together with zolazepam. Ketamine in lower doses are tranquillizing, while higher doses achieve surgical anesthesia. However it provides no analgesia, depth of anesthesia is difficult to evaluate and high doses often cause prolonged recovery. <b>Tiletamine</b> and zolazepam together gives anesthesia, analgesia and muscle relaxation. The duration is longer than with ketamine and entail longer recovery, nevertheless <b>tiletamine</b> with zolazepam is recommended when treating larger animals since smaller volumes are required in comparison to ketamine. Propofol can be used to provide induction or maintenance of anesthesia. Recovery is fast and organ toxicity is minimal. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Chemical {{immobilization}} of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) {{has previously}} been, {{for the most}} part, problematic {{and this has been}} mainly attributed to the type of immobilizing agent used.

We investigated the use of the intravenous administration of a 1 : 1 mixture of <b>tiletamine</b> and zolazepam (Telazol ®) to immobilize adult females at different points during a physiologically demanding 5 – 6 week lactation period. We also compared performance between IV and IM injection of the same mixture. Results The tiletamine:zolazepam mixture administered intravenously was an effective method for immobilization with no fatalities or pronounced apnoeas in 106 procedures; however, there was a 25 % (one animal in four) mortality rate with intramuscular administration. Induction time was slightly longer for females at the end of lactation (54. 9 ± 2. 3 seconds) than at post-parturition (48. 2 ± 2. 9 seconds). In addition, the number of previous captures had a positive effect on induction time. There was no evidence for effects due to age, condition (total body lipid), stage of lactation or number of captures on recovery time. Conclusion We suggest that intravenous administration of <b>tiletamine</b> and zolazepam is an effective and safe immobilizing agent for female Weddell seals. Although individual traits could not explain variation in recovery time, we suggest careful monitoring of recovery times during longitudinal studies (> 2 captures).

The vascular resistance index was calculated based on the mean values of systolic and diastolic flow of each vasses. An average value for the MAP of 144. 9 ± 26. 68 mmHg and a flow of 14. 28 ± 41. 3 cm/sec for the external ophthalmic artery in the right eye in systole, 23. 95 ± 11. 46 cm/sec in diastole and 42. 75 ± 12. 64 cm/sec in the left eye in systole, 25. 45 ± 9. 61 cm/sec in diastole, were verified, there being no significant difference between the eyes. The calculated index of vascular resistance was of 0. 4175 ± 0. 0774 for the external ophthalmic artery in the right eye and 0, 4015 ± 0. 0719 for the left eye, without any significant difference between the eyes.

40|$|Southern {{elephant}} seals (Mirounga leonina) {{were caught}} {{as part of}} a long-term demographic study on Macquarie Island. Over 18 months, 1033 seals were caught by hand and anaesthetised intravenously with a 1 : 1 mixture of <b>tiletamine</b> and zolazepam. Assessments were made of the effects of variations in the body condition and age at capture of the seals on the characteristics of their anaesthesia, including induction time and weighted recovery time. The size and condition of the seals were assessed by morphometric and ultrasound measurements. Weighted recovery times decreased as the body condition and age of the seals increased, but there were no residual effects of sex. There were no fatalities, and no periods of apnoea longer than five minutes were recorded. In individual seals there was a significant increase in weighted recovery time with successive captures. I.

40|$|Forty seven free-ranging, adult, male koalas were {{captured}} and administered an intramuscular injection of the dissociative anaesthetic, Telazol® (<b>tiletamine</b> HCI plus zolazepam HCI), at dose rates of 5. 0 to 7. 7 mg/kg body weight. Anaesthesia induction was rapid and smooth {{and resulted in}} a surgical plane of anaesthesia lasting 30 to 45 min. There was no depression of heart rate or respiration. Mild salivation occurred in most animals, but {{was not a problem}} because the swallowing reflex was retained. There was no mortality or morbidity and the anaesthesia level was sufficient to allow electroejaculation and multiple blood sampling with no apparent animal discomfort. For 10 of 19 males in which anaesthesia was required for a 90 min protocol, a supplementary Telazol injection (average, 2. 5 mg/kg) was necessary. All koalas recovered completely within 3 to 4 h of the initial injection. The results suggest that the optimal Telazol dosage for the adult male koala is 7. 0 mg/kg body weight. The retrospective analysis of 259 anaesthesia records involving 14 species indicated that Telazol was equally effective and safe in other captive marsupials...|$|E
