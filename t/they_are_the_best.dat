Designed by Daniel Robertson, it contains two quite ornate oriels placed asymmetrically, one is of six lights, the other four. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> example of the pre-archaeological Gothic in Oxford. The large oriel on the first floor at the north end was once the drawing room window of the Principal of the Hall. Parts of the street wall incorporated into this range show traces of blocked windows dating from the same period of rebuilding in the 15th century as the present-day staircase ten.|$|E

25|$|The Uí Liatháin dynasty were western {{neighbors of}} the proto-Déisi Muman along the {{southern}} Irish coast and raided and colonized parts western Britain. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> characterized of the South Irish colonists because of clear references to them by name in both early Irish and early British sources, while a presence of the Déisi Muman cannot actually be confirmed. Also noted are the Laigin, particularly in North Wales.|$|E

However, there have been inaccuracies in the scoreboards provided by Zimbabwe Cricket and thus a question mark exists over Dadengwa's feat.|$|E
25|$|The {{method is}} a {{continuous}} process {{that begins with}} observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> <b>The</b> <b>best</b> hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.|$|E

The word “chinelos” {{is derived from}} the Nahuatl word zineloquie, which means “disguised.” Chinelos dancers wear masks imitating the fair skin and beards of the Spanish along with elaborate dress and gloves. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known Carnival dancers in Mexico with Morelos have the most groups.

It is even possible to hire Chinelos dancers for special occasions.|$|E
500|$|Gass has {{described}} Tenacious D's comic assertion that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> band as being [...] "ridiculous because it's {{a matter of}} opinion". Black characterizes Tenacious D's comic nature {{as an antidote to}} [...] "the masculinity of rock", adding [...] "There's also something funny about the macho-ness of rock.

[...] Russell Brand, All Shall Perish, The Lonely Island, and Kanye West have in turn been influenced by the work of Tenacious D.|$|E
500|$|The upper-case of Gill Sans {{is partly}} {{modelled}} on Roman capitals like those {{found on the}} Column of Trajan. Edward Johnston had written that, [...] "The Roman capitals have held the supreme place among letters for readableness and beauty. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> forms for the grandest and most important inscriptions." [...] While Gill Sans {{is not based on}} purely geometric principles to the extent of the geometric sans-serifs that had preceded it, some aspects of Gill Sans do have a geometric feel. The [...] "O" [...] is an almost perfect circle and the capital [...] "M" [...] is based on the proportions of a square with the middle strokes meeting at the centre; this was not inspired by Roman carving but is very similar to Johnston. But the influence of traditional serif letters is clear in the [...] "two-storey" [...] lower-case [...] "a" [...] and [...] "g", unlike that of Futura, and the [...] "t" [...] with its curve to bottom right and slanting cut at top left, unlike Futura's which is simply formed from two straight lines. The lower-case [...] "a" [...] also narrows strikingly towards the top of its loop, a common feature of serif designs but rarer in sans-serifs.|$|E

Spain is not a country with an F1 culture, {{and we had to}} fight alone, every step of the way, to make this happen. A huge thank-you should also go to the team as well– <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in Formula One, and we have done this together. It will say that I am world champion, but we are all champions– and they deserve this." [...] In the May 2007 issue of F1 Racing, Alonso said that the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix was his greatest race. He said, [...] "It was a dream come true and a very emotional day. In the last few laps I leaped, thinking I could hear noises from the engine- from everywhere!
