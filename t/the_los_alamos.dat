5|$|Graves was {{a pillar}} of <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> community. He was {{an active member of}} the non-denominational Protestant Community Church. With the {{encouragement}} of Elizabeth, who played the violin, he learned to play the cello, hoarding his petrol ration stamps so that he could travel to Santa Fe, New Mexico, for lessons. He played in <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Symphony, accompanying local performances of Gilbert and Sullivan and Handel's Messiah. He was chairman of the board of the local bank, and a member of the local school board.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory, {{also known}} as Project Y, was a secret {{laboratory}} established by the Manhattan Project and operated by the University of California during World War II. Its mission was to design and build the first atomic bombs. Robert Oppenheimer was its first director, from 1943 to December 1945, when he was succeeded by Norris Bradbury. For scientists freely to discuss their work while preserving security, the laboratory was located in a remote part of New Mexico. The wartime laboratory occupied buildings {{that had once been}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Ranch School.|$|E

5|$|X-10 {{supplied}} <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory {{with the}} first significant samples of plutonium. Studies of these by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos revealed that it contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240, which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. This meant that it would be highly likely that a plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. <b>The</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory was thus forced to turn its development efforts to creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon—a far more difficult feat.|$|E
5|$|Agnew and Beverly {{moved to}} <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory in March 1943. Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman {{first went to}} the University of Illinois, where the men {{disassembled}} the Cockcroft–Walton generator and particle accelerator while Beverly catalogued all the parts. The parts were shipped to New Mexico, where Agnew and Beverly met up with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory. There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, {{for the rest of}} the war. Agnew's job was to reassemble the accelerator, which was then used for experiments by John Manley's group.|$|E
5|$|From 1943 to 1946 {{he worked}} at <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> National Laboratory as a group leader for the Manhattan Project. He found in April 1944 that Thin Man, the {{proposed}} plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon, would not work {{because of the presence}} of plutonium-240 impurities.|$|E

5|$|Harold Melvin Agnew (March 28, 1921 – September 29, 2013) was an American physicist, {{best known}} for having flown as a {{scientific}} observer on the Hiroshima bombing mission and, later, as the third director of <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum-140 has a short {{half-life}} of some 41 hours, {{and is not}} {{a threat}} after a fairly short time. Other radioisotopes, present as impurities, have a long enough half-life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests; in 2002 <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> National Laboratory issued a warning to <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> county and the Forest Service performing thinning of trees in the area to not remove the trees cut {{in various parts of the}} Bayo Canyon due to possible content of residual radioactive materials. The worst affected zones are fenced off; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil, insects and trees in the surrounding areas. The neighbouring population was not informed about the tests until the mid-1990s, and Los Alamos refused to declassify the documentation.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{recruited}} McMillan to {{join the}} Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to create atomic bombs, in September 1942. Initially, he commuted {{back and forth between}} San Diego, where his family was, and Berkeley. In November he accompanied Oppenheimer on a trip to New Mexico on which <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Ranch School was selected as the site of the project's weapons research laboratory, which became <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory. With Oppenheimer and John H. Manley, he drew up the specifications for the new laboratory's technical buildings. He recruited personnel for the laboratory, including Richard Feynman and Robert R. Wilson, established the test area known as the Anchor Ranch, and scoured the country for technical equipment from machine tools to a cyclotron.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for the {{national}} laboratories passed to the newly created Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on January 1, 1947. That year, Lawrence asked for $15 million for his projects, which included a new linear accelerator and a new gigaelectronvolt synchrotron which {{became known as the}} bevatron. The University of California's contract to run <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> laboratory was due to expire on July 1, 1948, and some board members wished to divest the university of the responsibility for running a site outside California. After some negotiation, the university agreed to extend the contract for what was now <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> National Laboratory for four more years, and to appoint Norris Bradbury, who had replaced Oppenheimer as its director in October 1945, as a professor. Soon after, Lawrence received all the funds he had requested.|$|E
5|$|Seth Henry Neddermeyer (September 16, 1907– January 29, 1988) was an American {{physicist}} who co-discovered the muon, {{and later}} championed the Implosion-type nuclear weapon {{while working on}} the Manhattan Project at <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory during World War II.|$|E

5|$|After {{the rest}} of the mission departed, Peierls, Kurti and Fuchs {{remained}} in New York, where they worked with Kellex. They were joined there by Tony Skyrme and Frank Kearton, who arrived in March 1944. Kurti returned to England in April 1944 and Kearton in September. Peierls moved on to <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory in February 1944; Skyrme followed in July, and Fuchs in August.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{joined the}} Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in 1942, and {{helped build the}} Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor.

After the war ended, he {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where he completed his graduate work under Enrico Fermi.|$|E
5|$|By late 1944, rocket {{development}} and testing work began to taper off, and production models started {{to reach the}} Navy and USAAF in quantity. The director of the OSRD, Vannevar Bush saw an opportunity {{to use some of}} the expertise at Caltech on another secret wartime project he was involved with, the Manhattan Project. Bush arranged for Charles C. Lauritsen, the head of the rocket team at Caltech, to visit <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory, and meet with the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the laboratory director, Robert Oppenheimer, and senior scientists at <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> laboratory. Oppenheimer and Lauritsen knew each other well, as Oppenheimer had worked at Caltech before the war. In addition to its scientists, Caltech also possessed an experienced procurement team, headed by Trevor Gardner. This group worked closely with its counterpart at Los Alamos, which was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. Lockridge.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{restricted}} airspace {{immediately to the}} south of the runway, and the noise-sensitive residential area just west of <b>the</b> runway, <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Airport employs a non-standard traffic pattern. All takeoffs, regardless of wind conditions, are to the east on runway 9. All landings, regardless of wind, are to the west on runway 27. Unlike many airports, the orientation of <b>the</b> runway at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> was chosen due to geographic necessity rather than preferential wind alignment. Pilots will frequently encounter a gusty crosswind at this airfield, particularly in spring. This fact, combined with the rugged terrain off the east end of the runway, has given LAM a reputation for being a challenging airport at which to land.|$|R
