5|$|In the First World War, {{horses were}} used in combat for cavalry charges, and they {{remained}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>means</b> for moving scouts, messengers, supply wagons, ambulances, and artillery quickly on the battlefield; the horse could refuel itself to some extent by grazing, and could cope with terrain which was beyond machines of the time. However, this war had a devastating effect on the British horse population. As thousands of animals were drafted for the war effort, some breeds were so reduced in number {{that they were in}} danger of disappearing. Many breeds were saved by the dedicated efforts of a few breeders who formed breed societies, tracking down remaining animals and registering them.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} approach in ranking and selection procedures {{is to compare}} simulated systems based on the mean performance of a metric of interest. The system with the largest (or smallest) mean performance is deemed as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> system. However, <b>the</b> system with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>mean</b> performance may be an undesirable choice because of its large variance. Variance {{is a measure of}} risk. A highly variable system performance shows that the system is not under control. Both mean and variance of a performance metric need to be compared to determine <b>the</b> <b>best</b> system. We present a statistically valid selection procedure for comparing simulated systems based on a mean-variance dominance relationship. The system with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>mean</b> and smallest variance is deemed as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> system. If there is not a unique <b>best</b> system, <b>the</b> procedure identifies a set of nondominant systems. In both cases, a prespecified probability of correct selection is guaranteed. ...|$|R

5|$|The Ottoman force {{prepared}} to repel a landing {{on either side}} of the Straits was the 5th Army.

All agreed that the best defence was to hold the high ground on the ridges of the peninsula. There was disagreement as to where the enemy would land and hence where to concentrate forces.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{study the}} hemodynamic effects of exogenously {{administered}} endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), a peptide produced by endothelial cells with potent non-adrenergically mediated vasoconstrictor properties. METHODS A prospective drug intervention study {{was carried out}} in a resuscitation research laboratory. Fifteen mixed-breed dogs were anesthetized and instrumented for hemodynamic monitoring. Asphyxia arrest was produced by clamping the endotracheal tube. Hemodynamic data were collected continuously. Following loss of aortic fluctuations monitored by thoracic aortic catheter, the animals remained in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes of no-flow PEA, closed-chest CPR was begun and the animals were randomized to one of three treatment groups (EPI, 0. 02 mg/kg epinephrine IV every 3 minutes; ENDO, 100 micrograms ET- 1 IV at 0 minutes; and EPI/ENDO, a combination of the EPI and ENDO treatments). RESULTS ENDO and EPI alone produced similar coronary perfusion pressures (CPPs). The EPI/ENDO combination produced significantly improved CPP compared with that of either EPI or ENDO alone. In the EPI group, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>mean</b> CPP was 16 +/- 14 mm Hg and occurred 7 minutes after drug administration. In the ENDO group, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>mean</b> CPP was 28 +/- 7 mm Hg and occurred 13 minutes after drug administration. In the EPI/ENDO combination group, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>mean</b> CPP was 61 +/- 37 mm Hg and occurred 7 minutes after drug administration (p < 0. 05 compared with the EPI and ENDO groups alone). CONCLUSION ET- 1 is a potent vasoconstrictor. The combination of EPI and ENDO significantly improved CPP compared with that for either agent alone. ET- 1 should be investigated further as a vasoconstrictor in cardiac arrest...|$|R
5|$|Sometimes criminals {{were beaten}} with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han {{scholars}} argued that torture was not <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>means</b> of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session {{to decide how}} many strokes should be given and what size the stick should be {{so as not to}} cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han; common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included tattooing the face, cutting off the nose, castration, and amputation of one or both feet, yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by the first year of Emperor Jing's (r. 154141 BCE) reign which decreased the amount of strokes a prisoner could receive from the bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than false accusation and murder.|$|E
5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a major threat}} to Allied shipping, the British military sought to damage or destroy the battleship before she could re-enter service. Another midget submarine attack was considered impractical due to improvements to Kaafjord's defences, and the commander of the RAF's Bomber Command refused to attempt heavy bomber raids against the battleship as he believed that such operations were unlikely to be successful and would result in heavy casualties. As a result, the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers were considered <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>means</b> of attacking Kaafjord, and the Admiralty directed the fleet to begin planning such a raid in late 1943. Following several months of preparations the Home Fleet's first attack on Kaafjord, which was designated Operation Tungsten, was conducted on 3 April 1944 and involved five aircraft carriers. The two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters were not detected during their flights to Kaafjord, and the battleship was hit by 15 bombs. Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties, but the ship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, the damage inflicted on Tirpitzs superstructure, armament and engines was sufficient to put her out of service for several months while repairs were completed. The commander of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, placed a priority on returning the battleship to service so that she could continue to tie down Allied naval resources. He and other senior German officers recognised at this time that the threat of further air attacks meant that Tirpitz could no longer operate against Allied convoys.|$|E

Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection.

Defensive strategy {{was based on}} offensive tactics, {{what became known as}} the cult of the offensive. To prevent German formations from hitting targets in Britain, Bomber Command would destroy Luftwaffe aircraft on their bases, aircraft in their factories and fuel reserves by attacking oil plants. This philosophy proved impractical as Bomber Command lacked the technology and equipment necessary for mass night operations, resources having been diverted to Fighter Command in the mid-1930s and it took until 1943 to catch up. Dowding agreed air defence would require some offensive action and that fighters could not defend Britain alone. Until September 1939, the RAF lacked specialist night-fighting aircraft and relied on anti-aircraft units, which were poorly equipped and lacking in numbers.|$|E
