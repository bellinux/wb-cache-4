5|$|College {{football}} {{maintained a}} tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game {{would be associated with}} a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).|$|E
5|$|Due to Bowl Alliance (predecessor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series) rules, the Orange Bowl {{following}} the 1996 season was played on December 31, instead of January 1 or later. This {{marked the first}} time that an Orange Bowl was played prior to New Year's Day: there were two Orange Bowls in the same calendar year—one in January, {{following the}} 1995 season, and the other in December, following the 1996 season. The Orange Bowl Committee, which had the fourth and sixth selections of eligible Bowl Alliance teams, selected Big East champions Virginia Tech and Nebraska, an at-large selection that appeared to be a national championship game contender before its loss to Texas in the inaugural Big 12 Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Following the loss, Virginia Tech {{won five}} {{straight}} games {{to win the}} Coastal Division of the ACC, while Boston College stumbled, losing two games before defeating the Clemson Tigers to win the Atlantic Division and representation in the Championship Game. Most pre-game {{media coverage of the}} event cast the game as an opportunity for Virginia Tech to avenge its earlier loss. In addition, the winner of the game would be awarded an automatic bid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series 2008 Orange Bowl game in Miami, Florida on January 3, 2008. Despite Boston College's earlier win over Virginia Tech, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech by five points.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Independence Bowl, the game {{received}} as much or more coverage than the incipient national championship game due to the controversial status of Tech star Bruce Smith, who was embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA about his participation in the game. Spread bettors favored Air Force to win the game by four points. Ticket sales were slow in the {{weeks leading up}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl,</b> and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12,000 tickets. Tech representatives said they might have to return as many as 8,000 tickets due to the difficulty of selling tickets for a game more than 20 hours away by car.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 2011, {{the final}} Bowl Championship Series standings were {{unveiled}} with LSU ranked first, followed by Alabama, {{to set up}} a rematch between the two teams in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In the weeks that led up to the game, the notion of a split national championship became a major storyline. This was the case as the AP Poll is not tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series and some AP voters expressed they might vote LSU national champions even if they lost as they defeated Alabama in their regular season game. However, after Alabama shut out LSU 21–0 in the BCS National Championship Game, the AP voted them national champions to give the Crimson Tide the consensus national championship and thus avoid a split title with LSU.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 Emerald Bowl {{began with}} a 1:35p.m. PST kickoff time in SBC Park. Because the field had been {{converted}} from the baseball diamond typically used by the San Francisco Giants, both teams shared the same sideline during the game. Rainy conditions caused the field's natural grass surface to become muddier as the game progressed. Although 30,563 tickets were sold, an increase of 19 percent from the 2003 game, official in-stadium attendance was listed at 28,856, an increase of 28 percent over the previous year. Despite New Mexico's closer proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> site, Midshipmen fans comprised {{a large portion of}} the crowd; Navy directly sold 18,000 tickets prior to the game and was given credit for 22,000. The game aired live on ESPN2, with Eric Collins and Andre Ware serving as announcers. With a Nielsen rating of 2.04, the game was watched by over four million households, approximately 65 percent more viewers than the previous year.|$|E
50|$|In {{their fifth}} {{game of the}} season, the Bulls lost, 28-22 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowling</b> Green Falcons.|$|R
50|$|On March 9, 2010, <b>the</b> Yankee <b>bowl</b> {{official}} name was announced <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> Pinstripe <b>Bowl</b> with New Era Cap Company agreed <b>to</b> sponsor <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> {{for four years}} while ESPN agreed <b>to</b> broadcast <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> for six years.

25|$|Methods {{used to make}} up for the inadequacies of {{low flow}} toilets include using thinner toilet paper, plungers, and adding extra cups of water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> manually.|$|E
25|$|For many years, the {{national}} champion of various polls were selected prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> games. The national champion was selected before bowl games as follows: AP (1936–1964 and 1966–1967), Coaches' Poll (1950–1973), FWAA (1954), and NFF (1959–1970). In all other latter-day polls, champions were selected after bowl games.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} Harris Interactive Poll (2005–2013) was {{contracted}} by the BCS to help formulate its standings, and although its final ranking which occurs prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> games {{is listed in}} the official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records, it does not conduct a final poll or award or name a national champion on its own.|$|E

25|$|After the game, Stewart {{was rewarded}} by the WVU {{athletic}} department by being named the team's permanent head coach. He {{was given a}} new five-year contract. Stewart later signed former Mountaineer coaches, Steve Dunlap, David Lockwood, and Doc Holliday along with other assistant coaches. Steve Slaton, Johnny Dingle and Darius Reynaud, all who were key in the Mountaineers' success leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game, left early after the game for the 2008 NFL Draft.|$|E
25|$|Maryland {{finished}} as the nation's only untied, undefeated {{team that}} had played a ten-game schedule. The final wire service rankings, however, were released prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> games at the time. Therefore, Maryland held a final ranking as the number-three team in the nation, behind first-ranked Tennessee (10–1) and second-ranked Michigan State (9–0). To date, the 1951 Terrapins remain Maryland's only undefeated, untied team of the modern era.|$|E
25|$|In {{connection}} with the act of drinking the 'ava, when {{the recipient of the}} cup calls out Ia manuia the assembly reply – Ia manuia or Soifua, the latter word meaning 'may you live'. The act of throwing by the drinker of the remainder of the contents of the cup over his shoulder may have been an unspoken desire that all misfortune should likewise disappear as it is noted that unconsumed 'ava is never returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b>|$|E

25|$|It {{had been}} in place since the 1998 season. The BCS {{replaced}} the Bowl Alliance, in place from 1995 to 1997, which had followed the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Coalition's creation in 1992, the AP Poll's number one and two teams had met in a bowl game only 8 times in 56 seasons. The AP's top two teams met 13 out of the 16 seasons the BCS was in place.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{into the}} game, both teams had win-loss records of 8–4. After {{beginning}} their {{season with a}} 4–4 record, the Navy Midshipmen defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in triple overtime and became bowl eligible after defeating the North Texas Mean Green for their sixth win of the season. The Utah Utes began {{the season with a}} 1–3 record, but won seven straight games when quarterback Brian Johnson returned from an injury. After finishing with the third best record in the Mountain West Conference, they accepted their invitation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game.|$|E
25|$|On December 2, Michigan was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida against the South Carolina Gamecocks. This was the first meeting between the two schools since Michigan traveled to South Carolina in 1985, which Michigan won 34–3, and Michigan's first trip to the Outback Bowl since 2003, when Michigan defeated Florida 38–30. Junior starting fullback Stephen Hopkins left the team prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game after not regaining his starting role following recovery from a midseason injury, while J.T. Floyd, Brandin Hawthorne, and Will Hagerup were suspended for the game for a violation of team rules.|$|E

25|$|During a {{generally}} disappointing 1996 season, the Cavaliers upset the top ten–ranked Tar Heels at Scott Stadium. In the fourth quarter, North Carolina led Virginia 17–3 and, having advanced within the Cavaliers' five-yard line, {{were about to}} put the game away. However, Virginia cornerback Antwan Harris intercepted a Tar Heel pass {{in the end zone}} and returned it 100 yards for a touchdown. Quarterback Tim Sherman then led the Cavaliers to another ten points, capped by Rafael Garcia's late game field goal, and the defense shut down the demoralized Tar Heels for a stunning 20–17 comeback victory. The defeat cost North Carolina a bid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance; coach Mack Brown left UNC for Texas after another highly ranked Tar Heel team in 1997 also failed to receive a Bowl Alliance bid.|$|E
25|$|The College Football Playoff National Championship is a post-season college {{football}} bowl game, {{used to determine}} a national champion of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), which began play in the 2014 {{college football}} season. The game serves as {{the final of the}} College Football Playoff, a bracket tournament between the top four teams in the country as determined by a selection committee, which was established as a successor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series and its similar BCS National Championship Game. Unlike the BCS championship, the participating teams in the College Football Playoff National Championship are determined by two semi-final bowls—hosted by two of the consortium's six member bowls yearly—and the top two teams as determined by the selection committee do not automatically advance to the game in lieu of other bowls.|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson's {{assistant}} coach, Gomer Jones, {{took over}} as head coach in 1964, a move Wilkinson engineered himself. His first year {{would prove to be}} a sharp contrast from Wilkinson's early years as the Sooners went 6–4–1. They started the season 1–3 with three consecutive losses to Southern California, Texas and Kansas. The final loss came in the Gator Bowl to Florida State. Prior to the game, it was found that four of Oklahoma's starters had signed professional football contracts before their college eligibility had expired. Those four were dismissed from the team prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game, ultimately causing Oklahoma to lose the game 36–19. The next season's team fared no better, going 3–7, Oklahoma's worst record, percentage wise, since it went 0–1 its inaugural season in 1895. This brought the Jones era to a quick close, although he did remain at Oklahoma as the athletic director, a role he also held while he was head coach.|$|E
50|$|The Huskies have {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun <b>Bowl</b> three times since this game, though they lost all three. <b>The</b> Longhorns returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun <b>Bowl</b> in 1982.|$|R
