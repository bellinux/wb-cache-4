5|$|Windows Mobile {{is based}} on the Windows CE kernel and first {{appeared}} as the Pocket PC 2000 operating system. It includes a suite of basic applications developed with the Microsoft Windows API, and is designed to have features and appearance somewhat similar to desktop versions of Windows. It allowed <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers</b> to develop software for Windows Mobile with no restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Software applications were purchasable from Windows Marketplace for Mobile during the service's lifespan.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{key factors}} in the PlayStation's success was Sony's {{approach}} to <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers.</b> Whereas Sega and Nintendo took an isolationist approach, focusing on first party development while generally leaving <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers</b> to their own devices, Sony took efforts to streamline game production by providing a range of programming libraries which were constantly updated online, organising third party technical support teams, {{and in some cases}} giving direct development support to third party companies.|$|E
25|$|The PS2 {{consisted}} of a DVD drive and retailed in the U.S. for US$299. SCEI received heavy criticism after {{the launch of the}} PS2 due to the games released as part of the launch, difficulties that it presented for video game designers, and users who struggled to port Sega Dreamcast games to the system. However, despite these complaints, the PlayStation 2 received widespread support from <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers</b> throughout its lifespan on the market.|$|E
50|$|In the early-to-mid 1990s, ICOM Simulations {{was a major}} <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developer</b> for the TurboGrafx-16 {{platform}} in the US. They produced many games for the console, including the TG-16 exclusive Shadowgate sequel, Beyond Shadowgate.|$|R
50|$|Techno Cop {{was one of}} {{the first}} games made for the Mega Drive/Genesis from a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developer</b> and was part of an attempt by Razorsoft to test what sort of content would Sega allow on a game made for one of its systems.|$|R
50|$|The base Descent II {{game was}} {{released}} for MS-DOS, Mac OS and the Acorn Archimedes in 1996. Windows support was also made available. Later in 1996 came Descent Mission Builder 2, a Descent and Descent II level editor from <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developer</b> Brainware. It is also capable of converting Descent levels into Descent II levels.|$|R
25|$|Nintendo {{initially}} showcased {{three games}} for the Virtual Boy. It planned to release three titles at launch, {{and two or three}} per month thereafter. Given the system's short lifespan, only 22 games were released. Of them, 19 games were released in the Japanese market, while 14 were released in North America. Third party support was extremely limited compared to previous Nintendo platforms. According to Gunpei Yokoi, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi had dictated that only a select few <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers</b> be shown the Virtual Boy hardware prior to its formal unveiling, in order to limit the risk of poor-quality software appearing on the system.|$|E
25|$|Windows Imaging Component (WIC) {{is a new}} {{extensible}} imaging {{framework that}} allows applications supporting the framework to automatically get support of installed codecs for graphics file formats. Windows Presentation Foundation applications also automatically support the installed image codecs. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers</b> can write their own image codecs for their specific image file formats. By default, Windows Vista ships with the JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, BMP and HD Photo codecs. Codecs for RAW image formats used generally by high-end digital cameras are also supported in this manner. Windows Explorer, Windows Photo Gallery and Windows Photo Gallery Viewer are based on this new framework and can thus view and organize images in any format for which the necessary codecs are installed.|$|E
25|$|Stardock's {{success in}} the Windows game market has been mixed. At first, its titles on Windows were {{published}} by third parties: The Corporate Machine (Take 2), Galactic Civilizations (Strategy First), and The Political Machine 2004 (Ubisoft). While all three titles sold well at retail, Stardock was unsatisfied {{with the amount of}} revenue Windows games developers received. In the case of Galactic Civilizations, publisher Strategy First filed for bankruptcy without paying most of the royalties it owed. This ultimately led to Stardock self-publishing its future titles. Because of the success of its desktop applications, Stardock has been able to self-fund its own PC games and aid <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers</b> with their games as well.|$|E
50|$|On October 2010, a {{smartphone}} app called Palm Hangzhou, which tells bikeshare users how many bicycles each bike-share station has, {{was released by}} <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developer</b> Zhang Guangyu. However, despite popularity among users, Hangzhou Public Bicycle accused Zhang of illegally obtaining the bikeshare data. As of March 2012, the app does not work anymore as Zhang's IP address was blocked from using {{the data for the}} app.|$|R
50|$|Captain Planet and the Planeteers was a {{video game}} {{released}} for various platforms in the early 1990s, loosely based on the environmentalist animated series, Captain Planet and the Planeteers and produced by the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developer</b> Mindscape Inc. Three different versions were developed to suit three different platform capabilities, each with markedly different gameplay. The Amiga/Atari ST version was released in 1991, as was the ZX Spectrum/Amstrad CPC version, while the Nintendo Entertainment System version was released in 1992.|$|R

25|$|Premium {{personal}} spaces {{were available}} from the Home Estates store in Home's shopping complex. Sony released many premium personal spaces for Home, from both first party and <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers.</b> Various premium apartments were available {{to all of the}} regions; however, some were region exclusive. The first premium personal space released was the Summer House. Loot's Sunset Yacht (formerly Amaterasu Yacht) personal space was the first personal space to allow users to set the mood of the setting (e.g. sunrise, sunset, day, night). In addition to the standard features of personal spaces, Loot's Space Apartment also allowed users to view Twitter feeds from a ticker, and search for photos from their Flickr account and display them on photo screens.|$|E
25|$|The Xbox 360's {{advantage}} over its competitors {{was due to}} the release of high-profile titles from both first party and <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers.</b> The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins – more than any other platform. By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7.5 games per console in the US; the rate was 7.0 in Europe, while its competitors were 3.8 (PS3) and 3.5 (Wii), according to Microsoft. At the 2008 Game Developers Conference, Microsoft announced that it expected over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360 {{by the end of the}} year. As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the Halo franchise and Gears of War, the Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles that were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives, including Devil May Cry 4, Ace Combat 6, Virtua Fighter 5, Grand Theft Auto IV, Final Fantasy XIII, Tekken 6, , and L.A. Noire. In addition, Xbox 360 versions of cross-platform games were generally considered superior to their PS3 counterparts in 2006 and 2007, due in part to the difficulties of programming for the PS3.|$|E
500|$|Publishers such as Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Majesco Entertainment {{continued}} to release exclusive titles for the console, but the Wii's strongest titles remained within its first-party line-up. Analysts speculated {{that this would}} change in time as the Wii's growing popularity persuaded third-party publishers to focus on it; however, some <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers</b> expressed frustration at low software sales. Goichi Suda, developer of No More Heroes for the Wii, noted that [...] "only Nintendo titles are doing well. This isn't {{just because of the}} current situation in Japan, as this is happening outside Japan. I am very surprised about the reality about Wii, because before I was making this game, I wasn't expecting that Wii would be a console targeted only for non-gamers. I expected more games for hardcore gamers. The reality is different to what I expected." [...] Conversely, the PAL publisher of No More Heroes Rising Star Games were greatly impressed with the game's sales. Goichi Suda later retracted his comment, saying his [...] "point was that No More Heroes, unlike a lot of Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product that will attract a different kind of consumer to the hardware, i.e. gamers who are looking for a different genre to the products that have been successful on this platform thus far." ...|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{turnovers}} was when four programmers were unsatisfied with their paychecks. They felt they were making a very paltry salary for someone who actually designed the games that made the company millions of dollars. They wanted a small commission, but when they asked Kassar about that, David Crane recalls that Kassar responded, [...] "You are no more important to that game than {{the guy on the}} assembly line who puts it together." [...] Crane and three others resigned from Atari and formed their own company: Activision, which became the first ever <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developer.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each of the PBX vendors {{offers a}} {{mobility}} capability. Some developed it internally. Some, like Cisco or Avaya, bought a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developer,</b> and some license their offering {{from a company}} like OptiCaller Software or Counterpath (formerly FirstHand). There is another set of vendors that offers enterprise FMC that works with any PBX, for example OptiCaller Software, OnRelay, Shortel, Tango Networks, ESCAUX and RIM. This is beneficial to {{both large and small}} customers. Large customers may have PBXes from multiple vendors, yet still wish to roll out a unified FMC solution. Small customers appreciate having a choice of supplier, rather than being tied to their PBX vendor.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the time}} the Pippin systems were released, the market was already {{dominated}} by the Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and the mostly Windows-based PC. In addition, although Apple made efforts to sign on software developers, there was little ready-to-use software for Pippin, the only major publisher being Bandai itself. The system's <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers</b> consisted solely of small software houses. At a price of [...] on launch, it was considered too expensive.|$|E

50|$|The Duplicati GUI and commandline {{interface}} both call {{a common}} component called Main {{which serves as}} a binding point for all the operations supported. Currently the encryption, compression and storage component are considered subcomponent and are loaded at runtime, making it possible for a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developer</b> to inject a subcomponent into Duplicati without access to the source, or any need to modify Duplicati itself. The license type is also flexible enough to allow redistribution of Duplicati with a closed source storage provider. Duplicati is designed to be as independent of the provider as possible, which means that any storage medium that supports the common commands GET/PUT/LIST/DELETE can work with Duplicati.|$|R

2500|$|Adding {{greatly to}} the {{severity}} of the problem, is the system used to add functionality to the operating system itself, which relies on a patching mechanism known as CDEVs and INITs, commonly known as Control Panels, and Extensions. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers</b> also make use of this mechanism to add features, including [...] screensavers and a hierarchal Apple menu, independently of Apple. Some of these third-party control panels became almost universal, like the popular After Dark screensaver package. Since there was no standard for use of these patches, {{it is not uncommon for}} several of these add-ons—including Apple's own additions to the OS—to use the same patches, and interfere with each other, leading to more crashing.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the heart}} of the TimeTrax {{controversy}} was the XM PCR: a computer-controlled XM Receiver. Unlike the other receivers, which could be used in the car or home stereo, the XM PCR required a computer to run. A software application on the computer acted as the radio's controls and display, which led to a flurry of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers,</b> who wanted to make a PCR replacement. Many of them [...] from the XM company. Once the PCR was discontinued, for the reasons listed above, people found that the XM Direct, a receiver intended to be used in satellite-ready car stereos, can be connected to a computer with a very simple adapter cable. Some people have dubbed the entire kit, with receiver, cable, and software, the Direct PCR. While the original PCR software does not control the XM Direct receiver, several community developers have continued to develop PCR replacement software.|$|E
2500|$|The first Wang VS {{computer}} {{was introduced in}} 1977, {{about the same time}} as Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX, and continues to be in use 39 years later. Its instruction set was compatible with the IBM 360 series, but it did not run any IBM 360 system software. The VS operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations. The VS was aimed directly at the business data processing market in general, and IBM in particular. While many programming languages were available, the VS was typically programmed in COBOL. Other languages supported in the VS integrated development environment included Assembler, COBOL 74, COBOL 85, BASIC, Ada, RPG II, C, PL/I, FORTRAN, Glossary, MABASIC, SPEED II and Procedure (a scripting language). Pascal was also supported for I/O co-processor development. The Wang PACE (Professional Application Creation Environment) 4GL and database was used from the mid-1980s onward by customers and <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developers</b> to build complex applications sometimes involving many thousands of screens, hundreds of distinct application modules, and serving many hundreds of users. Substantial vertical applications were developed for the Wang VS by third party software houses throughout the 1980s in COBOL, PACE, BASIC, PL/I and RPG II. The Wang OFFICE family of applications and Wang WP were both popular applications on the VS. Word Processing ran on the VS through services that emulated the OIS environment and downloaded the WP software as [...] "microcode" [...] (in Wang terminology) to VS workstations.|$|E
50|$|At {{the early}} age of 12, Neil Voss began playing with {{electronic}} music on his Commodore 64 and this hobby {{soon became a}} big part of his life. He later became an underground electronic music developer, but saw his fellow composers signing to game developers, and so he joined H20, a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developer</b> for Atari’s Jaguar. His first project was Phear, but after Jaguar failed, it was moved to Nintendo and expanded into Tetrisphere. As audio director, Voss produced, composed, and engineered the whole soundtrack for Tetrisphere, which some say made the game a hit. Voss went on to create more hit techno music in the N64 puzzle game, The New Tetris. This soundtrack became an instant favorite.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{urban land}} development when landowners anticipate a future large-scale redevelopment by a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>developer.</b> Landowners' initial development activities can deter such redevelopment because they impose two conversion costs on the redeveloper: demolition costs and landowners' reservation prices. These costs are eventually {{borne by the}} landowners when the developers' market is competitive. For the landowners' initial development activities, we analyze both the efficient solution and the noncooperative solution under the Nash equilibrium. In both cases, the possibility of redevelopment results in {{a lower level of}} initial development due to the conversion costs, but increases land prices. However, the magnitude of their effects is smaller in the Nash solution due to an externality. The presence of such an externality provides a rationale for zoning and urban planning.
