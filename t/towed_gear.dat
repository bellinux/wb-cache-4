40|$|The Inshore Potting Agreement (IPA) is a {{voluntary}} management system conceived by the inshore fishers of south Devon, England. The IPA has functioned effectively since 1978 to reduce conflict between static gear (trap and net) and <b>towed</b> <b>gear</b> (trawl and dredge) fishers. Although {{there is no}} legal recognition of the system, the IPA continues to be generally observed by both sectors of the fishing industry. Fishers from the static and <b>towed</b> <b>gear</b> sectors were interviewed to determine how well the system functioned, what the system achieved, and what factors caused most problems. Fishers were also asked if the IPA could and should evolve further to ensure greater effectiveness and regulatory compliance. Lessons that may be learned for fishery scientists and managers from the inception and later evolution of the IPA are discussed. In particular, {{the characteristics of the}} management system that have enabled the continuation of the inshore fishing industry’s traditional practices, despite falling catches in other areas are discussed {{in the context of the}} fishers ’ knowledge that designed them. The general increase in living standards and earning expectations of people in society as a result of this is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Fishing with bottom <b>towed</b> <b>gear</b> {{is widely}} {{considered}} an invasive form of fishing {{in terms of its}} impacts upon seabed habitats and fauna. Fishery closures or marine protected areas provide baseline conditions against which to assess the response to the removal of fishing disturbance and thus shed light on their use as fisheries management tools. We conducted repeat underwater camera surveys inside a recently established area that is permanently closed to scallop fishing and a seasonally fished area in Cardigan Bay, UK, to test for differences in scallop abundance and epibenthic community structure and to examine recovery processes over a 23 mo study period. Changes in scallop density and epifaunal diversity and community composition were primarily driven by seasonal fluctuations; no {{differences were found between the}} permanently closed area and the seasonally fished area. Temporal changes in epibenthic community inside the permanently closed area were not related to recovery processes associated with the cessation of scallop dredging. Sediment composition and bedforms shifted between surveys, suggesting that this community is exposed to a dynamic environment. It is likely that scallop dredging at the present levels of fishing may be insufficient to induce changes large enough to be detected in the presence of strong natural disturbance. We highlight the importance of considering the physical nature and dynamics of the environment and the nature of the species concerned throughout the process of designating closed areas, to avoid negative impacts on fisheries and limited conservation benefits...|$|E

40|$|Maerl beds occur {{worldwide}} and are formed by {{an accumulation of}} unattached calcareous red algae (Rhodophyta). Maerl-forming algae grow in a superficial living layer on sediments within the photic zone. Maerl beds are spatially complex habitats {{with a high degree}} of species and trophic group diversity. The European Commission’s ‘Habitats Directive’ mandates the conservation management of two of the main European maerl-forming species, Phymatolithon calcareum and Lithothamnion corallioides. Mediterranean maerl beds are to be considered for inclusion in national inventories of sites of conservation interest, as required by the SPABIM Protocol of the Barcelona Convention. In spite of their importance, and the requirement for their conservation management, European maerl grounds suffer a variety of anthropogenic perturbations including direct exploitation through extraction, fishing impacts and chemical pollution by organic matter and excess nutrients. The ecology of northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean maerl beds has received little attention, in contrast to other marine communities (e. g. kelp forests, sea-grass meadows). Key conservation and management measures proposed include: the recognition that maerl beds are non-renewable resources and cannot sustain direct exploitation; prohibitions on the use of <b>towed</b> <b>gear</b> on maerl grounds; moratoria on the issue of further permits for the siting of aquaculture units above maerl grounds; monitoring of existing exploited or impacted maerl beds; the designation of ‘no-take’ reserves; measures to limit the impacts that might affect water quality above maerl beds; a programme of monitoring of the ‘health’ of European maerl beds; an awareness campaign on the biological importance of maerl beds; a higher conservation status for maerl habitats and maerlforming species in European legislation; and further research on maerl ecosystems. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} seabed {{pressure}} of towed fishing gears and models the physical impact (area {{and depth of}} seabed penetration) from trip-based information of vessel size, gear type, and catch. Traditionally fishing pressures are calculated top-down by making use of large-scale statistics such as logbook data. Here, we take a different approach starting from the gear itself (design and dimensions) to estimate the physical interactions with the seabed {{at the level of}} the individual fishing operation. We defined 14 distinct <b>towed</b> <b>gear</b> groups in European waters (eight otter trawl groups, three beam trawl groups, two demersal seine groups, and one dredge group), for which we established gear “footprints”. The footprint of a gear is defined as the relative contribution from individual larger gear components, such as trawl doors, sweeps, and groundgear, to the total area and severity of the gear's impact. An industry-based survey covering 13 countries provided the basis for estimating the relative impact-area contributions from individual gear components, whereas sediment penetration was estimated based on a literature review. For each gear group, a vessel size–gear size relationship was estimated to enable the prediction of gear footprint area and sediment penetration from vessel size. Application of these relationships with average vessel sizes and towing speeds provided hourly swept-area estimates by métier. Scottish seining has the largest overall gear footprint of ~ 1. 6 km 2 h - 1 of which 0. 08 km 2 has an impact at the subsurface level (sediment penetration = 2 cm). Beam trawling for flatfish ranks low when comparing overall footprint size/hour but ranks substantially higher when comparing only impact at the subsurface level (0. 19 km 2 h - 1). These results have substantial implications for the definition, estimation, and monitoring of fishing pressure indicators, which are discussed in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management...|$|E
40|$|The Latitudinal Gradient Program (2002 – 2011) {{aimed at}} {{understanding}} the marine and terrestrial ecosystems existing along the Victoria Land coast (Ross Sea), an area characterized by strong latitudinal clines in environmental factors. During the program’s voyage of the Italian RV “Italica” in 2004, a fine-mesh <b>towed</b> <b>gear,</b> the “Rauschert dredge”, was deployed {{for the first}} time at 18 stations in four latitudinal distinct shelf areas between ~ 71 °S and ~ 74 °S. The collected samples contained undescribed species and new records for the Ross Sea from a variety of different marine taxa. Here, we describe the molluscan fauna and investigate evidences for latitudinal effects on molluscan diversity, abundance and assemblage composition. No significant latitudinal trends were detected: while diversity did not vary significantly with latitude, species richness showed an apparent but non-significant decrease with increasing latitude. Beta-diversity was found to be high both within and between latitudinally distinct shelf areas. A large fraction (~ 20 %) of the collected molluscs corresponded to new species records for the Ross Sea or undescribed species. Rarity in Antarctic molluscan occurrences was confirmed, with singletons (i. e. species represented by only a single individual) accounting for a 22 % and uniques (i. e. species occurring in one sample only) for a 43. 5 % of the total presence. Our study of the smaller macrofaunal benthic fraction showed that Antarctic marine research still has far to go to have robust reference baselines to measure possible changes in benthic communities, even in the case of the assumed well-known, well-sampled and well-studied group of Ross Sea shelf molluscs. We advocate the use of fine-mesh trawling gears for routine sampling activities in future Antarctic expeditions to assess the full marine biodiversity...|$|E

50|$|Traditional towed {{artillery}} {{can still be}} found in units where complexity and weight are liabilities: e.g. airmobile, amphibious and other light units. In such units, where organic transport is usually limited, any available transport can double as artillery tractors in order to reposition guns when needed.

50|$|Besides the {{established}} trawling fleets, {{a significant number}} of fleets using lobster creels have developed. The better size and condition of lobsters caught by this method yield prices three to four times higher than animals netted by trawling.

It has therefore been described as a reasonable alternative to demersal <b>towed</b> <b>gears,</b> and the allocation of additional fishing rights for this type of take has been suggested.|$|R

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{discipline of}} gear selectivity research {{has a long}} tradition that can be traced back hundreds of years. This note aims at giving a short review of central aspects of size selectivity analysis of data from experiments with <b>towed</b> fishing <b>gears.</b> It is thus not intended as a technical introduction to the analysis. More detailed descriptions can be found elsewhere in the literature. SINGLE HAUL ANALY SES Experiments with towed can be conducted by different methods. The most commonly used are covered codend and paired gear techniques. These are characterized by collecting fish in two compartments one of which is assumed virtually non-selective. The purpose of the non-selective compartment is to collect information about the local abundance of fish that entered the combined gear. With the appearance of more complicated gear with multiple selective devices (e. g. grids or panels) the experimental gears have also developed into more complex designs. The most important advancement in the analysis of single hauls was done by Millar in 1992, when he developed the SELECT method. The method is very general and covers not only all types of size selectivity experiments with <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> but also experiments with passive gears, i. e. hooks, set-net...|$|R

40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are 7 main {{target species}} of the {{demersal}} mixed fisheries in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Gadoids and Norway lobsters are mainly taken in the nor-thern North Sea by <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> except beam trawls while the flatfish fisheries are conducted in the southern North Sea mainly using beam trawls. Recently, the central North Sea appears less fished by demersal <b>gears.</b> <b>Towed</b> nets including seines and beam trawls equipped with meshes of more than 100 mm resp. more than 80 mm were identified as the main gears effecting the depleted cod and reduced plaice stocks. The saithe sector, using towed nets with meshes of more than 110 mm, longlines, gill nets and others, appears to affect the 7 species to a lesser extend. These results support the interim effort limitations by gear types, vessel and month as enforced by the European Commission since 2003. TAC regulations alone are considered inefficient to sustainably harvest stocks by mixed fisheries. A fleet-effort management method is developed estimating the fleets’ effects based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species in mixed fisheries weighted by {{the ratio of the}} precautionary reference Bpa and the actual SSB size as ecological quality objective. Applying such fleet effort management could result in increased catch possibilities of some stocks by fleets selecting mainly few and non-overexploited stocks while respecting precautionary management constraints in minimum SSB or maximum exploitation rates at the same time...|$|R
