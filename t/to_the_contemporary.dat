5|$|Castle Rising {{continued}} to be owned by the Howard family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by Mary Howard, and her husband Fulke Greville Howard. Fulke began to undertake restoration work, excavating {{the basement of the}} keep in 1822 and repairing some of the stonework. The ground level of the inner bailey, which had built up over the years, was lowered by about : according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> archaeologist Henry Harrod, this process required thousands of loads of earth to be dug out and removed. A great deal of medieval archaeological evidence was destroyed in the process, but the work uncovered the old Norman chapel and Harrod excavated the building in 1851. Mary continued the excavation work on the castle site after Fulke's death, and restored the stonework of the chapel.|$|E

According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E

5|$|Mateiu Caragiale had {{his first}} {{thoughts}} on Craii de Curtea-Veche in 1910. Two years later, {{during a trip to}} Iași, he published his first 13 poems in the literary magazine Viața Românească, winning the praise of poet Panait Cerna and the ridicule of writer Tudor Arghezi. Literary critic Șerban Cioculescu stressed that these had been printed following his father's interventions with the magazine's staff, and, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> account of Luca's brother-in-law, philosopher Ionel Gherea, Ion Luca admired his son's contributions, his criticism being minimal, constructive, and welcomed by Mateiu. This led Gherea to conclude that, copying in real life a Symbolist cliché, Caragiale-son fabricated an unfair image of his father. In later years, Mateiu continued to write poetry, published by literary promoter Constantin Banu in his magazine, Flacăra.|$|E

5|$|The Actor Rebellion of 1733 was {{an event}} that {{took place at the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, England when the actors who worked there, disapproving of the changes in the management, {{attempted}} to seize control. Before the rebellion, the theatre was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber, John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre, he, along with other actors, attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the lease. When the shareholders found out, they refused to admit the actors to the building and the theatre was closed for several months. The fight spilled over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> newspapers, which generally sided with the managers.|$|E

5|$|Theodosius was {{the first}} child of Maurice and his wife, the Augusta Constantina. He was born on August 4, 583 (according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> John of Ephesus and other chroniclers) or 585 (according to the later {{histories}} of Theophanes the Confessor and Kedrenos). He {{was the first}} son to be born to a reigning emperor since Theodosius II in 401, and was accordingly named after the previous ruler. The papal envoy, or apocrisiarius, to Constantinople, the future Pope Gregory the Great, acted as his godfather. The scholar Evagrius Scholasticus composed a work celebrating Theodosius' birth, {{for which he was}} rewarded by Maurice with the rank of consul.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> Procopius in the De Bello Gothico (the {{section of}} the De Bellis {{regarding}} the Gothic War), Justinian resented the takeover by the Gepids of the formerly Roman city of Sirmium in 537, {{which may have been}} voluntarily surrendered by the Ostrogoths to create difficulties for the Byzantines. The Ostrogoths were also occupied with the war in Italy and sought to retain their possessions in the peninsula. Sirmium's takeover was followed in 539 by a bloody confrontation between the Gepids and the Byzantines that had cost the latter the life of Calluc, their Master of the Soldiers, and also the loss to the Gepids of Dacia ripensis (Serbia) and Singidunum (Belgrade). Because of this, Justinian ended the alliance that had bonded the Gepids and Byzantines, and had ceased paying tributes to the Gepids, finding an enemy to set them against in the Lombards.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Serbs and Bosniaks in the Battle of Kosovo on 15 June 1389, Ivan Shishman had to seek help from Hungary. During the winter of 1391–1392, he entered into secret {{negotiations}} with the King of Hungary Sigismund, who was planning a campaign against the Turks. The new Ottoman sultan Bayezid I pretended to have peaceful intentions in order to cut off Ivan Shishman from his alliance with the Hungarians. However, in the spring of 1393 Bayezid gathered a large army from his dominions in the Balkans and Asia Minor and attacked Bulgaria. The Ottomans marched to the capital Tarnovo and besieged it. The defence of the capital was led by Patriarch Evtimiy because Ivan Shishman was located in Nikopol, presumably for better communication with Sigismund. After a three-month siege, Tarnovo fell on 17 July. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> Bulgarian scholar and cleric Gregory Tsamblak, the city was not captured because of the Ottoman military strength but due to treason. The Ottoman campaign of 1393 devastated Bulgaria; in the wake of that invasion, the lands of Ivan Shishman were limited to Nikopol and several towns along the Danube. Upon his return from Wallachia after the Battle of Rovine in 1395, Bayezid I attacked and captured Nikopol and, according to the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle, murdered Ivan Shishman on 3 June 1395. A Byzantine chronicle gives the date as 29 October. However, some sources suggest that the Bulgarian ruler was captured and died in prison.|$|E

5|$|Belgrade has wildly varying {{architecture}}, {{from the}} center of Zemun, typical of a Central European town, to the more modern architecture and spacious layout of New Belgrade. The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions. The oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish türbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dorćol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Neo-Byzantine architecture are present in buildings such as Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gračanica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphs {{retained}} their pictorial appearance, {{and classical}} authors emphasised this aspect, {{in sharp contrast}} to the Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote Hieroglyphica, an explanation of almost 200 glyphs. His work was believed to be authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga in the 18th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.|$|E
5|$|His second film of 1949, also {{produced}} by Film Art Association and released by Shintoho, was Stray Dog. It is a detective movie (perhaps the first important Japanese film in that genre) that explores {{the mood of}} Japan during its painful postwar recovery through {{the story of a}} young detective, played by Mifune, and his fixation on the recovery of his handgun, which was stolen by a penniless war veteran who proceeds to use it to rob and murder. Adapted from an unpublished novel by Kurosawa in the style of a favorite writer of his, Georges Simenon, it was the director's first collaboration with screenwriter Ryuzo Kikushima, who would later help to script eight other Kurosawa films. A famous, virtually wordless sequence, lasting over eight minutes, shows the detective, disguised as an impoverished veteran, wandering the streets in search of the gun thief; it employed actual documentary footage of war-ravaged Tokyo neighborhoods shot by Kurosawa's friend, Ishirō Honda, the future director of Godzilla. The film is considered a precursor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> police procedural and buddy cop film genres.|$|E
