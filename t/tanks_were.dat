5|$|German losses {{had been}} heavy at Hannut and Gembloux. The 4th Panzer Division {{was down to}} 137 tanks on 16 May, {{including}} just four Panzer IVs. The 3rd Panzer Division was down by 20–25 percent of its operational force, while the 4th Panzer Division 45–50 percent of its <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> not combat ready. Damaged <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> quickly repaired, but its strength was initially greatly weakened.|$|E
5|$|Six <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> {{used for}} each span {{and left in}} place for three hours; the 18 tanks used in total allowed three spans to be tested simultaneously.

25|$|Modern LNG storage <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} {{full containment}} type, {{which has a}} prestressed concrete outer wall and a high-nickel steel inner tank, with extremely efficient insulation between the walls. Large <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> low aspect ratio (height to width) and cylindrical in design with a domed steel or concrete roof. Storage pressure in these <b>tanks</b> <b>is</b> very low, less than 10kPa (1.45psig). Sometimes more expensive underground <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> used for storage.|$|R
5000|$|One <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> made, and the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> tested, {{but found}} wanting {{in regards to}} the power train.

50|$|Another {{refinery}} employee {{commented that}} these large oil storage <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> sometimes purposely floated {{in order to}} move them. The containment levees around the <b>tank</b> <b>are</b> generally filled with water and <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> moved in this way around <b>tank</b> farms.

5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} as she had {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> difficult to access.|$|E
5|$|During 1973, B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment—designated the Medium Tank Trials Unit (MTTU)—evaluated the German Leopard 1 {{against the}} American M60A1 Patton as a {{replacement}} for the obsolete Centurions. The Leopard was judged the superior tank, and 90 gun tanks, eight Leopard 1 Armoured Recovery Vehicles Medium and five Leopard 1 bridge layer <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> ordered. The Australian <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> designated the Leopard AS1, and were based on the Leopard 1A3 which had been built for the German Army. The main difference between the Australian and German tanks was the inclusion of a SABCA fire control system, equipment to allow the tank to better operate in the tropics, additional storage boxes {{on the sides of the}} tank as well as improved trunnion bearings and combustion cleaners. These <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> delivered to Australia in batches between 1976 and 1978. During the Leopard's service very little in the way of upgrades were undertaken, and by the 1990s they had become obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{tanks of}} the 1st Brigade {{were to be}} used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be {{attacked}} by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero-hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. The <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, the tanks still running were to drive to rally points.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Water <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> liquid storage {{containers}}. These containers {{are used}} for storing water. Water <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> traditionally designed by working stress method. As per revised IS 3370 water <b>tank</b> can also <b>be</b> designed by limit state method. In this dissertation water <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> designed by both working stress method and limit state method. Circular and square water <b>tank</b> <b>are</b> considered. Detailed analysis and design is done. Working drawings are prepared for all conditions. For understanding the financial implications quantities for concrete and steel were calculated. Exact amount of steel required is calculated for each case as per working drawings. It was observed that in case of limit state design cost required is less. Obviously circular water <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> more economical compare to square tank. Index Terms-Water tanks, working stress, limit state. Water <b>tank</b> <b>are</b> liquid storage containers. These containers are usually storing water for human consumption. The need for water <b>tank</b> systems <b>is</b> as old as civilized man. A ground water tank provide...|$|R

50|$|The {{outer shell}} of the water <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> a {{cylindrical}} stainless-steel tank 39 m in diameter and 42 m in height. The <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> self-supporting, with concrete backfilled against the rough-hewn stone walls to counteract water pressure when the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> filled. The capacity of the tank exceeds 50 ktons of water.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> {{partially}} {{destroyed by}} a fire in 1927. It was rebuilt and operational in 1930, and was used up to the 1940s. Then the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> used as a pressure tank to support other wind-tunnel activities at Langley. In 1978, the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> taken out of service; it survives on display.|$|R
5|$|T-26 model 1933: single turret version {{armed with}} 45mm 20K tank gun and DT tank machine gun. This version {{had a new}} {{cylindrical}} turret with a large rear niche. Some <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> equipped with a 71-TK-1 radio station with a hand-rail antenna around the turret (so-called radio tanks). They were upgraded in 1935 with a welded hull and turret, and again in 1936 with a rear DT tank machine gun in the turret. In 1937, some <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> equipped with an anti-aircraft machine gun and a searchlight. The model 1933 was the most numerous variant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tanks</b> <b>were</b> {{primarily}} {{used on the}} Western Front. The first offensive of the war {{in which}} <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> used en masse was the battle of Cambrai in 1917; 476 tanks started the attack, and the German front collapsed. At midday the British had advanced five miles behind the German line. The battle of Amiens in 1918 saw the value of the tank being appreciated; 10 heavy and two light battalions of 414 <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> included in the assault. 342 Mark Vs and 72 Whippets were backed up by a further 120 tanks designed to carry forward supplies for the armour and infantry. By {{the end of the first}} day of the attack, they had penetrated the German line by , 16,000 prisoners were taken. In September 1918, the British Army was the most mechanised army in the world. Some 22,000 men had served in the Tank Corps by the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|That {{afternoon}} three {{troops of}} tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, {{were sent to}} reinforce the Black Watch, but they had only just started to move towards the Château when three <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> destroyed by hidden German self-propelled guns. The other <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> withdrawn being unable to deploy in the wooded ground around the Château. The {{rest of the day}} and night passed without another attack, but the Germans sent out reconnaissance patrols to establish the exact location of the British positions and German armoured vehicles could be heard moving up to the front during the night.|$|E
50|$|Petrol is {{supplied}} by gravity from the tank {{at the rear}} of the car but once the car is under way exhaust gases maintain a pressure within this tank. A lubricating oil <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> pressurised the same way. The petrol <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> in two compartments separated by a partial partition. Both sections are filled when the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> filled above that partition but when the larger <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> empty the second tank provides a fresh supply and a timely warning to the driver.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{are often}} fitted {{with only one}} tank, but {{multiple}} <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> used in a some applications. In passenger car applications, the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> typically either a cylindrical tank, made from steel, mounted in the boot of the vehicle or a toroidal tank (also steel) or set of permanently interconnected cylinders placed in the spare wheel well. In commercial vehicle applications, the <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> generally cylindrical <b>tanks</b> mounted either in the cargo space or on the chassis underneath the body. Increasingly, the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> an aluminium Conformable <b>Tank,</b> which <b>is</b> lighter, has more capacity and cannot rust.|$|R

Although HPA tanks may in theory be refilled from other sources of compressed air such as a conventional scuba tank or a general-purpose air compressor, the pressure available from these sources is far below the pressure that HPA <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> designed for. For example, shop compressors create around [...] range, {{an order of magnitude}} less than HPA <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> designed for (typically in the range of [...] ). HPA <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> filled from a nipple instead of the ASA valve, which allows them to be filled while the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> still attached to the paintball marker.|$|R
5|$|The {{division}} used approximately 20 Tetrarchs {{during the}} British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944. The <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> successfully landed by glider, {{but they did}} not perform well. Several were lost in accidents, and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces. A few days after the beginning of the operation, the <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support. By August 1944, most of the Tetrarchs in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks, and the remainder were replaced by the M22 Locust in December 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 led to a significant expansion of Australia's armoured force. From 1942 large numbers of American light and medium <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> delivered to Australia, along with British Matilda IIs. In addition, {{a small number of}} Australian-designed Sentinel <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> delivered to the Army during 1942 and 1943, but the type was never issued to combat units. Three armoured divisions capable of independent operations were formed during the Second World War, but none were deployed outside Australia. Many individual units later fought against the Japanese in the Pacific, although only in regimental strength.|$|E

40|$|One key {{to clean}} {{freshwater}} {{is to prevent}} hazardous liquid spills from {{taking place in the}} first place. An important element to spill prevention is the safe storage of hazardous liquids in tanks that comply with national standards. Tanks come in many shapes and forms. Large <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> erected in the field. Smaller <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> produced in a factory and shipped to the site for installation. Shop-built <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> made for underground installations and for aboveground installations. Aboveground <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> either oriented for horizontal or vertical installation, and are produced in either cylindrical form or rectangular form.
