50|$|The Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company was {{a banking}} {{institution}} based in Cincinnati, Ohio, which existed from 1830 to 1857. The Panic of 1857, an economic depression, resulted after the company's New York City offices ceased operations due to bad investments, especially in agricultural-related businesses. During the Crimean War, much of Europe's farm labor {{was engaged in}} the military, resulting in Europe becoming dependent on American crops for food. At {{the conclusion of the}} war, European farm production resumed and American agricultural exports declined, causing a drop in value of American foodstuffs. Because of the <b>telegraph,</b> <b>word</b> of the office closure spread quickly and many investors, already shaky over declining markets, caused a financial panic. The markets wouldn't recover until two years later.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, Allied {{security}} officers were {{disturbed by the}} appearance, {{in a series of}} crosswords in The Daily <b>Telegraph,</b> of <b>words</b> that were secret code names for military operations planned as part of Operation Overlord.|$|R
50|$|The New South Wales telegraphic code library {{consisted}} of 404 code <b>words.</b> These 404 <b>telegraph</b> code <b>words</b> eliminated {{the need to}} type 3703 normal words as sentences on a telegraph, therefore saving time and reducing the likelihood of errors in the sending of messages.|$|R
5000|$|In {{commercial}} <b>telegraph</b> code, the <b>word</b> [...] "Archenor" [...] {{was used}} to signify [...] "You must number your invoices".|$|R
5000|$|Joel Selvin of the San Francisco Chronicle {{called the}} film [...] "very boring"; a [...] "story without irony, {{perspective}} or any leavening {{that would make}} it something other than an ordinary military-action caper. The story line is <b>telegraphed</b> from <b>word</b> one and the meticulous unfolding plot plods ahead inexorably without the slightest bit of suspense." ...|$|R
5000|$|The word {{semaphore}} {{was coined}} in 1801 by the French {{inventor of the}} semaphore line itself, Claude Chappe. He composed it from the Greek elements σῆμα (sêma, [...] "sign"); and from φορός (phorós, [...] "carrying"), or φορά (phorá, [...] "a carrying") from φέρειν (phérein, [...] "to bear"). Chappe also coined the <b>word</b> <b>telegraph.</b> The <b>word</b> semaphoric was first printed in English in 1808: [...] "The newly constructed Semaphoric telegraphs", referring {{to the destruction of}} telegraphs in France. The word semaphore was first printed in English in 1816: [...] "The improved Semaphore has been erected {{on the top of the}} Admiralty", referring to the installation of a simpler telegraph invented by Sir Home Popham. Semaphore telegraphs are also called [...] "optical telegraphs", [...] "shutter telegraph chains", [...] "Chappe telegraphs" [...] or [...] "Napoleonic semaphore".|$|R
500|$|Although the {{programme}} {{was broadcast}} {{only in the}} London region, the ensuing furore occupied the tabloid newspapers for days. The Daily Mirror famously ran the headline [...] "The Filth and the Fury!"; other papers such as the Daily Express ("Fury at Filthy TV Chat") and the Daily <b>Telegraph</b> ("4-Letter <b>Words</b> Rock TV") followed suit. Thames Television suspended Grundy and, though he was later reinstated, the interview effectively ended his career.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you mean, Phil," [...] {{asked the}} widow, with a perplexed look, [...] "that if I {{were a man}} of business, and wanted to ask a {{customer}} in India what was the smallest quantity of a thing he required, I should have to <b>telegraph</b> only the <b>word</b> `Blissful'?" ...|$|R
500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character. In The Daily <b>Telegraphs</b> <b>words,</b> instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as [...] "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift." [...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. Just what it would feel like. And this concept of letting out who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone. It’s not a perfect thing, but it's powerful." [...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, mother, {{it covers}} sense. A Quebec timber-merchant <b>telegraphed</b> these {{identical}} <b>words</b> {{the other day}} {{to a friend of}} mine, and when the friend turned up the words `obstinate kangaroo' in his corresponding code, he found the translation to be, `Demand is improving for Ohio or Michigan white oak (planks), 16 inches and upwards.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|On August 7, {{couriers}} reached Fort Concho {{with the}} good news. [...] The <b>telegraph</b> sent out <b>word</b> that Nolan was returning with his command. [...] The word went east that Nolan and his lost command were [...] "back from the dead." [...] The officer {{in charge of the}} relief force now guarding the Fort had Umbles and his three companions placed under guard.|$|R
40|$|We {{compensate}} by a prefilter {{the distortion}} of an input signal along an electric line modeled by the telegraph equation. The prefilter {{is based on}} the so-called flatness property of the telegraph equation. We derive the explicit equation of the filter and illustrate the relevance of our approach by a few simulations. Key <b>words.</b> <b>Telegraph</b> equation, control, signal, distortion, flatness, modules, operational calculus, convolution, Bessel functions...|$|R
6000|$|The House will {{pardon me}} if {{for a moment}} I dwell upon what by {{application}} is an innuendo conveyed in the admonition of the noble Marquess. I have a suspicion that he considered his advice was needed; he expressed the hope that all who were responsible for administration in India would have all the power for which they {{had a right to}} ask. Upon that I can--though I am half reluctant to do it--completely clear my character. In December last, shortly before I addressed your Lordships, Lord Minto, having observed there was some talk of my interference with him and his Council, <b>telegraphed</b> these <b>words,</b> and desired that I should make use of them whenever I thought fit-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo {{took her}} at her word, for during the first call she sat with every limb {{gracefully}} composed, every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as silent as the sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her 'charming novel', and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera, and the fashions. Each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a demure [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] with the chill on. In vain Amy <b>telegraphed</b> the <b>word</b> 'talk', tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with her foot. Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment like Maud's face, 'icily regular, splendidly null'.|$|R
50|$|In 1846, Alexander Bain {{patented}} {{a chemical}} telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked {{in a mixture}} of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing <b>telegraph</b> was 1000 <b>words</b> per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.|$|R
6000|$|... "So the {{telegraph}} clerk thought," [...] returned Phil, [...] "but when my City friend {{pointed out that}} Blastus was `the king's chamberlain' they were obliged to let the telegram go. `Blastus' stands for `superior quality,' and `unholy' for `Offer is open for three days from time of despatch of telegram.' Using the same code, if a merchant wants to ask a Calcutta friend the question--`How is the coming crop as regards extent and appearance?' he merely <b>telegraphs</b> the <b>word</b> `Hamlet.' If he wishes to say `Bills of lading go forward by this mail, Invoices will follow,' he has only to telegraph `Heretic.' For the most part, the compilers of these codes seem to have used the words arbitrarily, for the word `Ellwood' has no visible connection with the words `Blue Velvet,' which it represents; neither is there connection between `Doves' and `French Brandy,' nor between `Collapse' and `Scotch Coals,' though {{there does seem to}} have been a gleam of significance when they fixed on `Downward' to represent `Irish Whisky.'" ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1861, Choquette {{set out on a}} canoe trip up the Stikine with his wife and ten warriors of the Stikines to {{prospect}} for gold, discovering it at what has been known as Buck Bar since, just southwest of Telegraph Creek (the gold-rush settlement at Telegraph Creek was, in fact, known as Buck's Bar until the construction era of the unfinished Collins Overland <b>Telegraph).</b> When <b>word</b> of Choquette's discovery reached the other goldfields and the colonial capitals, the Stikine Gold Rush was launched and hordes of men sought out the Stikine, with Fort Stikine aka Shakesville become an important port-of-call for steamboats now bound for the river's many gold-bearing bars. In response to the influx of miners, most of them (but not all) American, Governor Douglas decreed the creation of the Stikine Territory, covering the lands inland from Russian American between the line of the Nass and Finlay Rivers north to the 62nd parallel to prevent American feared American annexation of the region, just as he had created the Colony of British Columbia in similar circumstances and had witnessed the loss of the Oregon Country to American settlers previously.|$|R
5000|$|The {{argument}} {{offered by}} supporters of Morse claims that Morse originally devised a cipher code {{similar to that}} used in existing semaphore <b>telegraphs,</b> by which <b>words</b> were assigned three- or four-digit numbers and entered into a codebook. The sending operator converted words to these number groups and the receiving operator converted them back to words using this codebook. Morse spent several months compiling this code dictionary. It is said by Morse supporters that Vail, in public and private writings, never claimed the code for himself. According to one researcher, in a February 1838 letter to his father, Judge Stephen Vail, Alfred wrote, [...] "Professor Morse has invented a new plan of an alphabet, and has thrown aside the Dictionaries." [...] In an 1845 book Vail wrote describing Morse's telegraph, he also attributed the code to Morse.|$|R
2500|$|As severe as {{the damage}} to the city's {{buildings}} was, the human toll was even greater. Because of the destruction of the bridges to the mainland and the <b>telegraph</b> lines, no <b>word</b> of the city's destruction was able to reach the mainland. At 11a.m. on September 9, one of the few ships at the Galveston wharfs to survive the storm, the Pherabe, arrived in Texas City on the western side of Galveston Bay. It carried six messengers from the city. When they reached the telegraph office in Houston at 3a.m. on September 10, a short message was sent to Texas Governor Joseph D. Sayers and U.S. President William McKinley: [...] "I have been deputized by the mayor and Citizen's Committee of Galveston to inform you that the city of Galveston is in ruins." [...] The messengers reported an estimated five hundred dead; this was considered to be an exaggeration at the time.|$|R
5000|$|McKay {{convinced}} his own editor David McNicoll and Telegraph owner Packer {{to get involved}} in the event, which they did with co-sponsorship (it reportedly took less than 5 minutes to convince the astute Packer). McKay also convinced GMH to get involved by supplying him with three of the yet to be released Holden Monaros in which to run in the event. Contrary to popular belief at the time, the Monaros were actually prepared for the 7,000 mi Marathon that would travel through eleven countries by GMH under the supervision of its Sales Director John Bagshaw and chief engineer Bill Steinhagen, and not by Scuderia Veloce. Also, the cars would not be entered under the name of Scuderia Veloce or the Holden Dealer Racing Team, but instead were entered in the event under the name of their major sponsor, The Sydney <b>Telegraph,</b> with the <b>words</b> [...] "Sydney <b>Telegraph</b> Racing" [...] prominently painted on the side of the cars.|$|R
2500|$|Wheatstone further {{invented the}} {{automatic}} transmitter, {{in which the}} signals of the message are first punched out on a strip of paper, which is then passed through the sending-key, and controls the signal currents. By substituting a mechanism for the hand in sending the message, {{he was able to}} <b>telegraph</b> about 100 <b>words</b> a minute, or five times the ordinary rate. In the Postal Telegraph service this apparatus is employed for sending Press telegrams, and it has recently been so much improved, that messages are now sent from London to Bristol at a speed of 600 words a minute, and even of 400 words a minute between London and Aberdeen. On the night of 8 April 1886, when Mr. Gladstone introduced his Bill for Home Rule in Ireland, no fewer than 1,500,000 words were dispatched from the central station at St. Martin's-le-Grand by 100 Wheatstone transmitters. The plan of sending messages by a running strip of paper which actuates the key was originally patented by Bain in 1846; but Wheatstone, aided by Mr. Augustus Stroh, an accomplished mechanician, and an able experimenter, was the first to bring the idea into successful operation. This system {{is often referred to as}} the Wheatstone Perforator and is the forerunner of the stock market Ticker tape ...|$|R
