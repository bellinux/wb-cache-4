25|$|The {{ventilation}} system maintains the air {{pressure in the}} service tunnel {{higher than in the}} rail tunnels, so that {{in the event of a}} fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels. Two cooling water pipes in each rail tunnel circulate chilled water <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> generated by the rail traffic. Pumping stations remove water in the tunnels from rain, seepage, and so on.|$|E
25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking. These cans were placed into a cooled water bath <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> {{and keep them}} cool until {{they were able to}} be transported to a collection facility. As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk milk cooler. 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk milk cooler. This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|E
25|$|This {{cooling method}} {{worked well for}} smaller dairies, however was fairly inefficient {{and was unable to}} meet the {{increasingly}} higher cooling demand of larger milking parlors. In the mid-1950s direct expansion refrigeration was first applied directly to the bulk milk cooler. This type of cooling utilizes an evaporator built directly into the inner wall of the storage tank <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> from the milk. Direct expansion is able to cool milk at a much faster rate than early ice bank type coolers and is still the primary method for bulk tank cooling today on small to medium-sized operations.|$|E

25|$|Another device {{which has}} contributed {{significantly}} to milk quality is the plate heat exchanger (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed stainless steel plates with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other set of plates with water being passed between {{the balance of the}} plates <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> from the milk. This method of cooling can remove large amounts of heat from the milk in a very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving milk quality. Ground water is the most common source of cooling medium for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE's can result in drastically improved milk quality, reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his bulk milk cooler, and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.|$|E
2500|$|When body {{temperature}} is significantly elevated, mechanical cooling methods are used <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> and {{to restore the}} body's ability to regulate its own temperatures. [...] Passive cooling techniques, such as resting in a cool, shady area and removing clothing can be applied immediately. [...] Active cooling methods, such as sponging the head, neck, and trunk with cool water, remove heat from the body and thereby speed the body's return to normal temperatures. [...] Drinking water and turning a fan or dehumidifying air conditioning unit on the affected person may improve {{the effectiveness of the}} body's evaporative cooling mechanisms (sweating).|$|E
2500|$|Industrial {{cooling towers}} {{can be used}} <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> from various sources such as {{machinery}} or heated process material. [...] The primary use of large, industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating cooling water systems used in power plants, petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants, food processing plants, semi-conductor plants, and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns, for cooling liquid in crystallization, etc. The circulation rate of cooling water in a typical 700 MW coal-fired power plant with a cooling tower amounts to about 71,600 cubic metres an hour (315,000 US gallons per minute) and the circulating water requires a supply water make-up rate of perhaps 5 percent (i.e., 3,600 cubic metres an hour).|$|E

2500|$|The {{applications}} of ultrasonic welding are extensive and {{are found in}} many industries including electrical and computer, automotive and aerospace, medical, and packaging. [...] Whether two items can be ultrasonically welded is determined by their thickness. [...] If they are too thick this process will not join them. [...] This is the main obstacle in the welding of metals. [...] However, wires, microcircuit connections, sheet metal, foils, ribbons and meshes are often joined using ultrasonic welding. [...] Ultrasonic welding is a very popular technique for bonding thermoplastics. [...] It is fast and easily automated with weld times often below one second {{and there is no}} ventilation system required <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> or exhaust. [...] This type of welding is often used to build assemblies that are too small, too complex, or too delicate for more common welding techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Cooling towers {{are also}} used in HVAC systems that have {{multiple}} water source heat pumps that share a common piping water loop. In this type of system, the water circulating inside the water loop removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the cooling mode, then the externally mounted cooling tower is used <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> from the water loop and reject it to the atmosphere. [...] By contrast, when the heat pumps are working in heating mode, the condensers draw heat {{out of the loop}} water and reject it into the space to be heated. [...] When the water loop is being used primarily to supply heat to the building, the cooling tower is normally shut down (and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage), and heat is supplied by other means, usually from separate boilers.|$|E

50|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} coolant is a coolant {{in a nuclear}} reactor used <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> from the nuclear reactor core and {{transfer}} it to electrical generators and the environment.Frequently, a chain of two coolant loops are used because the primary coolant loop takes on short-term radioactivity from the reactor.|$|E

5000|$|Though {{not very}} popular in North America, another type of water heater {{developed}} in Europe predated the storage model. In London, England, in 1868, a painter named Benjamin Waddy Maughan invented the first instantaneous domestic water heater that did not use solid fuel. Named the geyser after an Icelandic gushing hot spring, Maughan's invention made cold water at the top flow through pipes that were heated by hot gases from a burner at the bottom. Hot water then flowed into a sink or tub. The invention was somewhat dangerous {{because there was no}} flue <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>heated</b> gases from the bathroom.
