40|$|This study {{fills the}} {{research}} {{gap in the}} exploration of the relationships between both proactive and reactive green innovations and green product development performance, and examines the mediating effect of <b>green</b> <b>creativity.</b> Structural equation modeling (SEM) is utilized to test the hypotheses. From the sample of 146 valid respondents, the results show that proactive green innovation positively affects <b>green</b> <b>creativity</b> and <b>green</b> product development performance, and <b>green</b> <b>creativity</b> positively affects <b>green</b> product development performance. In addition, our findings also indicate that the relationship between proactive green innovation and green product development performance is partially mediated by <b>green</b> <b>creativity.</b> Accordingly, <b>green</b> <b>creativity</b> plays a critical role for companies to achieve a great green product development performance. However, reactive green innovation does not significantly influence <b>green</b> <b>creativity</b> and <b>green</b> product development performance. Companies should develop proactive green innovation rather than reactive green innovation in order to enhance their <b>green</b> <b>creativity</b> and increase their product development performance...|$|R
