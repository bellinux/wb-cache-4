5|$|During World War I, {{the ship}} escorted Indian troops from Bombay to Aden from September–November 1914. She was <b>then</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> the Suez Canal Patrol on 1 December to help defend the Canal. From 27 January to 4 February 1915, the ship helped {{to defend the}} Canal during the First Suez Offensive by Ottoman forces. Swiftsure was <b>then</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> the Dardanelles on 28 February and saw action in the Dardanelles Campaign bombarding Ottoman fortifications. She was {{assigned}} to the 9th Cruiser Squadron for escort duties in the Atlantic in February 1916. On 11 April 1917, the ship arrived at Chatham where she was paid off and placed in reserve to provide crews for anti-submarine vessels. Swiftsure was refitted in mid-1917 and was used as an accommodation ship from February 1918. Later that year, the ship was disarmed and stripped in order {{to be used as a}} blockship during a proposed second raid on Ostend. The war ended, however, before this was carried out and she was briefly used as a target ship before she was listed for sale in March 1920. Swiftsure was sold for scrap on 18 June 1920 to the Stanlee Shipbreaking Company.|$|E

50|$|After being {{released}} from PSII, PQH2 travels to the cytochrome b6f complex which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> two electrons from PQH2 to plastocyanin in two separate reactions. The process that occurs {{is similar to the}} Q-cycle in Complex III of the electron transport chain. In the first reaction, PQH2 binds to the complex on the lumen side and one electron is <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> the iron-sulfur center which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it <b>to</b> cytochrome f which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it <b>to</b> plastocyanin. The second electron is <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> heme bL which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it <b>to</b> heme bH which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it <b>to</b> PQ. In the second reaction, a second PQH2 gets oxidized, adding an electron to another plastocyanin and PQ.Both reactions together transfer four protons into the lumen.|$|R
5|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} {{exocytosis}} and endocytosis processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances {{are taken into}} the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and <b>then</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> a vacuole. There {{are two types of}} endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July the {{regiment}} was relocated again, {{this time in}} the vicinity of Orléans where it was based for four weeks. The regiment was ordered to detach two Panzer companies and the headquarters unit of the I. Abteilung (1st Department). These units, augmented by other Panzer companies, formed four Schwimm-Panzerabteilungen (amphibious tank departments) for Operation Sea Lion, the planned and aborted invasion of the United Kingdom. The remnants of Panzer-Regiment 2 were <b>then</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> East Prussia, where they were based at Heiligenbeil, present-day Mamonovo.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{targeted}} for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue {{that requires the}} coordinated reactions of three enzymes. In the first step, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (known as E1) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule. This is <b>then</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> E1's active-site cysteine residue {{in concert with the}} adenylylation of a second ubiquitin. This adenylylated ubiquitin is <b>then</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> a cysteine of a second enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the last step, a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases (E3) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein. A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid. It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system. The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type, but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system.|$|E
5|$|She {{captured}} a German merchant ship {{days after the}} beginning of World War I in August 1914 and was then sent to the Central Atlantic to search for German commerce raiders. Later that year, the ship {{was assigned to the}} squadron that destroyed the German East Asia Squadron at the Battle of the Falklands, where she helped to sink a German light cruiser. Cornwall briefly blockaded a German cruiser in East Africa in early 1915 before she was sent to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign a month later. The ship was <b>then</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> the China Station late in the year and remained there until the end of 1916. She was <b>then</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> the North America Station that year for convoy escort duties and remained on that duty {{for the rest of the}} war. Cornwall became a training ship in 1919 before she was paid off later that year. The ship was sold for scrap in 1920.|$|E
