Whoever is the enemy of la France is the enemy of Raoul Yvard. Honorable seamen, like yourselves, Messieurs, can understand this. I am young. My heart is not made of rock; evil as it may be, it can love beauty and modesty and virtue in the other sex. Such has been my fate--I love Ghita Caraccioli; have endeavored to make her my wife {{for more than a}} year. She has not authorized me to say that my suit was favored--this I must acknowledge; but she is not the less admirable for that. We differ in our opinions of religion, and I fear she left Monte Argentaro because, refusing my hand, she thought it better, perhaps, that we should not meet again. It is so with maidens, as you must know, Messieurs. But it is not usual for us, who are less refined, to submit to such self-denial. I learned whither Ghita had come, and followed; my heart was a magnet, that her beauty drew after it, as our needles are drawn toward the pole. It was necessary to go into the Bay of Naples, among the vessels of enemies, to find her I loved; {{and this is a very}} different thing from engaging in the pitiful attempts of a spy. Which of you would not have done the same, Messieurs? You are braves Anglais, and I know you would not hesitate. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> still youthful, like myself, and must still feel the power of beauty; even the Monsieur that is no longer a young man has had his moments of passion, like all that are born of woman.

5000|$|To {{place this}} problem in more common terms, imagine you are talking to someone 6 meters away. If the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in a quiet, empty room then a {{conversation}} is quite easy to hold at normal voice levels. In a loud, crowded bar, {{it would be impossible}} to hear the same voice level, and the only solution (for that distance) is for both you and your friend to speak louder. Of course, this increases the overall noise level in the bar, and every other patron has to talk louder too (this is equivalent to power control runaway). Eventually, everyone has to shout to make themselves heard by a person standing right beside them, and it is impossible to communicate with anyone more than half a meter away. (In general, however, a human is very capable of filtering out loud sounds; similar techniques can be deployed in signal processing where suitable criteria for distinguishing between signals can be established, see signal processing and notably adaptive signal processing.) ...|$|E

The <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in separate rooms and cannot exchange information. A coin toss decides which of you will propose how to share the money. Suppose that you are the proposer. You can make a single offer of how to split the sum, and the other person-the responder-can say yes or no. The responder also knows the rules and the total amount of money at stake. If her answer is yes, the deal goes ahead. If her answer is no, neither of you gets anything. In both cases, the game is over and will not be repeated. What will you do? Instinctively, many people feel they should offer 50 percent, because such a division is "fair" and therefore likely to be accepted. More daring people, however, think they might get away with offering somewhat less than half of the sum...|$|E

40|$|Consider the following: You, a Maine resident, {{and your}} friend, a Massachusetts resident, have {{gone for a}} weekend trout fishing trip to Acadia National Park in Downeast Maine. The <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> happily {{catching}} trout, and then each of you hook a bass and reel it in. Keeping the bass is illegal under Maine law but not banned by the National Park. Along comes a Maine game warden, who spies {{the two of you}} and cites only you with a fine for catching and keeping the bass. The warden says nothing to the Massachusetts resident who continues to fish, catching and keeping trout and bass, unmolested and without having his pockets lightened. A humorous scenario. Yet, an analogous enforcement dissonance is the norm in federal waters off of the coast of Maine with much larger consequences. The United States has the largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the world with 3. 4 million square miles of ocean. This vast swath of ocean helps support a $ 24 billion dollar domestic fisheries industry. The American lobster, Homarus americanus, is a crustacean found in the Western North Atlantic. This species of lobster ranges along the coast from Labrador, Canada to Virginia, and within the EEZ, out along the outer continental shelf and slope, the lobster ranges from Georges Bank to North Carolina. The lobster has very valuable and delicious meat contained in its tail and claws and is the focus of an economically important fishery in the Northeast United States, including in the EEZ off of Maine. Yet, in the EEZ, there are some seemingly unfair fishing practices occurring. In the same waters, non-Maine fishermen are allowed to keep and sell lobsters caught as a result of dragging bycatch whereas Maine fishermen are not. This creates an inequitable economic advantage for out of state fishermen, pushes valuable fishery dollars out of Maine, and results in a lack of uniformity in fisheries conservation enforcement. In 2010, in State v. Thomas, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law Court, correctly adjudged that this issue is one for the legislature and not for the courts. Defendant Thomas was caught in the net of this patchwork fisheries law. This Note will examine the relevant law, discuss the Law Court’s decision in State v. Thomas, and suggest possible approaches the Maine legislature could take to resolve the issue...|$|E
