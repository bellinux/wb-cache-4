This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean.|$|E

The approach follows in the <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work of Kenneth Goodpaster and Paul Taylor, though Varner's approach differs from Taylor's in its focus on interests rather than duties, with Varner showing clear utilitarian commitments.|$|E
