This paper seeks to analyze the relationship between final year accouting students’ perceived coverage <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> education and the overall sufficiency of the three areas in higher-learning institutions. Learning objectives {{were used to determine}} the sufficiency <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> education in current accounting curriculum and a brief comparison between different higher learning institutions in Malaysia, students with and without internship experience, and test of ethical conduct was performed. Findings include insufficient coverage in the areas <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> examination and forensic accounting but not auditing and that the students’ perceived coverage <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> education depends on the sufficiency <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> examination and forensic accounting areas. The paper only tested the perception aspect of students and results may differ depending on student’s aptitude in learning. This study provides valuable input to redesigning the current accounting curriculum to expose students to fraud-based learning environment and also incorporating forensic accounting courses. It seeks to regain society’s confidence in the accounting profession through improved fraud detection. The research will add value to the accounting education offered to undergraduates as very little prior research has been done to provide insights in students’ (end-user) perception <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> education...|$|R

In this article, the extent to which predictors <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> victimization are the same as the predictors <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> reporting is examined. Using a national sample <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> victims, these findings were consistent with prior research in that involvement in risky behaviors and age were found to be important predictors <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> victimization. Additionally, the specific factors that are influential in predicting fraud victimization appear to vary across offense type. Unfortunately, little was revealed regarding the predictors of the official reporting <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> victimizations. Future research needs to further unravel the importance of risky behavior in both victimization and reporting, as well as to focus on a broader array of white-collar crimes. ...|$|R

40|$|Several {{previous}} studies have pointed out {{the need for the}} use of a more robust statistical methodology in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of all forms <b>of</b> <b>fraud.</b> In this paper, we studied the aetiology <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> proposed by Cressey (1973) by examining two models that incorporated rationalisation into causal relationships within a fraud commission model and hence <b>of</b> a <b>fraud</b> risk model. A sample of 122 Indonesian respondents, who had ever encountered any forms <b>of</b> <b>fraud,</b> was used to test two theory based structural equations models. Because of the poor fit of the two theoretical models to the data as shown by the SRMR index and because the path between rationalisation and commission <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> was found to be non-significant, an exploratory research process was used to derive a further model. The outcome of this process was the introduction of additional paths into the second theoretical model. This model was tested using another sample of 122 respondents and produced a good fit to the data. Significant direct and indirect drivers <b>of</b> commission <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> were identified and these extended the theory and introduced the consideration of a wider range <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> risk factors for the global audit profession. Collusion was perceived to be the strongest direct influence on commission <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> with a lesser effect arising from opportunity for fraud and a final direct influence arising from the avoidance of justice. In addition, organisational orientation was perceived to provide another indirect influence on the commission <b>of</b> <b>fraud.</b> The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings...|$|R

Enormous cases <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> have occurred since the Comstock Lode, and the methods <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> are largely similar.

The author of the thesis deals with the characterization <b>of</b> facts <b>of</b> <b>fraud.</b> Property fraud (Section 209) is a damage crime, but the special forms <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> have features <b>of</b> pre-accomplished crime (preparation of crime). Fraudster's criminal liability for insurance, loan or subsidy fraud is rather larger than criminal liability for general type <b>of</b> <b>fraud.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> the judicial decisions of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court of the Czech republic is {{one part of the}} diploma thesis. From the results of the analysis the author concludes that there is a personal criminal liability for fraud when the perpetrator sues for a fake debt. This kind of deceptive activity is an attempt of crime <b>of</b> the <b>fraud.</b> The difference between special type <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> (insurance, loan or subsidy Sec. 210 - 212 Criminal code) and general fraud (Sec. 209 Criminal code) is evident also in the level of evidence.

The thesis is composed of six chapters, the first chapter dealing with the general term of economic, financial and property delinquency, while the other chapters investigate particularity <b>of</b> different <b>fraud</b> types <b>of</b> the Czech criminal regulation. The methodology employed was {{a review of the}} judicial decisions offering contradictory interpretation <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> statutes. Privatisation process in 1990 's started the growing trend of fraudulent actions when some people identified the lack of regulations and opportunity for gaining profit out of it.

Although all the fraudulent activities were punishable pursuant the provision <b>of</b> <b>fraud,</b> damage was not always possible to be proven.
