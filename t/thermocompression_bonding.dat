Compliant bonding is a unique method of forming this type of solid state bond between a gold lead and a gold surface since heat and pressure is transmitted through a compliant or deformable media. The use of the compliant medium ensures the physical integrity of the lead by controlling the extent of wire deformation. The process also allows one to bond a multiple number of gold wires of various dimensions simultaneously since the compliant media ensures contacting and deforming all the lead wires.|$|R

Two metals, e.g. gold (Au)-gold (Au), are brought into atomic contact applying force and heat simultaneously. The diffusion requires atomic contact between the surfaces due to the atomic motion. The atoms migrate from one crystal lattice to the other one based on crystal lattice vibration. This atomic interaction sticks the interface together.The diffusion process is described by the following three processes: ...|$|E
50|$|At present, the {{majority}} of connections to the silicon integrated circuit chip are made using thermosonic bonding because it employs lower bonding temperatures, forces and dwell times than <b>thermocompression</b> <b>bonding,</b> as well as lower vibratory energy levels and forces than ultrasonic bonding to form the required bond area. Therefore the use of thermosonic bonding eliminates damaging the relatively fragile silicon integrated circuit chip during the bonding cycle. The proven reliability of thermosonic bonding has made it the process of choice, since such potential failure modes could be costly whether they occur during the manufacturing stage or detected later, during an operational field-failure of a chip which had been connected inside a computer or a myriad of other microelectronic devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{two forms}} of {{integrated}} circuits discussed above were the beam leaded integrated circuit composed of attached electroformed gold leads or beams (Figure 5) and the silicon integrated circuit chip (Figure 6). With respect to the beam leaded silicon chip, both compliant and <b>thermocompression</b> <b>bonding</b> can be employed since each have their advantages. At this time, {{the most widely used}} form is the silicon integrated circuit chip, without the beam leads, which therefore requires electrical connections directly to the metallized silicon Chip (Figure 6). If wire connections is the method of choice to form these connections, thermosonic bonding gold wires directly to the silicon chip has been the process most widely used because of its proven reliability {{as a result of the}} low bonding parameters of force, temperature and time needed to form the bond.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thermocompression</b> <b>bonded</b> gold-gold (Au-Au) {{interfaces}} {{were investigated}} using electron microscopy {{to study the}} micro- and nanostructure post-bonding. Analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Au-Au interfaces at different bonding temperatures, ranging from 150 °C to 250 °C, produced {{a relationship between the}} size, shape and distribution of interfacial voids {{and the quality of the}} bond. The lowest bonding temperature, 150 °C, had the highest linear and area fraction of voids, as measured from cross-sectional and plan-view SEM images, respectively. The 250 °C bonded devices had the highest hermetic test yield and the lowest void linear and area fractions of the temperatures measured. Cross sectional images of the voids in the 250 °C sample show that voids appear to exist at the triple boundary between the bonding interface and two grains on one side of the interface. 	Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the growth of grains in Au-Au <b>thermocompression</b> <b>bonded</b> interfaces where one of the Au layers is nanotwinned (ntAu). During bonding, the ntAu was shown to partially “detwin”, resulting in a large grain that extends across the bonding interface, which may be indicative of high quality bonds. TEM images of the interface identified grains in the non-nanotwinned Au layer that either did or did not extend across the interface and electron diffraction was used to determine the orientation of each grain. The grains which had (111) planes oriented within 17 ° of the (111) plane in the ntAu layer grew across the interface while those with larger orientation angles did not. There was no correlation between cross-interfacial growth and orientation of the (100) plane. Additionally, gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanostubs deposited on silicon (Si) were investigated to study the production of stacking faults, including nanotwins, at different growth temperatures (590 °C, 605 °C and 620 °C) and its possible role as a strain relaxation process in the latticed-mismatched GaAs-Si interface. All nanostubs imaged using TEM showed stacking faults, with the highest area fraction of stacking faults in the 605 °C sample. This sample also was the only temperature to produce imaged nanotwins. The strain the GaAs was measured using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the TEM lattice images and was found to be lowest in the 605 °C, leading to a potential correlation between stacking faults and/or nanotwins and strain relaxation...|$|R

The nanoklystron employs a separately fabricated cathode structure composed of densely packed carbon nanotube field emitters and an add-in repeller. The nanotube cathode is expected to increase the current density, extend the cathode life and decrease the required oscillation voltage to values below 100 V. The excitation cavity is based on ridged-waveguide and differs from the conventional cylindrical re-entrant structures found in lower frequency klystrons. A quasi-static field analysis of the cavity and output coupling structure show excellent control of the quality factor and desired field distribution. Output power is expected to occur through an iris coupled matched rectangular waveguide and integrated pyramidal feed horn.

5000|$|An {{important}} {{application for}} compliant bonding {{arose in the}} early 1960s, when techniques were developed for fabricating a “beam leaded silicon integrated circuit “chip” consisting of pre-attached electroformed 0.005-inch thick gold leads or “beams” extending from the silicon chip (Figure 5). Thus the beam leaded “chip” eliminated the need to thermosonically bond wires directly onto metallized pads of the fragile silicon chip (as shown in Figure 6) The extended ends of the electroformed beams could then be permanently solid-state bonded to a matching metallized sunburst circuit which has been pre-deposted on a ceramic substrate appropriately packaged in a computer in the making. Figure 7. shows a preshaped hard faced tool <b>thermocompression</b> <b>bonding</b> all of the beam leads of a chip in one bonding cycle. In order to avoid excessively deforming the fine beam leads with the hard bonding tool and putting them at risk of mechanical failure, the applied bonding forces have to be carefully monitored.The invention of compliant bonding eliminated {{the problems associated with}} a hard faced bonding tool and therefore was ideally suited to simultaneously bond all of the extended electroplated gold beam leads to a matching gold metallized sunburst patterned ceramic substrate packaged in a computer (Figure 8). For example, compliant bonding eliminated the problems of using a hard faced bonding tool such as: attempting to uniformly deform the nominally 0.005-inch thick beams leads having slight variations in their thickness; excessive lead deformation that could cause mechanical damage and an ultimate [...] "costly" [...] failure of these fine beam leaded silicon chips which are the [...] "brains" [...] of our computers. The compliant bonding tape media offered the additional advantage of carrying the [...] "beam leaded silicon chip" [...] to the bonding site thus facilitating production. Figures 9. and 10 show that the compliant tape offers the advantage of carrying the beam leaded chip to the bonding site as discussed above. Figure 11 shows a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit compliantly bonded to a gold metallized sunburst pattern deposited on an alumina ceramic substrate which will be encapsulated and packaged in a computer-type device. Figure 12 shows the spent compliant member used to bond the chip in Figure 11 which clearly shows a mirror image of the uniformly bonded beam leads.|$|E
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{in the mid}} 1960s, Alexander Coucoulas, {{reported the}} first thermosonic wire bonds {{using a combination of}} heat, ultrasonic vibrations and pressure which led to his first invention. He first set up a commercial ultrasonic wire bonder (capable of transmitting vibratory energy and pressure) in order to investigate the attachment of aluminum wires to tantalum thin films deposited on glass substrates which simulated bonding a lead wire to the fragile metallized silicon integrated circuit [...] "chip". He observed that the ultrasonic energy and pressures levels needed to sufficiently deform the wire and form the required contact areas significantly increased the incidences of cracks in the glass or silicon chip substrates. A means of heating the bond region was then added to the ultrasonic bonder. The bond region was then heated during the ultrasonic bonding cycle which virtually eliminated the glass failure mode since the wire dramatically deformed to form the required contact area while using significantly lower ultrasonic energy and pressure levels. The enhanced wire deformation during the ultrasonic bonding cycle was attributed to the transition from cold working (or strain hardening of the wire) to near hot working conditions where its softness was enhanced. As the bonding temperature was increased the onset of recrystallization (softening mechanism) occurs where the strain hardening is most extensive. Thus the dual mechanisms of thermal softening and ultrasonic softening which is caused by vibratory energy interacting at the atomic lattice level, facilitated the desired wire deformation. Christian Hagar and George Harman stated that in 1970 Alexander Coucoulas reported additional work in forming thermosonic-type bonds which he initially called hot work ultrasonic bonding. In this case, copper wires were bonded to palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide substrates. As a result of these earliest reported thermosonic wire bonds, G.Harman stated [...] "as such, Alexander Coucoulas is the Father of Thermosonic Bonding".At present, the majority of connections to silicon integrated circuits (the chip) are made using thermosonic bonding because it employs lower bonding temperatures, forces and dwell times than <b>thermocompression</b> <b>bonding,</b> as well as lower vibratory energy levels than ultrasonic bonding, to form the required bond area.

For gold-gold thermo-compression bonding tiny bumps with 20 to 50 µm diameter are deposited on a silicon wafer. The wafer is diced and chips are bonded typically with 200 MPa bonding pressure at 300 °C to form all the electrical and mechanical interconnects in one step. We have developed a method to fabricate gold bumps with an open-porous cellular structure on wafer level. First a Au-Ag alloy of 10 to 15 µm thickness was electroplated into a lithographic structured resist mask which defines the bump pattern on the wafer.
