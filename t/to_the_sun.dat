5|$|A sungrazing comet is a comet {{that passes}} {{extremely}} close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> at perihelion, generally {{within a few}} million kilometres. Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers have {{discovered}} nearly 500 planetary systems with multiple planets. Regularly these systems include a few planets with masses several {{times greater than}} Earth's (super-Earths), orbiting closer to their star than Mercury is <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> and sometimes also Jupiter-mass gas giants close to their star.|$|E

5|$|Juno orbits at a {{slightly}} closer mean distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> than Ceres or Pallas. Its orbit is moderately inclined at around 12° to the ecliptic, but has an extreme eccentricity, {{greater than that}} of Pluto. This high eccentricity brings Juno closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> at perihelion than Vesta and further out at aphelion than Ceres. Juno had the most eccentric orbit of any known body until 33 Polyhymnia was discovered in 1854, and of asteroids over 200km in diameter only 324 Bamberga has a more eccentric orbit.|$|E

50|$|An {{example that}} clearly states what false cause is {{can be given}} by, Every time I go <b>to</b> sleep, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> goes down. Therefore, my going <b>to</b> sleep causes <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> set.|$|R
5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe {{the orbits of}} objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly {{because they are more}} affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.|$|E
5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm over a small area, to {{gigantic}} storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E
5|$|Some American {{alligators}} {{are missing}} an inhibited gene for melanin, {{which makes them}} albino.

25|$|At one {{location}} in Wyoming, {{a small group}} of astronomers used telescopic lenses <b>to</b> photograph <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> as it was in partial eclipse, while the ISS was also seen <b>to</b> briefly transit <b>the</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|R
25|$|From 2004–2006, the Heat and the Lakers met on Christmas Day <b>to</b> {{emphasize}} <b>the</b> Shaq-Kobe battle.

50|$|January 23, 2014: Archie Goodwin gets {{assigned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Suns' D-League affiliate, the Bakersfield Jam, for two games. Goodwin {{would return}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> for <b>the</b> road {{game against the}} Cleveland Cavaliers on January 26, 2014.|$|R
5|$|Some {{scholars}} theorise {{that the}} galactic tide {{may have contributed}} to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest distances <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun)</b> of planetesimals with large aphelia (largest distances <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun).</b> The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect can be quite significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide. Statistical models of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The aphelion, or {{farthest}} {{point from}} the Sun, {{would be in}} the general direction of the constellation of Taurus, whereas the perihelion, the nearest point <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> {{would be in the}} general direction of the southerly areas of Serpens (Caput), Ophiuchus, and Libra.|$|E

5|$|The two orbits do not intersect. When Pluto is closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> {{and hence}} closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, {{it is also}} the {{farthest}} above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 AU above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.|$|E
5|$|There are exoplanets {{that are}} much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> {{and there are also}} exoplanets {{that are much}} farther from their star. Mercury, the closest planet <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> at 0.4 AU, takes 88-days for an orbit, but the {{shortest}} known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. Kepler-70b. The Kepler-11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury's, all of them much more massive than Mercury. Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of AU from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit, e.g. 1RXS1609 b.|$|E
5|$|There are {{relatively}} few stars within ten light-years of the Sun. The closest is the triple star system Alpha Centauri, {{which is about}} 4.4 light-years away. Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the small red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair {{at a distance of}} 0.2 light-year. In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was confirmed to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> The stars next closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> are the red dwarfs Barnard's Star (at 5.9ly), Wolf 359 (7.8ly), and Lalande 21185 (8.3ly).|$|E

50|$|In Javanese mythology, Batara Kala is {{the cause}} of the solar and lunar eclipses.

Sometimes he will try <b>to</b> devour <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> or Moon, causing an eclipse. When this eclipse happens, Javanese villagers will try <b>to</b> save <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> or Moon by offering sacrifices and banging lesung (traditional rice hulling equipment) or slit drums, to cause noise and make Batara Kala vomit. This is thought <b>to</b> release <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> or Moon and stop the eclipse.|$|R
