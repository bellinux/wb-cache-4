5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways. The eagle nest {{is represented by the}} fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used {{during the course of the}} dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E
5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> in the video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E

50|$|Symbolically, spires {{have two}} functions. Traditionally, {{one has been}} to {{proclaim}} a martial power of religion. A spire, with its reminiscence of the spear point, gives the impression of strength. The second is to reach up <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>skies.</b> <b>The</b> celestial and hopeful gesture of the spire is one reason for its association with religious buildings. A spire on a church or cathedral {{is not just a}} symbol of piety, but is often seen {{as a symbol of the}} wealth and prestige of the order, or patron who commissioned the building.|$|R

25|$|Like the {{two other}} examples, in plaster and stone, L'Âme de la France in bronze is a statue 3.20 m high. It depicts a helmeted female warrior {{stretching}} her two arms <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> her right hand ending in a delicate little spray of flowers and, by contrast, her left fist forcefully gripping a shield slipped onto her forearm.|$|E
25|$|L'Âme de la France (“The Soul of France”) is {{the name}} given by the French {{sculptor}} Carlo Sarrabezolles to three identical monumental statues that he executed in three different materials during the interwar period, the first in plaster in 1921, the second in stone in 1922, and the last in bronze in 1930. 3.2 metres tall, they represent a female warrior with naked breasts raising her arms <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E
25|$|The columned porch, or talar, {{seen in the}} rock-cut tombs near Persepolis, {{reappear}} in Sassanid temples, and in late Islamic {{times it}} {{was used as the}} portico of a palace or mosque, and adapted even to the architecture of roadside tea-houses. Similarly, the dome on four arches, so characteristic of Sassanid times, is a still to be found in many cemeteries and Imamzadehs across Iran today. The notion of earthly towers reaching up <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> to mingle with the divine towers of heaven lasted into the 19th century, while the interior court and pool, the angled entrance and extensive decoration are ancient, but still common, features of Iranian architecture.|$|E

No, no; up you go: fat or lean: Lambert or Edson: never mind how much avoirdupois you might weigh.

Adan learned that another force was also meeting stiff resistance in the green belt north of the town, and could spare only one battalion, in addition to another battalion from near Shalufa. Zaken's battalion had eighteen men killed, thirty-five wounded and three disabled tanks which were abandoned. Adan ordered the paratroopers {{to get out of}} the city on foot. Hisdai and Keren spoke in the Hebrew equivalent of pig latin to confuse the Egyptians, and Hisdai asked to have tank projectors beam lights <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> to indicate the location of the nearest Israeli unit.

25|$|Outdooring ceremonies {{can vary}} in {{practice}} {{among the different}} Ghanaian ethnic groups. The Ga place drops of water and alcohol onto the child's tongue to symbolize teaching them the difference between good and evil, and they may also place a piece of food such as kenkey so the child will appreciate a staple food of the Ga. Some groups practice raising the baby <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> three times to introduce them to heaven and Earth. Libations are also poured and live sacrifices of chickens or goats are made to ensure good health and protect the child from evil. The father or an elder will call out the child's name for the guests to repeat aloud to formally welcome the child into the community. After the naming concludes, friends and relatives give gifts to the family, and feasting and dancing follows.|$|E

Hatosy seems {{to be interested in}} Johansson and Timberlake asks him to [...] "keep an eye on her for me", perhaps suspecting she has another man on the side. Timberlake returns and finds them kissing in the stairway. After punching Hatosy, he chases after Johansson, who speeds off in her 1967 Chevrolet Corvette C2 Sting Ray; Timberlake follows in his Porsche Carrera GT. Johansson runs into a fiery car crash pile up and is ejected from the car as it tumbles through the air and lands several feet away 2 times. Timberlake notices a motionless body lying supine on the ground. He gets out and kneels over her while the camera view moves <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E
500|$|Pierce {{returns to}} the {{farmstead}} shortly after with six other men, including a doctor, who begin examining Nahum's remains. They discover both Merwin and Zenas' eroding skeletons {{at the bottom of}} the well, as well as remnants of several other creatures. As they reflect upon their discoveries in the house, a light begins to emit from the well that eventually transforms into the [...] "colour" [...] and begins pouring out, spreading over everything nearby. The men flee the house just as the horror blights the land and then shoots <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Pierce alone turns back after the [...] "colour" [...] has gone and witnesses a small part of it try to follow the rest, only to fail and return to the well. The knowledge that part of the alien still resides on earth is sufficient to alter his mental state. When some of the men return the following day, there is nothing remaining but a dead horse and acres of grey dust, and the surrounding area is quickly abandoned by all of its remaining residents.|$|E
500|$|The {{bird's-eye view}} of the {{engraving}} by Étienne Dupérac shows Michelangelo's solution {{to the problems of}} the space in the Piazza del Campidoglio. Even with their new facades centering them on the new palazzo at the rear, the space was a trapezoid, and the facades did not face each other squarely. [...] Worse still, the whole site sloped (to the left in the engraving). Michelangelo's solution was radical. The three remodelled palazzi enclose a harmonious trapezoidal space, approached by the ramped staircase called the [...] "Cordonata". The stepped ramp of the cordonata was intended, like a slow-moving escalator, to lift its visitors <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and deposit them on the threshold of municipal authority. Since no [...] "perfect" [...] forms would work within the dimension of the plaza, his apparent oval in the paving is actually egg-shaped, narrower at one end than at the other. The oval shape combined with the diamond pattern within it was a play on the previous Renaissance geometries of the circle and square. [...] The travertine design set into the paving is perfectly level: Around its perimeter, low steps arise and die away into the paving as the slope requires. Its centre springs slightly, so that one senses that he/she is standing on the exposed segment of a gigantic egg all but buried at the centre of the city at the centre of the world, as Michelangelo's historian Charles de Tolnay pointed out. An interlaced twelve-pointed star makes a subtle reference to the constellations, revolving around this space called Caput mundi, Latin for [...] "head of the world." [...] This paving design was never executed by the popes, who may have detected a subtext of less-than-Christian import, but Benito Mussolini ordered the paving completed to Michelangelo's design in 1940. [...] Michelangelo looked at the center to find a solution to the Capitoline disorder. [...] The statue provided a center and a focus. [...] The buildings defined the space, and it is this space as much as the buildings, that is the impressive achievement of the Capitoline complex. It is a giant outdoor room, a plaza enclosed and protected but open to the sky and accessible through five symmetrical openings. Axiality and symmetry govern all parts of the Campidoglio. [...] The aspect of the piazza that makes this most immediately apparent is the central statue, with the paving pattern directing the visitors’ eyes to its base. [...] Michelangelo also gave the medieval Palazzo del Senatore a central campanile, a renovated façade, and a grand divided external staircase. [...] He designed a new façade for the colonnaded Palazzo dei Conservatori and projected an identical structure, the Palazzo Nuovo, for {{the opposite side of the}} piazza. [...] On the narrow side of the trapezoidal plan, he extended the central axis with a magnificent stair to link the hilltop with the city below.|$|E
5000|$|Another advantage, {{important}} in satellite ground antennas, {{is that because}} the feed antenna is directed forward, rather than backward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> dish as in a front-fed antenna, the spillover sidelobes caused by portions of the beam that miss the secondary reflector are directed upwards <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>sky</b> rather than downwards towards the warm earth.

2500|$|While geologists {{debate the}} details, {{it is clear}} that the Sierra Nevada is a young {{mountain}} range, probably not more than 10 million years old. Forces in the earth, probably associated with the development of the Great Basin, forced the mountains to grow and climb <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> During the last 10 million years, at least four periods of glacial advance have coated the mountains in a thick mantle of ice. Glaciers form and develop during long periods of cool and wet weather. Glaciers move through the mountains like slow-motion rivers carving deep valleys and craggy peaks. The extensive history of glaciation within the range and the erosion resistant nature of the granitic rocks that make up most of the Sierra Nevada have together created a [...] landscape of hanging valleys, waterfalls, craggy peaks, alpine lakes and glacial canyons.|$|E
