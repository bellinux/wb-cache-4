25|$|Since the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale was {{introduced}} in 1953, comprehensive {{research has been done}} regarding the validity of the scale. across different cultures. In 1967, a study of cross-cultural differences in the scale was done between 9 year-old Japanese, French, and American students. The data concluded that Japanese and French students tested significantly lower on anxiety scores compared to the American students. Thus, there are strong cross-cultural differences related to <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the TMAS. Additional studies of the validity of the TMAS include a study between South African Natives and South African Europeans in 1979. Both groups included individuals with varying levels of education.This study found that the TMAS is sensitive to certain cross-cultural differences, but precautions should be taken when interpreting scores from the scale in non-Western cultures, regardless of the individual’s education level.|$|E

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with 74 patients in three CCUs at a major hospital. Data were collected prospectively using the simplified acute physiology <b>score</b> (SAPS II), <b>the</b> nursing activities <b>score</b> (NAS), and <b>the</b> Braden scale. Results: Approximately a third of patients (31 %) had a PU. Factors associated with PUs were age, days of hospital stay, <b>the</b> <b>score</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Braden scale, and <b>the</b> <b>score</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> SAPS II. <b>The</b> <b>score</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NAS {{was not associated with}} PUs. <b>Scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> SAPS II and NAS were moderately correlated with <b>the</b> <b>score</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Braden scale.

2500|$|To commemorate {{what would}} have been Gould's 75th birthday, the Canadian Museum of Civilization held an {{exhibition}} titled Glenn Gould: The Sounds of Genius. The multimedia exhibit was held in conjunction with Library and Archives Canada. The exhibition opened September 28, 2007 and looked at five aspects of Gould: [...] "The person," [...] "The musician," [...] "The broadcast personality and producer," [...] "The writer and theorist, composer and conductor," [...] and [...] "The Sounds of Genius". Curator Sam Cronk said [...] "The primary purpose of the exhibition is to remind Canadians of the many facets of Gould's musical genius." [...] John F. Burns of The New York Times reported, in an interview with Herbert Kallmann, that the exhibit will omit many of Gould's eccentricities in favour of highlighting Gould's talent. Of the numerous documents, there are essays, scripts, and music scores. <b>The</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> display were used for some of his most important recordings, marked only for breaks between takes. Peter Goddard of the Toronto Star says that the exhibit will give patrons a feeling {{of what it was like}} at Gould's home: [...] "The cramped space conveys a sense of what his St. Clair Ave. apartment might have felt like, with his piano at the very centre of things, along with his low piano chair made by his father." ...|$|E
2500|$|In reply, the Sixers {{had trouble}} {{of their own}} keeping wickets in hand. With regular opener Michael Lumb out for the game, Stephen O'Keefe partnered Nic Maddinson {{at the top of}} the order. Both looked to move <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> but fell cheaply. Then when Moises Henriques and Marcus North both {{returned}} to the pavilion without troubling the scorers the Sixers were 4/20. Scorchers bowler Tim Behrendorff was the destroyer with 3/21 from his four overs. Steve Smith and Jordan Silk did some rebuilding of their own before Silk gifted Voges an easy return catch. Smith continued scoring runs and looked in fine form as he reached his half century. The Sixers seemed like they would now easily make the runs. However, the game turned on its head once more when Dan Smith attempted to play a reverse sweep only to scoop the ball to fine leg. With the Scorchers eyeing off the Sixers tail-enders, Steve Smith took it upon himself to finish the game. A mistimed shot of the bowling of Yasir Arafat saw him caught at short third man by Voges with the Sixers 7/131. Lyon quickly departed and the Scorchers looked destined to win. However, the nineteenth over by Thomas saw some big hitting by Lee and Chris Tremlett leaving the Sixers with just 7 runs of the final over by Arafat to win. Neither side could quite find the slice of luck to get the win in ordinary time. With Lee out bowled, Tremlett faced the final delivery needing two runs to win. He dug out the ball from Arafat who couldn't quite hold onto out bumping it out to cover. The Sixers scampered through for a single leaving the scores tied.|$|E
