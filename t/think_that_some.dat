The need for it just can't be escaped. Even when everything that it is possibly to do by way of building new roads and expanding public transport has been done, there would still be, in the absence of deliberate limitation, more cars trying to move into, or within our cities than could possibly be accommodated.|$|E
500|$|End of the Century was {{described}} by the band as an album written solely to gain popularity, resulting in more of a pop punk sound. Joey failed {{to contribute to the}} best of his abilities on the album and recalled: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the worst crap I ever wrote went on the album. That was me at my worst." [...] Johnny also felt that the album was far from the band's prime.|$|E
500|$|Within {{a couple}} of hours, Michael Jensen of the gay website AfterElton.com took note of Murphy's statement, and also of the then-current cover article on Criss in Out magazine, in which Murphy was quoted as saying, [...] "Blaine will openly {{question}} whether bisexuality is real. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> people will love that discussion and some will not love it." [...] Jensen pointed out that Murphy does not say that Blaine will not question his own sexuality, but clearly [...] "decides he is, in fact, gay". Ausiello posted at about that time that Blaine was indeed who {{he was referring to}} in his original story, quoted from the same Out article as Jensen, and added a new one-sentence summation from Murphy on the coming episode: [...] "I guess the moral of the story is don’t play spin the bottle while drunk on wine coolers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leibniz rightly {{saw that}} {{creating}} the characteristica would be difficult, fixing {{the time required}} for devising it as follows: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> selected men could finish the matter in five years" [...] (Loemker 1969: 224), later remarking: [...] "And so I repeat, what I have often said, {{that a man who}} is neither a prophet nor a prince can ever undertake any thing of greater good to mankind of more fitting for divine glory" [...] (Loemker 1969: 225).

2500|$|York {{was paid}} off and in February 1802 Ferrier {{received}} {{an appointment to}} command the 74-gun [...] [...] There was no immediate service available after {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Amiens later that year, but on the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, Albion became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez on the Channel station. The squadron patrolled the Channel against French raiders, and on 28 May 1803 she captured the 40-gun French frigate Franchise while in company with the 74-gun ships [...] and [...] Albion was then ordered to the West Indies where on 21 December she captured the 12-gun privateer Clarisse. Ferrier then sailed for the East Indies, encountering a homeward-bound fleet of East Indiamen in February 1804, in the Strait of Malacca. The fleet, under Commodore Nathaniel Dance, had narrowly escaped capture by a powerful French squadron under Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois. Despite the massive French superiority Dance had successfully defended his convoy and by leading Linois to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of his merchants were actually warships, drove away the French at the Battle of Pulo Aura. Proceeding through the strait, Dance and his convoy came across Ferrier in HMS Albion, and accompanied by the 74-gun , and were escorted as far as Saint Helena. They arrived safely there on 9 June 1804.|$|E

5000|$|While Croatian {{historian}} Nada Klaić <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> sort {{of surrender}} occurred in 1102, giving the Croatians light terms, Slovenian historians Matjaž Klemenčič and Mitja Žagar believe the Pacta Conventa never actually existed, {{but the story}} about {{it was important to}} support the Croatian position later in the Habsburg Empire of rights on the basis of that agreement. Klemenčič and Žagar <b>think</b> <b>that</b> although Croatia ceased to exist as an independent state, the Croatian nobility retained relatively strong powers.
