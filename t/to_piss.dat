500|$|Some People Change was Montgomery Gentry's lowest-selling album at the time. Joe Galante, then-president of Sony Music Nashville, {{thought that}} the album's poor sales were because it [...] "strayed musically from what the base had been.

[...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times gave a mixed review, saying that it was more [...] "touchy-feely" [...] than You Do Your Thing, and that [...] "no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "C", criticizing the duo for the {{contradictory}} viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the [...] "defense of the American right <b>to</b> <b>piss</b> off your neighbors" [...] in [...] "What Do Ya Think About That".

500|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and {{longing for a}} return to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really amazed at how badly [...] was being viewed... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're not trying to be difficult... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed <b>to</b> <b>piss</b> off a lot of people... What we're doing isn't that radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you <b>to</b> <b>piss</b> off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

500|$|The song is {{interpreted}} {{to be an}} ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that [...] "At the time [...] [...] [...] {{it was written in}} the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like [...] [...] [...] 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [...] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot <b>to</b> <b>piss</b> in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the album, {{as well as its}} cleaner sound and the group's {{appearances}} on MTV, caused many longtime fans to accuse the band of [...] "selling out". Many commentators stated that the band's polished pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. Although the video for [...] "All the Small Things" [...] was filmed as a mockery of boy bands and teen pop, [...] "fame [...] discriminate based on origin: soon the group was as famous as those it was parodying." [...] "Blink now had the backing of a major record company... just like the synthesized pop acts they were spoofing," [...] said British journalist Tim Footman. [...] "In what way were they less 'pop' than Sugar Ray and 98 Degrees?" [...] Matt Diehl, author of the book My So-Called Punk, called the basis for satire thin: [...] "To seasoned ears, Blink-182 sounded and looked just as manufactured as the pop idols they were poking fun at." [...] The band faced a backlash shortly after Enema of the State was released from several punk and emo acts who wished to not be associated with their music. Tristin Laughter, employee of Bay Area record label Lookout! Records, wrote in an issue of the influential zine Punk Planet that the band would have a genuinely negative impact on punk and accused the band of misogyny. DeLonge responded to the accusations, commenting, [...] "I love all those criticisms, because fuck all those magazines! I hate with a passion Maximumrocknroll and all those zines that think they know what punk is supposed to be. I think it's so much more punk <b>to</b> <b>piss</b> people off than to conform to all those veganistic views". While ska veterans Blue Meanies tried to empathize ("I think they [...] are just trying to get in the mindset of a teenager, which means a lot of curiosity about sex,") others, such as John Lydon, frontman of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd, dismissed the band as a [...] "bunch of silly boys... an imitation of a comedy act." ...|$|E

2500|$|Piss Flowers {{is a work}} made up {{of twelve}} sculptures that Chadwick made while on a {{residency}} at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Alberta, Canada, in February 1991. During their stay, she and her partner, David Notarius travelled to different locations, made mounds of snow and laid out a flower shaped metal cutter. They would take turns to urinate in the snow then pour plaster into the cavities. These casts were attached to pedestals that {{were based on a}} hyacinth bulb. The whole thing was then cast in bronze and enamelled white. The works are a result of her physical contact with the location, preserving a direct impact of reality. Chadwick describes the flowers as a [...] "metaphysical conceit for the union of two people expressing themselves bodily". The work utilises the pleasure of taboo; elevating the medium of urine that is generally regarded as polluting and marginal in a dynamic and playful way. [...] "It may have been mischievous <b>to</b> <b>piss</b> in the snow, but it was damn hard work to end up with the 12 bronzes," [...] Chadwick recalled. [...] "Piss Flowers took two years, largely because I had to find [...] £12,000 to make them".

[...] Sampras's loss denied him the chance to match two records—Jimmy Connors' mark of five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles.

For me, I won another Slam, and it hasn't sunk in yet. It's very, very exciting for me, especially to repeat it". For his part, Sampras said about Rafter, [...] "When I see him holding the US Open trophy, it pisses me off."
