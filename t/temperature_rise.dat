5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E
5|$|Compression of {{ambient air}} causes a <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> of the gas, {{proportional}} to the pressure increase. Ambient air is typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during each stage. Intercoolers and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter.

Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> due to the incident beam.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the {{temperature}} elasticity is not a constant, but decreases gradually as <b>temperatures</b> <b>rise.</b> It is because actual evaporation increases as <b>temperatures</b> <b>rise</b> under normal precipitation, but when the <b>temperature</b> <b>rises</b> to a certain extent, the actual evaporation will reach the maximum that equals the wet environmental evapotranspiration (Brutsaert, 1979; Fu et al., 2009 b). The streamflow will not reduce at this stage, and the temperature elasticity will be a constant.|$|R

5|$|The National Hurricane Center remarked the {{potential}} for the system transitioning into a tropical cyclone. An approaching trough caused the storm to stall and weaken the deep convection. On April 23, the cyclone weakened to depression status due to strong wind shear. A Hurricane Hunters flight into the system confirmed the weakening, and also reported a 1.8°F (1°C) <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> in the center, suggesting a warm core and some tropical characteristics. Early on April 24, the subtropical depression turned eastward, maintaining limited convection. At the time, forecasters anticipated the depression would continue east-northeastward and become an extratropical cyclone. By late on April 24, the system was too weak to classify using the Dvorak technique, and the NHC ceased issuing advisories. Within 24hours, the circulation dissipated as the system continued eastward through the westerlies.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic phases {{are those}} that occur in a certain {{temperature}} range. If the <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, on heating {{a particular type of}} LC molecule (called mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.|$|E

The {{results indicate that the}} coal sample mass and <b>temperature</b> <b>rising</b> rate affect measurement results, while there is no effect of gas flow. Under the same experimental condition, a higher <b>temperature</b> <b>rising</b> rate leads to a higher initial heat release temperature and less output of heat; The initial heat release temperature shows the trend of increase after decrease with the increase of coal sample mass. So, when micro calorimeter is used to investigate the coal low-temperature oxidation process, the experiments under the conditions of appropriate coal sample mass and the lower <b>temperature</b> <b>rising</b> rate can obtain more accurate test parameters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Dynamic {{stability}} of machine tool spindle during operations {{is dependent on}} many parameters including the spindle speed, bearing preload, and thermal effect. In this article, a finite element-based model of spindle is presented, which uses the Timoshenko beam theory to obtain the frequency response of the spindle at the tool tip. The effects of the bearing preload and <b>temperature</b> <b>rising</b> on the stability characteristics of themilling systemare therefore investigated. It {{was found that the}} <b>temperature</b> <b>rising</b> has the same effects on the critical cutting depth as on thefirst natural frequencyof themilling system. This result verifies the fact that the critical cutting depth has close relationship with the first nature frequency of the milling system. On conditions that the <b>temperature</b> <b>rising</b> varies with the spindle rotational speed, the increment of the lowest critical cutting depth shifts with the spindle rotational speed. The above conclusions help to predict the {{stability of}} milling system under <b>temperature</b> <b>rising</b> situations for better controlling the machining process...|$|R
