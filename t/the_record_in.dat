5|$|During the mid-1930s, George Eyston set many speed {{records with}} his Speed of the Wind car, powered by an unsupercharged Rolls-Royce Kestrel. In 1937 {{he built a}} massive new car, Thunderbolt, powered by two R engines to attempt the {{absolute}} land speed record. At first Eyston experienced clutch failure due to the combined power of the engines. Nevertheless, he took <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> November 1937, reaching 312mph (502km/h), and in 1938 when Thunderbolt reached 357.5mph (575km/h). When first built at Bean Industries in Tipton, the nearside engine fitted to Thunderbolt was R27 which had powered S1595 when it set the air speed record in 1931. The other was R25, used by the same aircraft to win the Schneider Trophy two weeks earlier. Eyston had also borrowed R17 from Sir Malcolm Campbell and, with the continuing support that Rolls-Royce extended to both Campbell and Eyston, he also {{had the option of}} using R39.|$|E
5|$|Ehrhoff scored {{his first}} goal in a Canucks uniform on 5 October 2009, in a 5–3 {{loss to the}} Columbus Blue Jackets. The {{following}} month, he notched his first two-goal game in the NHL, adding an assist, in a 5–2 win over the Colorado Avalanche on 20 November. Late in the season, he missed two games in April 2010 due to a sprained left knee. Prior to the last game {{of the regular season}} against the Calgary Flames, Ehrhoff was awarded the Babe Pratt Trophy as the Canucks' fan-voted best defenceman. He finished his first season in Vancouver leading all team defencemen with career-highs of 14 goals, 44 points, a +36 rating and an average ice time of 22:47 minutes per game. His 44 points tied Uwe Krupp for the most points by a German-born defenceman in an NHL season, while his +36 rating broke the single-season team record shared by Pavel Bure and Marek Malík by one point (Daniel Sedin tied with Ehrhoff for <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> 2009–10, as well).

5|$|In 1994 Tony Hall, {{the head}} of the BBC's News and Current Affairs, argued that the {{restrictions}} did not allow viewers to make a proper judgment about those subject to the rules, as the subtle changes to their voices could not be heard. In particular he cited the example of the appearance of Gerry Adams on the BBC's On <b>the</b> <b>Record</b> <b>in</b> September 1993, in which he spoke about the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland. Hall said Adams was nervous and defensive throughout the interview as the presenter, Sheena McDonald, argued that peace could not be achieved while the IRA continued its violent stance, but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of the discussion. He also said that some countries, such as India and Egypt, had quoted the restrictions to BBC journalists who complained about the over use of censorship by authorities in those countries. Additionally Hall argued that Sinn Féin and the IRA had manipulated the ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews.|$|E

He scored 369 goals in 357 matches, making him the second club's highest goalscorer (counting goals scored in both official games and friendlies) with Lionel Messi ranking first in <b>the</b> <b>record.</b> <b>In</b> 1917, he was selected by the Philippines to represent the country at the Far Eastern Championship Games in Tokyo, helping them defeat Japan 15–2, which remains the largest win in Philippine international football history.

In 1916, while continuing his studies in medicine, he played football for a local team, the Bohemian Sporting Club, whom he helped win two Philippine Championships in 1917 and 1918.|$|E

Stan collaborated with several producers on the record, including Andreas Schuller, Sebastian Jacome, Chrishan Prince, Erik Lidbom, and Gabriel Huiban, while material was developed during the first Romanian international songwriting camp FonoCamp in 2013. Unlocked was released following an alleged physical altercation between Stan and her former manager Marcel Prodan, which led her {{to take a short}} hiatus in 2013. As a result, she left Prodan's label and signed a record deal with Fonogram Records to distribute <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> various countries. Unlocked features dance, techno, pop, and R genres, with influences varying from J-pop and Bhangra to house music. Lyrically, it deals with themes of liberation and new beginnings.

5|$|Nurmi {{struggled}} to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems. He {{quit his job}} as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively. As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland. In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> Stockholm, despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide. Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again. In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer. This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m. In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna. Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics. At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances. He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before, the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.|$|E
