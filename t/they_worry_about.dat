2500|$|The series seven opener [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] (2012) shows Amy, {{still working}} as a fashion model, signing papers for her and Rory's divorce. In the episode, the Doctor {{engineers}} a reconciliation between the two during the mission, allowing them to discuss their feelings for each other. It is revealed Amy left Rory because she has been infertile since [...] "A Good Man Goes to War", and knew he wanted children. The couple continue traveling with the Doctor on small adventures in [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] and [...] "A Town Called Mercy", but leave {{at the end of}} each to return to their normal lives. In [...] "The Power of Three", Amy says that the Doctor has been in her and Rory's life for ten years, and she now works as a journalist. The couple realise they have to choose between their normal lives and their life with the Doctor. They are inclined to choose the former, but Rory's father Brian (Mark Williams) encourages the pair to continue travelling with the Doctor. Their next adventure, [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", is their last. In the story, Amy and Rory are threatened by the evil Weeping Angels, whose touch will send them into the distant past to die alone. Having witnessed this eventuality, they attempt suicide, creating a paradox which destroys all but one Angel, but also renders the area permanently off-limits to the Doctor's TARDIS. In the present, the surviving Angel sends Rory back in time, and knowing the Doctor cannot recover him, Amy allows the Angel to touch her too so she can be with him. Gravestones in a New York cemetery reveal that Rory died at the age of 82 and Amy died at the age of 87. River arranges for Amy to leave the Doctor a message in the afterword of a 1930s pulp fiction novel, where she says she is happy with Rory and that <b>they</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> the Doctor travelling alone. [...] "P.S.", a mini shows-episode supplement based on the original script for this episode, shows that Rory and Amy adopted a son, in 1946, and named him Anthony Brian Williams. The actress reprised the role in [...] "The Time of the Doctor" [...] (2013), in which Matt Smith departs the series. During the Eleventh Doctor's regeneration, he hallucinates images of young Amelia Pond on board his TARDIS, before a vision of adult Amy approaches and says a final goodbye.|$|E

6000|$|My {{correspondent}} says, [...] "Would not {{our women}} be spared the drudgery of cooking {{and all its}} attendant worries, leaving them free for higher culture?" [...] The first thing that occurs to me {{to say about this}} is very simple, and is, I imagine, a part of all our experience. If my correspondent can find any way of preventing women from worrying, he will indeed be a remarkable man. I think the matter is a much deeper one. First of all, my correspondent overlooks a distinction which is elementary in our human nature. Theoretically, I suppose, every one would like to be freed from worries. But nobody in the world would always like to be freed from worrying occupations. I should very much like (as far as my feelings at the moment go) to be free from the consuming nuisance of writing this article. But it does not follow that I should like to be free from the consuming nuisance of being a journalist. Because we are worried about a thing, it does not follow that we are not interested in it. The truth is the other way. If we are not interested, why on earth should we be worried? Women are worried about housekeeping, but those that are most interested are the most worried. Women are still more worried about their husbands and their children. And I suppose if we strangled the children and poleaxed the husbands it would leave women free for higher culture. That is, it would leave them free to begin to worry about that. For women would worry about higher culture as much as <b>they</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> everything else.|$|E

S. Coders reviewed transcripts, identified themes, and coded transcripts.  Results Youth felt uncomfortable discussing HIV with their parent who has HIV because <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> upsetting and reminding the parent of his/her illness. Adult children reported learning about HIV prevention by watching how the illness affected their parents. Few siblings reported talking with one another <b>about</b> HIV because <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> upsetting their brother/sister and about their sibling unintentionally disclosing the parent's illness to others.  Conclusions Discussions between youth and their parent with HIV and their siblings vary, highlighting the need for further research in this area...|$|R
