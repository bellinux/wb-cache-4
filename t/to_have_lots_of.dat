Inaba added that Sega is a publisher which allows the team <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> creative control over their games. In 2011, PlatinumGames announced that they had extended their partnership with a new title called Max Anarchy. The game was released in western territories as Anarchy Reigns in 2013. The game serves as a sequel to MadWorld, but it does not feature the Sin City graphic style, though players assume control of MadWorlds protagonist Jack Cayman for most parts of the game. The game received mixed reviews on its release, and it was a commercial failure in both Japan and the West, partly due to Sega's insufficient marketing which they feared that would be a [...] "waste of money". Anarchy Reigns is the last game developed by PlatinumGames published by Sega.|$|E

Then he had remarked--making the most of the advantage of his years--that it frightened him quite enough to find himself dedicated to the entertainment of a little foreign girl. There were girls he wasn't afraid of--he was quite bold with little Americans. Thus it was that she had defended herself to the end--"Oh but I'm almost American too.
