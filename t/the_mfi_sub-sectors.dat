40|$|A new {{interconnection}} technique {{has been developed}} that allows versatile multiple strand connections between microsensors, sensor arrays, and chips designed for wire bonding. The new technique has been termed `microflex interconnects' (MFI). Conventional wire bonding technique is commonly restricted to planar interconnects with a limited degree of freedom for placing microsystem components. <b>The</b> <b>MFI</b> technique has overcome this limitation by interconnecting microsystem components through custom designed flexible foils with embedded metallized conductors. <b>The</b> <b>MFI</b> foils may also serve as circuit substrates. This basic foil material is polyimide (Du Pont PI 2611) or BCB which are patterned photolithographically. Platinum, gold or either conductive metals are sputtered or evaporated on the foil and patterned using lift-off technique. Several metallization layers can be embedded in the material. Pitch and shape of <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> contact pads correspond to {{the one of the}} chips to be interconnected. A via hole is placed in the center of <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> contact pads. MFI pads and chip pads are adjusted. Metal balls or wedges generate the electrical and mechanical contact through the vias between the chips and <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> substrate. An commercial wire bonder is the only equipment needed to perform <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> method. <b>The</b> <b>MFI</b> technique was applied to bond standard CMOS integrated circuit bond pads with a width of 30 micrometers and a pitch of 70 micrometers to a 10 micrometers thick <b>MFI</b> foil. <b>The</b> integration density of <b>the</b> of <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> technique correspond to one of the flip- chip technology. Special advantages of <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> technique are 3 D interconnects, the flexibility in design and shape, and easy visual inspection of alignment qualities. <b>The</b> <b>MFI</b> method is also suited for biomedical applications because all materials used are biocompatible...|$|R

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of fetal}} death associated with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is hypothesized to be {{a consequence of}} PRRS virus-induced apoptosis at <b>the</b> maternal-fetal interface (<b>MFI).</b> <b>The</b> objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate distribution and degree of apoptosis in the uterine and fetal placental tissues during the experimental type 2 PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection and determine associations between apoptosis at <b>the</b> <b>MFI,</b> PRRSV RNA concentration and antigen staining intensity, PRRSV-induced microscopic lesions, and fetal preservation status. A total of 114 naïve, high-health pregnant gilts were inoculated with type 2 PRRSV on gestation day 85 ± 1 with euthanasia 21 days later; 19 sham-inoculated gilts served as controls. Two hundred and fifty samples of uterine tissue with fetal placenta were selected based on negative, low PRRSV RNA, and high PRRSV RNA concentration (0, 2. 7 log 10 copies/mg, respectively). TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis in the endometrium and at <b>the</b> <b>MFI.</b> PRRSV RNA concentration and numbers of PRRSV immunopositive cells in uterine and placental tissue were positively associated with the severity of apoptosis in the endometrium and <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> (P< 0. 001, P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 001, respectively). The number of TUNEL positive cells at <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> was also positively associated with the severity (P< 0. 001) of vasculitis, but not total numbers of inflammatory cells in the endometrium. Increased numbers of TUNEL positive cells at <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> were associated with PRRSV load in the fetal thymus, and greater odds of meconium staining of the fetus at 21 days post infection (P< 0. 001 for both).

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. In the {{microfinance}} discourse, sustainability {{can relate}} to organisational, managerial and financial aspects. However, what is in vogue in mainstream analysis is the financial sustainability of <b>MFIs</b> throughout <b>the</b> world, especially in Africa, Asia and Latin America. What has attracted controversial debate on the self financial viability of <b>MFIs</b> is <b>the</b> extent they have maintained the balance between achieving substantial levels of profitability (through employing the institutionalist approach), and being agents of poverty-alleviation (through the welfarist approach). Analysing the mixed fortunes of <b>the</b> five <b>MFIs</b> in Mozambique between 2005 and 2009, this study explores the scope and patterns of outreach programmes as an essay in service-delivery by <b>the</b> <b>MFIs,</b> <b>the</b> repayment capacity of the different stripes of clients, the cost-control regime adopted by <b>the</b> <b>MFIs</b> and <b>the</b> ultimate variegated levels of success realised, and the challenges faced by <b>the</b> <b>MFIs</b> in different provinces...|$|R

Further, double-dipping necessarily leads to default and inefficiency, and moreover, borrowers who face relatively higher transactions costs optimally decide to double-dip. Interestingly, an increase in MFI competition can increase the extent of double-dipping and default. Further, the interest rates may go either way, with the interest rate likely to increase with more competition if <b>the</b> <b>MFIs</b> are very socially motivated...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{governments and}} many {{development}} agents pay great {{attention to the}} develop-ment of Microfinance Institutions (<b>MFIs)</b> with <b>the</b> belief {{that they are able}} to alleviate poverty in a very shot time. This paper tried to give statistical insight in measuring <b>the</b> performance of <b>MFIs</b> in Ethiopia and the determinants of their performance. A cross-sectional data from 2006 fiscal calendar balance sheet of 26 <b>MFIs</b> in <b>the</b> country is used to carry out the study. Factor analysis (FA) of performance indicators revealed that the deposit mobilized from clients, the number of active borrowers, and the gross loan portfolio load high on one component, estab-lishing the outreach performance dimension of <b>the</b> <b>MFIs</b> in <b>the</b> country. On the other hand, profit margin, OSS, return on asset and gross loan portfolio-to-total asset ratio load high on the other component, establishing the financial sustainability dimension. In order to identify the determinants of the performance of <b>the</b> <b>MFIs,</b> a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model was fitted on the outreach and sustainability dimension scores synthesized by FA. The num-ber/types of financial services rendered, the number of staff per branch and their capital are found to determine the outreach performance of <b>the</b> <b>MFIs</b> in <b>the</b> country. It was also noted that capital has an adverse impact on the outreach efforts of <b>the</b> <b>MFIs.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> financial via-bility of <b>the</b> <b>MFIs</b> is found to be highly determined by the average amount of loans disbursed to individuals, the financial revenue ratio and the cost per borrower ratio...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of {{increased}} MFI competition, focusing on its implications for borrower targeting, both in the presence and the absence of double-dipping. In the absence of competition we find that the loans are more likely to go to relatively richer borrowers whenever inequality is not too large, and the technology is sufficiently convex. In the presence of competition, the results depend on whether double-dipping is feasible or not. In case double-dipping is not feasible, we find that <b>the</b> <b>MFIs</b> necessarily target <b>the</b> richer borrowers. Interestingly, it turns out that double-dipping may encourage <b>the</b> <b>MFIs</b> to give loans to the poor, rather than the rich.

40|$|The {{microvascular}} flow index (MFI) {{is commonly}} used to semiquantitatively characterize the velocity of microcirculatory perfusion as absent (0), intermittent (1), sluggish (2), or normal (3). There are three approaches to compute MFI: (1) {{the average of the}} predominant flow in each of <b>the</b> four quadrants (<b>MFI</b> by quadrants), (2) the direct assessment during the bedside video acquisition (MFI point of care), and (3) the mean value of <b>the</b> <b>MFIs</b> determined in each individual vessel (MFI vessel by vessel). We hypothesized that the agreement between <b>the</b> <b>MFIs</b> is poor and that <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> vessel by vessel better reflects the microvascular perfusion.

There were wide 95 % limits of agreement between MFI by quadrants and MFI point of care (1. 46), between MFI by quadrants and MFI vessel by vessel (2. 85), and between MFI by point of care and MFI vessel by vessel (2. 56). <b>The</b> <b>MFIs</b> significantly correlated with the RBC velocity and with the fraction of perfused small vessels, but MFI vessel by vessel showed the best R 2.

40|$|The {{recently}} published report ‘How {{to evaluate the}} microcirculation’ [1] should be praised for standardizing analysis of human microcirculation data. This standardization will enable better comparison between studies. Having worked extensively with both orthogonal polarization spectral (OPS) and sidestream dark field (SDF) imaging and most analysis software, I feel the proposed analysis is extremely useful but is also equally time consuming. Despite advances in computer analysis, current practice is still predominantly manual. I therefore wish {{to make a comment}} that may greatly simplify the procedure. The report suggests determining the microvascular flow index (<b>MFI),</b> <b>the</b> perfused vessel density (PVD) and the percentage of perfused vessels (PPV). For <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> a grid is used dividing the screen into four quadrants, and the vessels are scored according to observed flow: 0 = none, 1 = intermittent, 2 = sluggish, 3 = continuous. For the PVD and the PPV, three equidistant horizontal and vertical lines are drawn and a different score is used: absent, intermittent, present (for details see [1]). I propose using the same grid for <b>the</b> <b>MFI,</b> <b>the</b> PPV and the PVD. Dividing <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> quadrants into four sections more effectively creates the PPV and PVD lines (see Figure 1). Each vessel is then scored according to <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> criteria. <b>The</b> PPV and the PVD are calculated as usual. Vessels with MFI scores of 2 or 3 are classified as having flow present. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>MFI</b> is calculated as ordinary. I used this method for a recent study [2]. Trzeciak and colleagues used a similar approach but with different scoring definitions [3].
