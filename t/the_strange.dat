5|$|In 1945 Rossen {{joined a}} picket line against Warner Bros, making {{an enemy of}} Jack Warner. Rossen signed a {{contract}} with an independent production company formed by Hal Wallis, who had previously been Warner Bros.' head of production. However Rossen wrote only two full scripts for this company, <b>The</b> <b>Strange</b> Love of Martha Ivers in 1946 and Desert Fury in 1947. In <b>The</b> <b>Strange</b> Love of Martha Ivers Rossen used a short story by John Patrick to introduce the main plot, which was set fifteen years later and which Rossen wrote himself. The relationship between Rossen and Wallis broke down when Rossen received offers from other production companies.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is <b>the</b> <b>Strange</b> Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below). <b>The</b> <b>Strange</b> Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on <b>the</b> <b>Strange</b> Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous.|$|E

5|$|Wanting to {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> light pattern, Tabetha S. Boyajian put several hypotheses to the test. The first general assumption was an exoplanet transiting (eclipsing) its massive star, but the dips in light lasted between 5 to 80 days and were erratically spaced apart, thus ruling out {{any kind of}} an orbit for one celestial object.|$|E
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in <b>the</b> <b>Strange</b> Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E

5|$|Culture in the Netherlands {{at the end}} of the 15th {{century was}} {{influenced}} by the Italian Renaissance through trade via Bruges, which made Flanders wealthy.

5|$|Farber {{noted the}} strong female {{characters}} of the 1930s and 1940s, and laments their replacing by all-male relationships from the 1950s onwards. For the earlier pattern Farber cited Rossen's 1946 script <b>The</b> <b>Strange</b> Love of Martha Ivers, which was over melodramatic but portrayed a woman consumed by power, money and success. Lilith created {{one of the few}} strong women in the 1960s. Rossen generally destroyed the main character.|$|E

5|$|In psychophysiological {{research}} on attachment, {{the two main}} areas studied have been autonomic responses, such as heart rate or respiration, and {{the activity of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.
