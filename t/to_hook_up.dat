40|$|<b>Hook</b> <b>ups</b> are sexual {{encounters}} that can include {{a variety of}} behaviours (e. g., kissing to intercourse) with no expectation of future contact or a committed relationship. Although <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> is reported <b>to</b> be common on college campuses across the USA, {{little is known about}} whether the frequency of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> changes {{over the course of the}} college experience. Using cross-sectional data and the covariates alcohol use, gender and relationship status, we examined a synthetic cohort of undergraduate students (n 1003) on rates of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> using (1) logistic regression and (2) an applied form of survival analysis. Whereas both analytic techniques produced similar results, survival analysis provided a more complete picture by showing an increase in the rate of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> that peaked between spring semester of the first year of college and autumn semester of the second year of college, followed by a gradual decline in <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> rates over subsequent semesters. Findings indicate that gender is significantly related <b>to</b> <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> in the logistic regression analysis, with women reporting fewer hook ups; however, gender was not significantly related <b>to</b> <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> in the survival analysis, indicating that there are no differences in the pattern across cohorts. Implications for promoting the sexual health of college students and future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Hooking up {{is defined}} as a {{physical}} encounter between two people who are not romantically committed. This study explored whether there were subgroups of young adults with unique reactions <b>to</b> <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> (N = 879). Psycho-socialpredictorvariables (gender,depression, loneliness, intoxi-cation level, college adjustment, and hope for a committed rela-tionship) wereinvestigatedalongwithemotional reactionsas the outcome variables. Through the use of cluster analysis, four distinct clusters were identified: Happy Hopeful, Content Real-ist, Used and Confused, and Disappointed and Disengaged. The majority (62 %) of the sample reported mostly positive reactions <b>to</b> <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> and fell within the Happy Hopeful or Content Realist clusters. Protective factors in these two clusters included hope for a committed relationship, having realistic expectations, and healthy psychological adjustment. The Used and Confused and Disappointed and Disengaged clusters reported the most negative <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> reactions and consisted of 38 % of the overall sample. These two groups reported increased depression and loneliness symptoms and lower levels of social adjustment as compared to those clusters with more positive reactions...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is common}} for college {{students}} to seek sexual encounters without the goal of establishing a long-term relationship, a practice commonly referred <b>to</b> as <b>hooking</b> <b>up.</b> Hooking up can have different meanings to different college students. For instance, at Howard University, {{the majority of students}} see <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> as meeting friends or simply exchanging phone numbers without any sexual connotation to it. [...] Hooking up is unique for when and why the sexual encounter occurs: instead of building a relationship before initiating sexual acts (from kissing <b>to</b> intercourse), <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> allows the participants to become intimate without the expectation of commitment.|$|R

25|$|Toon Boom Animation's Toon Boom Harmony {{software}} {{was used as}} the main software package for the production of the film, as the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) system that Disney developed with Pixar in the 1980s for use on their previous traditionally animated films had become outdated.

The reinstated traditional unit's first production, a 2007 Goofy cartoon short entitled How <b>to</b> <b>Hook</b> <b>Up</b> Your Home Theater, was partly animated without paper by using Harmony and Wacom Cintiq pressure-sensitive tablets. The character animators found some difficulty with this approach, and decided to use traditional paper and pencil drawings, which were then scanned into the computer systems, for The Princess and the Frog.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{continue}} the line into northern Brooklyn, the Glendale and East River Railroad was acquired.

For the summer season in 1878, the line was opened on May 15, 1878. The final line of the NY, the Kings County Central Railroad, which was leased by the NY opened for service on June 29, 1878. This line ran {{from the edge of}} Prospect Park at Flatbush Avenue and Malbone Street, before running east through Malbone to Clove Road, and then south on Clove to Clarkson prior to merging with the Manhattan Beach line. The line closed on September 30, 1878, when the summer season ended, after it had been sold to a group that desired to rebuild the line to standard gauge and compete with the NY by building a new line to Manhattan Beach. Their plans were never realized, and the right-of-way had been totally stripped by July 1879.|$|E

Opeth signed with UK label Peaceville Records in Europe, which was distributed by Music for Nations. Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated. Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio. Delays with the album's artwork pushed the release back an additional month and Still Life was released on October 18, 1999. Due to problems with the band's new distribution network, the album was not released in the United States until February 2001. Still Life was the first album recorded with Méndez, and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release, including the band's logo. Allmusic called Still Life a [...] "formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies." [...] As explained by Åkerfeldt, Still Life is a concept album: [...] "The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't got the same faith {{as the rest of}} the inhabitants there.
