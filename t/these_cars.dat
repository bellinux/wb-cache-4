5|$|Metro's {{rolling stock}} was {{acquired}} in six phases, and each version of car is {{identified with a}} separate series number. The original order of 300 rail cars (90 {{of which are in}} operation as of April 18, 2017) was manufactured by Rohr Industries, with final delivery in 1978. <b>These</b> <b>cars</b> are numbered 1000–1299 and were rehabilitated in the mid-1990s. Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (Breda), now AnsaldoBreda, manufactured the second order of 76 cars delivered in 1983 and 1984. <b>These</b> <b>cars,</b> numbered 2000–2075, were rehabilitated in the early 2000s by Alstom in Hornell, New York. A third order of 288 cars, also from Breda, were delivered between 1984 and 1988. <b>These</b> <b>cars</b> are numbered 3000–3291 and were rehabilitated by Alstom in the early 2000s. An order of 100 cars from Breda, numbered 4000–4099, were delivered between 1992 and 1994. A fifth order of 192 cars was manufactured by Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) of Spain. <b>These</b> <b>cars</b> are numbered 5000–5191 and were delivered from 2001 through 2004. A sixth order of 184 cars from Alstom Transportation, are numbered 6000-6183 and were delivered between 2005 and 2007. The cars have body shells built in Barcelona, Spain with assembly completed in Hornell, New York.|$|E
5|$|I.J. Carruthers {{operated}} Carruthers Garage in Lashburn, and six Model T Ford {{cars were}} shipped here October 5, 1917. <b>These</b> <b>cars</b> required assembly, and in total 18 cars {{were sold in}} 1917, and 24 in 1918 with prices ranging from $563 to $818. Lashburn was served by Provincial Highway 5, the early name for Saskatchewan Highway 16.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Sightseer lounges, Amtrak converted five Superliner I dining cars to lounge cars in 1998 for use on the Auto Train, an automobile-carrying overnight train between Virginia and Florida. <b>These</b> <b>cars</b> may be distinguished from the Sightseer lounges by their conventional windows.|$|E

5|$|Since 1999, the R142, R142A, R143, R160, and R188 {{cars have}} been placed into service. <b>These</b> <b>cars</b> are collectively known as New Technology Trains (NTTs) due to modern {{innovations}} such as LED and LCD route signs and information screens, as well as recorded train announcements {{and the ability to}} facilitate Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC). Live conductor announcements can still be made on older rolling stock equipment.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol Limited {{received}} streamlined heavyweight {{sleeping and}} dining cars in 1938. A typical consist included the following: baggage-dormitory, 8-section 1-drawing room 1-compartment sleeping car, dining car, {{three to four}} 8-section 5-double bedroom sleeping cars, 14-section sleeping car, two 12-section 1-drawing room sleeping cars, and a sleeper-buffet-lounge with a drawing room and three compartments.

50|$|In Prague, {{park and}} ride car parks are {{established}} near some metro and railway stations (about 17 parks near 12 metro stations and 3 train stations, in 2011). <b>These</b> <b>car</b> parks offer low prices and all-day and return (2× 75 min) tickets including the public transport fare.|$|R
25|$|In 2007, Korail ordered eight 4-car express trains branded as the Trunk-Line Electric Car (TEC) to Hitachi. <b>These</b> <b>car</b> body, bogies, {{power systems}} made in Japan, but {{were to be}} {{assembled}} at SLS Heavy Industry in Changwon, Korea. and, {{a significant amount of}} the components have been replaced by a Korean part.|$|R
5|$|American {{automakers}} {{had first}} countered imports {{such as the}} Volkswagen Beetle with compact cars including the Ford Falcon, Chevrolet Corvair and Plymouth Valiant, although <b>these</b> <b>cars</b> featured six-cylinder engines and comprised a larger vehicle class. As the popularity of smaller Japanese imports from Toyota and Datsun increased throughout the 1960s, Ford North America responded by introducing the Ford Cortina from its European arm Ford of Europe as a captive import. American automakers would soon introduce their own subcompacts.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak assumed {{control of}} almost all private sector {{intercity}} passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. It retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric and diesel) and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s. <b>These</b> <b>cars</b> were aging, in need of maintenance, {{and in many cases}} incompatible with each other. The company recognized the need and opportunity to standardize on a single design.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania took {{delivery}} of two rail cars that operated in car-and-trailer configuration. Largely {{similar to the}} car ordered by the Reading, these rail cars were also beset by problems with their rubber-tired wheels, which were later replaced with conventional trucks. After being retrofitted, <b>these</b> <b>cars</b> {{went on to become}} the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin rail cars. They remained with the Pennsylvania until 1943, when they were sold to the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, a Virginia short line that operated them for only a few months; they were ultimately scrapped in 1948.|$|E
50|$|The two {{remaining}} cars were rebuilt into single cars {{for use on}} the South Acton shuttle, replacing a B Stock <b>car.</b> <b>These</b> two <b>cars,</b> numbered 4167 and 4176, were not rebuilt into Q Stock and were classified G23 Stock.|$|R

He therefore developed a car hauler for use by his company, but soon was selling <b>these</b> <b>car</b> haulers to other manufacturers. This is the first instance of a semi-trailer truck product.|$|R
50|$|In 1888, the Raritan River Rail Road began {{operation}} with two 4-4-0 engines (No.1 and No.2) and twenty 20-ton gondola <b>cars.</b> <b>These</b> small <b>cars</b> {{were used by}} Suchs and Crossmans to move the sand and clay found in the area.|$|R
5|$|McLaren's later cars {{abandoned}} Mallite {{in favour}} of conventional aluminium construction; the Ford and Serenissima engine also saw no further action. For 1967 BRM engines powered the M4B and M5A {{but it was not}} until the Cosworth DFV became available in 1968 that McLaren scored their first Formula One wins with the M7A. Herd stayed on designing all of <b>these</b> <b>cars</b> until he left for Cosworth in 1967. McLaren have since become one of the most successful teams in Formula One.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered 150 more Amfleet {{cars from}} Budd on March 13, 1980, {{at a cost}} of $150 million. <b>These</b> <b>cars,</b> dubbed Amfleet II, were {{intended}} to replace rolling stock on Amtrak long-distance trains, and featured larger windows, more legroom, and folding legrests. Budd delivered the first four cars on October 28, 1981; the unveiling took place on November 11. The final cars arrived on June 11, 1983. The Amfleet IIs were the last intercity cars Budd built. The continuing unreliability of the Budd Metroliner led to refurbished Amfleet I coaches displacing them in Metroliner service in 1981. New EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives pulled the trains.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} Ridge Racer, the player {{normally}} starts with four cars. The remaining eight are selectable on winning the mini game before the title screen (the mini game is Galaga '88 {{instead of the}} original game's Galaxian). They are mostly unchanged; their names (certain cars are named after other Namco titles) and specifications {{are similar to the}} first game. After the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions are unlocked, and Time Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car. There are three secret cars; the '13th Racing' (from the first Ridge Racer) of the Novice course, and the new '13th Racing Kid' (of the Intermediate course) and 'White Angel' (of the Expert course). <b>These</b> <b>cars</b> are unlocked upon winning the respective course's Time Trial race.|$|E

5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create <b>these</b> <b>cars</b> are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E
5|$|The UAAI badge-engineered cars first {{introduced}} in 1989 sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated, but the Holden Commodore, Toyota Camry, and Corolla were all successful when sold under their original nameplates. The first generation Nova and the donor Corolla were produced at Holden's Dandenong, Victoria facility until 1994. UAAI was dissolved in 1996, and Holden returned to selling only GM products. The Holden Astra and Vectra, both designed by Opel in Germany, replaced the Toyota-sourced Holden Nova and Apollo. This {{came after the}} 1994 introduction of the Opel Corsa replacing the already available Suzuki Swift as the source for the Holden Barina. Sales of the full-size Holden Suburban SUV sourced from Chevrolet commenced in 1998—lasting until 2001. Also in 1998, local assembly of the Vectra began at Elizabeth, South Australia. <b>These</b> <b>cars</b> were exported to Japan and Southeast Asia with Opel badges. However, the Vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in Australia to justify local assembly, and reverted to being fully imported in 2000.|$|E
