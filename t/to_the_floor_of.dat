5|$|In April 1910 Davison {{decided to}} gain entry <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the House of Commons to ask Asquith about {{the vote for}} women. She entered the Palace of Westminster {{with other members of}} the public and made her way into the heating system, where she hid overnight. On a trip from her hiding place to find water, she was arrested by a policeman, but not prosecuted. The same month she became an {{employee}} of the WSPU and began to write for Votes for Women.|$|E
5|$|Over about 80 million years, erosion {{caused the}} {{transportation}} of {{massive amounts of}} alluvial sediment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the Central Valley, where it was trapped between the California Coast Range on {{the west and the}} Sierra Nevada on the east, forming an incredibly flat and fertile land surface. The present-day form of the upper Merced River watershed, however, was formed by glaciers, and the lower watershed was indirectly but significantly affected.|$|E

5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside of the tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament Building {{is open to}} {{visitors}} all year round. On non-sitting days, normally Mondays, Fridays and weekends as well as during parliamentary recess periods, visitors are able to view the Main Hall {{of the building and}} can access the public galleries of the debating chamber and main committee rooms. Guided tours are also available on non-sitting days and these allow visitors access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the chamber, the Garden Lobby, Queensberry House and committee rooms {{in the company of a}} parliamentary guide. On sitting days, members of the public must purchase tickets for the public galleries of both the chamber and committee rooms.|$|E
5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these {{are probably the result}} of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E

5|$|The acting Commander, 7th Division Australian Army Service Corps (AASC), Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Richardson, assumed {{control of}} {{logistics}} {{on the track}} on 10 September. Supplies were then brought from the Base Supply Depots at Sogeri and Ilolo to Newton's Depot in 3-ton trucks by the 2/5th AASC Company. The 2/4th AASC Company moved them by jeep to the roadhead at Owers' Corner. The flying fox was used to take them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the Goldie River Valley, from whence the 1st Independent Light Horse Troop carried them to Uberi. From there, they were carried {{on the backs of}} Papuan porters, known as carriers. If there were more stores than the animals could carry, they would assist with that too.|$|E
5|$|If {{travelling}} in a North-South direction, the Wicklow Way {{begins in}} Marlay Park, a historic demesne {{on the outskirts}} of Dublin's suburbs laid out in the late 18th century by the La Touches, a family of Huguenot merchants and bankers, and later developed as a public park. The trailhead comprises a map board, beside which is a low wall with a stone stile through which walkers pass in order to make their first step on the trail. The Way traverses the park, following a wooded shelterbelt along the Little Dargle River, before emerging on the southern side of the park onto College Road. Passing under the M50 motorway, it ascends Kilmashogue Lane and enters the forest recreation area on Kilmashogue mountain. This is the first of many forest plantations, owned by Coillte, that the Wicklow Way passes through. The tree species in this area comprise Sitka spruce, Scots pine and beech. Much of this initial section of the Way is underlain by granite. The trail circles the mountain, emerging onto open moorland near Fairy Castle. This upland heath and bog habitat is dominated by heather, purple moor grass and bog cotton and supports many bird species, including red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. The Way crosses a saddle between Two Rock mountain and Kilmashogue before descending from a broad ridge between Two Rock and Tibradden Mountain into the valley of Glencullen where it follows the R116 road to the hamlet of Boranaraltry. The road is flanked by hedgerow-bordered farmland. Ascending from Boranaraltry, the trail crests the shoulder of Prince William’s Seat, at which point the Way leaves County Dublin and enters County Wicklow. The habitat here alternates between blanket bog and upland heath. The trail descends <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the Glencree valley via Curtlestown Wood where it then enters Lackan Wood and crosses the shoulder of Knockree Hill.|$|E
25|$|A {{congenital}} {{disorder of}} the tongue is that of ankyloglossia also known as tongue-tie. The tongue is tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the mouth by a very short and thickened frenulum and this affects speech, eating, and swallowing.|$|E
60|$|The boats, {{as we have}} said, were empty, {{but there}} were some curious {{appliances}} in them, having the appearance of chains, and wristlets, and bars of iron running along and fixed to their decks, or rather <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flooring</b> <b>of</b> their holds. Their long yards and sails were cleared and ready for hoisting.|$|R

25|$|Baldridge's {{claims of}} {{unlimited}} executive power created {{a firestorm of}} negative opinion on April 26. Newspapers denounced the claim, public opinion ran heavily against the president, and members of Congress took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> their respective chambers to attack the argument. Truman was forced to issue a denial of Baldridge's assertion, but {{the pressure on the}} administration continued unabated.|$|E
25|$|The fell {{itself is}} a ridge running broadly north-south and about {{a mile and a}} half long. The summit is at the {{southern}} extremity, a flank guarded by Calf and Raven Crags. Immediately to the north is Ivy Crag, a second top sporting a large cairn, followed by the depression of Uskdale Gap. Continuing northward are a succession of lower tops, gradually descending toward the final knoll of Great How (692ft). A swift descent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Little Langdale then follows.|$|E
5|$|The fold {{that connects}} {{the back of the}} sublingua and tongue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth is called the plica sublingualis.

The point where the plica sublingualis attaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth marks the location of the submandibular salivary glands.|$|R

25|$|Swirl How {{stands at}} the {{geographical}} centre of the Coniston Fells and, according to some sources, may be the highest of the group. A long sickle shaped ridge extends from the summit of Swirl How, first north and then curving around to the east. Great Carrs is {{the high point of}} this ridge, which continues as Wet Side Edge, falling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Little Langdale. A western outlier branching off the main ridge between Great Carrs and Swirl How is Grey Friar.|$|E
25|$|The Langdale Pikes form a parapet to {{the lower}} {{hinterland}} to their north. From 'behind' they are unimpressive, but their southern faces fall full length over crags <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Langdale, nearly 2,000ft below. Loft Crag has a peaked summit which apes in lesser proportion the fine knoll of Pike of Stickle. To the east, between Loft Crag and Harrison Stickle is the subsidiary top of Thorn Crag. This is sometimes counted as a Langdale Pike in its own right, but only Birkett amongst the major guidebooks takes this view.|$|E

25|$|Crittenden's {{proposals}} were debated by a specially-selected Committee of Thirteen. The proposals provided for, among other things, {{an extension of}} the Missouri Compromise line dividing the territories to the Pacific Ocean, bringing his efforts directly in conflict with the 1860 Republican Platform and the personal views of President-elect Abraham Lincoln, who had made known his objections. The compromise was rejected by the committee on December 22 by a vote of 7–6. Crittenden later brought the issue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the Senate as a proposal to have his compromise made subject to a national referendum, but the Senate rejected it on January 16, by a vote of 25–23.|$|E
25|$|Finally, on 1 December, {{the crisis}} ended when Bjelke-Petersen {{announced}} his retirement from politics. He declared: The policies of the National Party are no longer those on which I went to the people. Therefore I have no wish to lead the Government any longer. It was my intention to take this matter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> State Parliament. However, I now have no further interest in leading the National Party any further.Three months later, Bjelke-Petersen called on voters at the federal by-election in Groom to support the Liberal candidate instead of the National contestant. Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and {{turned their backs on}} traditional conservative policies.|$|E
25|$|Clay {{introduced}} the negotiated tariff bill on February 12, {{and it was}} immediately referred to a select committee consisting of Clay as chairman, Felix Grundy of Tennessee, George M. Dallas of Pennsylvania, William Cabell Rives of Virginia, Webster, John M. Clayton of Delaware, and Calhoun. On February 21 the committee reported a bill <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the Senate which was largely the original bill proposed by Clay. The Tariff of 1832 would continue except that reduction of all rates above 20% would be reduced by one tenth every two years with the final reductions back to 20% coming in 1842. Protectionism as a principle was not abandoned and provisions were made for raising the tariff if national interests demanded it.|$|E
