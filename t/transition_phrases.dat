Linguist like Brown (2004), most linguists agree with in an ESL/EFL academic English program, {{the objective of}} the curriculum should not be limited to only the linguistic component alone but should also include developing the art of critical thinking. In view of that, the aim {{of this study is to}} understand and explore the relationship between English language proficiency in writing and critical thinking dispositions. The California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) was used to determine the critical thinking disposition score. The English language proficiency in writing was measured through the research essay assignment which was graded through the holistic grading scheme for writing from a preparatory college. This study involved 138 students. The study aims to achieve three objectives. The first objective was to investigate the critical thinking dispositions profile of students with high, average and low English in their writing. The results showed that for each essay score category (high, average and low), most of the students have ambivalent CCTDI score. The second objective of the study is to examine the extent to which writing correlates with the seven scales of the critical thinking disposition: analyticity, truth-seeking, systematicity, maturity, inquisitiveness, open-mindedness and CT self confidence. It was found that, there were two disposition scales that correlates with the students writing score. These scales are: inquisitiveness and maturity. The third objective is to look at the transition words that students use in their writing when managing the content of their writing. The study found that students with ambivalent score in CCTDI used more <b>transition</b> <b>phrases</b> compared to students with low CCTDI score. Implications in ESL studies were discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{integrated}} approach for recognizing both the word sequence and the syntactic-prosodic {{structure of a}} spontaneous utterance. We {{take into account the}} fact that a spontaneous utterance is not merely an unstructured sequence of words by incorporating phrase boundary information into the language model and by providing HMMs to model boundaries. This allows for a distinction between word <b>transitions</b> across <b>phrase</b> boundaries and <b>transitions</b> within a <b>phrase.</b> During recognition, the syntactic-prosodic structure of the utterance is determined implicitly. Without any increase in computational effort, this leads to a 4 % reduction of word error rate, and, at the same time, syntactic-prosodic boundary labels are provided for subsequent processing. The boundaries are recognized with a precision and recall rate of about 75 % each. They can be used to reduce drastically the computational effort for parsing spontaneous utterances. We also present a system architecture to inco [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Music {{maintains}} a characteristic balance between repetition and novelty. Here, we report a similar balance in singing performances of free-living Australian pied butcherbirds. Their songs include many phrase types. The more phrase types in a bird's repertoire, the more diverse the singing performance can be. However, without sufficient temporal organization, avian listeners may find diverse singing performances difficult to perceive and memorize. We tested for {{a correlation between}} the complexity of song repertoire and the temporal regularity of singing performance. We found that different phrase types often share motifs (notes or stereotyped groups of notes). These shared motifs reappeared in strikingly regular temporal intervals across different phrase types, over hundreds of phrases produced without interruption by each bird. We developed a statistical estimate to quantify {{the degree to which}} <b>phrase</b> <b>transition</b> structure is optimized for maximizing the regularity of shared motifs. We found that <b>transition</b> probabilities between <b>phrase</b> types tend to maximize regularity in the repetition of shared motifs, but only in birds of high repertoire complexity. Conversely, in birds of low repertoire complexity, shared motifs were produced with less regularity. The strong correlation between repertoire complexity and motif regularity suggests that birds possess a mechanism that regulates the temporal placement of shared motifs in a manner that takes repertoire complexity into account. We discuss alternative musical, mechanistic and ecological explanations to this effect. 15 page(s...|$|R

This {{essay is}} a {{reflection}} on how South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has articulated and defended the proposition that reconciliation affords victims {{of human rights abuses}} the opportunity to forgive their tormentors. While certainly not the only proposed benefit of reconciliation, the author believes that the controversy surrounding the TRC’s call for forgiveness sheds light on the “problem of persuasion ” that appears when institutional and quasi-institutional bodies attempt to generate public support for reconciliation. Truth and Reconciliation. In the motion and instant of <b>transition,</b> this <b>phrase</b> issues a challenge to our understanding, politics, and faith. The meanings of its constituent terms are ambiguous, their relationship contested. How should we read the “and ” that sits between “Truth and Reconciliation? ” At times, these concepts and practices appear coupled; truth motivates reconciliation while reconciliation lends form to truth-seeking, helping to gather what Antjie Krog rightly sees as the dizzying and sometimes paralytic array of truth theory – correspondence, coherence, deflationary, pragmatic, redundancy, semantic, double, logical, subjective, and so on (Krog 1998...|$|R

40|$|A {{universal}} {{detection system}} based on allosteric aptamers, signal amplification cascade, and eye-detectable <b>phrase</b> <b>transition.</b> A broadly applicable homogeneous detection system is provided. It utilizes components of the blood coagulation cascade {{in the presence of}} polystyrene microspheres (MS) as a signal amplifier. Russell's viper venom factor X activator (RVV-X) triggers the cascade, which results in an eye-visible phase transition [...] precipitation of MS bound to clotted fibrin. An allosteric RNA aptamer, RNA 132, with affinity for RVV-X and human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF. sub. 165) was created. RNA 132 inhibits enzymatic activity of RVV-X. The effector molecule, VEGF. sub. 165, reverses the inhibitory activity of RNA 132 on RVV-X and restores its enzymatic activity, thus triggering the cascade and enabling the phase transition. Similar results were obtained for another allosteric aptamer modulated by a protein tyrosine phosphatase. The assay is instrumentation-free for both processing and readout...|$|R

It has been used to describe the static and dynamic semantics of numerous programming and concurrent process languages, and some non-executable specification languages.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{tackle the}} problem of searching for the most {{favourable}} pattern of link capacities allocation that makes a power transmission network resilient to cascading failures with limited investment costs. This problem is formulated within a combinatorial multi-objective optimization framework and tackled by evolutionary algorithms. Two different models of increasing complexity are used to simulate cascading failures in a network and to quantify its resilience: a complex network model (namely, the Motter-Lai (ML) model) and a more detailed and computationally demanding power flow model (namely, the ORNL-Pserc-Alaska (OPA) model). Both models are tested and compared on a case study involving the 400 kV French power transmission network. The results show that cascade-resilient networks {{tend to have a}} non-linear capacity-load relation: in particular, heavily loaded components have smaller unoccupied portions of capacity, whereas lightly loaded links present larger unoccupied portions of capacity (which is in contrast with the linear capacity-load relation hypothesized in previous works of literature). Most importantly, the optimal solutions obtained using the ML and OPA models exhibit consistent characteristics in terms of <b>phrase</b> <b>transitions</b> in the Pareto fronts and link capacity allocation patterns. These results provide incentive for the use of computationally-cheap network-centric models for the optimization of cascade-resilient power network systems, given the advantages of their simplicity and scalability...|$|R
40|$|Bird {{songs are}} {{acoustic}} communication signals primarily used in male-male aggression and in male-female attraction. These are often monotonous patterns {{composed of a}} few phrases, yet some birds have extremely complex songs with a large phrase repertoire, organized in non-random fashion with discernible patterns. Since structure is typically associated with function, the structures of complex bird songs provide important clues {{to the evolution of}} animal communication systems. Here we propose an efficient network-based approach to explore structural design principles of complex bird songs, in which the song networks [...] transition relationships among different phrases and the related structural measures [...] are employed. We demonstrate how this approach works with an example using California Thrasher songs, which are sequences of highly varied phrases delivered in succession over several minutes. These songs display two distinct features: a large phrase repertoire with a 'small-world' architecture, in which subsets of phrases are highly grouped and linked with a short average path length; and a balanced <b>transition</b> diversity amongst <b>phrases,</b> in which deterministic and non-deterministic transition patterns are moderately mixed. We explore the robustness of this approach with variations in sample size and the amount of noise. Our approach enables a more quantitative study of global and local structural properties of complex bird songs than has been possible to date...|$|R
50|$|In the 1900s corsages {{could be}} seen pinned on a dress and were known as bouquet de corsage. With time this <b>phrase</b> <b>transitioned</b> to 'corsage', with corsages being made into wristlets {{because of the new}} styles of dresses being made. In the 1950s, some were made with fruit and would be seen on hats for decoration.

This explains why flowers are seen at special events or occasions such as weddings and sacred rituals during religious practices. It has become a customary practice and a demonstration of affection from a date. It is thought that originally the gentleman would bring a gift of flowers for the parents of his date, and would select one flower to give to his date which would then be carried or attached to her clothing.

40|$|Many {{species of}} animals deliver vocalizations in {{sequences}} {{presumed to be}} governed by internal rules, though the nature and complexity of these syntactical rules have been investigated in relatively few species. Here I present {{an investigation into the}} song syntax of fourteen male Cassin's Vireos (Vireo cassinii), a species whose song sequences are highly temporally structured. I compare their song sequences to three candidate models of varying levels of complexity-zero-order, first-order and second-order Markov models-and employ novel methods to interpolate between these three models. A variety of analyses, including sequence simulations, Fisher's exact tests, and model likelihood analyses, showed that the songs of this species are too complex to be described by a zero-order or first-order Markov model. The model that best fit the data was intermediate in complexity between a first- and second-order model, though I also present evidence that some transition probabilities are conditioned on up to three preceding phrases. In addition, sequences were shown to be predictable with more than 54 % accuracy overall, and predictability was positively correlated with the rate of song delivery. An assessment of the time homogeneity of syntax showed that <b>transition</b> probabilities between <b>phrase</b> types are largely stable over time, but that there was some evidence for modest changes in syntax within and between breeding seasons, a finding that I interpret to represent changes in breeding stage and social context rather than irreversible, secular shifts in syntax over time. These findings constitute a valuable addition to our understanding of bird song syntax in free-living birds, and will contribute to future attempts to understand the evolutionary importance of bird song syntax in avian communication...|$|R
