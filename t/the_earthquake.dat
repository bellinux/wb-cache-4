5|$|Premier of North West Supra Mahumapelo promised {{residents}} {{that all}} who {{were affected by}} <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> would receive help. Mahumapelo said that counselling, social relief and temporary accommodation were being provided, and that the buildings and infrastructure damaged in <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> might take years to repair. The North West provincial government started the North West Disaster Relief Fund to help residents affected by <b>the</b> <b>earthquake.</b> Teams were sent to investigate damage to parts of the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality by the municipality. The Cabinet of South Africa sent its condolences {{to the family of}} the man who was killed by <b>the</b> <b>earthquake.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>earthquake</b> {{occurred}} at 3:00pm local {{time and was}} followed by up to seventeen aftershocks. The main shock lasted at least 30 seconds. According to the BBC, fatalities from the tremor were limited to Qeshm Island; 30 people were injured. Qeshm Island reported 15 injured; its homes were constructed from earthquake-resistant material. <b>The</b> <b>earthquake</b> was felt throughout southern Iran, causing slight to moderate damage. Mercalli ratings of IV (Light) were assigned to Ajman and Ra's al Khaymah, and intensity III (Weak) occurred in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah. Doha in Qatar also reported <b>the</b> <b>earthquake.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{significantly}} slower {{propagation of}} seismic waves {{compared to the}} near-speed-of-light transmission of Internet traffic, some Twitter users read about <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> seconds before feeling the tremors. For example, Twitter users in such cities as New York City and Boston reported reading tweets about <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> from users in Washington, D.C., or Richmond, Virginia, 15 to 30seconds before feeling the quake itself.|$|E
30|$|To model <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes,</b> <b>the</b> {{frequency}} of <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> EQ 4 - 4.9 {{is taken as}} the response variable. Then, two types of GARX models are constructed: first one takes only the frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> other than EQ 4 - 4.9 as the exogenous variables; second one includes additional variables about the solar activities and the magnetospheres. In such a way, we try to investigate the relation between <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> and <b>the</b> solar activities by comparing these models. In what following, GARX for <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> will be introduced.|$|R
30|$|A {{change in}} {{seismicity}} occurred after <b>the</b> 2011 Tohoku-Oki <b>earthquake</b> (Okada et al. 2011 b). In some areas, the seismogenic stress changed {{due to the}} 2011 Tohoku Oki earthquake (Yoshida et al. 2012). In the figures, we plotted the hypocenters before and after <b>the</b> 2011 Tohoku-Oki <b>earthquake</b> in different colors. <b>The</b> <b>earthquakes</b> after <b>the</b> 2011 Tohoku-Oki <b>earthquake</b> occurred in <b>the</b> same areas with <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> before <b>the</b> 2011 Tohoku-Oki <b>earthquake.</b> This suggests that the stress change and/or the fluid pressure change by <b>the</b> 2011 Tohoku-Oki <b>earthquake</b> are not significant for triggering <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> in this region.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the trigger interaction; between <b>the</b> Wenchuan <b>earthquake</b> and <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> on <b>the</b> Xianshuihe fault zone {{as well as the}} stress {{changing}} with the effect of regional tectonic loading, we have studied <b>the</b> seven major <b>earthquakes</b> in <b>the</b> Xianshuihe and Longmenshan fault zones. The regional tectonic loading is approximated by velocity boundaries from GPS data. The split-node technique was used to simulate <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> in upper crust. With the three-dimensional viscoelastic finite element code we simulated the evolution of Coulomb stress. The results show that the trigger interaction between <b>the</b> Wenchuan <b>earthquake</b> and <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> on Xianshuihe fault zone is different. The trigger interaction is obvious on the Xianshuihe fault zone (except <b>the</b> Litang <b>earthquake</b> in 1948 and <b>the</b> Luhuo <b>earthquake</b> in 1973), as 17 to 38 percentages' Coulomb stress increasing was caused by regional tectonic loading, other 49 to 67 percentages of stress was contributed by earthquake deformation. However, part of the Coulomb stress was released by <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> that happened from 1893 to 1981. So it is impossible that <b>the</b> Wenchuan <b>earthquake</b> was triggered by <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> in <b>the</b> past. The Coulomb stress in <b>the</b> Wenchuan <b>earthquake</b> was mainly increased from regional tectonic loading. With occurrence of this <b>earthquake,</b> <b>the</b> certain region released almost all the Coulomb stress and became into a new condition...|$|R
5|$|Focused only several {{kilometres}} {{below the}} surface, <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> resulted in significant shaking {{over a large}} portion of central-eastern South Island. Maximum ground motions registered at VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Christchurch, while strong shaking (MM VI) was felt in adjacent populated areas such as Rolleston and Lincoln. The landforms of Sumner recorded intensified shaking due to the effects of its topographic setting. Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as far afield as Dunedin. <b>The</b> <b>earthquake</b> was felt as far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill.|$|E
5|$|Gifu {{recovered}} from <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> damage {{by the end}} of the Meiji period, and by 1911 was prosperous enough to establish a municipal street car service throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|In Bucharest, <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> had an {{estimated}} intensity of VIII–IX on the Mercalli scale. It toppled church steeples and caused Cotroceni Monastery to collapse.

50|$|This is a megathrust {{earthquake}} which ruptured part of {{the boundary}} between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate. In this area, the Nazca Plate is subducting beneath the South America Plate with a convergence vector of about 7.6 cm/yr. Much of the rupture zone of <b>the</b> 1942 <b>earthquake</b> overlapped with that of <b>the</b> 1996 Nazca <b>earthquake.</b> <b>The</b> rupture zone of <b>the</b> 1942 <b>earthquake</b> was about 40 km longer than that of <b>the</b> 1996 <b>earthquake.</b> <b>The</b> epicenter of <b>the</b> 1942 <b>earthquake</b> was very close to, but slightly southeast of, that of <b>the</b> 1996 <b>earthquake.</b> <b>The</b> energy released by <b>the</b> 1942 <b>earthquake</b> was about 2.5×1017 Nm.|$|R

30|$|The {{seismicity}} {{near the}} Miyagi-oki region became more active than usual {{in the beginning}} of February 2011, almost one month before <b>the</b> Tohoku-oki <b>earthquake</b> occurred. Before <b>the</b> Tohoku-oki <b>earthquake,</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>earthquake</b> was an interplate earthquake with M 7.3, which occurred on March 9, 2011 (Fig. 1). Intensive aftershock seismicity, including moderate-sized (M 5 – 6) earthquakes, followed that event. In this paper, we refer to <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> that preceded <b>the</b> M- 9 <b>earthquake</b> as foreshocks of <b>the</b> Tohoku-oki <b>earthquake</b> because of their proximity to <b>the</b> Tohoku-oki <b>earthquake</b> in terms of time and space. Further, from the hypocenter catalogue published by JMA, it has been pointed out that the epicenters of the foreshocks migrated toward the hypocenter of the mainshock of <b>the</b> Tohoku-oki <b>earthquake</b> (Ando and Imanishi, 2011; Kato et al., 2012).|$|R

5|$|The Imperial Valley is {{surrounded}} by a number of interconnected fault systems and is vulnerable to both moderate and strong earthquakes as well as earthquake swarms. The area was equipped with an array of strong motion seismographs for analyzing the fault mechanisms of nearby earthquakes and seismic characteristics of the sediments in the valley. <b>The</b> <b>earthquake</b> was significant in the scientific community for studies of both fault mechanics and repeat events. Four of the region's known strike-slip faults and one additional newly discovered normal fault all broke the surface during <b>the</b> <b>earthquake.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>earthquake</b> {{occurred}} {{as a result}} of normal faulting to the west of Iwaki and triggered numerous landslides across adjacent mountainous areas. A few fires broke out, and 220,000 households lost electricity. Officials issued localised tsunami alerts, though no significant waves were generated. <b>The</b> <b>earthquake</b> caused little structural damage, but killed four people and injured ten others. The strong ground movements triggered the reactivation of a nearby geological fault, prompting researchers to conduct extensive surveys in the region.|$|E
5000|$|Two years later, on 14 March 1983, the Seattle Sounders (NASL) hired Calloway {{as their}} new head coach.
