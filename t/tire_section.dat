An inflated aircraft tire model, which was validated by comparison with experimental indentation tests, showed that over-rolling of stones under typical takeoff conditions led to only modest vertical loft velocities of less than 5 m/s. Experiments using a drop weight impactor {{to simulate}} a section of aircraft tire descending upon stones, demonstrated that lofting was achieved with impacts with low rubber thicknesses, but with greater rubber thickness lofting was suppressed. Using more realistic tire geometries resulted in launches with backspin, but only horizontally along {{the ground in the}} direction of the tire axis. The speed at which launches occurred was proportional to the rate of descent of the <b>tire</b> <b>section</b> and would consequently determine the loft speeds due to potential asperity lofting.

40|$|Tires {{are made}} of {{viscoelastic}} materials with stiffness quite dependent on the frequency. Generally, two causes of the stiffness increase are distinguished : a frequency dependence complex modulus and a geometrical stiffness. In this paper, an experimental and theoretical study on the relaxation and frequency dependence of complex moduli of the tire constitutive materials are presented and validated. Expressions of the viscoelastic behavior are presented in time and frequency domains. The {{results show that the}} real part of the Young's modulus is monotonic according to the frequency. It contributes to {{an important part of the}} stiffening. A numerical approach simulating the experimental results of the contact area of Cesbron is also presented. The tire is modeled with a real material distribution in the <b>tire</b> <b>section.</b> The geometrical stiffness also increases with the rotational velocity and it varies with the vibration frequencies. Static and dynamic computations for different rolling velocities are done. The results show that the contact area depends on the velocity of the rolling tire. Comparisons between the measurements and the computations show a good agrement and a decrease of about 20 % in the contact areas when the tire rolls compared to a static tire. This difference can be explained by the viscoelastic properties of the materials...|$|E

As deflections for a given tire size, inflation pressure and vertical load are significantly different between bias-ply and radial-ply tires, {{this study was conducted}} to predict deflection () of radial-ply <b>tire</b> based on <b>section</b> width (b), overall unloaded diameter (d), inflation pressure (P) and vertical load (W). For this purpose, deflection of four radial-ply <b>tires</b> with different <b>section</b> width and/or overall unloaded diameter were measured at five levels of inflation pressure and five levels of vertical load. Results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tires No. 1, 2 and 3 were utilized to determine multiple variables regression model and results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tire No. 4 were used to verify selected model. The paired samples t-test results showed that the difference between the deflection values predicted by model and measured by test apparatus were not statistically significant and to predict deflection of radial-ply <b>tire</b> based on <b>section</b> width, overall unloaded diameter, inflation pressure and vertical 2 load the multiple variables regression model = 75. 67 + 0. 104 b- 0. 107 d- 0. 758 P + 3. 519 W with R = 0. 986 can be strongly recommended.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop efficient modeling techniques and computational strategies for: (1) predicting the nonlinear response of tires subjected to inflation pressure, mechanical and thermal loads; (2) determining the footprint region, and analyzing the tire pavement contact problem, including the effect of friction; and (3) determining the sensitivity of the tire response (displacements, stresses, strain energy, contact pressures and contact area) to variations in the different material and geometric parameters. Two computational strategies were developed. In the first strategy the tire was modeled by using either a two-dimensional shear flexible mixed shell finite elements or a quasi-three-dimensional solid model. The contact conditions were incorporated into the formulation by using a perturbed Lagrangian approach. A number of model reduction techniques were applied to substantially reduce the number of degrees of freedom used in describing the response outside the contact region. The second strategy exploited the axial symmetry of the undeformed tire, and uses cylindrical coordinates in the development of three-dimensional elements for modeling each of the different parts of the <b>tire</b> cross <b>section.</b> Model reduction techniques are also used with this strategy...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} road utilization and tightening regulations, an increasing effort {{is made by}} the tire and automotive industries for accurate modeling of tire/road noise. It {{is well known that}} finite element (FE) based methods describing the vibration response of a rolling tire are computationally expensive while analytical models do not offer the necessary accuracy in the structural description of the tire. The recently proposed waveguide finite element (WFE) method combines the detailed description of a discretized <b>tire</b> cross <b>section</b> with a computationally efficient wave approach in the circumferential direction. The method has been successfully applied for tire dynamics and rolling noise simulations. An important aspect for the modeling of rolling noise is an accurate description of the road induced excitation. Both the high frequency vibration field and the lower frequency or quasi-static contact area need to be accurately captured. In this work we compare FE and WFE models of a tire in terms of traditional NVH properties such as mobility and modal frequencies, and in term of contact behavior such as footprint shape and structural stiffness. This way the potential of the WFE method for the modeling of both the excitation and the response of a rolling tire is critically examined...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{procedure is}} presented for {{the solution of}} frictional contact problems for aircraft tires. A Space Shuttle nose-gear tire is modeled using a two-dimensional laminated anisotropic shell theory which includes the effects of variations in material and geometric parameters, transverse-shear deformation, and geometric nonlinearities. Contact conditions are incorporated into the formulation by using a perturbed Lagrangian approach with the fundamental unknowns consisting of the stress resultants, the generalized displacements, and the Lagrange multipliers associated with both contact and friction conditions. The contact-friction algorithm {{is based on a}} modified Coulomb friction law. A modified two-field, mixed-variational principle is used to obtain elemental arrays. This modification consists of augmenting the functional of that principle by two terms: the Lagrange multiplier vector associated with normal and tangential node contact-load intensities and a regularization term that is quadratic in the Lagrange multiplier vector. These capabilities and computational features are incorporated into an in-house computer code. Experimental measurements were taken to define the response of the Space Shuttle nose-gear tire to inflation-pressure loads and to inflation-pressure loads combined with normal static loads against a rigid flat plate. These experimental results describe the meridional growth of the <b>tire</b> cross <b>section</b> caused by inflation loading, the static load-deflection characteristics of the tire, the geometry of the tire footprint under static loading conditions, and the normal and tangential load-intensity distributions in the tire footprint for the various static vertical loading conditions.

40|$|Roads in many {{northern}} climates like Saskatchewan can undergo {{structural failure}} caused by frost action and substructure moisture problems. Frost action can be efficiently controlled by eliminating {{at least one}} of the following conditions: moisture; freezing temperatures; and frost susceptible soils. However, effective use of shredded tire material could provide an environmentally sustainable solution for waste tires and could relieve pressure on limited quality aggregate resources. The City of Saskatoon has successfully incorporated crushed rock and crushed recycled concrete as a subsurface road drainage layer to mitigate substructure drainage and frost issues. However, the price of crushed high value aggregates can be cost prohibitive and at times these materials are not available in quantities required. Previous research has documented that shredded tires are efficient in controlling frost action by providing thermal insulation and free drainage, but shredded tires performed poorly as a structural support layer with low mechanical stiffness and high compressibility properties. The goal of this research was to provide improved pavement performance with respect to road substructure moisture drainage and frost mitigation. The specific objectives of this research were to: •	Quantify the mechanical properties of shredded tires and investigate the mechanical behavior of mixes of shredded tires with and without sand blended into the tire matrix as compared to conventional subbase and base coarse materials; •	Determine the permeability of shredded tires and investigate the effect of sand on the permeability of shredded tire/sand mixes as compared to conventional granular base and subbase materials, and; •	Compare the structural primary response behavior and capital cost of alternate road structures constructed with shredded tires and mixes of shredded tire and sand as a free draining subbase material compared to conventional drainage layers and road structures. The hypothesis of this research was that the mechanical behavior of shredded tire material, used as a road substructure layer, can be improved by blending it with free draining sand. It was also hypothesized that blending shredded tire with free draining sand will have improved drainage compared to conventional granular subbase and base course materials. Volumetric and mechanistic material properties and structural performance behavior of shredded tires and shredded tire/sand mixes in the mix ratios (by volume) of 1 Tire: 1 Sand, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand were evaluated and compared to City of Saskatoon subbase materials: crushed rock and granular base; as well as Saskatchewan Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure (SMHI) Type 6 subbase. Laboratory characterization showed that 100 % shredded tire materials were uniformly graded indicating high amounts of voids. The addition of sand resulted in a reduction of interparticle air voids. Results from strength and stiffness characterization tests indicated that 100 % shredded tires exhibited low structural stiffness, but this behavior was improved as the quantity of sand in the shredded tire was increased. The 100 % shredded tire material was determined to have a dynamic modulus value of 5 MPa, whereas shredded tires/sand blends at the ratios of 1 Tire: 1 Sand, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand gave dynamic moduli values of 30 MPa, 110 MPa and 158 MPa, respectively. For comparison, SMHI Type 6 subbase, City of Saskatoon crushed rock and granular base exhibited dynamic moduli values of 94 MPa, 174 MPa and 471 MPa, respectively. Permeability characterization indicated that the 100 % shredded tire materials were free draining at 1. 42 cm/s. Permeability decreased from 1. 42 cm/s with 100 % shredded tire to 0. 0026 cm/s with 1 Tire: 3 Sand. However, the shredded tire/sand mixes maintained permeability values higher than sand (0. 0013 cm/s). SMHI Type 6 subbase and granular materials were found to have a permeability of 0. 0018 cm/s and 0. 000025 cm/s, respectively, while crushed rock was free draining with a permeability of 1. 12 cm/s. Structural behavior of 100 % shredded tire, shredded tire/sand mixes and City of Saskatoon subbase materials were studied in road models using a 3 -D numerical road modeling software that encoded triaxial material constitutive relationships determined in this research. A typical City of Saskatoon road structure was assumed for all road structures considered in this study with varying subbase material so as to directly compare the structural effect of the shredded tire with conventional road materials under primary load limits. Modeled results of the 100 % shredded tire and crushed rock roads showed peak surface deflections of 2. 19 mm and 0. 73 mm, respectively. Peak surface deflection under primary load limits was found to decrease with an increase in sand quantity within the shredded tire layer. Based on the modeling results, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand yielded peak surface deflections of 1. 01 mm and 0. 96 mm, respectively. For comparative purposes, road structures with SMHI Type 6 subbase deflected at 1. 14 mm. Field test sections were constructed at Adolph Way in Saskatoon to compare the structural performance of shredded tire to crushed rock (currently specified by City of Saskatoon for drainage layers) in a typical residential road in Saskatoon. Unfortunately, both crushed rock (control) and shredded <b>tire</b> <b>sections</b> were found to deflect above acceptable limits due to high moisture conditions within the deep subgrade. Therefore, deeper excavation was required and the test sections were not constructed. The Adolph Way field experimentation of shredded tire showed that shredded tire road systems can be effectively constructed in the field, but showed the same sensitivity to poor subgrade conditions as crushed rock. Capital cost analysis showed the 100 % shredded tire and shredded tire/sand subbase layers to be less expensive than City of Saskatoon specified crushed rock drainage layers. The 100 % shredded tire layer was estimated at a total cost of $ 2. 93 /m 2 while 1 Tire: 1 Sand, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand were estimated at $ 4. 39 /m 2, $ 4. 88 /m 2 and $ 5. 12 /m 2, respectively. SMHI Type 6 subbase, crushed rock and granular base layers were estimated at a total cost of $ 5. 85 /m 2, $ 13. 95 /m 2 and $ 9. 00 /m 2, respectively for equivalent thickness. From the structural, permeability and economic perspective of this research, the 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand materials proved to be cost efficient as well as technically viable options for mitigating frost action as compared with City of Saskatoon crushed rock materials evaluated. The use of shredded tire/sand mixes of 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand in urban local road structures with low traffic volumes are therefore recommended as a cost effective subbase drainage layer material...|$|R
