5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the caf√©-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department</b> immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department,</b> the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department.</b>|$|E

50|$|Budgeting and districting of <b>the</b> various <b>fire</b> <b>departments</b> {{throughout}} <b>the</b> {{city has}} been unstable since 2007, due to an extended legal conflict between the volunteer departments and the Malloy administration, which sought to consolidate <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>departments</b> against <b>the</b> advice and wishes of <b>the</b> volunteer <b>fire</b> <b>departments.</b>|$|R
50|$|The town is {{protected}} by both <b>the</b> Bennington <b>Fire</b> <b>Department</b> and <b>the</b> Bennington Rural <b>Fire</b> <b>Department.</b> <b>The</b> current chief of <b>the</b> Bennington <b>Fire</b> <b>Department</b> is Jeff Vickers, and the current chief of <b>the</b> Bennington Rural <b>Fire</b> <b>Department</b> is Wayne Davis.|$|R

5|$|The building, {{including}} the load-bearing elements, was constructed of wood. There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 fire hoses in the hotel. Only a few escape routes had proper emergency lighting and {{directions to the}} emergency exits, and the hotel was also not on a hotline with the emergency centre of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department.</b> The building had been inspected by <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department,</b> first in February 1976, {{and later in the}} beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects. They issued a list of proposed improvements to be implemented by the hotel, such as complying with the building regulations and the regulations for residence facilities.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the annual}} cost of agency {{communication}} was NOK175 million, while this had increased to NOK260 million in 2004. The increase was largely caused by the increase in use of mobile telephones. The costs of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department</b> networks was {{paid for by the}} municipalities, the health network paid for by the municipalities and the regional health authorities, and the police networks by the respective police districts.|$|E
25|$|Established in 1786, <b>the</b> Rogersville <b>Fire</b> <b>Department,</b> a {{volunteer}} <b>department,</b> is <b>the</b> second-oldest <b>fire</b> <b>department</b> in Tennessee, {{and one of}} <b>the</b> oldest active <b>fire</b> <b>departments</b> in <b>the</b> United States.|$|R

5|$|The {{project has}} been {{supported}} by some public officials, and received some public funding, but received criticism for its financial ties to the Church of Scientology, for exposing rescue workers to potential medical dangers, and for discouraging their use of orthodox medicine. Sources in <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Department</b> told a reporter that several participants had joined Scientology, even disconnecting from their families.|$|E
5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of {{the main part of}} the building also burned through and collapsed. Despite the fact that there were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department</b> proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30am the fire was declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> 1800s <b>fire</b> <b>departments</b> {{typically}} {{had similar}} uniforms. Black or navy blue pants, red wool shirt with black breast and white insignia and patented leather belts.

5|$|Firefighters from <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Department</b> of the City of New York (FDNY), at {{that time}} a {{volunteer}} organization, arrived {{under the command of}} Chief Engineer Cornelius Anderson. As the fire grew, the FDNY personnel were joined by retired fire chiefs from the city and firefighting crews from Brooklyn, Newark, and Williamsburg. Firemen battling the blaze were aided by water flowing from the Croton Aqueduct, which had been completed in 1842. The fire either weakened in intensity or had been subdued by firefighters by 1:00 p.m. that day.|$|E
5|$|Homestead {{was mostly}} flooded underwater, {{with the first}} floor of city hall and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department</b> {{completely}} flooded and nearly all its residences destroyed.

5|$|With the victory, the Indians {{received}} their first playoff berth since the 1920 World Series. Indians' Manager Lou Boudreau dedicated the victory to pitcher Don Black, {{who suffered a}} cerebral hemorrhage the previous month. The Indians went on to face the Boston Braves in the 1948 World Series, winning it four games to two. The Red Sox fans experienced disappointment when Boston mayor James M. Curley ordered <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department</b> sirens sounded when Boston won the pennant. The sirens did sound, but it was instead for {{a fire in the}} Boston navy yard.|$|E

5|$|After {{dismissing the}} idea of taking Simpson family home videos and a geode, Bart brings Santa's Little Helper to school for show and tell. Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school air ducts to follow the food scent coming from the kitchen and is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after the dog and catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent to exit and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department</b> is called in to rescue him. As the firemen are attempting to rescue Willie, an outraged Superintendent Chalmers appears and fires Principal Skinner, much to Bart's shock.|$|E
5|$|Hose Company #12, {{and later}} Hose Company #11, hired the first African-American firefighters in the city. One of these {{stations}} was located at 20th and Lake Streets. One {{of the first}} African-American firefighters in Omaha was James C. Greer, Sr. {{who was a member}} of the Omaha Fire Department from May 5, 1906, to August 1, 1933, and was a captain in the department for many years.

He retired as senior captain from the Omaha Fire Department in 1933. His son Richard N. Greer served as a volunteer for <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department</b> in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>department</b> {{moved to}} Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed {{for fear that}} {{unscrewing}} the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, the bulb has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only been off the grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E
50|$|Standing next to <b>the</b> Moraga <b>fire</b> <b>department</b> is <b>the</b> hazard house. The hazard house {{serves as}} a display for {{elementary}} school tours to demonstrate all the things not {{to do and how}} to prevent a <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> Moraga <b>Fire</b> <b>Department</b> began as a volunteer service staffed by retirees. <b>The</b> Moraga <b>Fire</b> <b>Department</b> is part of <b>the</b> Moraga Orinda <b>Fire</b> District.|$|R
