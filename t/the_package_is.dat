25|$|Ultra Heat Treatment (UHT), {{is a type}} of milk {{processing}} where all bacteria are destroyed with high heat to extend its shelf life for up to 6 months, as long as <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>is</b> not opened. Milk is firstly homogenized and then is heated to 138 degrees Celsius for 1–3 seconds. The milk is immediately cooled down and packed into a sterile container. As a result of this treatment, all the pathogenic bacteria within the milk are destroyed, unlike when the milk is just pasteurised. The milk will now keep for up for 6 months if unopened. UHT milk {{does not need to be}} refrigerated until <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>is</b> opened, which makes it easier to ship and store. But in this process there is a loss of vitamin B1 and vitamin C and there is also a slight change in the taste of the milk.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Staden <b>Package</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} by Rodger Staden's {{group at the}} Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England, since 1977. <b>The</b> <b>package</b> <b>was</b> available free to academic users, with 2,500 licenses issued in 2003 and an estimated 10,000 users, when funding for further development ended. <b>The</b> <b>package</b> <b>was</b> converted to open source in 2004, and several new versions have been released since.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} deliver the {{developed}} product to the customer, the vendor needs to package the different components of its product into a package. By doing this, the customer will receive all the information and software components at once fulfilling all its needs. After combining all elements into one package the software vendor will carefully have to check if <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>is</b> complete. The package will have to provide the customer with all the tools and information to use the product. When {{this is not the}} case the software vendor will get a lot of questions from its customers which will consume a lot of time. It is therefore very important that <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>is</b> checked carefully before it is shipped. The package can be a physical combination of different elements packed into for example a box, but it can also be a digital combination of files which contain all the elements. Within the CCU process it is stated that a package will consist of five elements, being: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. In the following paragraphs is explained how these elements fit into the CCU delivery phase.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} applying the carbon {{to the surface}} of the iron involved packing the iron in a mixture of ground bone and charcoal or a combination of leather, hooves, salt and urine, all inside a well-sealed box. This carburizing package is then heated to a high temperature but still under the melting point of the iron and left at that temperature for a length of time. The longer <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>is</b> held at the high temperature, the deeper the carbon will diffuse into the surface. Different depths of hardening are desirable for different purposes: sharp tools need deep hardening to allow grinding and resharpening without exposing the soft core, while machine parts like gears might need only shallow hardening for increased wear resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{software}} distribution {{of a product}} can be done offline as well as online. In an offline situation <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>is</b> a physical package which contains all the elements. The software is stored on a data carrier such as a CD or a DVD, and the documents might also be stored in a digital form on this data carrier, or they might be in physical form such as a booklet. The package {{as a whole is}} a physical product. In an online situation the entire package needs to be in a digital form. The consequences on the distribution process are described in the following paragraphs. CCU is designed to fit both situations but as bandwidth is growing it is making more sense to distribute especially updates and new versions to existing customers online. In this article both ways are discussed. In the process-data model it is assumed that the software vendor conducts both distribution channels. As a practical example: HISComp, a provider of medical information systems distributes its software straightforward via CDs. However they use their website to distribute patches for the software products.|$|E
