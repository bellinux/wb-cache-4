5000|$|When {{central vision}} is compromised, {{as in the}} case of macular scotoma, {{patients}} develop an eccentric or extra-foveal vision, normally with unstable fixation. The retinal area used by eccentric viewers to substitute the foveal vision is known as the Preferred Retinal Locus (PRL) In Microperimetry systems, the fundus (eye) is imaged in real time, while an eye tracker compensates eye movements during stimuli projection, allowing correct matching between expected and projected stimulus position onto the retina. Simultaneously, the eye tracker plots the retinal movement during fixation attempt defining the PRL zone as well as fixation stability. Some microperimetry instruments calculate 2 different PRL zones during the examination. To create the fundus image an infrared <b>telecamera</b> is used, {{as in the case}} of the [...] "Nidek-MP1", or a Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO), {{as in the case of}} the [...] "Centervue-MAIA".|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, a short {{description}} of the basic concepts about optical methods for the acquisition of three-dimensional shapes is first presented. Then two applications of the surface reconstruction are presented: the passive technique Shape from Silhouettes and the active technique Laser Triangolation. With both these techniques the sensors (<b>telecameras</b> and laser beam) were moved and oriented {{by means of a}} robot arm. In fact, for complex objects, {{it is important that the}} measuring device can move along arbitrary paths and make its measurements from suitable directions. This chapter shows how a standard industrial robot with a laser profile scanner can be used to achieve the desired d-o-f. Finally some experimental results of shape acquisition by means of the Laser Triangolation technique are reported...|$|R

40|$|We asses the {{interactions}} between the different biomaterials used in intraocular lenses (IOL) and the tamponade agents used in vitreoretinal surgery. Morphological analysis was carried out macro-filming with a <b>telecamera</b> coupled to an image analysis system and with a scannig electron microscope. The contact between the silicone oil and the silicone lenses causes numerous bubbles visible under the optical microscope {{as a result of}} the biophysical contact. The electron scanning microscope revealed a thin layer of silicone covering the whole surface the optic disc, while on the loops the silicone oil deposits in a charateristic spindlelike pattern. On the multifocal IOLs the silicone oil forms a surface film that masks the characteristic pattern of concentric rings. Silicone oil can distort the optical characteristics of IOLs in direct proportion to their hydrophobicity.

40|$|A "Short {{course of}} dissection" was {{introduced}} in 1999 for the second-year medical students at the University of Padova. The course aims to offer a direct experience of practical anatomy despite a shortage of time for anatomy courses and lack of availability of cadavers. The course is optional and is planned for 40 students, subdivided into eight working groups. It consists of five sessions on the following topics: the viscera of the male pelvis; the viscera of the female pelvis; the kidney, the testis and spermatic cord; the thorax and abdomen; the brain. Each session lasts 3 hours and is organized as follow: (A) Theory: Teacher: concise review of the systematic and topographic anatomy of the selected topic (20 min); Students: analysis of a dissection guide (20 min). (B) Practice: Students: identification of the viscera and vascular and nervous structures, through inspection and palpation (15 min); step-by-step dissection following the worksheet (80 min); presentation of the visceral blocks as prosections under a closed-circuit <b>telecamera</b> (anatomical variability) (30 min); Teachers and students: three-dimensional conceptualization tests (15 min). At {{the end of the}} 2000 and 2001 courses, a questionnaire was administered to the students and the results confirm the usefulness of dissection for developing a three-dimensional knowledge of anatomy. In our opinion the main guidelines in planning a short course of dissection are: (1) selection of the topics, aimed at allowing experience of the gross anatomy of single viscera, fascia and serosa as well as the evaluation of the topographical relationships between parts of different systems including the local vessels and nerves; (2) preparation of a worksheet, presenting in 10 - 15 points concise instructions for the step-by-step progression from inspection to palpation and dissection of the anatomical structures of the visceral block; (3) direct dissection, brief and selective, by students; (4) clinical correlation; (5) motivational teachers, who stimulate the active involvement of students in "learning by doing" and also "learning how to do"...|$|E
40|$|Between 1971 and 2001, the Southeast Crater was {{the most}} {{productive}} of the four summit craters of Mount Etna, with activity that can be compared, on a global scale, to the opening phases of the Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō-Kūpaianaha eruption of Kīlauea volcano, Hawai‘i. The period of highest eruptive rate was between 1996 and 2001, when near-continuous activity occurred in five phases. These were characterized by {{a wide range of}} eruptive styles and intensities from quiet, non-explosive lava emission to brief, violent lava-fountaining episodes. Much of the cone growth occurred during these fountaining episodes, totaling 105 events. Many showed complex dynamics such as different eruptive styles at multiple vents, and resulted in the growth of minor edifices on the flanks of the Southeast Crater cone. Small pyroclastic flows were produced during some of the eruptive episodes, when oblique tephra jets showered the steep flanks of the cone with hot bombs and scoriae. Fluctuations in the eruptive style and eruption rates were controlled by a complex interplay between changes in the conduit geometry (including the growth of a shallow magma reservoir under the Southeast Crater), magma supply rates, and flank instability. During this period, volume calculations were made with the aid of GIS and image analysis of video footage obtained by a monitoring <b>telecamera.</b> Between 1996 and 2001, the bulk volume of the cone increased by ~ 36 × 106 m 3, giving a total (1971 – 2001) volume of ~ 72 × 106 m 3. At the same time, the cone gained ~ 105 m in height, reaching an elevation of about 3, 300 m. The total DRE volume of the 1996 – 2001 products was ~ 90 × 106 m 3. This mostly comprised lava flows (72 × 106 m 3) erupted at the summit and onto the flanks of the cone. These values indicate that the productivity of the Southeast Crater increased fourfold during 1996 – 2001 with respect to the previous 25 years, coinciding with a general increase in the eruptive output rates and eruption intensity at Etna.

A Intermédia nos mecanismos de encenação (a telecamara a captar imagens da actuação do actor em palco e a projectá-las em directo na tela) irá contribuir para o aprofundamento deste «binómio» facultado, cada vez mais, pelo fácil acesso às novas tecnologias e ao seu enorme e progressivo avanço. Por outro lado, o actor vai, também, aprofundar e desenvolver a sua consciência nestes dois planos de actuação simultânea. Verifica-se a sua presença no espaço físico (cena) e em simultâneo a reprodução da sua emoção amplificada através do grande-plano, no espaço virtual (ecrã). Esta ubiquidade, em que o actor é, ao mesmo tempo, a imagem e faz a imagem, dá lugar a uma actuação paralela que se funde de forma a permitir uma única leitura para o público. Com estas duas linguagens (Teatro/Cinema) distintas mas, de certa forma, próximas e muito utilizadas no universo da criação artística contemporânea, cria-se uma narrativa miscigenada criada pela conjugação destas duas disciplinas e através da qual não se perde a tridimensionalidade da actuação em cena. O teatro. As questões orientadoras deste trabalho são: a) nos mecanismos de encenação proporcionados pela «Intermédia», que discurso paralelo o actor/intérprete deve usar conscientemente na comunicação directa com o público e como se deve relacionar, em simultâneo, com a telecamara; b) por outro lado, tem-se em conta o desenvolvimento de um método de fusão, ao nível da narrativa dramática, na qual a simultaneidade das sintaxes teatral e cinematográfica se conjuga para criar um objecto híbrido. Esta estética insere-se nos parâmetros da criação contemporânea. ABSTRACT - This text is {{a report}} of project, a {{descriptive}} of the construction method used {{in the context of}} the show FERAS AMESTRADAS – Comédia Musical Negra à Portuguesa, staged by Afonso Guerreiro, which was final exercise for the discipline of Staging II, conducted by Carlos Pessoa, who rated this work with 18 marks/ 20. Within the mechanisms of staging (<b>telecamera</b> capturing images of the actor’s acting on stage and projecting them directly on screen), the Inter-media provided the depth of this 'duality', increasingly provided by the easy access to new technologies and its huge and progressive advancement. On the other hand, the actor will also deepen and develop his awareness of these two plans. By this, we mean his presence in the physical space (scene) and the simultaneous reproduction of his emotion amplified through close-up, on the virtual space (screen). This ubiquity, in which the player is, at the same time, the image and the image maker, gives rise to an acting allowing the public a parallel reading. With these two distinct but somehow very close languages (Theatre/Cinema), widely used in the world of contemporary artistic creation, a mixed narrative is created, through which the three-dimensionality on the scene of action is not lost. Within the mechanisms of staging provided by Inter-media, the questions guidelines of this study are linked to which parallel speech is the actor/performer to consciously use in direct communication with the public, and how to relate to the telecamara. Furthermore, regard has been given to the development of a method of melting, as far as the narrative dramatic is concerned, in which the simultaneous theater and film syntax is combined to create a hybrid object. This aesthetic fits the parameters of contemporary creation...|$|E
