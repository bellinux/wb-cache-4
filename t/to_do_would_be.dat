25|$|Some {{classical}} and modern scholars have analyzed Abraham's reasoning for hiding Sarah's position as his wife. Rashi argued {{that when a}} stranger comes to town, the proper thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to inquire if he needs food and drink, not whether his female companion is a married woman, and hence as Abimelech did the latter, it tipped off Abraham {{to the fact that}} there is no fear of God in this place, and so he lied about his relationship with Sarah in order to avoid being killed. Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in the lives of those who otherwise lived upright lives, comparable to Noah's and Lot's drunkenness and David's adultery.|$|E
500|$|Delegate Houston had a {{long list}} of quibbles about the coin's design. [...] For example, Beach had placed an anklet on the chief's leg; Houston felt such an item would not have been worn. Beach defended some of his choices, such as the anklet (which was removed when Houston insisted), and promised to comply with the remainder. This did not satisfy Houston, who was also unhappy about the shape of the palm tree on the coin, and Beach {{modified}} the design again. [...] Beach forwarded final models, indicating that he would only consider making changes if the Mint requested it. [...] He wrote to Moore, [...] "I think the proper thing for Mr. Houston <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to take the sculptor and family to Hawaii and let us live in the cocoanut [...] trees for a while and absorb the atmosphere of that paradise." ...|$|E
500|$|Another of Bradley's {{concerns}} in his {{message to the}} legislature was {{the condition of the}} Governor's Mansion. In his address, he declared [...] "As to the Executive Mansion, for years its floors have been propped up to prevent them from falling, and it required more than seven hundred feet of weather strips to make it comfortable in the winter. The present site is disagreeable, the view from one side overlooks the walls of the penitentiary, and from the other the smokestack of a large flouring mill nearby." [...] Instead of addressing Bradley's concerns, the General Assembly passed a [...] "ripper bill" [...] taking control of the mansion from the governor and putting it {{under the supervision of the}} Court of Appeals. On February 10, 1899, the mansion caught fire as a result of a faulty flue in the governor's bedroom. The day was so cold that the fireman had difficulty keeping the water in their hoses unfrozen, and the mansion suffered extensive damage. Though the mansion was insured and a reporter for the Courier-Journal opined that the sensible thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to demolish the old structure and construct a new one or purchase another house in Frankfort to serve as the governor's mansion, the legislature was disinclined to make more than minimal accommodations for a Republican governor. Consequently, the mansion was once again repaired. The Bradleys stayed with a neighbor in Frankfort immediately after the fire. Thereafter, Governor Bradley stayed in Frankfort's Capitol Hotel, while Mrs. Bradley and daughter Christine returned to the family's home in Lancaster. The family re-occupied the residence prior to the end of Bradley's term.|$|E

500|$|Wright's {{contributions}} to the band diminished in the late 1970s as Waters began to write more material, with Animals being the first album where he did not receive any songwriter credits. By the time the group was recording The Wall in 1979, Waters had become frustrated that Wright was not contributing enough yet still claiming an equal share of production royalties. Wright refused {{to catch up on}} the recording backlog as his first marriage had deteriorated and he had not seen enough of his children, deciding family was more important. Waters considered suing Wright, but ultimately decided an easier thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> for Wright to leave the band {{at the end of the}} project. As the band was in financial trouble at the time, Wright agreed to these terms. Several other musicians, including Waters, Gilmour, producer Bob Ezrin, composer Michael Kamen and session player Fred Mandel played keyboards on The Wall. Wright was retained as a salaried session musician during the live concerts to promote that album in 1980–81, and he became the only member of Pink Floyd to profit from the initial run of the costly Wall shows, since the net financial loss had to be borne by the three remaining [...] "full-time" [...] members. Wright did not attend the 1982 premiere of the film version of Pink Floyd—The Wall. In 1983, Pink Floyd released The Final Cut, the only album from the band on which Wright does not appear. His absence from the credits was the first time fans realised he had left the group, which was officially confirmed some years later.|$|E

2500|$|But Stewart {{described}} the Kasenetz-Katz deal as a breakthrough: [...] "That {{allowed us to}} get the extra equipment {{to turn it into}} a real studio. To begin with they were interested in Graham's songwriting and when they heard that he was involved in a studio I think they thought the most economical thing for them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to book his studio and then put him to work there – but they ended up recording Graham's songs and then some of Kevin and Lol's songs, and we were all working together." ...|$|E
