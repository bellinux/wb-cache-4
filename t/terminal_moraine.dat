50|$|The {{glaciation}} {{during the}} Ice Ages also deepened {{many of the}} river valleys, which were invaded by the sea when the ice melted, creating the noteworthy fjords of Norway. In {{the southern part of}} the peninsula, the glaciers deposited vast numbers of <b>terminal</b> <b>moraines,</b> configuring a very chaotic landscape. These <b>terminal</b> <b>moraines</b> covered all of what is now Denmark.|$|R

25|$|Staten Island {{has been}} at the {{southern}} terminus of various periods of glaciation. The most recent, the Wisconsin Glacier, ended approximately 12,000 years ago. The accumulated rock and sediment deposited at the terminus of the glacier is known as the <b>terminal</b> <b>moraine</b> present along the central portion of the island. The evidence of these glacial periods is visible in the remaining wooded areas of Staten Island in the form of glacial erratics and kettle ponds.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{channel of}} the Illinois River was shaped {{in a matter}} of days by the Kankakee Torrent. During the melting of the Wisconsin Glacier about 10,000 years ago, a lake formed in present-day Indiana, {{comparable}} to one of the modern Great Lakes. The lake formed behind the <b>terminal</b> <b>moraine</b> of a substage of that glacier. Melting ice to the north eventually raised the level of the lake so that it overflowed the moraine. The dam burst, and the entire volume of the lake was released in a very short time, perhaps a few days.|$|E
25|$|A glacial lake {{outburst}} flood (GLOF) {{is a type}} of outburst flood {{that occurs}} when the dam containing a glacial lake fails. An event similar to a GLOF, where a body of water contained by a glacier melts or overflows the glacier, is called a Jökulhlaup. The dam can consist of glacier ice or a <b>terminal</b> <b>moraine.</b> Failure can happen due to erosion, a buildup of water pressure, an avalanche of rock or heavy snow, an earthquake or cryoseism, volcanic eruptions under the ice, or if a large enough portion of a glacier breaks off and massively displaces the waters in a glacial lake at its base.|$|E

25|$|Glaciation and the {{resulting}} glacial and fluvio-glacial deposition has had a vast impact on the geology of England covering many areas with a veneer of glacial till in the lower lying areas north of a line running from Bristol to London. In the Ribble valley, Lancashire in north west England {{the resulting}} drumlins are clearly visible. Cromer Ridge in East Anglia is a <b>terminal</b> <b>moraine.</b> Indeed, most of East Anglia is covered with glacial till which has produced its rich loamy soils. This unconsolidated material (it is not stuck tightly together) is very easily eroded hence the rapid rate of retreat of the coastline of this region.|$|E
25|$|During {{at least}} three glacial periods, {{including}} the Wisconsin glaciation around 20,000 years ago, ice sheets advanced south across North America carving moraines, valleys, and hills. In particular, bays and estuaries were formed along {{the north shore of}} Long Island. During glaciation, what is now Flushing Meadows Park was formed just north of the <b>terminal</b> <b>moraine</b> that runs across Long Island, which consisted of sand, gravel, clay and boulders. The moraine created a drainage divide, with rivers north of the moraine such as the future Flushing River emptying into the north shore. The Flushing Meadows site became a glacial lake, and then a salt marsh after the ice melted. Into the 19th Century, the site continued to consist of wetlands straddling Flushing River. Species inhabiting the site included waterfowl and fiddler crab, with fish using water pools for spawning.|$|E
25|$|Then from 25,000 to 10,000 {{years ago}} the lower volume Wisconsin {{glaciation}} carved many of the glacial features seen today. Burned Ridge is made of the <b>terminal</b> <b>moraine</b> (rubble dump) of the largest of these glaciers to affect the area. Today this hummocky feature is covered with trees and other vegetation. Smaller moraines from a less severe part of the Pinedale were formed just below the base of each large valley in the Teton Range by alpine glaciers. Many of these piles of glacial rubble created depressions that in modern times are filled {{with a series of}} small lakes (Leigh, String, Jenny, Bradley, Taggart, and Phelps). Jackson Lake is the largest of these and was impounded by a recessional moraine left by the last major glacier in Jackson Hole. A collection of kettles (depressions left by melted stagnant ice blocks from a retreating glacier) south of the lake is called the Potholes. The basins that hold Two Ocean Lake and Emma Matilda Lake were created during the Bull Lake glaciation. Since then humans have built a dam over Jackson Lake's outlet to increase its size for recreational purposes.|$|E

500|$|When {{the current}} warming period began, the glacier retreated and finally melted completely. It {{left behind a}} bowl shape, deepest {{at the base of}} the {{headwall}} where the glacial ice had been the deepest and most abrasive. [...] The bowl shape extended to its northeast edge, where there was a <b>terminal</b> <b>moraine</b> of smaller rocks and debris which had been deposited by the glacier. When the bowl-shaped crater filled with water, this <b>terminal</b> <b>moraine</b> acted as a natural dam, helping to contain the water in the newly formed cirque lake.|$|E

50|$|Today's Teltow plateau in Brandenburg-Berlin {{was formed}} around 20,000 years ago during the Brandenburg stage of Weichsel glaciation.

However, the line of <b>terminal</b> <b>moraines</b> is very patchy and is traces out an ice front. To the north are ground moraines that have been deposited over a large area. Only south of Ludwigsfelde, does the contiguous ground moraine plateau of the Teltow begin.|$|R
500|$|The lake's origins {{date to the}} Pleistocene Era (more than 10,000 years ago) when {{a glacier}} carved a basin in the {{location}} of the current lake.
