60|$|There was a heap {{of baggage}} near {{the centre of the}} boat, covered with a <b>tarpauling.</b> Mr. George put his valise and the knapsacks under the covering, with the other travellers' effects, and then began to look about for seats. There was a range of wooden benches all along the sides of the deck, but they were very wet, and looked {{extremely}} uncomfortable. The water, however, did not stand upon them, for they were made of open work, on purpose to let the water through.|$|E
60|$|And sure enough, {{the moment}} her bows passed beyond the pier, the sea struck her, and tossed her like an eggshell, and the deck, from stem to stern, was drenched in a moment, and running with floods {{as if she}} had been under water. For a few moments H. and I both enjoyed the motion. We stood amidships, she in her shawl, I in a great <b>tarpauling</b> which I had {{borrowed}} of Jack, and every pitch sent the spray over us. We exulted that we were not going to be sick. Suddenly, however, so suddenly that it was quite mysterious, conscience smote me. A profound, a deep-seated remorse developed itself just exactly in the deepest centre of the pit of my stomach.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the wind}} {{set up a}} howling, And the poodle-dog a yowling, And the cocks began a crowing, And the old cow raised a lowing, As she heard the tempest blowing; And fowls and geese did cackle, And the cordage and the tackle Began to shriek and crackle; And the spray dashed o'er the funnels, And down the deck in runnels; And the rushing water soaks all, From the seamen in the fo'ksal To the stokers, whose black faces Peer out of their bed-places; And the captain he was bawling, And the sailors pulling, hauling; And the quarter-deck <b>tarpauling</b> Was shivered in the squalling; And the {{passengers}} awaken, Most pitifully shaken; And the steward jumps up, and hastens For the necessary basins.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000 KAMEKO {{moved to}} London to {{and signed a}} {{recording}} deal with [...] "SugerReff/BlakKat" [...] on the Sony Music Label, in 2002 he and the label parted ways. With the support and guidance of Universal Music Group president Monte Lipman, KAMEKO released his first studio album in 2003 entitled [...] "Evalt [...] "(Evolutionary Alternative) on his own label <b>Tarpaul</b> Records. KAMEKO's Music document video was featured on MTV2's show [...] "Advance Warning". The album received rave reviews which lead to KAMEKO's 2006 music collaboration with music legend Michael Jackson.|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was deliciously balmy, {{and when the}} felucca drew in with the land, {{the surface of the}} sea was as smooth as that of an inland lake. There was just wind enough to cool the air, and to propel the little vessel three or four knots through the water. The day apartment occupied by our hero and heroine, was on the quarter-deck. It was formed, on the exterior, by a <b>tarpauling,</b> bent like the tilt of a wagon, while the interior was embellished with a lining of precious stuffs that converted it into a beautiful little saloon. In front, a canvas bulkhead protected it from the gaze of the crew; and, toward the stearn a rich curtain fell, when it became necessary to shut out the view. The latter was now carelessly festooned, permitting the eye to range over a broad expanse of the ocean, and to watch the glories of the setting sun.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} bow of a steamer came {{shooting}} into view, down the river. On the forward part of the deck were several soldiers and laborers, with women and children that looked like emigrants, and also a huge pile of trunks and merchandise covered with a <b>tarpauling.</b> Then came the paddle wheels, and then the quarter deck, with a large company of tourists, {{most of whom were}} looking about very eagerly at the scenery, with guide books and glasses in their hands. These were tourists that had been travelling in Switzerland, and were coming home by way of the Rhine; and as they were now just entering the part of the river where the grand and imposing scenery was to be seen,--though Mr. George and Rollo were just leaving it,--they were full of wonder and admiration at the various objects which appeared around them on every side. Rollo had but a very brief opportunity to look at these strangers, for the steamer which conveyed them passed by very swiftly, and in a moment they were gone.|$|E
60|$|The ship lay at {{a single}} anchor, well outside the pier of Leith, so that all we {{passengers}} must come to it by the means of skiffs. This was very little troublesome, {{for the reason that}} the day was a flat calm, very frosty and cloudy, and with a low shifting fog upon the water. The body of the vessel was thus quite hid as I drew near, but the tall spars of her stood high and bright in a sunshine like the flickering of a fire. She proved to be a very roomy, commodious merchant, but somewhat blunt in the bows, and loaden extraordinary deep with salt, salted salmon, and fine white linen stockings for the Dutch. Upon my coming on board, the captain welcomed me, one Sang (out of Lesmahago, I believe), a very hearty, friendly <b>tarpauling</b> of a man, but at the moment in rather of a bustle. There had no other of the passengers yet appeared, so that I was left to walk about upon the deck, viewing the prospect and wondering a good deal what these farewells should be which I was promised.|$|E
6000|$|When a squall, upon a sudden, [...] Came o'er {{the waters}} scudding; [...] And the clouds began to gather, [...] And {{the sea was}} lashed to lather, [...] And the {{lowering}} thunder grumbled, [...] And the lightning jumped and tumbled, [...] And the ship and all the ocean [...] Woke up in wild commotion. [...] Then the wind set up a howling, [...] And the poodle dog a yowling, [...] And the cocks began a crowing, [...] And the old cow raised a lowing, [...] As she heard the tempest blowing; [...] And fowls and geese did cackle, [...] And the cordage and the tackle [...] Began to shriek and crackle; [...] And the spray dashed o'er the funnels, [...] And down the deck in runnels; [...] And the rushing water soaks all, [...] From the seamen in the fo'ksal [...] To the stokers whose black faces [...] Peer out of their bed-places; [...] And the captain, he was bawling, [...] And the sailors pulling, hauling, [...] And the quarter-deck <b>tarpauling</b> [...] Was shivered in the squalling; [...] And the passengers awaken, [...] Most pitifully shaken; [...] And the steward jumps up and hastens [...] For the necessary basins.|$|E
60|$|How {{like a dream}} it was, when I {{bent over}} a pool of water, one {{pleasant}} morning, {{and saw that the}} ocean had dashed its spray over me and made me a fisherman! There were the <b>tarpauling,</b> the baize shirt, the oil-cloth trousers and seven-league boots, and there my own features, but so reddened with sunburn and sea-breezes, that methought I had another face, and on other shoulders too. The sea-gulls and the loons, and I, had now all one trade; we skimmed the crested waves and sought our prey beneath them, the man with as keen enjoyment as the birds. Always, when the east grew purple, I launched my dory, my little flat-bottomed skiff, and rowed cross-handed to Point Ledge, the Middle Ledge, or, perhaps, beyond Egg Rock; often, too, did I anchor off Dread Ledge, a spot of peril to ships unpiloted; and sometimes spread an adventurous sail and tracked across the bay to South Shore, casting my lines in sight of Scituate. Ere nightfall, I hauled my skiff high and dry on the beach, laden with red rock-cod, or the white-bellied ones of deep water; haddock, bearing the black marks of St. Peter's fingers near the gills; the longbearded hake, whose liver holds oil enough for a midnight lamp; and now and then a mighty halibut, with a back broad as my boat. In the autumn, I trolled and caught those lovely fish, the mackerel. When the wind was high,--when the whale-boats, anchored off the Point, nodded their slender masts at each other, and the dories pitched and tossed in the surf,--when Nahant Beach was thundering three miles off, and the spray broke a hundred feet in air, round the distant base of Egg Rock,--when the brimful and boisterous sea threatened to tumble over the street of our village,--then I made a holiday on shore.|$|E
60|$|And at last, {{without any}} undue haste or unseemliness, the day dawned, the great day, when Banghurst had promised his public--the world in fact--that flying should be finally {{attained}} and overcome. Filmer saw it dawn, watched {{even in the}} darkness before it dawned, watched its stars fade and the grey and pearly pinks give place at last to the clear blue sky of a sunny, cloudless day. He watched it {{from the window of}} his bedroom in the new-built wing of Banghurst's Tudor house. And as the stars were overwhelmed and the shapes and substances of things grew into being out of the amorphous dark, he must have seen more and more distinctly the festive preparations beyond the beech clumps near the green pavilion in the outer park, the three stands for the privileged spectators, the raw, new fencing of the enclosure, the sheds and workshops, the Venetian masts and fluttering flags that Banghurst had considered essential, black and limp in the breezeless dawn, and amidst all these things a great shape covered with <b>tarpauling.</b> A strange and terrible portent for humanity was that shape, a beginning that must surely spread and widen and change and dominate all the affairs of men, but to Filmer it is very doubtful whether it appeared in anything but a narrow and personal light. Several people heard him pacing in the small hours--for the vast place was packed with guests by a proprietor editor who, before all understood compression. And about five o'clock, if not before, Filmer left his room and wandered out of the sleeping house into the park, alive by that time with sunlight and birds and squirrels and the fallow deer. MacAndrew, who was also an early riser, met him near the machine, and they went and had a look at it together.|$|E
