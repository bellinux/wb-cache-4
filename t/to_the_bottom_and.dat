5|$|The shape I {{have adopted}} {{is that of}} an ellipse, formed by bisecting, on each side, the {{horizontal}} ordinates of a circle of 32 feet diameter, down to its center, below which the sides are to be made vertical, if no arch is necessary lower down; otherwise, the ellipse is to continue down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> to be shaped all round with bricks, stones, or iron, as may appear most eligible. This shape leaves ample room for the cars, and, by contracting the roof, is more secure than a semicircle of 16 feet diameter.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to larvae that have portable cases, {{members of the}} Annulipalpia have a completely different feeding strategy. They make fixed retreats in which they remain stationary, waiting for food to come to them. Members of the Psychomyiidae, Ecnomidae and Xiphocentronidae families construct simple tubes of sand and other particles held together by silk and anchored <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>and</b> feed on the accumulations of silt formed when suspended material is deposited. The tube can be lengthened when the growing larva needs to feed in new areas. More complex tubes, short and flattened, are built by Polycentropodidae larvae in hollows in rocks or other submerged objecte, sometimes with strands of silk suspended across the nearby surface. These larvae are carnivorous, resembling spiders in their feeding habits and rushing out of their retreat to attack any unwary small prey crawling across the surface.|$|E
5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E

5|$|The larvae of inarticulates swim as {{plankton}} {{for months}} and are like miniature adults, with valves, mantle lobes, a pedicle that coils in the mantle cavity, and a small lophophore, which is used for both feeding and swimming—except that Craniids have no pedicle. As the shell becomes heavier, the juvenile sinks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> becomes a sessile adult. The larvae of articulate species live only on yolk, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days. This type of larva has a ciliated frontmost lobe that becomes the body and lophophore, a rear lobe that becomes the pedicle, and a mantle like a skirt, with the hem towards the rear. On metamorphosing into an adult, the pedicle attaches to a surface, the front lobe develops the lophophore and other organs, and the mantle rolls up over the front lobe and starts to secrete the shell. In cold seas, brachiopod growth is seasonal and the animals often lose weight in winter. These variations in growth often form growth lines in the shells. Members of some genera have survived for a year in aquaria without food.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process {{them in the same}} way as the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{anthropogenic}} artifacts {{placed in}} the oceans are harmful. Iron and concrete structures typically do little damage to the environment because they generally sink <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> become immobile, and at shallow depths they can even provide scaffolding for artificial reefs. Ships and subway cars have been deliberately sunk for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|Several {{months are}} needed for the larva to {{complete}} its development, which begins {{with the formation of}} the test plates around the mouth and anus. Soon, the larva sinks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> metamorphoses into adult form in as quickly as one hour. In some species, adults reach their maximum size in about five years.|$|E
25|$|The ammonites {{that form}} ammolite {{inhabited}} a prehistoric, inland subtropical sea that bordered the Rocky Mountains—this area is {{known today as}} the Cretaceous or Western Interior Seaway. As the ammonites died, they sank <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> were buried by layers of bentonitic mud that eventually became shale. Many gem-quality ammonites are found within siderite concretions. These sediments preserved the aragonite of the shells, preventing it from converting to calcite.|$|E

25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} are flammable or highly flammable, {{depending on}} their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane and chloroform. Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can explode. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will sink <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent vapors {{can also be found}} in supposedly empty drums and cans, posing a flash fire hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.|$|E
25|$|The {{additives}} {{may include}} anticoagulants (EDTA, sodium citrate, heparin) or a gel with density between those of blood cells and blood plasma. Additionally, some tubes contain additives that preserve certain components of or substances within the blood, such as glucose. When a tube is centrifuged, the materials within {{are separated by}} density, with the blood cells sinking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> the plasma or serum accumulating at the top. Tubes containing gel can be easily handled and transported after centrifugation without the blood cells and serum mixing.|$|E
25|$|Although they {{frequently}} live in dryland forests, tapirs {{with access to}} rivers spend {{a good deal of}} time in and underwater, feeding on soft vegetation, taking refuge from predators, and cooling off during hot periods. Tapirs near a water source will swim, sink <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>and</b> walk along the riverbed to feed, and have been known to submerge themselves under water to allow small fish to pick parasites off their bulky bodies. Along with freshwater lounging, tapirs often wallow in mud pits, which also help to keep them cool and free of insects.|$|E

25|$|Man Ray {{abandoned}} conventional {{painting to}} involve himself with Dada, a radical anti-art movement. He started making objects and developed unique mechanical and photographic methods of making images. For the 1918 version of Rope Dancer, he combined a spray-gun technique {{with a pen}} drawing. Like Duchamp, he did readymades—ordinary objects that are selected and modified. His Gift readymade (1921) is a flatiron with metal tacks attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>and</b> Enigma of Isidore Ducasse is an unseen object (a sewing machine) wrapped in cloth and tied with cord. Aerograph (1919), another work from this period, was done with airbrush on glass.|$|E
25|$|How {{by means}} of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not {{describe}} my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction {{at the bottom of the}} sea, by sending ships <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>and</b> sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.|$|E
500|$|Many species {{breed in}} moving water, {{where there is}} a {{tendency}} for the eggs and nymphs to get washed downstream. To counteract this, females may fly upriver before depositing their eggs.

These sink <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> hatch after 45 days, the nymphs burrowing their way into the sediment where they spend two or three years before hatching into subimagos.|$|E
