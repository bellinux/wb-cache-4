5|$|David Mirkin (born September 18, 1955) is an American {{feature film}} and {{television}} director, writer and producer. Mirkin grew up in Philadelphia and intended to become an electrical engineer, but abandoned this career path in favor of studying film at Loyola Marymount University. After graduating, he became a stand-up comedian, and then moved into television writing. He wrote for the sitcoms Three's Company, It's Garry Shandling's Show and <b>The</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>Sanders</b> <b>Show</b> and served as showrunner on the series Newhart. After an unsuccessful attempt to remake the British series The Young Ones, Mirkin created Get a Life in 1990. The series starred comedian Chris Elliott and ran for two seasons, {{despite a lack of}} support from many Fox network executives, who disliked the show's dark and surreal humor. He moved on to create the sketch show The Edge starring his then-partner, actress Julie Brown.|$|E

Black has appeared in several television shows, including Wings and <b>The</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>Sanders</b> <b>Show.</b> He has since starred in the 1998 television film, Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack, based on the rodeo star Jack Favor, who was falsely accused of double murders in Haughton, Louisiana in 1967.
