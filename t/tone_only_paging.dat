50|$|The {{physical}} layer is adaptive. The silence and the preamble allow the receiver's signal processing {{to measure the}} channel's noise ratios. Depending on the signal to noise ratios, the bits can be recovered from {{the difference between the}} power of the mark and space tones, the power of the mark <b>tones</b> <b>only,</b> or the space <b>tones</b> <b>only.</b> The system should be able to adjust the receiving method on each 42-byte packet.|$|R

5000|$|In Dâw {{there are}} either {{three or four}} tones, {{depending}} on analysis. There are a low tone, a high tone, a rising tone and a falling tone, marked by a grave accent, an acute accent, a caron and circumflex, respectively, but only the two latter are lexical. The low <b>tone</b> <b>only</b> occurs on syllables without stress, while the high <b>tone</b> <b>only</b> occurs on syllables with stress, and the rising and falling tones may occur on all syllables. As the low and high tones are not lexical, they are often left unmarked, as in [...] "tooth", which really is realized as [...]|$|R
50|$|In addition, some collars have {{multiple}} settings, allowing owners {{to have a}} collar emit a <b>tone</b> <b>only,</b> or one of several levels of static shock, with higher levels used to contain bigger, stronger dogs.|$|R

50|$|Kalenjin is {{a marked}} {{nominative}} language: nominative {{case is the}} only case that is marked in the language, while all other cases (accusative, genitive, dative etc.) are left unmarked. Nominative case is marked through <b>tone</b> <b>only.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Rhyme is mandatory. Rhyme, or rime, {{is based}} on a {{sometimes}} somewhat technical rhyme scheme. The rhyme of a poem can be difficult to determine, especially for older poems as pronounced in modern versions of Chinese; however, even as early as the Tang Dynasty, formal rhyme might be based upon authoritative references in a rime table or rime dictionary, rather than on actual vernacular speech. Generally level <b>tones</b> <b>only</b> rhyme with level tones, and non-level (or [...] "deflected") <b>tones</b> <b>only</b> formally rhyme with other non-level tones. Also, the first line of the poem may also set the rhyme, more often in the seven-character form than the five-character.|$|R
50|$|The {{conditioning}} {{factors which}} led to the yin - yang split still exist in Shanghainese, as they do in other Wu dialects: yang <b>tones</b> are <b>only</b> found with voiced initials , while the yin <b>tones</b> are <b>only</b> found with voiceless initials.|$|R
50|$|The extra {{keys are}} added {{primarily}} for increased resonance from the associated strings; that is, they vibrate sympathetically with other strings whenever the damper pedal is depressed and thus give a fuller <b>tone.</b> <b>Only</b> {{a very small}} number of works composed for piano actually use these notes.|$|R
5000|$|Tone {{is written}} {{as in the}} IPA, with the {{addition}} or a vertical mark for mid-low tone: [...] etc. Where rising and falling <b>tones</b> <b>only</b> occur on long vowels, they are decomposed: [...] etc. The high tone mark is used for contrastive stress in languages {{that do not have}} tone.|$|R
50|$|Other dialects of Vietnamese {{have fewer}} <b>tones</b> (typically <b>only</b> five).|$|R

An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.' ...|$|R
50|$|For {{the lowest}} <b>tones,</b> <b>only</b> the thyroarytenoid muscles are active, {{but as the}} pitch rises, the cricothyroids enter the action, which begins to {{lengthen}} the folds. As longitudinal tension increases, the glottis tends to develop {{a gap in the}} middle. To counteract the tendency, the lateral cricoarytenoids are brought into action, pulling forward on the muscular process of the arytenoids. The process is sometimes referred to as medial compression.|$|R
50|$|In {{sentences}} involving focused words and/or phrases, {{the rising}} <b>tones</b> <b>only</b> last until the focused word; all following words carry a low tone. This intonation pattern extends to wh-questions, as wh-words are normally {{considered to be}} focused. In yes-no questions, the rising tones may be more exaggerated, and most importantly, the final syllable of the final word in the sentence takes a high falling tone instead of a flat low tone.|$|R
5000|$|Accentuation lost distinctions of {{high and}} high-low <b>tones,</b> leaving <b>only</b> a high <b>tone</b> for a [...] "stress" [...] accent.|$|R
50|$|The {{high and}} rising <b>tones</b> occur <b>only</b> in monosyllabic, monomorphemic lexemes. Multisyllabic morphemes are {{stressed}} {{on the first}} syllable.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} level tones in Abou Dida: [...] , [...] , and [...] , with [...] {{about twice as}} common as the other two. Speaker intuition hears six contour tones: rising [...] and falling [...] (The falling <b>tones</b> <b>only</b> reach [...] {{register}} {{at the end of}} a prosodic unit; otherwise the low falling tone [...] is realized as a simple low tone.) However, some of these only occur in morphologically complex words, such as perfective verbs.|$|R

50|$|Within polysyllabic words (of {{two or more}} syllables) or {{characters}} {{within one}} sense unit, if in the departing tone (both light departing and dark departing) or in the dark entering tone, {{and if it is}} not the last character in the unit, the rime undergoes a transformation. This rime change is related to the open/close rime phenomenon: as these three <b>tones</b> <b>only</b> have open rimes, when the character changes tone through tone sandhi, the open rimes will become the corresponding close rimes.|$|R
