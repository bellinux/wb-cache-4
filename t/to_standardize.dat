5|$|A merging draft, BioCode, was {{published}} in 1997 in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>standardize</b> nomenclature in these three areas, but {{has yet to be}} formally adopted. The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed. A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, would provide a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011. However, the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal. The ICVCN remains outside the BioCode, which does not include viral classification.|$|E
5|$|During 1895, Robert S. Hatcher, {{the reading}} clerk of the Indiana Senate, was {{directed}} to ascertain {{the legal status of}} the design of the state seal.

He recommended that a bill be passed <b>to</b> <b>standardize</b> the seal. Senator McCord submitted legislation for that purpose, but no action was taken on it.|$|E

The book refers to early Kannada prose and poetry writers such as Durvinita, perhaps the 6th-century monarch of Western Ganga Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The current {{design of}} the seal was {{standardized}} by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963. During {{the meeting of the}} General Assembly, Representative Taylor I. Morris introduced legislation <b>to</b> <b>standardize</b> the design of the state seal. His bill described a seal that depicts a woodsman chopping a sycamore tree, while an American Bison runs in the foreground and the sun rises in the background. The leaves of the state tree, the tulip, were to be the border design. The bill passed the assembly that session and became law.|$|E

5|$|These guns fired 100lb (45.4kg) shells {{at a rate}} {{of between}} 57 per minute. The shells were fired with a muzzle {{velocity}} of 2,775fps (846mps), though the guns were capable of higher velocities. It was reduced in order <b>to</b> <b>standardize</b> the performance of all the 6inch guns in Royal Navy service, which would simplify range calculations for guns of the calibre. The guns could elevate to 20°, which enabled a maximum range of 15,800yd (14,450m).|$|E

5|$|Amtrak assumed {{control of}} almost all private sector {{intercity}} passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. It retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric and diesel) and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s. These cars were aging, in need of maintenance, {{and in many cases}} incompatible with each other. The company recognized the need and opportunity <b>to</b> <b>standardize</b> on a single design.|$|E

5|$|More recently, Japanese {{publications}} {{have emerged}} in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>standardize</b> taiko performance. The Nippon Taiko Foundation was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good relations among taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko. Daihachi Oguchi, {{the leader of the}} Foundation, wrote Japan Taiko with other teachers in 1994 out of concern that correct form in performance would degrade over time. The instructional publication described the different drums used in kumi-daiko performance, methods of gripping, correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi's group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation's scope.|$|E

The Guild and the staff of the Blade brought a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board and deliberated for a few weeks over this issue resulting in a ten to eight vote against unionization on July 20, 2001.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 1876, {{representatives from}} Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia {{met at the}} Massasoit House in Springfield, Massachusetts <b>to</b> <b>standardize</b> a new code of rules based on the rugby game first {{introduced}} to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. The rules were based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring (a change that would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, {{as a result of}} the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, because of an early disagreement about the number of players per team.|$|E
