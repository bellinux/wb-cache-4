5|$|According to the {{architectural}} historian John Harvey, the octagonal chapter house, built about 1332 by William Ramsey, was the earliest example of Perpendicular Gothic. This {{is confirmed by}} Alec Clifton-Taylor, who notes that <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> house and St Stephen's chapel at Westminster Abbey predate the early Perpendicular work at Gloucester Cathedral by several years. The foundations of <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> house were recently made visible in the redeveloped south churchyard of the new cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Carvings in the Decorated Gothic style may {{be found}} in the eastern end of the buildings, where there are many carved bosses. In <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> house, the carvings of the fifty-one stalls include {{numerous}} small heads of great variety, many of them smiling or laughing. A well-known figure is the corbel of the dragon-slaying monk in <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> house stair. The large continuous capital that encircles the central pillar of <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> house is markedly different in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and is clearly identifiable as grapevine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, {{the text of}} the Libellus was used to support the claims of the monks of the Canterbury Cathedral chapter that <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> had always {{included}} monks, back to the founding of the cathedral by Augustine. But the Libellus does not explicitly say that the cathedral chapter should be composed of monks, only that the monks that were members of <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> should live in common and have some other aspects of monastic life.|$|E

5|$|The dignitaries and canons {{constituted}} <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> and had {{the primary}} role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters.

5|$|American {{publisher}} William Randolph Hearst bought {{parts of}} the monastery in 1931 {{with the intention of}} using its stones in the construction of a grand and fanciful castle at Wyntoon, California, but after some 10,000 stones were removed and shipped, they were abandoned in San Francisco for decades.

5|$|As a {{guide to}} the {{contents}} of each chapter, musical notations were added before <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> number. In School Rumble, chapters marked with a sharp sign(♯) concern the main plot development focusing around Tenma and Harima, while side stories dealing with supporting characters are indicated by a flat sign(♭). The one exception to this pattern in the first series is <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> that appears in Shōnen Magazine Wonder, which uses the natural sign(♮). School Rumble Z uses the natural sign for every chapter. The manga volumes of School Rumble contain original bonus chapters that use no musical notation; these are normally one page in length, but the seventh volume spreads its bonus chapter over several pages with each page telling a self-contained story.|$|E

5|$|On December 1, 2011, {{following}} the death of Florida A University drum major Robert Champion, the Delta Iota chapter was placed on investigative hold pending an investigation by the national fraternity. In January 2012, the Tallahassee Democrat reported alleged hazing by the FAMU chapter in spring 2010. According to the allegations, two members of the FAMU band faculty were involved in a hazing incident at a professor's home in which prospective members were struck on the back and neck and forced to recite information. The fraternity's investigation was postponed at the request of FAMU due to the ongoing police investigation. The investigations cleared Delta Iota of any connection to Champion's death; Champion was not a member or prospective member of the fraternity. After the conclusion of both the police and fraternity investigations, the national council closed down <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> because of its violations of fraternity policy and the uncertainty of the future of the FAMU band program. As part of the chapter's termination, 28 members, including all active and prospective members in spring 2010, were expelled from the fraternity.
