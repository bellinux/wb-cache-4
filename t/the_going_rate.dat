Dyer got another couple of chances and showed some form, but by mid-season found himself in the seconds team, with players who were not quite league standard, but wanted to stay on at the club and earn an extra few shillings per week to support their families.|$|E

In the summer of 1962, Saskatchewan became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's physicians, who brought things to a halt with the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors' strike. The doctors believed their best interests were not being met and feared a significant loss of income as well as government interference in medical care decisions even though Douglas agreed that his government would pay <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>rate</b> for service that doctors charged.

The investigation utilized records and documents to ascertain the evolution of community college curricula in three categories [...] baccalaureate, vocational-technical, and general studies [...] in Illinois from 1965 through 1980. The study population was composed of 36 locally-controlled districts divided into three groups, according to each district's institutional origins at the time Class I recognition was granted by the state. The three institutional classifications used in the study were the "pre- 1959 " colleges which had been under the control of a common school board; the " 1959 " colleges which had existed as separate districts under the provisions of legislation enacted that year; and "post- 1965 " colleges which had no historical antecedents prior to the formation as college districts until the enactment of the 1965 legislation. Each of the following district variables were subjected to several statistical treatments: population, headcount, the percentage of population enrolled in credit-bearing programs or "going rate," equalized assessed valuation, the number of baccalaureate, vocational-technical, and general studies degree and certificate programs. The findings indicated that the average community college in the 1959 origin group was numerically greatest in the variables of district population, student headcount, equalized assessed valuation, <b>going</b> <b>rate,</b> and <b>the</b> breadth of offerings in the baccalaureate, vocational-technical degree and certificate program areas. Pearson r correlations of the three major program areas, <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>rates,</b> and <b>the</b> equalized assessed valuations for each member district of each origin group demonstrated significant relationships at the p <. 05 level. The greatest number of significant relationships was between vocational-technical degree programs and <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>rates.</b> <b>The</b> second greatest number of significant relationships was between vocational-technical degree programs and the equalized assessed valuations. Vocational-technical certificate programs had fewer statistically significant relationships than vocational-technical degree programs, but more than baccalaureate programs when correlated with <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>rates</b> and equalized assessed valuations...|$|R

The Athletics made the playoffs for four straight years, from 2000 to 2003, but lost their first round (best three-out-of-five) series in each case, 3 games to 2. In two of those years (2001 against the Yankees and 2003 against the Red Sox), the Athletics won the first two games of the series, only to lose the next three straight. In 2001, Oakland became the first team to lose a best-of-five series after winning both of the first two games on the road.

500|$|In 1850, New York Senator Daniel S.

[...] He proposed {{to offer it}} {{in exchange for the}} Spanish silver, which would be valued at eight reals to the dollar for the purpose, higher than <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>rate.</b> [...] The new coin would weigh three-tenths as much as the dime, but the debasement of the silver would compensate the government for the losses it would take in redeeming the underweight, worn Spanish coins. The three-cent denomination was chosen as it coordinated well with the six and twelve cent values often assigned the fip and levy. The House of Representatives instead considered legislation to reduce the valuation of the Spanish coins to ten cents per real, and to strike a twenty-cent piece, of [...]900 silver, to facilitate the exchange. [...] Neil Carothers, in his book on small-denomination American money, suggests that the House's plan would have resulted in the Spanish coins staying in circulation, and any twenty-cent pieces issued being hoarded or melted. No legislation passed in 1850, which saw continued export of America's silver coinage.|$|E
