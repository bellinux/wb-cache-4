[...] In 1918, he wrote the following in the dedication to his book, The Meaning of Architecture:"This book is dedicated <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> -- my lifelong companion and partner Allen Bartlit Pond. [...] Through his sympathy and understanding, {{in the light of}} his clear thought, and under his inspiration I have been better able to follow those paths of individual, professional and civic endeavor in which a rare ancestry bade us walk." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first four}} {{numbers of the}} Journal {{featured}} Fielding's contributions to the [...] "Paper War", a conflict he instigated with writers of other contemporary periodicals to generate sales. In the first number, along with the promise to avoid the dullness of other periodicals, Fielding confronted [...] "the armies of Grub Street" [...] and proclaimed his disdain for the literary critics of the day: [...] "As <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> authors, who, like mere mechanics, are envious and jealous of a rival in their trade, to silence their jealousies and fears, I declare {{that it is not}} my intention to encroach on the business now carried on by them, nor to deal in any of those wares which they at present vend to the public." [...] Also given in the inaugural number was [...] "An introduction to a journal of the present paper-war between the forces under Sir Alexander Drawcansir, and the army of Grub Street", written in the tradition of Jonathan Swift's Battle of the Books.|$|E
2500|$|He {{acknowledged}} a [...] "failure in the 1970s to {{act more}} assertively with regard <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> his victims, and the church," [...] but also reassured {{people that the}} church had since established reporting and disciplinary procedures so that, [...] "What happened 30 years ago would not happen today." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Introduce {{me in the}} {{customary}} form," [...] Mrs. Gallilee proceeded; [...] "and then refer the lawyers <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother's</b> Will. Is it done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{answered}} at last. [...] "It {{is not likely}} that I should do that. Baron Domiloff, I will show you the way <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother's</b> room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{surprised}} {{you to hear}} me called by that name. It was my father's name, and I have now taken it in obedience <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother's</b> wish." ...|$|R
2500|$|Maryam Nawaz tweeted {{denial of}} wrongdoing, {{adding that she}} did not own [...] "any company/property abroad", except as a trustee in a brother's corporation, [...] "which only entitles me to {{distribute}} assets <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> Hussain's family/children if needed". The leaked documents name her the sole beneficial owner of Nescoll, created in 1993, and Nielson, first registered in 1994. The two companies subscribed to Mossack Fonseca services in July 2006. The Panama Papers name Maryam as the joint owner with her brother Hussain of Coomber Group. Mossack Fonseca was managing Nescoll, Nielsen Holdings, and Coomber Group when the three companies obtained a £7million mortgage from the Swiss bank, Deutsche Bank (Suisse) SA and purchased four flats in Avenfield House, at 118 Park Lane in London.|$|E
2500|$|Charles {{made his}} debut for Wales {{in a game}} against Northern Ireland at Windsor Park on 20 April 1955; the Welsh won 3–2 thanks to a John Charles hat-trick. His second cap came against Austria on 23 November, in a game latter dubbed the 'Battle of Wrexham'. He was stretchered off with fifteen minutes to go after an Austrian boot went through the back of his leg; this was notable as the only time John ever lost his temper, as he reacted to the {{challenge}} by lifting the Austrian off the ground and screaming [...] "If you ever do that <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> again I'll bloody kill you!" [...] Charles was then selected for the 1957 British Home Championship squad, and helped his country to record a 2–2 draw with Scotland at Ninian Park. He also battled against injury to play in the 3–1 defeat to England at Wembley Stadium, before the tournament ended with a goalless draw in Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} courts-martial began on 2 May, in which 187 people were tried, {{most of them}} at Richmond Barracks. The {{president}} of the courts-martial was Charles Blackader. Controversially, Maxwell decided that the courts-martial would be held in secret and without a defence, which Crown law officers later ruled to have been illegal. Some of those who conducted the trials had commanded British troops involved in suppressing the Rising, {{a conflict of interest}} that the Military Manual prohibited. Only one of those tried by courts-martial was a woman, Constance Markievicz. Ninety were sentenced to death. Fifteen of those (including all seven signatories of the Proclamation) had their sentences confirmed by Maxwell and were executed by firing squad at Kilmainham Gaol between 3 and 12 May. Among them was the seriously wounded Connolly, who was shot while tied to a chair because of his shattered ankle. Maxwell stated that only the [...] "ringleaders" [...] and those proven to have committed [...] "coldblooded murder" [...] would be executed. However, the evidence presented was weak, and some of those executed were not leaders and did not kill anyone: Willie Pearse described himself as [...] "a personal attaché <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> Patrick Pearse"; John MacBride had not even been aware of the Rising until it began, but had fought against the British in the Boer War fifteen years before; Thomas Kent did not come out at all—he was executed for the killing of a police officer during the raid on his house the week after the Rising. The most prominent leader to escape execution was Éamon de Valera, Commandant of the 3rd Battalion, who did so partly because of his American birth.|$|E

60|$|I {{had some}} little obligations, indeed, upon me <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother's</b> house, {{which was in}} Coleman Street Parish, and which he had left <b>to</b> <b>my</b> care; and I went at first every day, but {{afterwards}} {{only once or twice}} a week.|$|R
