5|$|In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a {{design for a}} production reactor with water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{new regime}} {{was soon to}} {{discover}} that changes don't easily come about by legislative fiat. The part of the constitution that worked adequately was the experiment with indirect democracy. During {{the period in which}} the constitution was in force, the system of primary assemblies that elected delegates who voted for the respective organs of government worked efficiently, and kept the voters engaged. However, exactly because the Republic was a genuine democracy, other goals of the regime were less easy to attain. The elections often put people into office that were very much opposed to the unitary state <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> enshrined in the constitution, and to other innovations that it entailed, or in any case were of a conservative inclination.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the California Transportation Commission (CTC) {{approved}} shifting SR 111 {{onto the}} new SR 86 expressway {{after it was}} completed, using SR 195 to make the connection. When the SR 86 expressway was fully constructed, SR 195 was {{to be removed from}} the state highway system according to state law; that expressway was finished in 2001. However, this removed the connection from the highway portion of SR 111 to the new expressway carrying both SR 111 and SR 86 north from the state highway system. Caltrans officially deleted most of SR 195 in 2009, leaving a gap in SR 111 following deletions of the old routing <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> bypassed by the expressway. In December 2014, with Riverside County and Caltrans both supporting, the CTC transferred the remaining portion of SR 195, from the new SR 86 expressway to SR 111, to become part of SR 111. SR 195 still appears in Caltrans documents dated from 2014.|$|E

50|$|Highway 947 {{was first}} {{designated}} {{in the early}} 1970s, but in a different alignment. At that time, the highway began at Highway 16 within Edson. It traveled northeast using the general alignment <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> designated Highway 748, and then north to Swan Hills via Whitecourt using the general alignment <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> designated Highway 32. From Swan Hills, it continued north to Highway 2 using the general alignment <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> designated Highway 33.|$|R

5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to operate out of Genoa, intercepting and inspecting merchantmen and cutting-out suspicious vessels in both enemy and neutral harbours. Nelson formulated ambitious plans for amphibious landings and naval assaults to frustrate {{the progress of}} the French Army of Italy <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> advancing on Genoa, but could excite little interest in Hotham. In November Hotham was replaced by Sir Hyde Parker but the situation in Italy was rapidly deteriorating: the French were raiding around Genoa and strong Jacobin sentiment was rife within the city itself. A large French assault at the end of November broke the allied lines, forcing a general retreat towards Genoa. Nelson's forces were able to cover the withdrawing army and prevent them from being surrounded, but he had too few ships and men to materially alter the strategic situation, and the British were forced to withdraw from the Italian ports. Nelson {{returned to}} Corsica on 30 November, angry and depressed at the British failure and questioning his future in the navy.|$|E
5|$|Two {{documents}} survive of the barons' complaints. In {{the first}} of these, the barons reiterated {{the background of the}} conflict, and stressed the fact that the king himself had accepted the conditions of the provisions. Henry had in fact, in an effort to gain public support, pledged to uphold the provisions, a fact <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> made the most of. The document further goes on to explain the reform instituted by the baronial council. In order to restore law and peacekeeping to the country, the council had installed a new Chief Justiciar and Chancellor. They had also appointed new sheriffs in the counties, who were to be directly accountable to the government and be replaced annually. The king had violated these conditions, it was argued, when he had appointed his own chancellor and a number of sheriffs. He had also taken over custody of Winchester Castle, which had been given over to Montfort by the provisions. Furthermore, there were accusation made against individual royal adherents, such as Roger Mortimer for his military raids in the Welsh Marches. The second document goes into more detail on the king's alleged transgressions. By extortionate taxation, it was claimed, Henry had impoverished the land. He had also infringed the liberties of the Church, violated Magna Carta, and corrupted justice.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} years Brann entered a recession. Brann {{had to wait}} until 1947 before again qualifying for the top league <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> called Norgesligaen (Norwegian league). In 1950 Brann once again managed to qualify for the cup final, losing 0–3 to Fredrikstad.|$|E

25|$|The Patriots {{were heavily}} favored {{to go to}} Super Bowl XLV, but faced a Jets team <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> {{prepared}} for their revamped post-Randy Moss trade offense. New York's pass defense effectively shut the Patriots down, as Brady found it all-but impossible to make throws. The Jets won 28–21, sending New England to a second straight home playoff exit.|$|E
25|$|On September 7 Stalin {{once again}} {{outlined}} {{a new line}} for the Comintern <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> {{based on the idea}} that the war was an inter-imperialist conflict and hence there was no reason for the working class to side with Britain, France, or Poland against Germany, thus departing from the Comintern's anti-fascist popular front policy of 1934–1939. He labeled Poland as a fascist state oppressing Belarusians and Ukrainians.|$|E

25|$|Mannock took {{command of}} No. 85 Squadron RAF on 5 July 1918. The {{morale of the}} unit was {{different}} to that of 74 Squadron. The former commanding officer, Billy Bishop, did not develop into a patrol leader not had he encouraged that method of command <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> expected. The squadron boasted several fighter aces: Alec Cunningham-Reid, Spencer B. Horn, Malcolm C. McGregor and Walter H. Longton. Mannock had a cadre of experienced pilots to build his leadership around.|$|E
25|$|Although wind speeds were extreme, {{the major}} cause of damage and loss of life {{appears to have been}} storm surge. The major focus of devastation appears to have been on the east coast of Samar and Leyte, with a {{particular}} focus on Tacloban, because of its location between Samar and Leyte, and the large population in low lying areas. Philippine Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Mar Roxas said the scale of the relief operation <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> required was overwhelming, with some places described as a wasteland of mud and debris.|$|E
25|$|The Americans {{began the}} war with {{significant}} disadvantages compared to the British. They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> shut down by the British blockade and the Americans {{had to rely on}} slow overland travel.|$|E

25|$|Four {{months after}} the library was demolished, Jill Nerheny, the Birkenhead-Northcote Community Coordinator, claimed there was a groundswell of support for leaving the land as green space. Residents Clyde Scott and Peter White became adamant the {{community}} {{would be better served}} with a park on the reserve site and the library located elsewhere in Highbury. Others lobbied for the fence ringing the library site to be taken down, and eventually the Birkenhead-Northcote Community Board had it pushed back to the perimeter. Two new park benches were installed on the reserve {{to take advantage of the}} expanse <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> available (pictured).|$|E
25|$|Charles was {{initially}} {{treated as a}} hero on his return to Paris but {{after several years of}} war, the French were short of money and eager to bring it to a conclusion; following the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the Stuarts were once more banished from France. Charles secretly visited London in 1750 and continued attempts to reignite his cause but the heavy drinking <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> a feature of his life made him argumentative and hard to work with. In 1759, the French Chief Minister, de Choiseul met with Charles to discuss Jacobite participation in another ambitious invasion attempt but dismissed him as incapable through drink. Charles never visited Britain again and in January 1788, died in Rome, a disappointed and embittered man.|$|E
25|$|Forced {{to reduce}} their {{activities}} in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the Genoese had turned to North African trade of wheat, olive oil (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant deficit in silver and gold, as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> cut off. Several European mines were exhausted, the lack of bullion leading {{to the development of}} a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, Banco di San Giorgio, was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of Bruges (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal, who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.|$|E

25|$|Vikings {{returned}} to Galicia in 859, {{during the reign}} of Ordoño I of Asturias. It was a contingent of a hundred ships from looting expeditions by the French coast <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> directed toward the Arousa estuary. After looting Iria Flavia they continued to Santiago de Compostela, where they laid siege. Their neighbours had paid tribute to avoid looting, but in spite of this, the Vikings tried to enter the city. They were faced with an army led by Don Pedro who dispersed them and destroyed thirty eight of their ships; after which the surviving Vikings went south. As a result of this expedition the episcopal see of Iria relocated to Santiago de Compostela. In 861, a group of Vikings ransomed García Íñiguez, king of Pamplona, whom they had captured the previous year, for 60,000 gold pieces.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1918 strike, Sir Edward Henry, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police resigned and was replaced by a serving soldier, General Sir Nevil Macready. Macready immediately began reorganising the command structure of the police. As far as Macready was concerned the days of the NUPPO were numbered. He had the comforting knowledge that, given the circumstances in which his appointment was made, he was to have carte blanche in his dealings with the NUPPO and its officials. Macready did nothing to encourage talks with the union. He refused to recognise both James Marston, the president of NUPPO, and Jack Hayes, the general secretary. As far as Macready was concerned the police had had a grievance <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> settled, and NUPPO remained an unofficial body therefore they were not to be dealt with.|$|E
25|$|Atholl {{was ordered}} 2 January 1942 {{as part of}} the 1942-43 {{modified}} Flower-class building programme. This programme was known as the Increased Endurance (IE). Many changes were made, all from lessons that had been learned in previous versions of the Flower-class. The bridge was made a full deck higher and built to naval standards instead of the more civilian-like bridges of previous versions. The platform for the 4-inch main gun was raised to minimize the amount of spray over it and to provide a better field of fire. It was also connected to the wheelhouse by a wide platform <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> the base for the Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar that this version was armed with. Along with the new Hedgehog, this version got the new QF 4-inch Mk XIX main gun, which was semi-automatic, used fixed ammunition and had the ability to elevate higher giving it an anti-aircraft ability.|$|E
