5|$|On February 5, 2009, TNT {{announced}} {{the addition of}} H–O–R–S–E to its All-Star Weekend coverage. The competition was held outdoors on a half-sized court during the special Inside the NBA show prior to the All-Star Saturday Night events. The objective of this competition is to accrue as few of the five letters as possible. A player is given a letter every time they fail <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> the shot of another player. Each player was given 24 seconds to make or duplicate the shot (dunking was prohibited). Each player who fails <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> five shots was eliminated from the competition. An NBA referee was assigned to rule whether the shot was done properly.|$|E

50|$|The {{direct effect}} of this {{optimization}} is to improve time performance(by eliminating call overhead), {{at the cost of}} worsening space usage (due <b>to</b> <b>duplicating</b> the function body). The code expansion due <b>to</b> <b>duplicating</b> the function body dominates, except for simple cases, and thus the direct effect of inline expansion is to improve time at the cost of space.|$|R
5|$|As a goaltender, Lehman was {{a strong}} skater and good puckhandler. He chased down loose pucks, {{and was able to}} pass the puck to his forwards, {{surprising}} the other team's defenders. Playing in the OPHL, Lehman scored a goal by shooting the puck in the opponent's net. The first NHL goaltender <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> such a feat was Ron Hextall, who did it in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Helgoland and six destroyers {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> {{the success}} of the earlier raid on 18–19 October, but they were spotted by Italian aircraft and turned back in the face of substantial Allied reinforcements alerted by the aircraft. She was caught under the guns of several mutinous armored cruisers during the Gulf of Kotor Mutiny in February 1918, but managed to escape without damage.|$|E
5|$|However, , {{with the}} {{exception}} of Spiroplasma mirum strain SMCA causing spongiform microcystic encephalitis in suckling rats, other researchers have been unable <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> these findings, casting doubt on the Spiroplasma hypothesis. In defense of the Spiroplasma hypothesis, Bastian pointed out that Spiroplasma is hard to culture and that strain variation makes it hard to detect certain strains using PCR and other techniques, thus giving a false negative.|$|E

5|$|In January 1918, Friedrich Schlosser {{replaced}} von Trapp {{as commander}} of U-14. Schlosser was, in turn, replaced in June by Hugo Pistel, {{who remained in}} command {{until the end of}} the war. Neither of the later commanders was able <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> von Trapp's success in U-14; the U-boat sank no more ships through the rest of the war.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev founded several {{academic}} towns, such as Akademgorodok. The premier {{believed that}} Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university {{towns such as}} Oxford, isolated from big city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> those conditions in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centers tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{crossing}} loop {{was installed}} at Caringbah Station and Gymea Station when {{the line was}} opened, the single track line prevented the expansion of services to the Cronulla peninsula, and so in the 1980s it was decided <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> a 3.5 kilometre section of the line between Gymea and Caringbah, with Gymea. Miranda and Caringbah all receiving island platforms. The new section was opened on 15 July 1985. In the 2000s, the remaining single track sections were duplicated. These opened on 19 April 2010.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN Radio {{broadcasts}} public-affairs programming, {{including some}} audio simulcasts of C-SPAN's flagship television programs like Washington Journal and some radio-only programming {{such as the}} famous tape-recorded Oval Office conversations from the Johnson and Nixon administrations, oral histories, and some committee meetings and press conferences not shown on television due to programming commitments. The radio station does not try <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> C-SPAN television coverage, and takes a more selective approach to its broadcast content. Regular programs broadcast on the radio station include Today in Washington and Prime Minister's Question Time. The station also broadcasts full gavel-to-gavel coverage of political conventions in election years.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle {{the pictures on the}} front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E
50|$|At first, {{individual}} organizations {{developed their}} own software, including data management utilities, themselves. Different products might also have 'one-off' bespoke software. This fragmented approach led <b>to</b> <b>duplicated</b> effort {{and the production of}} management information needed manual effort.|$|R
50|$|Gene {{duplication}} initially leads <b>to</b> redundancy. However, <b>duplicated</b> gene sequences can mutate {{to develop}} new functions or specialize so that the new gene performs {{a subset of the}} original ancestral functions. In addition <b>to</b> <b>duplicating</b> whole genes, sometimes only a domain or part of a protein is duplicated so that the resulting gene is an elongated version of the parental gene.|$|R

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{titles in the}} series, the player {{controls}} space-faring bounty hunter Samus Aran, who travels to planet Zebes after learning that Space Pirates are experimenting with Metroids in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> them and use them for their own gain. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups {{that are used to}} reach previously inaccessible areas. The remake also features new items, additional areas, mini-bosses, difficulty levels, and a rewritten story which explores Samus's past.|$|E
5|$|Lower-class {{citizens}} used common {{forms of}} funerary art—including shabti figurines (to perform any labor {{that might be}} required of the dead person in the afterlife), models of the scarab beetle and funerary texts—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife. During the Middle Kingdom, miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> {{the activities of the}} living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Pharaohs used reliefs {{to record}} {{victories}} in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes.

5|$|Recognizing at {{an early}} age that he had an incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor. Once his {{associate}} had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> the writing of others for very little pay.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{decides to}} join Mulder in the game, {{and the two}} fight Maitreya together. Maitreya begins <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> herself, making the task of killing her more difficult. Finally, Maitreya sits atop a virtual tank and aims it at the agents. Phoebe admits there {{is one way to}} stop the game, but doing so will erase the entire program. Despite protests from Ivan, Phoebe gives Byers the kill command, {{effectively}} destroying Maitreya along with the game while saving Mulder and Scully. During Mulder's narration, we see that in the control room one of the monitors is still active. There, Ivan sees Maitreya's avatar, but with Scully's face.|$|E
50|$|VIPs {{should be}} readily {{identifiable}} as such, {{in a manner}} appropriate for their duties. VIP uniform items include the official VIP patch (shoulder or cap) and name tag. VIPs must not wear {{any part of the}} official NPS uniform or be dressed in a manner that attempts <b>to</b> <b>duplicates</b> its appearance.|$|R
30|$|An {{inconsistent}} aggregation session usually {{results in}} inaccurate aggregates. Note that double-counting {{does not always}} result in inaccuracies as some aggregation functions are insensitive <b>to</b> <b>duplicates,</b> i.e., MAXIMUM or MINIMUM. However, duplicates cause additional communication and processing overhead in nodes. For this reason, this paper treats inconsistent aggregation sessions as subject of prevention.|$|R
50|$|A {{slide copier}} {{is a simple}} optical device which can be {{fastened}} to the lens mount of a camera <b>to</b> enable slide <b>duplicates</b> <b>to</b> be made. Whilst these devices were formerly used <b>to</b> make <b>duplicates</b> on <b>to</b> slide film, they are often now {{used in conjunction with}} digital cameras to digitize images from film-based transparencies. This method usually gives better resolution than using attachments for digital A4 flat-bed scanners.|$|R
