5|$|In December 1946, the {{government}} of Camille Huysmans inaugurated a medal to be awarded to former members of <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> and bestowed various other benefits on other members, including pensions and a scheme of state-funded apprenticeships. Individuals were accorded military rank equivalent to their status in the movement during the war, entitling them to title and other privileges. Today the role of <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> during the conflict is commemorated by memorials, plaques and road names across the country, {{as well as by}} the National Museum of <b>the</b> <b>Resistance</b> in Anderlecht.|$|E
5|$|John {{returns to}} <b>the</b> <b>Resistance</b> {{headquarters}} located aboard a nuclear submarine and is briefed by General Ashdown (Ironside) that <b>the</b> <b>Resistance</b> has discovered a hidden signal containing a code protocol which they believe can initiate a permanent shutdown of Skynet's machines. Working on this intelligence, the human militia {{plans to launch}} an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco. It is decided among <b>the</b> <b>Resistance</b> that the offensive will commence in four days, due to an intercepted kill-list created by Skynet, which plans to terminate the Resistance's command staff within the same time frame. John learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese (Yelchin). <b>The</b> <b>Resistance</b> leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually travel {{back in time and}} become his father, and realizes that Skynet has learned of this fact.|$|E

50|$|Among <b>the</b> {{most notable}} <b>resistance</b> {{movements}} were <b>the</b> Polish <b>Resistance,</b> including <b>the</b> Polish Home Army, Le≈õni, {{and the whole}} Polish Underground State; the Soviet partisans, the Italian Resistenza led mainly by the Italian CLN; <b>the</b> French <b>Resistance,</b> Yugoslav Partisans, <b>the</b> Belgian <b>Resistance,</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian <b>Resistance,</b> <b>the</b> Danish <b>Resistance,</b> <b>the</b> Greek <b>Resistance,</b> <b>the</b> Dutch <b>Resistance</b> and <b>the</b> politically persecuted opposition in Germany itself (there were 16 main resistance groups and at least 27 failed attempts to assassinate Hitler with many more planned): in short, across German-occupied Europe.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{equivalent}} series <b>resistance</b> (ESR) summarizes all {{resistive losses}} of the capacitor. These are <b>the</b> terminal <b>resistances,</b> <b>the</b> contact <b>resistance</b> of <b>the</b> electrode contact, <b>the</b> line <b>resistance</b> of <b>the</b> electrodes, <b>the</b> electrolyte <b>resistance,</b> and <b>the</b> dielectric {{losses in the}} dielectric oxide layer.|$|R
50|$|In {{cases where}} there is heat {{transfer}} through different media (for example, through a composite material), <b>the</b> equivalent <b>resistance</b> is <b>the</b> sum of <b>the</b> <b>resistances</b> of <b>the</b> components {{that make up the}} composite. Likely, in cases where there are different heat transfer modes, <b>the</b> total <b>resistance</b> is <b>the</b> sum of <b>the</b> <b>resistances</b> of <b>the</b> different modes. Using the thermal circuit concept, the amount of heat transferred through any medium is the quotient of the temperature change and <b>the</b> total thermal <b>resistance</b> of <b>the</b> medium.|$|R
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> {{was focused}} in the French-speaking areas of Belgium (Wallonia {{and the city}} of Brussels), {{although}} Flemish involvement in <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> was also significant. Around 70 percent of underground newspapers were in French, while 60 percent of political prisoners were Walloon.|$|E
5|$|The attempt of <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> {{to enter}} {{mainstream}} politics with a formal party, the Belgian Democratic Union, failed {{to attract the}} level of support that similar parties had managed in France and elsewhere. Associations of former members were founded {{in the years immediately}} after the war and campaigned for greater recognition of the role of <b>the</b> <b>resistance.</b> The largest association, the , continues to fund historical research on the role of <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> and defending the interests of its members.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is given}} {{intelligence}} by an unidentified informant from the Cylon command structure, {{by use of}} a secret dead drop; flipping a dog bowl and hiding some documents inside the tent next to it. One piece of intelligence given is information on a Cylon communications blocker; <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> makes use of that information to contact a Raptor orbiting the planet. The Raptor returns to Galactica with news they have made contact with <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> on the planet.|$|E

40|$|Electrochemical noise {{measurements}} and impedance {{analyses were performed}} on A 516 - 70 carbon steel in chromate/chloride solutions. The noise data were used to calculate <b>the</b> noise <b>resistance</b> in <b>the</b> time domain, and <b>the</b> spectral noise <b>resistance</b> and spectral noise impedance in the frequency domain. It is shown that the spectral noise impedance {{is equivalent to the}} modules of electrode impedance over the experimental frequency range. This relationship is independent o f the corrosion types (passivity, general corrosion and metastable pitting). <b>The</b> noise <b>resistance</b> coincides with <b>the</b> charge-transfer <b>resistance</b> and <b>the</b> spectral noise <b>resistance</b> only under certain conditions, such as passive state or general corrosion, where <b>the</b> noise <b>resistance</b> provides an indication of <b>the</b> corrosion <b>resistance</b> o f <b>the</b> material under study. During pitting corrosion, <b>the</b> noise <b>resistance</b> is much lower than <b>the</b> charge-transfer <b>resistance</b> and only qualitatively, rather than quantitatively, tracks the change of corrosion <b>resistance.</b> <b>The</b> spectral noise <b>resistance</b> is consistent with <b>the</b> charge-transfer <b>resistance</b> and can be used to indicate the corrosivity of carbon steel under studied conditions...|$|R
5|$|A reduced fear of {{persecution}} encouraged <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> movements; anti-integration protests accompanied high-profile visits to East Timor {{including that of}} Pope John Paul II in 1989. The end of the Cold War removed much of the justification for western support of Indonesia's occupation.|$|E
5|$|A {{resistance}} movement developed in Belgium {{soon after the}} German occupation. <b>The</b> <b>resistance</b> took various forms. Although some sabotages by <b>the</b> <b>resistance,</b> notably {{the destruction of the}} Brussels-Aachen railway line, were celebrated at the time, armed resistance represented a minority of their acts. Around 300 separate resistance networks existed which often included both male and female members.|$|E
5|$|Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, {{a teenage}} refugee and admirer of John Connor and <b>the</b> <b>Resistance.</b> As portrayed by Michael Biehn in The Terminator, {{he was sent}} {{back in time to}} 1984 to protect Sarah Connor to ensure the {{survival}} of the human race, and fathered John with her. Yelchin said he wanted to portray Kyle as Biehn did and not make him appear weaker because it was a younger version of the character. The difference in his portrayal lies in showing Kyle as intense, but not concentrated until he joins <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> proper. Yelchin tried to convey Kyle's intensity by focusing on how fast Biehn appeared when running in the original film.|$|E
5000|$|To find <b>the</b> total <b>resistance</b> of all {{component}}s, add the reciprocals of <b>the</b> <b>resistances</b> [...] of {{each component}} {{and take the}} reciprocal of <b>the</b> sum. Total <b>resistance</b> will always be less than {{the value of the}} smallest resistance: ...|$|R

50|$|The theorem states how {{to choose}} (so as to {{maximize}} power transfer) <b>the</b> load <b>resistance,</b> once <b>the</b> source <b>resistance</b> is given. It is a common misconception to apply the theorem in the opposite scenario. It does not say {{how to choose}} <b>the</b> source <b>resistance</b> for a given load <b>resistance.</b> In fact, <b>the</b> source <b>resistance</b> that maximizes power transfer is always zero, regardless {{of the value of}} <b>the</b> load <b>resistance.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{they hide}} {{in a parking}} lot, Kyle {{explains}} to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defense network, known as Skynet, will become self-aware {{in the near future}} and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With <b>the</b> <b>Resistance</b> on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of <b>the</b> <b>Resistance.</b> The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the {{government}} was involved in launching Gutt's monetary reform plan {{as well as the}} disarming of <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> as part of the transition to stability. A major crisis emerged within {{the government}} over the refusal of the Front de l'Ind√©pendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Arm√©s (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and disarm. Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'√©tat, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Resistance</b> Brigades were reactivated, mainly {{comprising}} Sunni supporters {{from the}} southern city of Sidon. Its strength was reduced in late 2013 from 500 to 200‚Äì250 due to residents complaints about some fighters of the group exacerbating tensions with the local community.|$|E
30|$|Generally, the {{influence}} of <b>the</b> tangent <b>resistance</b> should be removed from <b>the</b> curve <b>resistance</b> results to determine <b>the</b> resultant <b>resistance</b> resulting only from the curving [18]. Consequently, the following analysis was simulated on a circle curve, and the final stable value {{was selected as the}} traction ratio for <b>the</b> curving <b>resistance.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{equivalent}} series <b>resistance</b> (ESR) summarizes all {{resistive losses}} of the capacitor. These are <b>the</b> supply line <b>resistances,</b> <b>the</b> contact <b>resistance</b> of <b>the</b> electrode contact, <b>the</b> line <b>resistance</b> of <b>the</b> electrodes and the dielectric {{losses in the}} dielectric film. The largest share of these losses is usually the dissipative losses in the dielectric.|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} of contact <b>resistance</b> often implies <b>the</b> {{presence of}} a barrier which gives rise to diode-like behavior or sigmoidal I-V characteristics. In some cases, a linear dependence on applied bias can be measured indicating that <b>the</b> barrier <b>resistance</b> involved in <b>the</b> contact <b>resistance</b> can be neglected. <b>The</b> contact <b>resistance</b> only consists then in a geometrical resistance which depends on the electrical radius [23]. In order to estimate <b>the</b> geometrical <b>resistance,</b> <b>the</b> Wexler <b>resistance</b> model [24, 25] was used, which describes the transition between the diffusive and ballistic transport regimes in constricted contacts.|$|R
5|$|In a {{move against}} the insurgency, the Cylons decide {{to have the}} NCP arrest 200 civilians {{they believe to be}} {{affiliated}} with <b>the</b> <b>resistance.</b> Headed by Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna), a former Galactica deckhand and resistance fighter, most of the arrests take place during the night. Those being arrested include Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch) and Cally Henderson Tyrol (Nicki Clyne). Learning of Cally's arrest, Jammer attempts to get her released by Boomer, but Boomer is unable to help. After another suicide bombing at a power station, the Cylons decide to have the prisoners executed, but require President Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) signature. When he refuses to sign, an Aaron Doral (Matthew Bennett) copy forces him to at gunpoint. Caprica-Six (Tricia Helfer) attempts to stop him, but Doral shoots her in the head. Baltar signs the document. Meanwhile, Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon) learns from Cavil (Dean Stockwell) that he only released her husband Saul (Michael Hogan) because the Cylons know he is leading <b>the</b> <b>resistance.</b> He informs Ellen that unless she tells the Cylons where <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> leaders will be meeting next, he will imprison Saul once more. Reluctantly, Ellen discovers where <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> plans to meet with members from the colonial fleet.|$|E
5|$|John pleads with General Ashdown {{to delay}} the {{offensive}} so he can formulate a plan to extract the human captives, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, <b>the</b> <b>Resistance</b> disobeys Ashdown's orders and instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that Connor can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Wright learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen), that he was created and built from the original Wright's corpse to lure John to the base; when <b>the</b> <b>Resistance</b> launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish in the past. The hidden signal that <b>the</b> <b>Resistance</b> received earlier is revealed {{to have been a}} ruse, and Skynet uses it to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.|$|E

5|$|Prisoners {{had little}} effect on <b>the</b> <b>{{resistance}}</b> in France. Initially there were three resistance networks based around repatriated prisoners split along political lines, but in March 1944, the three merged to form the National Movement of Prisoners of War and Deportees.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{occupiers}} chiefly came in {{the form}} of helping Allied airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this effort; for instance the Comet line which evacuated an estimated 700 Allied servicemen to Gibraltar. The Comet Line had a series of safe houses throughout Belgium. Allied airmen were given civilian clothes and were frequently moved from house to house, staying with Belgian families who supported <b>the</b> <b>resistance.</b> <b>The</b> <b>resistance</b> would aid the airmen by giving them false papers and guiding them to either neutral or Allied occupied territory.|$|E
