5|$|The Red River Trails {{are less}} well known today than many other pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with {{the exception of the}} Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers. It may be that this relative lack of attention is due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> did not lead to annexation of any territory to either of the nations in which the trails were located.|$|E
5|$|Lacking {{military}} discipline, in what likely {{seemed to}} the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> were still in Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at Belgrade, but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At Nish the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of Bohemians and Saxons {{did not make it}} past Hungary before splitting up.|$|E

25|$|Monorail means {{a system}} of guided transit {{vehicles}} operating on or suspended from a single rail, beam, or tube. Usually they operate in trains.

25|$|One {{of their}} enigma is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> were not {{mentioned}} in local and foreign medieval documents.

It implies that occurred discontinuity of historical memory among all three ethnic groups, caused by ethnic migrations and religious conversions during the Ottoman occupation.|$|E

25|$|The game added hugely to {{the rivalry}} {{between the two}} teams in England where they {{felt that they had}} been cheated out of the {{competition}} by Maradona's handball.

However, Trinity was not able to meet league requirements and was dropped from the league in 1986, the same year San Beda returned (despite sports articles in newspapers that year stating Trinity voluntarily left the league).|$|E

Calling Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium at Owen Field home, the team has won numerous bowl games, 41 conference championships (including every Big Seven championship awarded), and seven Associated Press National Championships, making the Sooners football program the most decorated in the Big 12. Oklahoma has scored the most points in Division I-A football history despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> have played over 60 fewer games than the second place school on that list.

25|$|In November and December 2008, the Human League got {{together}} with Martin Fry's ABC and Heaven 17 for 'The Steel City Tour' of the UK. This was Philip Oakey's concept of a joint tour of all three bands celebrating the original electronic music of early 1980s Sheffield (the titular Steel City). Much {{was made in the}} UK media of the history between Heaven 17 and the Human League, the original events of 1980 and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> were now working together.

25|$|Just {{after these}} runners {{had arrived in}} Nashville, a war party {{attacked}} one of its outlying settlements, killing Robertson's brother Mark. In response, Robertson raised a group of one hundred fifty volunteers and proceeded south by a circuitous land route, guided by two Chickasaw. Somehow catching the town off guard despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> knew Robertson's force was approaching, they chased its would-be defenders to the river, killing {{about half of them}} and wounding many of the rest. They then gathered all the trade goods in the town to be shipped to Nashville by boat, burned the town, and departed.|$|E

25|$|The {{relatively}} unsophisticated and ad-hoc {{nature of}} sessions {{is due to}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> weren't part of the initial design, {{and had to be}} developed, with minimal disruption to the main line, by a third party (Citrix Systems) as a prerequisite for their terminal server product for Windows NT, called WinFrame. Starting with Windows Vista, though, sessions finally became a proper aspect of the Windows architecture. No longer a memory manager construct that creeps into user mode indirectly through Win32, they were expanded into a pervasive abstraction affecting most Executive subsystems. As a matter of fact, regular use of Windows Vista always results in a multi-session environment.|$|E

They were due {{to move into the}} new 75,000-seater Nou Mestalla in the {{northwest}} of the city in 2013, but the final move date has been postponed while the stadium remains under construction. Valencia have a fierce rivalry with fellow Valencian club Villarreal, with whom they contest the Derby de la Comunitat. The rivalry is further fueled by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> are the two most successful clubs in the region. Valencia also have a long-standing rivalry with Levante, also located in the city of Valencia, and with two other clubs in the Valencian region, Hércules and Castellón.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids {{are further}} {{distinguished}} from insects by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> {{do not have}} antennae or wings. Their body is organized into two tagmata, called the prosoma, or cephalothorax, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen. The cephalothorax {{is derived from the}} fusion of the cephalon (head) and the thorax, and is usually covered by a single, unsegmented carapace. The abdomen is segmented in the more primitive forms, but varying degrees of fusion between the segments occur in many groups. It is typically divided into a preabdomen and postabdomen, although this is only clearly visible in scorpions, and in some orders, such as the Acari, the abdominal sections are completely fused. A telson is present in scorpions, where it has been modified to a stinger, and in the Schizomida, whip scorpions and Palpigradi.|$|E
