5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{contains the}} ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum, a membrane that separates <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> ventricles. Beneath <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> ventricles is the thalamus {{and to the}} front and below this is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland. At the back of the thalamus is the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the abducens nerve (VI) {{can also}} result in diplopia. This {{is due to}} {{impairment}} in <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> rectus muscle, which is innervated by the abducens nerve.|$|E
5|$|In African antelopes, <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> dental {{grooming}} apparatus {{does not}} appear to be used during grazing or browsing. Instead, it is used during grooming when the head sweeps upward in a distinctive motion. It is thought to comb the fur and remove ectoparasites.|$|E

50|$|Aprusia veddah is {{only known}} from the female of the species. The females are 18.5mm long. The {{cephalothorax}} is pale orange and broadly oval in shape. <b>The</b> anterior <b>lateral</b> eyes are <b>the</b> largest and circular, the posterior median eyes are oval, as are <b>the</b> posterior <b>lateral</b> eyes; <b>the</b> posterior eye row is procurved from the front; <b>the</b> anterior <b>lateral</b> eyes are separated by less than their radius, <b>the</b> anterior <b>lateral</b> eye and <b>the</b> posterior <b>lateral</b> eye are separated by less than <b>the</b> anterior <b>lateral</b> eye's radius, <b>the</b> posterior median eyes are touching, <b>the</b> posterior <b>lateral</b> eye and posterior median eye are touching. The sternum is longer than wide. They have three spines on the prolateral side of the first femur.|$|R
5|$|In RP, <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> approximant , has {{two main}} allophones (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain , as in light, {{and the dark}} or velarised , as in full. GA has dark l in most cases.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. <b>The</b> <b>lateral</b> canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
5|$|Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus. The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, frontal horn of <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> ventricle, and occipital horn of <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> ventricle. CSF is also produced by the single layer of column-shaped ependymal cells which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the subarachnoid space; and a small amount directly from the tiny spaces surrounding blood vessels around the brain.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> voiceless velar <b>lateral</b> {{fricative}} , <b>the</b> voiced velar <b>lateral</b> fricative , and <b>the</b> corresponding voiceless and ejective affricates , [...] {{are extremely}} unusual speech sounds among {{the languages of}} the world, because velar fricatives are usually central rather than <b>lateral.</b> <b>The</b> velar <b>laterals</b> are further forward than velars in most languages and could better be called prevelar, like the Tutorial does.|$|R
5|$|Physical {{examination}} often {{begins with}} {{examination of the}} patient's gait. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated {{in an attempt to}} avoid tibial spine impingement on <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia, {{also called}} basal nuclei, are {{a set of}} {{structures}} deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation. The largest component is the striatum, others are the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. Part of the dorsal striatum, the putamen, and the globus pallidus, lie separated from <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> ventricles on their outer sides.|$|E

5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the spinal {{accessory}} nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper segments of the spinal cord. This cluster of neurons, called the spinal accessory nucleus, is located in <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> aspect of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and stretches from where the spinal cord begins (at the junction with the medulla) through {{to the level of}} about C6. <b>The</b> <b>lateral</b> horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve passes {{between the}} {{piriformis}} muscle and coccygeus (ischiococcygeus) muscles {{and leaves the}} pelvis through {{the lower part of}} the greater sciatic foramen. It crosses over <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> part of the sacrospinous ligament and reenters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen. After reentering the pelvis, it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal, along with the internal pudendal blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of females consist of paired ovaries, lateral oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber. <b>The</b> <b>lateral</b> ducts are where the eggs leave the body, while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored. Unlike other insects, the gonopore, or genital opening {{is behind the}} seventh abdominal segment. The ovaries are primitive {{in that they are}} polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate {{along the length of the}} ovariole). In some species these long ovarioles branch off <b>the</b> <b>lateral</b> duct, while in others, short ovarioles appear around the duct.|$|E

40|$|Two {{new species}} are {{recognized}} in the rhodomelacean genus Tayloriella Kylin: T. divaricata sp. nov. and T. abyssalis sp. nov. These two taxa are distributed in the northeastern North Pacific, the former ranging from Amchitka Island in the Aleutians through southcentral Alaska to northern British Columbia, and the latter ranging also from Amchitka Island through southcentral Alaska and British Columbia into northern Washington. A characteristic of these two species shared {{with the type of}} Tayloriella is that <b>the</b> abaxial <b>lateral</b> always overtops <b>the</b> monopodially developed axes in every order of branching. <b>The</b> <b>laterals</b> have little congenital fusion with the parent axes. A common feature in these two species is that <b>the</b> <b>laterals</b> are terminated in a relatively long monosiphonous portion (usually 6 or 7 cells).
