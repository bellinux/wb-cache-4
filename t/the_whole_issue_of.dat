On that supposition, let us examine our own proceeding. Let us compute the profit it has brought, and the advantage that it is likely to bring hereafter. A peace too eagerly sought is not always the sooner obtained. The discovery of vehement wishes generally frustrates their attainment, and your adversary has gained a great advantage over you when he finds you impatient to conclude a treaty.

Após 18 meses, constatou-se que a maioria das propriedades cadastradas ainda permanecia irregular sem registro, o que poderia caracterizar a apropriação indevida de terras “grilagem”. Neste trabalho, foi utilizado o SIG: SPRING (Sistema de Processamento de Informações Georreferenciadas) para gerar mapas cadastrais de propriedades, nos municípios do Estado do Tocantins, de modo a visualizá-las espacialmente.
