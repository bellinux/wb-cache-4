5|$|A {{variety of}} {{religious}} beliefs are represented among the novel's characters. Jacob Brattle is an unbeliever. Puddleham is a Primitive Methodist. The Stowte family, {{to which the}} marquis belongs, are Low Church Anglicans, and Fenwick is High church and latitudinarian. Their charity is tested by their response to Carry Brattle, and it is Fenwick who passes the test. As William Cadbury expresses it, Puddleham has been hardened by too much doctrine, Jacob Brattle by <b>too</b> <b>little.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the mid-1990s}} Arnada had begun working for Bintang Indonesia, {{owned by the}} Ciputra family. He left the {{newspaper}} in 1999 as he considered the publication to devote <b>too</b> <b>little</b> space to music. He established Bintang Milenia that year, but by 2002 it had been shut down. During this time he worked extensively with MTV Indonesia and various start-ups.|$|E

5000|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the album consisted of mixed reviews, a negative one by Kenneth Nguyen from The Age, stating the album [...] "comes across as a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> old-fashioned, a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> polite, a <b>little</b> - may I say it? - too Hilary Duff." ...|$|R

5|$|Christopher Huynh of Game Music Online {{generally}} {{praised the}} soundtrack's quality, but {{felt there was}} <b>too</b> <b>little</b> variety. RPGFans Patrick Gann was generally positive, although he had little commentary on individual tracks, and recommended the album to people who had enjoyed the soundtrack of Nier. The album reached #18 in the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With <b>too</b> <b>little</b> buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching both men and machinery within.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the overall}} {{positive}} reception, some reviewers {{thought that the}} game had too many redundancies in the cases and left <b>too</b> <b>little</b> control to the player, leading to the game being boring at times. Although 1UP gave it a perfect score, they also warned that the extended cut-scenes in the game could make some players feel they {{lost control of the}} action.|$|E
5000|$|Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress rated it 2.5/5 {{stars and}} called it [...] "a slickly produced, low-budget, faith-based thriller that's light on the thrills and heavy on the faith". [...] In rating it 5/10 stars, George Tiller of PopMatters wrote, [...] "So what we wind up with is a muddled bit of Southern Gothic lite that somehow manages {{to be a pretty}} enjoyable movie." [...] David Cornelius of DVD Talk rated it 2/5 and criticized the film's {{transition}} from drama to supernatural thriller. Cornelius described it as [...] "always just a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> melodramatic, a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> hokey, a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> saccharine".|$|R
5000|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a B-, writing, [...] "Valerie's mental illness just seems a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> controlled, a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> cool, somehow.

5000|$|The song {{describes}} a narrator whose woman had recently {{walked out on}} him, wanting {{him to be a}} better man. The narrator keeps stating in his mind that he should have done something for the woman: [...] "I should've done this and I should've done that / I should've been there then she'd have never left / I should've been hangin' on to every word she ever had to say / But it's a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> late, she's a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> gone / She's a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> right, I'm a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> wrong / Now {{would be a good time}} to change / But it's a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> late." ...|$|R
5|$|Haas and Creamer {{were cleared}} of the {{plagiarism}} charge by their institutions. The Chicago Field Museum of Natural History’s science advisory council rebuked Haas for press releases and web pages that gave <b>too</b> <b>little</b> credit to Shady and inflated the couple’s role as discoverers. The dispute remains heated. Scholars have concerns {{that it could}} {{make it more difficult}} for United States archaeologists to gain permission to work in Peru.|$|E
5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} {{inside the}} rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide <b>too</b> <b>little</b> power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria. It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can {{be judged by}} its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate <b>too</b> <b>little</b> light. It {{can be difficult to}} control because it grows fast and spreads over other objects in the tank.|$|E

5000|$|Sartre cites a café waiter, whose {{movements}} and conversation are a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> [...] "waiter-esque". His voice oozes with an eagerness to please; he carries food rigidly and ostentatiously; [...] "his movement is quick and forward, a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> precise, a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> rapid". His exaggerated behaviour illustrates {{that he is}} play acting as a waiter, as an object in the world: an automaton whose essence {{is to be a}} waiter. But that he is obviously acting belies that he is aware that he is not (merely) a waiter, but is rather consciously deceiving himself.|$|R
5|$|<b>Too</b> <b>little</b> {{data has}} been {{gathered}} {{to assess the}} population size and trend of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. It has been reported as “moderately common”, although difficult to find because of its size and ability to blend into its surroundings. Its distribution across the British Virgin Islands seems to be limited, and development may affect it further.|$|E
5|$|Wallace (1973) {{addressed}} {{a number of}} criticisms of the committee including that it provides <b>too</b> <b>little</b> information on the reasons for rarity rejection. Alan Vittery and Sara McMahon have both argued that the committee should inform observers whose records are rejected of the committee's reasons for doing so. This view also {{has the support of}} the editor of Birdwatch, Dominic Mitchell, who has made this the topic of editorials on a number of occasions.|$|E
5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers <b>too</b> <b>little...</b> Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E

5|$|Aflaq {{moved to}} Baghdad {{following}} his reelection to the Secretary Generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, when Black September happened, he criticised the Ba'ath leadership of doing <b>too</b> <b>little</b> {{to help the}} Palestine Liberation Organisation during the conflict. During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned to Lebanon in self-imposed exile. The government of Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.|$|E
5|$|All these {{attempts}} {{to mount a}} combined offensive between the Franks and Mongols were <b>too</b> <b>little</b> and too late. In May 1291, the city of Acre was conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Acre. When Pope Nicholas IV learned of this, he wrote to Arghun, again asking him to be baptized and {{to fight against the}} Mamluks. But Arghun had died on , and Pope Nicholas died as well in March 1292, putting an end to their efforts towards combined action.|$|E
5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being <b>too</b> <b>little,</b> too late.|$|E
50|$|Reviewing the TIFF début of the film, Rocchi writes: Emotional Arithmetic {{plays out}} {{in a series of}} fairly {{predictable}} scenes — resentments simmer, past pain comes to light, rapprochements are formed. Emotional Arithmetic tries to paint a picture of the long-term emotional effects of political atrocities, which is certainly an important topic. But, again, it feels like a film that was made to be about an important topic — it's a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> obvious, a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> on-the-nose, a <b>little</b> familiar. Emotional Arithmetic has the best of intentions; it's just that its whole is far less than the sum of the parts.|$|R

Ticknor ('Life', vol. i. p. 265) thought him [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> precise, a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> much made up in his manners and conversation." [...] But on all sides there is evidence to confirm the testimony of Rogers ('Table-Talk', p. 207) that he was a man [...] "who had not a particle of envy or jealousy in his nature."] ...|$|R

5|$|American {{broadcaster}} NBC Sports, {{who also}} owns the broadcast {{rights to the}} Olympics, has been criticised by athletes and IPC officials for airing <b>too</b> <b>little</b> coverage of the Paralympics; the lack of coverage from NBC in Athens was {{a cause for concern}} from senior IPC officials, especially given that the United States was bidding for the 2012 Games. In 2012 NBC only produced around 5 hours of tape delayed highlights from the Games, airing on the pay TV channel NBC Sports Network, and did not cover the ceremonies at all.|$|E
5|$|Arévalo {{took office}} on 15 March 1945, inheriting {{a country with}} {{numerous}} social and economic issues. Despite Ubico's policy of using unpaid labor to build public roads, internal transport was severely inadequate. 70% {{of the population was}} illiterate, and malnutrition and poor health were widespread. The wealthiest 2% of landowners owned nearly three quarters of agricultural land, and as a result less than 1% was cultivated. The indigenous peasants either had no land, or had far <b>too</b> <b>little</b> to sustain themselves. Three quarters of the labor force were in agriculture, and industry was essentially nonexistent.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the third Four Quartets poem, The Dry Salvages, Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green, Surrey while he recovered. During this time, Eliot started writing Little Gidding. The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it. He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write, and that, precipitated by air raids on London, he had started the poem with <b>too</b> <b>little</b> preparation and had written it too quickly. After the first draft was written, he set the poem aside, and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain.|$|E
