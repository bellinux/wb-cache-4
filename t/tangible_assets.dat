25|$|The {{dividend}} is {{hopefully the}} payout that the assignee issues, once all creditors' claims have been vetted {{and all the}} assets have been sold. The assignee hopes to generate enough cash to provide a one for one redemption of a creditor's claims. This is the hope the reality varies vastly, depending on the price the assets fetched when sold. Most dividends are {{in the form of}} cash back to the creditor, but not necessarily all. There may not even be a dividend in certain instance, thus no creditor receives any payment. There is no way to determine the cash value of an asset in the assignment process, regardless of past estimates. <b>Tangible</b> <b>assets</b> cash value can usually, but not always, be reasonably estimated.

Although he learnt to write and draw with his left hand, and had cameras adapted, Beaton became frustrated by the limitations the stroke had put upon his work. As a result of his stroke, Beaton became anxious about financial security for his old age and, in 1976, entered into negotiations with Philippe Garner, expert-in-charge of photographs at Sotheby's. On behalf of the auction house, Garner acquired Beaton's archive—excluding all portraits of the Royal Family, and the five decades of prints held by Vogue in London, Paris and New York. Garner, who had almost singlehandedly invented the photographic auction, oversaw the archive's preservation and partial dispersal, so that Beaton's only <b>tangible</b> <b>assets,</b> and what he considered his life's work, would ensure him an annual income. The first of five auctions was held in 1977, the last in 1980.|$|E

25|$|Asset {{poverty is}} an {{economic}} and social condition that is more persistent and prevalent than income poverty. It {{can be defined as}} a household's inability to access wealth resources that are enough to provide for basic needs for a period of three months. Basic needs refer to the minimum standards for consumption and acceptable needs.Wealth resources consist of home ownership, other real estate (second home, rented properties, etc.), net value of farm and business assets, stocks, checking and savings accounts, and other savings (money in savings bonds, life insurance policy cash values, etc.).Wealth is measured in three forms: net worth, net worth minus home equity, and liquid assets. Net worth consists of all the aspects mentioned above. Net worth minus home equity is the same except it does not include home ownership in asset calculations. Liquid assets are resources that are readily available such as cash, checking and savings accounts, stocks, and other sources of savings. There are two types of assets: tangible and intangible. <b>Tangible</b> <b>assets</b> most closely resemble liquid assets in that they include stocks, bonds, property, natural resources, and hard assets not in the form of real estate. Intangible assets are simply the access to credit, social capital, cultural capital, political capital, and human capital.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a neoclassical growth model with capital accumulation and a retradable <b>tangible</b> <b>asset</b> in an overlapping generations framework. It analyzes {{its effect on}} the dynamics of capital accumulation. Two period lived consumers hold portfolios consisting of real capital and the <b>tangible</b> <b>asset.</b> It is shown that the possibility of trading the <b>tangible</b> <b>asset</b> as an alternative to capital may cause the coexistence of stable steady states with high and low levels of capital and with disjoint basins of attraction. Thus, the so-called poverty trap may appear purely endogenously generated as a consequence of asset trading alone. The possibility of the occurrence of the poverty trap is reduced as factors of production become more substitutable. However, the result is robust for continua of homogeneous as well as heterogeneous consumers...|$|R
