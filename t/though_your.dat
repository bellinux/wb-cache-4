In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound {{to be its}} weakest component, <b>though</b> <b>Your</b> Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later rooms of the castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the anxiety of the running timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E

[...] The book Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design by Scott Rogers used him as an example while discussing how the [...] "party members don't need to be human". In 2008, UGO Team stated this [...] "undisputed champion of Fallout characters" [...] is not [...] "only our favorite Fallout character, he's also one of gaming's greatest dogs." [...] That same year, Joe Martin of Bit-tech ranked Dogmeat as the sixth top PC game NPC of all time, commenting: [...] "There are a lot of computer game characters we like and a few we’d even {{go so far as to}} say we love. Dogmeat though, despite being a definite tabula rasa, sits in a different category altogether and is the only computer game character that we’d reload and repeat significant portions of a game for, just so he could stand a better chance of survival." [...] In 2009, Michael Fiegel of The Escapist called Dogmeat possibly the most beloved character of the Fallout universe, writing that [...] "in an uncaring wasteland ... Dogmeat is a moral compass: <b>Though</b> <b>your</b> needle might swing towards good or evil, his center always holds strong provided you protect him." [...] Steve and Larson of ScrewAttack ranked Dogmeat as the tenth best gaming pet in 2011. Dogmeat was included in numerous lists of best video game dogs, including by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist in 2010, Michael Perry of PlayStation Official Magazine in 2012, Gergo Vas of Kotaku in 2013, and Benjamin Abbott of Metro, Brian Taylor of Paste, and the staff of Bild in 2014. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN chose Dogmeat as the top feature he wished to return in Fallout 4.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{have given}} the game mixed reviews. Billboards Doug Reece commented that [...] "Unfortunately, the detail {{is so great that}} there are moments when Virtual Springfield can become {{somewhat}} tedious." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com gave the game a three out of five rating, criticizing the lack of a plot but praising the humor. She wrote that Virtual Springfield [...] "isn't so much a game as an interactive tour of Springfield and The Simpsons characters. <b>Though</b> <b>your</b> task is to collect trading cards around town, it doesn't offer any difficulty in finding them. The game controls make it difficult, however, to pick up the cards and collect them. The real fun of Virtual Springfield is browsing the Kwik E Mart, visiting Krustylu Studios or hangin' on Evergreen Terrace with the Simpson family. The entire cast lent their voice to this game, so meeting the characters and hearing their quotes is a lot of laughs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The last {{sign of the}} Zodiac, the Pisces symbol {{has been}} {{said to be a}} {{representation}} of the difficulty in extracting the good from that which appears bad. The moral of the symbol for Pisces is said to be that [...] "the severe season has passed; <b>though</b> <b>your</b> flocks, as yet, do not yield their store, the ocean and rivers are open to you, their inhabitants are placed within your power." [...] It is generally considered a feminine sign, and colors that have been used to represent the Pisces sign are gray or blue gray. The body parts associated with Pisces are the feet, or the toes. Likewise, astrologists also associate various diseases of the body with the zodiac, and Pisces' diseases are those of the feet. This includes gout, lameness, distempers, and sores. Excess of eating and drinking, as well as poisoning related to the consumption of fish and medicines are also shown in Pisces.|$|E
