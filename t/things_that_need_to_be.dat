The writers created Ruby to change the perception of demons into more of a , rather than the [...] "black and white", [...] "They're evil, we're good" [...] approach previously used in the series. However, the writers also planned for Ruby to impact the brothers negatively by facilitating the story arc of Sam falling into evilwhich had been set up in the second season, but without follow-throughand causing a fracture in their relationship. Knowing this, the writers were amused by fans questioning why they were [...] "trying to make [...] likable". Despite Ruby's overall betrayal of the brothers, writer Sera Gamble commented, [...] " [...] brought the idea that you can't just dismiss demons as <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed right away. They could be useful, and while fundamentally untrustworthy, there might be cause to trust them in a given situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes there are <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done and they're not fun to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead {{of being able to}} join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist. He understands that even when you have friends that come back from the dead, not everything that you want to happen is going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Paramount faced two {{obstacles}} {{in promoting the}} film: the unfamiliarity of the [...] "MySpace generation" [...] with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Treks stigma. Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with statements like [...] "I'm not a Star Trek fan" [...] and [...] "this movie is not made for Star Trek fans necessarily". Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode [...] "A Matter of Honor", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel. [...] "On that ship when someone talks back to you, {{you would have to}} beat them down or you lose the respect of your crew, which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship that would be a crime. So we have to give [...] a little bit of leeway, when he is traveling the 'galaxy' over there where they don't know Trek, to say the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said in order to get people onto our side." ...|$|E

When I cite those numbers to people here in the United States, I find most people are astonished. They just have no idea about that. In some countries in Africa, it's well above 50 percent that are women and girls.

2500|$|Disagreement {{persists}} {{over who}} originated {{the metaphor of}} a [...] "stab in the back" [...] as an explanation for losing the First World War. [...] What emerges clearly from Thaer's observations is {{that the idea of}} off-loading responsibility for military defeat away from the military leadership originated in the Supreme Army Command. [...] Even though Hindenburg and Ludendorff tried to shift the blame for the threatened defeat [...] - and therefore the failure of their own predications to come true - during the later years of the war, away from the army, there was not at this point any talk of a planned or treacherous conspiracy. [...] But there was talk of the forces having been let down by shortcomings on the homefront, whereby inadequate soldiers and insufficient war resources had been supplied by the civilain authorities. [...] Thaer quotes Ludendorff on 1 October 1918: [...] "Right now we have no chancellor. [...] Whoever gets appointed, there are <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. [...] But I have asked His Majesty to bring into government those whom we have to thank that we have come to the present position. [...] We will now see these gentlemen taking over the ministries. [...] They must now conclude the peace that must be concluded. [...] Let them now take the gruel that they have been delivering to us!" [...] This argument can really only be interpreted as a form of retreat-ideology, and in that sense the first phase {{in the development of the}} [...] Dolchstoß legend. [...] It served to obscure the failures of the military leadership, and from there of certain specific individuals.|$|E

6000|$|Thus it is self-evident {{that the}} society in which the Vedic poets lived was so far from being PRIMITIVE that it was even {{superior}} to the higher barbarisms (such {{as that of the}} Scythians of Herodotus and Germans of Tacitus), and might be regarded as safely arrived at the threshold of civilisation. Society possessed kings, though they may have been kings of small communities, like those who warred with Joshua or fought under the walls of Thebes or Troy. Poets were better paid than they seem to have been at the courts of Homer or are at the present time. For the tribal festivals special priests were appointed, [...] "who distinguished themselves by their comprehensive knowledge of the requisite rites and by their learning, and amongst whom a sort of rivalry is gradually developed, according as one tribe or another is supposed to have more or less prospered by its sacrifices".(1) In the family marriage is sacred, and traces of polyandry and of the levirate, surviving as late as the epic poems, were regarded as <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> explained away.
