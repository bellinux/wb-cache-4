Using the rock is in itself not new. In factories all around the world, phosphate rock is processed chemically (with sulphuric acid, for instance) to make the phosphate soluble for use as crop fertiliser. In the mid- 1990 s, researchers from Zimbabwe s Institute of Mining Research and Canada s University of Guelph in developed a small device that mixes phosphorous rock with triple super-phosphate fertiliser into clean and easy-to-handle pellets. Once the pellets are applied to the soil and watered, a chemical reaction releases the phosphate into the soil. The device is easy to make and is catching on fast in Kenya and Uganda where local artisans produce it for around US$ 200. With support from the agroforestry centre ICRAF, Canada s IDRC, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Africa 2000 programme, the technology is now being replicated in Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal.

40|$|We analyze {{different}} {{issues related to}} synchronization among multiple components in Global Computing (GC) systems, where many heterogeneous entities must cooperate in a distributed scenario with mobility. We start with a comparison between different models for GC systems, namely Fusion Calculus, Synchronized Hyperedge Replacement (SHR) with both Hoare and Milner synchronization, and logic programming. The comparison shows tight relations between the three models, while it highlights the complexity of implementing a synchronization model (Milner model) on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> (Hoare model). This triggers {{the idea of having}} the synchronization model as a separate entity w. r. t. the underlying framework, thus allowing to choose each time the most suitable one. This is formalized using synchronization algebras with mobility (SAMs), a generalization of Winskel's synchronization algebras apt to be used in a framework with mobility and local resources, and then applied both in the framework of SHR and of process calculi. Finally, we analyze the compositionality properties of our frameworks, with particular attention to the ``bisimilarity is a congruence' property, using standard techniques from bialgebras. As a result we show that bisimilarity is a congruence for SHR with any synchronization model, and we present a concurrent semantics for Fusion Calculus, whose induced bisimilarity is a congruence (while this does not hold for the standard semantics...|$|R

25|$|In {{many parts}} of ancient India, the {{inscriptions}} were carried out in smoke-treated palm leaves. This tradition dates back to over two thousand years. Even after the Indian languages were put on paper in the 13th century, palm leaves where considered a preferred medium of writing owing to its longevity (nearly 400 years) compared to paper. Both sides of the leaves were used for writing. Long rectangular strips were gathered on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string. Books of this manufacture were common to Southeast Asia.

5000|$|The Rockeries and The Strid: in 1842 Paxton {{began work}} on a rockery of a gargantuan scale, piling rocks {{weighing}} several tons <b>one</b> on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> them was described thus by Lord Desart in the 1860s: [...] "In one place a sort of miniature Matterhorn apparently blocked the path but with the touch of the finger it revolved on a metal axis and made a way to pass." [...] It is now locked in place to comply with health and safety regulations. Another rock is so balanced {{that it can be}} swayed with little pressure. Two rocks are named for the Queen and Prince Albert, and another for the Duke of Wellington, all of whom visited Chatsworth in the 6th Duke's time. The Wellington Rock, a construction of several rocks piled on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> each other, is 45 feet (14 m) high and a small waterfall drips over it into a pond. Sometimes in the winter the water freezes creating icicles. The water flows into a pond created by Paxton called 'The Strid', which is named after a stretch of the River Wharfe on the Devonshires' Bolton Abbey estate, where the river is compressed into a turbulent chasm just a yard wide. Chatsworth's Strid is a placid stretch of water fringed with rocks and luxuriant vegetation and crossed by a rustic bridge.|$|R
40|$|In a {{multicolor}} {{offset press}} the process inks (kcmy) will be printed consecutively on the substrate from oneprinting unit to the other. The printing dots and elements in different process color will be printed either isolated, partly orcompletely overprinted {{depending on the}} halftoning. In a multicolor press the inks will be printed wet on wet. That meansthat {{in the area where}} process inks overlap each other one or more inks will be printed on another ink which is not dryenough. The adhesive power between the wet inks is different and less compared to the adhesive power between one inkprinted on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a less wet ink or even a completely dry ink. The adhesive power between the substrate and printed ink isalso different from the adhesive power <b>of</b> <b>one</b> ink on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> <b>one.</b> Depending on this adhesive power and the inks’inner cohesion power the thickness of the second printed ink varies. The thickness or amount of the second printed ink on thefirst one can be determined; its value is called trapping. The amount of the trapping will also be changed due to differentparameters such as ink temperature, dampening, printing speed etc. An important outcome is that the gray balance and thecolor appearance (secondary and tertiary colors) of the printed product also depend very much on the trapping’s amount. Thatshows {{how important it is to}} have an explicit value for the trapping. The amount of the second printed inks will bedetermined by trapping formulas. This value should be useful for the printer at the press. Unfortunately, the conventionaltrapping formulas are only useful for the “relative” comparison of trapping between two print products. All the conventionalformulas for trapping only deliver the amount of the second printed ink on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>one</b> in percent. This value for itsown (e. g. 63 %) is not really useful and meaningful for print machine operators. There are three different formulas fordetermining trapping. These are Preucil, Ritz, and Brunner. All of them are based on density only. The results of theseformulas are different to each other, especially the Brunner formula differs to the other ones. Here a method will beintroduced which is based on spectrometry and will complement the conventional formulas. Shahram Hauck is Printing process and quality manager at manroland, Germany</p...|$|R

For some time, problems {{at the front of}} the Liverpool central goal pens went largely unnoticed except by those inside it, and by a few police at that end of the pitch. Liverpool's goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, reported fans from behind him pleading to him for help as the situation worsened. The police at first attempted to stop fans from spilling out of the pens, some believing this to be a pitch invasion. At approximately 3:05pm in match action, Peter Beardsley kicked a shot which struck Nottingham Forest's goal bar.

25|$|All mountain-building strata {{consists}} of sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic era, that were originally laid {{down on the}} seabed. The base of the mountain comprises muschelkalk beds; its upper layers are made of Wetterstein limestone. With steep rock walls up to 800metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper Triassic that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, arêtes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine coralline algae in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-white and light grey to speckled. In several places it contains lead and zinc ore. These minerals were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the Höllental valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of muschelkalk run from {{the foot of the}} Great Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder Köpfe.
