25|$|Chris Cairns and Brendon McCullum found {{themselves}} in the precarious position of being at 6/86 after 22 overs, needing 262 for victory. Cairns hit fast and hard, knocking 50 runs from 40 balls, before falling victim to Gillespie's bowling, attempting another boundary. Three overs later, McCullum was the recipient of a ball from Brad Hogg which he attempted to block, getting a <b>thick</b> <b>edge</b> of his bat to the ball before it struck his pads. Upon appeal however, umpire Peter Parker gave McCullum out, a clearly incorrect decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{third day}} of play was blessed with a bright and sunny weather, and the pitch {{remained}} an excellent one for batting. The pair of Dravid and Laxman began in a circumspect fashion, adding only 28 runs in 17 overs, {{a period in which}} the only noteworthy accomplishment made by either sides was Dravid's half-century, which he reached with a front-foot flick to square leg off Stuart MacGill's bowling in the penultimate ball of the 59th over. Not long afterward, in the 65th over, Dravid hit the first boundary of the morning by flicking a loose, low full-toss drifting towards leg-side from MacGill. VVS Laxman, facing the first ball after the drinks break, from Andy Bichel, was dropped by Ricky Ponting when he was batting on 65. The ball was short and nicely dug in, but Laxman tilted the face of the bat at an unusual angle, getting a <b>thick</b> <b>edge</b> towards slips, where Ponting dived full to his left, but was unable to latch on to the ball. Australia would go on to regret this mistake. Sunil Gavaskar noted that Laxman would have a sudden lapse of concentration after prolonged periods of good batting. The two batsmen grew in confidence, however, and they began to bat a little more freely, with Dravid driving every ball in the off-stump line towards extra cover or cover for a boundary, while Laxman use his wristy strokeplay and his good footwork to negotiate the odd ball which kept low, and often dragging off-stump deliveries towards leg-side. This was reminiscent of the way he handled Shane Warne in 2000–01 at Eden, where he hit 281 and along with Dravid, staged a comeback to give India a famous victory. At Lunch, India were securely placed at 252/4 from 83 overs. After lunch, the two batsmen began to stroke boundaries at will, going at a rate of a four every over for the first five overs after lunch, with the highlight of that passage of play being Dravid's century. He miscued a pull from Gillespie's short ball, but had hit it hard enough for it go over the backward-square leg ropes for a six. Then Laxman reached his century as well, in the 89th over, with a single towards mid-wicket, his sixth in tests and his third against Australia, the earlier two being 167 and 281.|$|E
500|$|Side-crimped pasties {{gave rise}} to the {{suggestion}} that the miner might have eaten the pasty holding the <b>thick</b> <b>edge</b> of pastry, which was later discarded, thereby ensuring that his dirty fingers (possibly including traces of arsenic) did not touch food or his mouth. However, many old photographs show that pasties were wrapped in bags made of paper or muslin and were eaten from end-to-end; according to the earliest Cornish recipe book, published in 1929, this is [...] "the true Cornish way" [...] to eat a pasty. Another theory suggests that pasties were marked at one end with an initial and then eaten from the other end so that if not finished in one go, they could easily be reclaimed by their owners.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{conditions}} {{conducive to}} swing bowling, New Zealand's captain, Tiffen, chose to bat first {{after winning the}} toss. England opened the bowling with seam from one end, provided by Katherine Brunt, and spin at the other, from Isa Guha. Brunt's bowling spell was described by the BBC's Aimee Lewis as [...] "superb", and teammate Shaw credited her with putting the New Zealand batsmen under pressure. New Zealand progressed to 46 {{for the loss of}} just the opener Pulford, before England made their first bowling change. The England vice-captain, Shaw, was brought on, and made an immediate impact. From her third ball, Bates mistimed an attempted loft over mid-on, and was caught by Atkins. The following ball, Satterthwaite fell for a duck, edging an outswinging delivery to the wicket-keeper, Sarah Taylor. Four overs later, Tiffen was also dismissed by Shaw, providing a <b>thick</b> <b>edge</b> to Sarah Taylor. Although middle-order batsmen McGlashan and Mason both got starts, New Zealand collapsed to 101 for seven. Doolan joined Browne at the crease, and the pair provided their side with some degree of a recovery: Doolan scored 48 runs in a partnership of 63 to help New Zealand to their total of 166. After the dismissal of Doolan, who was stumped off a wide delivery, New Zealand subsided rapidly, losing their final two wickets for just two more runs. The New Zealand Herald criticised the batting as being [...] "indifferent", but Richards credited England for their [...] "tight bowling and fielding" [...] to restrict New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|In the Fifth Test Max O'Connell called [...] "over" [...] {{and turned}} to walk to square leg after Snow bowled the last ball of the first over. As a result he missed Alan Knott {{catching}} Keith Stackpole and {{had to give him}} not out. This was his first over as an umpire in Test cricket and Snow 'could quite understand his actions which illustrate the pressure umpires are also under in a Test', {{and they were able to}} joke about it afterwards. In the Seventh Test Walters had to be stumped twice by Knott off Underwood as he was given not out by Rowan the first time when for 41, but was a few balls later by Max O'Connell on 42. Later in the match Keith Stackpole was caught off a <b>thick</b> <b>edge</b> by Alan Knott off Peter Lever on 13, but was given not out by Rowan, Illingworth said the decision [...] "was really unbelievable".|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{were set}} 223 {{to win and}} retain the Ashes and their hopes must have been high even after Snow yorked Ken Eastwood for a duck. Unfortunately for England Snow had to retire after two overs when he smashed {{his finger on the}} wooden {{boundary}} fence trying to catch a six off Keith Stackpole. He was taken to hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic to reconstruct his shattered finger bones. Stackpole was caught off a <b>thick</b> <b>edge</b> by Alan Knott off Peter Lever on 13, but was given not out, much to the disappointment of England skipper Ray Illingworth who said [...] "It was really unbelievable". Stackpole hit 2 sixes and 6 fours in his 67, but received little support {{as the rest of the}} team folded. Illingworth took 3/39 off 20 eight ball overs and accounted for Stackpole, Redpath and Greg Chappell, d'Oliveira took 2/15 and Underwood 2/28 on a spinning wicket and Australia were all out for 160 to lose by 62 runs. The last wicket was that of Terry Jenner caught by Keith Fletcher off Derek Underwood, after which the England team chaired Ray Illingworth off the field in celebration.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybridization of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Fuzzy edge detector. The edge detector {{is used as}} the initial population and as the objective function. The purpose of hybridizing the algorithm {{is to create an}} optimized edge detector. Classical Fuzzy Heuristics (CFH) detects <b>thick</b> <b>edges.</b> These <b>thick</b> <b>edges</b> need to be optimized to obtain a thin line. In this research the PSO is used to optimize the edge detection detected by the CFH algorithm and it is referred to as FHPSO. The test images are radiographs images of the metacarpal. These images have been used, because {{there is a need to}} detect strong and thin edges. Radiograph images are noisy in nature, which makes it difficult to measure the cortical thickness, the cortical outline of the inner cortical and outer cortical of the long tubular bone. The outer cortical edges are considered to be the strong edges due to high discontinuity values and the inner cortical edges are considered weak edges due to low their discontinuity values. The performance of FHPSO in detecting edges has been shown to be quite efficient...|$|R
2500|$|The end {{looked to}} be even more abrupt than people could think before the third day had started. However, a no-ball-aided {{recovery}} and some fine batting from wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud, who surpassed Aftab Ahmed's score, sent the match into a slow-death period. Anwar Hossain and Khaled Mashud did, however, manage to put on 58 together for the ninth wicket, Bangladesh's best partnership of the match. Simon Jones eventually broke through the defences, though, as Anwar Hossain Monir got a standard <b>thick</b> <b>edge</b> to first slip Trescothick, and thus the ninth wicket fell – 156 for 9. An over later, Khaled Mashud was finally out, giving an awkward edge off Andrew Flintoff's bowling to Graham Thorpe at short leg and ending the innings on 159 all out – giving England an innings and 261 run win just before noon, half an hour before lunch, on the third day. Interestingly, Gareth Batty – England's spin-bowler, who came in to replace the injured Ashley Giles – was only mentioned on the official scorecard once, as he did not bat, did not bowl, and did not hold a catch. Trescothick was named man of the match for his 194.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{sandwich}} double-patch {{technique was}} adopted {{as an alternative}} method for reconstruction of the left ventricle after excision of postinfarction dysfunctional myocardium to solve technical problems due to the <b>thick</b> <b>edges</b> of the ventricular wall. Methods Over a 5 -year period, 12 of 21 patients with postinfarction antero-apical left ventricular aneurysm had <b>thick</b> wall <b>edges</b> after wall excision. It was due to akinetic muscular thick tissue in 6 cases, while in the other 6 with classic fibrous aneurysm, <b>thick</b> <b>edges</b> remained after the cut of the border zone. The ventricular opening was sandwiched between two patches {{and this is a}} technique which is currently used for the treatment of the interventricular septum rupture. In our patients the patches are much smaller than the removed aneurysm and they were sutured simply by a single row of single stitches. However, in contrast to interventricular septum rupture where the patches loosen the tension of the tissues, in our patients the patches pull strongly and restrain the walls by fastening their edges and supporting tight stitches. In this way they could narrow the cavity and close the ventricle. Results The resected area varied from 5 × 4 to 8 × 8 cm. Excision was extended into the interventricular septum in 5 patients, thus opening the right ventricle. CABG was performed on all patients but two. Left ventricular volumes and the ejection fraction changed significantly: end-systolic volume 93. 5 ± 12. 4 to 57. 8 ± 8. 9 ml, p Conclusion The double-patch sandwich technique (bi-patch closure) offers some advantages and does not result in increased morbidity and mortality. In the case of excising a left ventricular aneurysm, this technique in no way requires eversion of the edges, felt strips, buttressed and multiple sutures, all of which are needed for longitudinal linear closure. Moreover, it does not require purse string sutures, endocardial scar remnant to secure the patch or folding the excluded non-functional tissue, all of which are needed for endoventricular patch repair. </p...|$|R
