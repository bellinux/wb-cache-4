5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E

5|$|A {{motto is}} a short phrase usually {{appearing}} below the shield as a statement of belief.

Fifty Egyptians surrendered at Mutanah, near Humaidat. They were eventually allowed to evacuate to San'a with <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b> Mohamed's policy was to keep officers as prisoners for exchange, and to allow soldiers to go in return for <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b> Three to five thousand Egyptian troops in garrisons on the eastern slopes of the mountains and in the desert now had to be supplied entirely by air.|$|E

5|$|Archpriests {{and priests}} {{would use a}} less ornate mantle in <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> and an ecclesiastical hat of the style they wear liturgically. Although an Orthodox monk (not an abbot) {{displaying}} personal arms is rare, a hieromonk (monk who has been ordained a priest) would appropriately display a monastic hat (klobuk) and a black cloak or veil suggestive of his attire, and a hierodeacon (monastic deacon) would display an orarion behind the shield.|$|E
5|$|Before Wilhelm, the knuckleball was {{primarily}} mixed in to older pitchers' repertoires {{at the end}} of their careers to offset their slowing fastballs and to reduce stress on <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> thereby extending their careers. Wilhelm broke with tradition when he began throwing the pitch as a teenager and threw it nearly every pitch. The New York Times linked his knuckleball with that of modern pitcher R.A. Dickey, as Wilhelm taught pitcher Charlie Hough the knuckleball in 1971, and Hough taught it to Dickey while coaching with the Texas Rangers.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen on the arms of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes. Except for cardinals of the Roman Curia, most cardinals head an archdiocese and use an archiepiscopal cross on <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b> Other cardinals use a simple Latin cross, as {{is found in the}} arms of Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is not an archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|Burnham and Armstrong leapt {{over the}} dead Mlimo {{and ran down}} a trail toward their horses.

The two men escaped and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and made peace with the rebels, ending the Second Matabele War.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day, 29 November, the garrison's water supply had been exhausted. The {{walls of the}} fort had also collapsed and the garrison was exposed, leading to further casualties amongst the Nepali troops. Seeing the disheartened state of men, the Captain and other officers asked them to sign a pledge {{to fight to the}} last. Eighty-four soldiers signed. However, that night the Mleccha Kalanala Company, which had arrived as reinforcements and was stationed at a portico east of Nalapani, secretly abandoned their post, taking with them <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> and colours. Seeing this, some of the men who had signed the pledge followed. The 50 or 60 men that remained, overcome by the hopelessness of the situation, felt that instead of confronting certain death by remaining in the fort, it was better to escape to the hills and hold their position there. Perhaps unable to convince their commanders with words, the escaping men caught hold of their Captain and other officers by <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> and dragged them away from the fort. Learning of this new movement, the British renewed their fire; but the Nepalese managed to cut through and make a successful escape.|$|E

50|$|In many {{football}} games, {{the play}} clock is {{managed by the}} back judge who is positioned behind the defense and faces the quarterback. When the play clock counts down to 5 seconds remaining, some back judges will raise <b>their</b> <b>arm</b> over <b>their</b> head to warn the quarterback, and rotate <b>their</b> <b>arm</b> downward to <b>their</b> leg, counting down the final seconds. A penalty flag for delay is thrown afterward. The infraction typically results in a five-yard penalty.|$|R

5|$|Each of Sweden's 21 {{counties}} (län), 25 provinces (landskap) and 290 municipalities (kommun) {{has its own}} coat of arms. The Instrument of Government (1634) {{introduced the}} modern counties of Sweden, superseding the 25 medieval provinces. Although many of these counties {{have been the subject}} of more recent reforms, many of them occupy broadly similar regions. (See comparative maps at Counties of Sweden.) Most of the counties that have remained largely intact (Dalarna, Gotland, Skåne, Södermanland, Uppsala, Värmland, etc.) retain the respective province's coat of arms, while the redistricting of other lands has been reflected heraldically (e.g. the newly created Gävleborgs län, occupying parts of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, bears <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> quarterly). By royal decree on 18 January 1884, King Oscar II granted all provinces the rights to the rank of duchy and to display <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> with a ducal coronet. While more exhaustive lists can be found elsewhere, this article only discusses the arms of a few of these regions, selected for their heraldic notability. The arms of Gotland, Västerbotten, Uppland, Södermanland, Skåne and Lappland will be considered here in further detail.|$|E
