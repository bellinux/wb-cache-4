I wanted it to look as phony as possible, I wanted the clouds to go one direction, the {{mountains}} to go one direction, the horses to go over there, cause I want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> this is The Hunger Games. I want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{this is the type of}} imagery that's been presented to all of us. And the only difference is a black dude in the middle of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Keith Devlin says (Devlin 2003), [...] "By {{opening his}} door, Monty {{is saying to}} the {{contestant}} 'There are two doors you did not choose, and {{the probability that the}} prize is behind one of them is [...] I'll help you by using my knowledge of where the prize is to open one of those two doors <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it does not hide the prize. You can now take advantage of this additional information. Your choice of door A has a chance of 1 in 3 of being the winner. I have not changed that. But by eliminating door C, I have shown you that the probability that door B hides the prize is 2 in 3.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't ask me, Isobel!" [...] I said. [...] "We {{all make}} {{mistakes}} sometime, you know. Not <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> story {{when you asked}} me was one of mine." ...|$|E
60|$|Again, as thou sawest the damsel {{sprinkle}} {{the room with}} water, upon which it was cleansed with pleasure; this is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>that</b> when the Gospel comes in the sweet and precious influences thereof to the heart, then, I say, even as thou sawest the damsel lay the dust by sprinkling the floor with water, so is sin vanquished and subdued, and the soul made clean, through the faith of it, and consequently fit for the King of glory to inhabit (John 15:3; Eph. 5:26; Acts 15:9; Rom. 16:25, 26; John 15:13).|$|R
6000|$|INTER. The Interpreter answered, [...] "This parlor is {{the heart}} of a man that was never made pure by the sweet grace of the Gospel. The dust is his sin, and inward evils that have defiled the whole man. He that began to sweep at first is the law; but she that brought water, and did {{sprinkle}} it, is the Gospel. Now, whereas thou sawest that, as soon as the first began to sweep, the dust did fly so about that the room could not by him be cleansed, but that thou wast almost choked therewith; this is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>that</b> the law, instead of cleansing the heart (by its working) from sin, doth revive, put strength into, and increase it in the soul, even as it doth discover and forbid it, for it doth not give power to overcome. Again, as thou sawest the girl sprinkle the room with water, upon which it was cleansed with ease; this is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>that</b> when the Gospel comes, in the sweet and gracious power thereof, to the heart, then, I say, even as thou sawest the maiden lay the dust by sprinkling the floor with water, so is sin vanquished and subdued, and the soul made clean through the faith of it, and, consequently, fit for the King of Glory to dwell in." ...|$|R
60|$|INTER. The {{man whose}} picture this is, {{is one of}} a thousand; he can beget {{children}} (1 Cor. 4:15), travail in birth with children (Gal. 4;19), and nurse them himself when they are born. And whereas thou seest him with his eves lift up to Heaven, the best of books in his hand, and the law of truth writ on his lips, it is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>that</b> his work is to know and unfold dark things to sinners; even as also thou seest him stand as if he pleaded with men; and whereas thou seest the world as cast behind him, and that a crown hangs over his head, <b>that</b> is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> slighting and despising the things that are present, for the love that he hath to his Master's service, he is sure in the world that comes next to have glory for his reward. Now, said the Interpreter, I have <b>showed</b> <b>thee</b> this picture first, because the man whose picture this is, is the only man whom the Lord of the place whither thou art going, hath authorized to be thy guide in all difficult places thou mayest meet with in the way; wherefore, take good heed to what I have <b>showed</b> <b>thee,</b> and bear well in thy mind what thou hast seen, lest in thy journey thou meet with some that pretend to lead thee right, but their way goes down to death.|$|R

5000|$|According to Adam Curtis the {{production}} is [...] "the {{story of an}} enchanted world that was built by American power as it became supreme...and how those living in that dream world responded to it". He has also said; [...] "it’s trying <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the way <b>you</b> feel about yourself {{and the way you}} feel about the world today is a political product of the ideas of that time”. According to Curtis: ...|$|R
6000|$|INTER. The {{man whose}} picture this is, {{is one of}} a {{thousand}}. He can say, {{in the words of the}} apostle Paul, [...] "Though ye have ten thousand teachers in Christ, yet have you not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have been your father through the Gospel." [...] And whereas thou seest him with his eyes lifted up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, and the law of truth writ on his lips, it is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> his work is to know and unfold dark things to sinners; even as also thou seest him stand as if he pleaded with men. And whereas thou seest the world is cast behind him, and that a crown hangs over his head; <b>that</b> is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that,</b> slighting and despising the things that are in the world, for the love that he hath to his Master's service, he is sure in the world that comes next to have glory for his reward. Now, said the Interpreter, I have <b>showed</b> <b>thee</b> this picture first, because the man whose picture this is, is the only man whom the Lord of the place whither thou art going hath chosen to be thy guide, in all difficult places thou mayest meet with in thy way; wherefore take good heed to what I have <b>showed</b> <b>thee,</b> and bear well in thy mind what thou hast seen, lest in thy journey thou meet with some that pretend to lead thee right, but their way goes down to death.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't say," [...] I answered, [...] "at {{least in}} words.

Mark, it is water, water of life, pure water of life, and clear as crystal. These words, 'pure' and 'clear,' and that as 'crystal,' they are added upon a double account.
