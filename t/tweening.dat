5|$|In 1983, Nolan Bushnell {{founded a}} new computer-guided {{animation}} studio called Kadabrascope as {{a subsidiary of}} his Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatres company, {{which was founded in}} 1977. Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas movie for NBC starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots. The animation movement would be made using <b>Tweening</b> instead of traditional cel animation. After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) would be sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope would be sold to LucasFilm. The Kadabrascope assets would be combined with the Computer Division of LucasFilm. Coincidentally, Steve Jobs, a main Apple shareholder and former CEO, worked under Bushnell in 1973 as a technician at his other company Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in 1976 to focus on PTT. PTT would later go bankrupt in 1985 and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} on <b>tweening</b> {{is used by}} a very successful and well-known bowler, Pete Weber, who is considered a power stroker. This term refers to a bowler who relies on a high backswing and open shoulders to generate potential ball speed and a big hook, but uses the timing of a stroker. It {{can also be used}} to describe a stroker with a high rev rate, or a cranker with an unusually smooth release. A power stroker's release is both smooth and powerful, generating many revolutions via a wrist snap or flick of the fingers, without muscling the armswing. Some other famous power strokers include Bryan Goebel, Wes Malott, Doug Kent (often considered a tweener), and Chris Barnes (often considered a stroker).|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons was {{the first}} {{successful}} animated program in American prime time since Wait Till Your Father Gets Home in the 1970s. During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. The Simpsons changed this perception, initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like Capitol Critters, Fish Police, and Family Dog, which were expensive and unsuccessful. The Simpsons use of Korean animation studios for <b>tweening,</b> coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of The Simpsons and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other animated series. This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as South Park, Family Guy, King of the Hill, Futurama and The Critic. For Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, [...] "The Simpsons created an audience for prime-time animation {{that had not been}} there for many, many years... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium." ...|$|E

50|$|When animating in {{a digital}} context, the {{shortened}} term <b>tweening</b> is commonly used, and the resulting sequence of frames is called a tween. Sophisticated animation software enables the animator to specify objects in an image and define how they should move and change during the <b>tweening</b> process. Software {{may be used to}} manually render or adjust transitional frames by hand, or may be used to automatically render transitional frames using interpolation of graphic parameters. The free software program Synfig specializes in automated <b>tweening.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The current {{version of}} ScreenCam builds and edits {{interactive}} software demonstrations, simulations, podcasts, screencasts, and program demos. For software demos, it records in real time using a proprietary capture algorithm that captures a sequence of still images and then builds mouse movement simulations to create {{the appearance of a}} running program. By using Adobe Flash <b>Tweening</b> technology, ScreenCam is able to create screencasts in a smaller filesize than by using typical video compression technology. In particular, the system can use <b>tweening</b> to simulate cursor movement without needing to use delta-frame CODECs on the entire video frame.|$|E
50|$|Twixt was a 3D {{computer}} animation system created in 1984 by Julian Gomez at Sun Microsystems. It featured keyframes and <b>tweening</b> in a track-based graphical interface, and {{was capable of}} realtime wireframe playback.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{method of}} {{animation}} {{is that of}} <b>tweening.</b> This means that the user specifies the position, orientation and colour {{of the first and}} last frames of an animation and the computer fills in all the intermediate positions.|$|E
50|$|Trimension is a framerate {{enhancement}} software by Philips for video, primarily DVD. The software utilizes both {{picture and}} stream information to render new frames between the original frames of video (<b>tweening),</b> thus increasing the framerate and enhancing the smoothness of motion.|$|E
50|$|Though {{animations}} can {{be created}} easily using Custom Animations provided in Microsoft PowerPoint, it may be much more tedious to complete a project in PowerPoint than in professional animation programs such as Adobe Flash due {{to the absence of}} key frames and <b>tweening</b> in the former.|$|E
5000|$|The {{goal of the}} {{developers}} {{is to create a}} program that is capable of producing [...] "feature-film quality animation with fewer people and resources." [...] The program offers an alternative to manual <b>tweening</b> so that the animator does not have to draw each and every frame.|$|E
50|$|Animating {{the object}} is similar to motion <b>tweening</b> in Macromedia Flash. A {{keyframe}} is created with the object in the desired position. A second keyframe is then created and {{the object is}} moved to the new desired position. One can then preview this with the convenient Preview button.|$|E

According to one of its project websites, the rules of Dogman 99 are: [...] "No Wacom tablet, no scanning, pure RGB colors only, only fake <b>tweening,</b> and as many alpha tricks as possible".|$|E
50|$|Framerate {{enhancement}} {{can provide}} an interesting benefit if it is performed after upscaling. If the picture is scaled to a high-definition resolution and then tweened, the tweened frames will have motion {{that exists in the}} high-definition space even though the actual picture resolution does not. It is unclear whether available implementations of Trimension scale before or after <b>tweening.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inbetweening or <b>tweening</b> is {{the process}} of {{generating}} intermediate frames between two images to give the appearance that the first image evolves smoothly into the second image. Inbetweens are the drawings between the key frames which help to create the illusion of motion. Inbetweening is a key process in all types of animation, including computer animation.|$|E

5000|$|Foldes later {{moved to}} Paris, {{where he became}} an early pioneer in {{computer}} animation. Foldes {{was one of the}} first animators to use the <b>Tweening</b> method. In the 1960s, he worked for the Research Service of the ORTF. He is one of the pioneers of computer animation with his film Hunger, which received the Jury Prize in the [...] "short film" [...] category at Cannes Film Festival as well as an Academy Award nomination.|$|E
5000|$|Kent {{began his}} {{programming}} career in 1983 with Island Graphics Inc. where {{he wrote the}} Aegis Animator program for the Amiga home computer. This program combined polygon <b>tweening</b> in 3D with simple 2D cel-based animation. In 1985 he founded and ran a software company, Dancing Flame, which adapted the Aegis Animator to the Atari ST, and created Cyber Paint for that machine. Cyber Paint was a 2D animation program that brought together {{a wide variety of}} animation and paint functionality and the delta-compressed animation format developed for CAD-3D. The user could move freely between animation frames and paint arbitrarily, or utilize various animation tools for automatic <b>tweening</b> movement across frames. Cyber Paint was one of the first, if not the first, consumer program that enabled the user to paint across time in a compressed digital video format. Later he developed a similar program, the Autodesk Animator for PC compatibles, where the image compression improved to the point it could play off of hard disk, and one could paint using [...] "inks" [...] that performed algorithmic transformations such as smoothing, transparency, and tiled patterns. The Autodesk Animator was used to create artwork {{for a wide variety of}} video games.|$|E

50|$|For 3D animations, objects (models) {{are built}} on the {{computer}} monitor (modeled) and 3D figures are rigged with a virtual skeleton. For 2D figure animations, separate objects (illustrations) and separate transparent layers are used with or without that virtual skeleton. Then the limbs, eyes, mouth, clothes, etc. of the figure are moved by the animator on key frames. The differences in appearance between key frames are automatically calculated by the computer in {{a process known as}} <b>tweening</b> or morphing. Finally, the animation is rendered.|$|E
50|$|Elements of {{a motion}} {{graphics}} project can be animated by various means, {{depending on the}} capabilities of the software. These elements may be in the form of art, text, photos, and video clips, to name a few. The most popular form of animation is keyframing, in which properties of an object can be specified at certain points in time by setting a series of keyframes so that the properties of the object can be automatically altered (or tweened) in the frames between keyframes. Another method involves a behavior system such as is found in Apple Motion that controls these changes by simulating natural forces without requiring the more rigid but precise keyframing method. Yet another method involves the use of formulas or scripts, such as the expressions function in Adobe After Effects or the creation of ActionScripts within Adobe Flash. Computers are capable of calculating and randomizing changes in imagery to create the illusion of motion and transformation. Computer animations can use less information space (computer memory) by automatically <b>tweening,</b> a process of rendering the key changes of an image at a specified or calculated time. These key poses or frames are commonly referred to as keyframes or low CP. Adobe Flash uses computer animation <b>tweening</b> as well as frame-by-frame animation and video.|$|E
5000|$|Going further, orientations (rotations) {{of objects}} and parts of objects can be {{interpolated}} as well as parts of complete characters. This process mimics that used in early cartoon films. Master animators would draw key frames of the film, then, junior animators would draw the in-between frames. This is called inbetweening or <b>tweening</b> and the overall process is called [...] "key frame animation". To make these motions appear realistic, interpolation algorithms have been sought which follow, or approximate real life motion dynamics. This applies to things such as the motion of arms and legs from frame to frame, or the motion of all parts of a face, given {{the motion of the}} important, key points of the face. Defining the motion of key strands of hair, spread around an animal, can be made into full fur. Using custom algorithms, motions with unique, unnatural and entertaining visual characteristics can be formed. The color of an object can be defined by key color-locations or frames allowing the computation of smooth color gradients around an object or varying in time. Algorithms such as the Kochanek-Bartels spline provide additional adjustment parameters which allow customizing the in-between behavior to suit a wide variety of situations. The article on <b>tweening</b> currently demonstrates several of these.|$|E
50|$|Animator {{gave the}} ability to do frame-by-frame {{animation}} (creating each frame as an individual picture, much like traditional cel animation). Animator Studio also had <b>tweening</b> features (transforming one shape into another by letting the computer draw each in-between shape onto a separate frame). Animator and Animator Pro supported FLI and FLC animation file formats, while Animator Studio also supported the AVI format. Animator was particular strong in Palette based editing, effects (like Color cycling) and animations a favoured technology in the time of indexed CGA and VGA graphics modes.|$|E
50|$|The Flash 4 Linux {{project was}} an {{initiative}} {{to develop an}} open source Linux application {{as an alternative to}} Adobe Animate. Development plans included authoring capacity for 2D animation, and <b>tweening,</b> as well as outputing SWF file formats. F4L evolved into an editor that was capable of authoring 2D animation and publishing of SWF files. Flash 4 Linux was renamed UIRA. UIRA intended to combine the resources and knowledge of the F4L project and the Qflash project, both of which were Open Source applications that aimed to provide an alternative to the proprietary Adobe Flash.|$|E
50|$|Once the key {{animation}} is approved, {{the lead}} animator forwards {{the scene on}} to the clean-up department, {{made up of the}} clean-up animators and the inbetweeners. The clean-up animators take the lead and assistant animators' drawings and trace them onto a new sheet of paper, taking care in including all of the details present on the original model sheets, so that it appears that one person animated the entire film. The inbetweeners will draw in whatever frames are still missing in between the other animators' drawings. This procedure is called <b>tweening.</b> The resulting drawings are again pencil-tested and sweatboxed until they meet approval.|$|E
50|$|Clutter allows {{implicit}} animations {{of every}} {{item on the}} canvas using special objects called behaviours: each behaviour {{can be applied to}} multiple actors, and multiple behaviours can be composed on the same actor. Behaviours handle animations implicitly: the developer specifies the initial and final states, the time (or number of frames) needed to complete the animation, the function of time to be used (linear, sine wave, exponential, etc.), and the behaviour will take care of the <b>tweening.</b> Clutter provides a generic base class for developers to implement custom behaviours, and various simple classes handling simple properties, like opacity, position on the Z axis (depth), position along a path, rotation, etc.|$|E

50|$|The engine {{supported}} {{loading of}} 3D {{models in the}} DTS and DIF file formats. DTS models were typically used for characters and vehicles though occasionally for buildings and interiors. They could be animated using either skeletal or morph target animation. It was also possible to blend multiple skeletal animations together by playing them simultaneously or automatically <b>tweening</b> the different positions of bones in the skeleton. DIF models have pre-calculated lighting and as such are ill-suited for animation. Instead, they were used for buildings and interiors. They automatically had bounding boxes that perfectly match the visible geometry.
