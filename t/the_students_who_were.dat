5|$|The {{miniature}} city project involved {{students from}} eighteen Springfield public high schools. <b>The</b> <b>students,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> learning construction and handicraft, built {{the city of}} about 1,200 structures {{under the supervision of}} their teachers. It consisted of 1,000 miniature houses, in several neighborhoods, and 200 other structures. The miniature buildings and houses were built according to standard construction plans, and lumber and building-materials companies donated items for the project. The buildings and homes were landscaped with real grass. Their interiors were furnished and decorated like a full-sized house or building. The buildings were scaled at one-half inch to the foot. Tiny Town, with water mains and electric lights, was laid out on streets like a real city.|$|E
5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> framed in the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} was called in, and tanks rolled down Ratchadamnoen Avenue and helicopters fired down at Thammasat University. A {{number of students}} commandeered buses and fire engines {{in an attempt to}} halt the progress of the tanks by ramming into them. With chaos on the streets, King Bhumibol opened the gates of Chitralada Palace to <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> being gunned down by the army. Despite orders from Thanom that the military action be intensified, army commander Kris Sivara had the army withdrawn from the streets.|$|E
25|$|Initially, upon {{accepting}} the State Counsellor position, she granted amnesty to <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> arrested for opposing the National Education Bill, and announced {{a creation of}} the commission on Rakhine state, which had a long record of persecution of the Muslim Rohingya minority. However, soon Aung San Suu Kyi's government did not manage with the ethnic conflicts in Shan and Kachin states, where thousands of refugees fled to China, and eventually the persecution of the Rohingya by the government forces escalated {{to the point that}} it is not uncommonly called a genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing. She has also refused to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, instead taking steps to issue ID cards for residency but no guarantees of citizenship.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} three weeks of the yarchei kallah the {{scholars}} seated in the first row reported on the Talmud treatise assigned for study during the preceding months; in the fourth week the other scholars and also some of the pupils were called upon. Discussions followed, and difficult passages were laid before the gaon, who also took a prominent part in the debates, and freely reproved any member of the college who was not up to the standard of scholarship. At the end of the yarchei kallah the gaon designated the Talmudic treatise which the members of the assembly were obliged to study in the months intervening until the next gathering took place. <b>The</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not given seats were exempt from this task, being free to choose a subject for study according to their needs.|$|E

500|$|Similar copycat crimes have {{occurred}} on the Georgia Tech campus. In late 2001, a group of Georgia Tech students calling itself the [...] "Caldwell Liberation Army" [...] stole 32 'T's from signs on 16 campus buildings {{over a period of}} two nights. <b>The</b> <b>students,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not caught, vandalized the signs to express their bitterness at being displaced from Caldwell Residence Hall while renovations were taking place. In February 2006, it was noticed that small vinyl 'T' stickers were being stolen from informational signs located around the Georgia Tech campus, creating confusion for visitors and new students. According to the Georgia Tech Student Government Association (SGA), 'T' thefts across campus cost the Institute over $100,000 from 2010–11. The SGA discouraged these thefts, which they emphasized did not constitute a true Georgia Tech tradition: [...] "The tradition is stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower – no other 'T's were ever a part of this tradition." [...] The campaign drew national press coverage.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{claims about}} how the flag was torn. Canal Zone Police Captain Gaddis Wall, {{who was in charge}} of the police at the scene, denies any American culpability. He claims that the Panamanian students stumbled and accidentally tore their own flag. David M. White, an apprentice telephone technician with the Panama Canal Company, stated that [...] "the police gripped <b>the</b> <b>students,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> four or five abreast, under the shoulders in the armpits and edged them forward. One of the students fell or tripped and I believe when he went down the old flag was torn." [...] However we must take into account that this is all hearsay.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{students}} who participated in the protest was Chrissie Hynde, future leader of The Pretenders, who was a sophomore at the time.

Casale was reportedly [...] "standing about [...] away" [...] from Allison Krause when she was shot, and was friends with her and another one of <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> killed. The shootings were the transformative moment for him and for the band, which became less of a pure joke and more a vehicle for social critique, albeit with a blackly humorous bent.|$|E

2500|$|The Initial {{classification}} stage lasted 1 to 2 {{weeks and}} processed the cadet and issued him his equipment. This was {{the stage where}} it would be decided whether the cadet would train as a navigator, bombardier, or pilot. The education and training stages were 9 weeks each. Each 9 week stage was divided into two 4.5 week (63 day) halves: a lower half and an upper half [...] The lower half was made up of students just beginning the stage and the upper half was made up of <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> half-finished. The more experienced cadets would (hopefully) help the new cadets get through the section before they were promoted to the next stage.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2006, it was {{announced}} that {{a small percentage of the}} SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers' being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2006 on behalf of the 4,411 students who received an incorrect score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when the College Board and Pearson Educational Measurement, the company that scored the SATs, announced they would pay $2.85 million into a settlement fund. Under the agreement each student could either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she felt the damage was greater. A similar scoring error occurred on a secondary school admission test in 2010–2011 when the ERB (Educational Records Bureau) announced after the admission process was over that an error had been made in the scoring of the tests of 2010 (17%) of the students who had taken the Independent School Entrance Examination for admission to private secondary schools for 2011. Commenting on the effect of the error on students' school applications in The New York Times, David Clune, President of the ERB stated [...] "It is a lesson we all learn at some point—that life isn't fair." ...|$|E

60|$|Thus, {{either from}} the {{circumstances}} of his birth, or the natural melancholy of his disposition, Esmond came to live very much by himself during his stay at the University, having neither ambition enough to distinguish himself in the college career, nor caring to mingle with the mere pleasures and boyish frolics of <b>the</b> <b>students,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were,</b> for the most part, two or three years younger than he. He fancied that the gentlemen of the common-room of his college slighted him on account of his birth, and hence kept aloof from their society. It may be that he made the ill will, which he imagined came from them, by his own behavior, which, as he looks back on it in after life, he now sees was morose and haughty. At any rate, he was as tenderly grateful for kindness as he was susceptible of slight and wrong; and, lonely as he was generally, yet had one or two very warm friendships for his companions of those days.|$|E

The day was sultry, and we fully enjoyed the transition. In this part of Germany the postilions are no laggards, and we trotted merrily across the wide plain, reaching Bonn long before it was time to refresh ourselves.

Brooks advanced up the laboratory, smacking down a couple of guinea-pigs at each table. The rest of the class, scenting the prey from afar, came crowding in by the lecture theatre door, and the discussion perished abruptly as <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not already in their places hurried to them to secure the choice of a specimen. There was a noise of keys rattling on split rings as lockers were opened and dissecting instruments taken out.
