Having dignity is something you work on your whole life, in how you treat people and how you treat yourself. I hope I always strive to have it."

The song moves towards a more reproachful tone as Björk sings, [...] "You just ain't receiving / Your phone is off the hook / Your doors are shut", tempered by the recognition <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> [...] "twist your head around you" [...] because [...] "love is all around you". This is musically effected by Björk's vocals as she sings the lyric [...] "All is full of love" [...] in counterpoint with herself.|$|E

Microsoft intended the rules to be [...] "flexible", and, because it was unilateral, the license was legally unable to reduce rights. However, machinima artists, such as Edgeworks Entertainment, protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's fictional universes (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works. Compounding the reaction was the license's statement, [...] "If you do any of these things, you can expect to hear from Microsoft's lawyers who will tell you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop distributing your items right away." ...|$|E

500|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} are two important themes in Little Busters!. The opening {{video of the}} visual novel starts with two lines written in English: [...] "What 'Adolescence' do you have?" [...] and [...] "Do you remember 'Childhood'?". Riki Naoe, the male protagonist, has four childhood friends with whom he grew up together through adolescence and still hangs out with when the story begins. Thus, friendship is another theme presented {{in the form of}} Riki's relationships with his friends in high school, and is thought to be irreplaceable. The opening video of the original visual novel contains a third line written in English, [...] "The irreplaceable one existed there," [...] though another line was added into the opening video of Little Busters! Ecstasy: [...] "This will remind you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> recollect 'Adolescence'." ...|$|E

Two songs from The Joshua Tree, [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] and [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared", {{focused on the}} foreign policy of the United States. In describing [...] "Exit", Bono said [...] "It is all very well to address America and the violence that is an aggressive foreign policy but to really understand <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get under the skin of your own darkness, the violence we all contain within us. Violence is something I have quite a bit about. I have a side of me which, in a corner, can be very violent. It's the least attractive thing in anyone and I wanted to own up to that." ...|$|E

[...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's afraid of what somebody else might do {{as a result of his}} work?

500|$|Little {{is known}} of this period of Alkan's life, other than that apart from {{composing}} he was immersed {{in the study of}} the Bible and the Talmud. Throughout this period Alkan continued his correspondence with Ferdinand Hiller, whom he had probably met in Paris in the 1830s, and with Masarnau, from which some insights can be gained. It appears that Alkan completed a full translation into French, now lost, of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, from their original languages. In 1865, he wrote to Hiller: [...] "Having translated a good deal of the Apocrypha, I'm now onto the second Gospel which I am translating from the Syriac... In starting to translate the New Testament, I was suddenly struck by a singular idea– <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be Jewish to be able to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{was chosen}} as the showrunner for the series by Killen. Gordon commended the pilot script at first glance. Gordon {{originally}} read the script on a flight to New York City. [...] "I read the pilot, and once I got past my envy, I was struck by the voice," [...] he stated. [...] "So few writers have real voices. Kyle is disarmingly self-effacing; and at the same time, he's disarmingly confident. It's that duality thing: On the one hand, he's open; on the other, he's closed." [...] Gordon later compared the television series to The Good Wife. He said that The Good Wife has so many procedural aspects <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> decide which format to use each week. He compared it to Awake, saying, then, [...] "What makes an Awake episode?" [...] "Pilot" [...] was written by Killen, and directed by David Slade.|$|E

500|$|Stylistically, {{the album}} has been {{described}} by Allrovi's Jason Lymangrover as ranging [...] "from Frank Sinatra pop to psychedelic garage rock"; while The Boston Globe James Reed has noted the [...] "spare" [...] sound of [...] "Scalinatella" [...] and the [...] "furious and rocking" [...] pace of [...] "Urlo Negro". Although wanting to remain faithful to the original versions of the songs covered, Patton wished to avoid simply mimicking the original recordings, stating [...] "this is a record of covers, and I believe firmly <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make them your own. There is a very fine line to tread. You have to treat a song with respect, yet twist it up, fuck it up and somehow make it a part of your own voice".

However, she declined to take part in the project.|$|E
500|$|Between 25 January and 29 January, Thomas {{was interviewed}} four times {{by members of}} the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and {{by members of the}} Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), {{accompanied}} by Pakistani officials. During one of these interviews, a Pakistani official said to Thomas [...] "we told you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> prove it... that you are not a terrorist... you have to prove it that you are an innocent man and why you are sitting here." [...] Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of Lahore, where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as [...] "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information on Al Qaeda figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed. Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife. Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.|$|E
500|$|There was one vice-presidential {{debate between}} Congresswoman Ferraro and Vice President George H. W. Bush. Held on , {{the result was}} proclaimed mostly even by the press and historians; women voters tended to think Ferraro had won, while men, Bush. At it, Ferraro criticized Reagan's initial refusal to support an {{extension}} to the Voting Rights Act. Her experience was questioned at the debate and she was asked how her three terms in Congress stacked up with Bush's extensive government experience. To one Bush statement she said, [...] "Let me just say first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> teach me about foreign policy." [...] She strongly defended her position on abortion, which earned her applause and a respectful reply from her opponent. In {{the days leading up}} to the debate, Second Lady of the United States Barbara Bush had publicly referred to Ferraro as [...] "that four-million-dollar—I can't say it, but it rhymes with 'rich'." [...] Barbara Bush soon apologized.|$|E

500|$|Kyla was {{involved}} in three romantic relationships during her time in the show, {{the first of which}} was with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards). Ayola said of the relationship: [...] "She hasn't got great taste in men! She likes good-looking blokes - that whole 'take me to a cave' thing - but she doesn't check that there is a soft, gentle, sensitive side to him. He's gorgeous to look at, but she hasn't learned <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look a bit deeper." [...] Roger Griffiths was cast as Kyla's ex-husband Harvey. Ayola commented on their previous relationship: [...] "I think they split up because Kyla is so volatile. The more we learn about Harvey the more I think he might not be the reason for their split". She expanded: [...] "They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which got too much for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla and she just ends up yelling at him. It's a very difficult and if he knew how to handle her maybe it could work out but he doesn't." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Web Weirdos" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story {{developed}} by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Dick Grunert. According to Ward, the original outline for the episode was [...] "super-sitcomy" [...] and [...] "standard". Castuera and Moynihan, however, {{were able to}} transform it into something different. In the DVD commentory for the episode, Castuera noted that she enjoys physical comedy, whereas Moynihan likes focusing on emotion. She contended that this episode is therefore epitomic of their differing storyboarding sensibilities. For instance, {{the first half of}} the episode (storyboarded by Castuera) begins with Finn and Jake partaking in parkour, whereas the second part of the episode (storyboarded by Moynihan) focuses more on Barb and Ed's relationship. According to Moynihan, much of his storyboard material was inspired by experiences he had had at couples therapy with a former girlfriend. He noted that for him, the episode was based on the idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have empathy for your partner.|$|E
500|$|The rivalry, {{which is}} the oldest in the sport, is fueled by history, competitiveness, and {{cultural}} implication. Both schools {{are located in the}} state of Maryland, a historical hotbed for lacrosse, and have traditionally been two of the sport's powerhouses. Many of the opposing players have had past associations in grade school, high school, or youth club sports. Hopkins' current coach and former player Dave Pietramala said, [...] "Everybody knew each other; we had all played together at some point or another. It was a fierce, intense game and there was no love lost on the field." [...] Additionally, Johns Hopkins is a private university, while Maryland is a public institution. Former Terrapins coach Dick Edell said:"To get the juices flowing before the game, [...] kids that it was the blue-collar guys against the future executives—that this was their only chance to get them before they got into the real world. Plus, you have all the kids who came from the same high school, or worked the camps together, so there was that closeness <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live with for the other 364 days, no matter who wins." ...|$|E

500|$|The motel {{scene with}} the bounty hunter and Dana Scully was shot on a sound stage in Vancouver, Canada in a simple motel room set. The scene {{featuring}} Scully being beaten up by the bounty hunter was primarily performed by a stunt woman. The stiletto weapon, {{often referred to as}} the [...] "gimlet", used by the bounty hunter was constructed from aluminium and acrylic, and activated by a pneumatic hose hidden in actor Brian Thompson's sleeve. The grunt Scully utters when thrown through a table was insisted on by Standards and Practices, giving the reasoning that the show needed to make it clear for the viewers that she was not dead. According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz it was an [...] "arcane, bizarre logic <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with when you're putting a show on network television." [...] As director Rob Bowman was dissatisfied with the first take of Skinner shoving X against the elevator wall, Mitch Pileggi and Steven Williams decided to do the stunt for real, and Pileggi did it with so much strength that it broke the back of the elevator scenery. Williams' background in fight choreography, stemming from his role in , allowed him to help in choreographing the brawl.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Ester Dean and Alexander Grant, with {{production}} helmed by Grant under his production name Alex da Kid. [...] "Farewell" [...] contains lyrics that revolve around saying goodbye to a lover who {{is not able to}} be physically present in the relationship for long periods of time. Instrumentation consists of a piano. The song was composed in the key of G major and set in common time signature, and has a moderately slow tempo of 88 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocals span from the low note of G3 to the high note of D5. [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine noted that the song's structure was similar to Beyoncé Knowles song [...] "Halo", while Priya Elan for NME wrote that the song was reminiscent of Rihanna's song [...] "Fire Bomb", from her fourth studio album, Rated R (2009). Lipshutz also noted that Rihanna delivered the bridge with [...] "powerhouse" [...] vocals. A reviewer for Flavour Magazine wrote that Rihanna displayed [...] "great vocals" [...] in the lyric [...] "Somebody's gonna miss you... Farewell." [...] Melissa Maerz for Entertainment Weekly wrote that Rihanna [...] "wails" [...] the lyrics [...] "'Even though it kills me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go/ I know I'd be sadder if you didn't hit the road." ...|$|E
500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go through everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E
