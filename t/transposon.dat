5|$|McClintock {{was widely}} {{credited}} with discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered {{the process in}} bacteria, yeast, and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition. In the 1970s, Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be Class II transposons. Ac is a complete <b>transposon</b> that can produce a functional transposase, which {{is required for the}} element to move within the genome. Ds has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, Ds cannot move in the absence of Ac. Spm has also been characterized as a <b>transposon.</b> Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution. McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, Ac/Ds is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.|$|E
25|$|Because non-retroviral {{approaches}} have demonstrated such low efficiency levels, researchers {{have attempted to}} effectively rescue the technique with {{what is known as}} the PiggyBac <b>Transposon</b> System. Several studies have demonstrated that this system can effectively deliver the key reprogramming factors without leaving footprint mutations in the host cell genome. The PiggyBac <b>Transposon</b> System involves the re-excision of exogenous genes, which eliminates the issue of insertional mutagenesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transposon</b> {{silencing}} {{is a form}} of transcriptional {{gene silencing}} targeting transposons. Transcriptional gene silencing is a product of histone modifications that prevent the transcription of a particular area of DNA. Transcriptional silencing of transposons is crucial to the maintenance of a genome. The “jumping” of transposons generates genomic instability and can cause extremely deleterious mutations. Transposable element insertions have been linked to many diseases including hemophilia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and predisposition to cancer. The silencing of transposons is therefore extremely critical in the germline in order to stop <b>transposon</b> mutations from developing and being passed on to the next generation. Additionally, these epigenetic defenses against transposons can be heritable. Studies in Drosophila, Arabidopsis thaliana, and mice all indicate that small interfering RNAs are responsible for <b>transposon</b> silencing. In animals, these siRNAS and piRNAs are most active in the gonads.|$|E

50|$|Currently <b>transposons</b> {{can be used}} in genetic {{research}} and recombinant genetic engineering for insertional mutagenesis. Insertional mutagenesis is when <b>transposons</b> function as vectors to help remove and integrate genetic sequences. Given their relatively simple design and inherent ability to move DNA sequences, <b>transposons</b> are highly compatible at transducing genetic material, making them ideal genetic tools.|$|R
25|$|While the Neurospora genome {{has very}} little {{repeated}} DNA, half of the methylation occurs in repeated DNA including <b>transposon</b> relics and centromeric DNA. The ability to evaluate other important phenomena in a DNA methylase-deficient genetic background makes Neurospora an important system in which to study DNA methylation.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, a {{study by}} Margaret Roth Woodhouse, Michael Freeling, and Damon Lisch {{identified}} a gene that inhibits the transcription of both transposons and paramuted color gens in maize (Woodhouse, 6). The gene, called Mediator of paramutation1 (Mop1), codes for an RNA-processing enzyme that is necessary for making the small RNAs {{that are responsible for}} silencing the <b>transposon</b> MuDR. A second gene, Mu killer (MuK), is then needed to establish heritable silencing (Gross, 1).|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} is {{a powerful}} transcriptional repressor, at least in CpG dense contexts. Transcriptional repression of protein-coding genes appears essentially limited to very specific classes of genes {{that need to be}} silent permanently and in almost all tissues. While DNA methylation does not have the flexibility required for the fine-tuning of gene regulation, its stability is perfect to ensure the permanent silencing of transposable elements. <b>Transposon</b> control is one the most ancient function of DNA methylation that is shared by animals, plants and multiple protists. It is even suggested that DNA methylation evolved precisely for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|The recent spurt in {{information}} on various plant-related processes {{has largely been}} {{a result of the}} revolution in molecular biology. Powerful techniques like mutagenesis and complementation were made possible in Arabidopsis thaliana via generation of T-DNA containing mutant lines, recombinant plasmids, techniques like <b>transposon</b> tagging etc. Availability of complete physical and genetic maps, RNAi vectors, and rapid transformation protocols are some of the technologies that have significantly altered the scope of the field. Recently, there has also been a massive increase in the genome and EST sequences of various non-model species, which, coupled with the bioinformatics tools existing today, generate opportunities in the field of plant evo-devo research.|$|E
25|$|Mutagenesis experiment: The {{direct method}} to {{investigate}} the DFE is to induce mutations and then measure the mutational fitness effects, which {{has already been done}} in viruses, bacteria, yeast, and Drosophila. For example, most studies of the DFE in viruses used site-directed mutagenesis to create point mutations and measure relative fitness of each mutant. In Escherichia coli, one study used <b>transposon</b> mutagenesis to directly measure the fitness of a random insertion of a derivative of Tn10. In yeast, a combined mutagenesis and deep sequencing approach has been developed to generate high-quality systematic mutant libraries and measure fitness in high throughput. However, given that many mutations have effects too small to be detected and that mutagenesis experiments can detect only mutations of moderately large effect; DNA sequence data analysis can provide valuable information about these mutations.|$|E
25|$|A {{function}} that appears even more conserved than <b>transposon</b> silencing is {{positively correlated with}} gene expression. In almost all species where DNA methylation is present, DNA methylation is especially enriched {{in the body of}} highly transcribed genes. The function of gene body methylation is not well understood. A body of evidence suggests that it could regulate splicing and suppress the activity of intragenic transcriptional units (cryptic promoters or transposable elements). Gene-body methylation appears closely tied to H3K36 methylation. In yeast and mammals, H3K36 methylation is highly enriched in the body of highly transcribed genes. In yeast at least, H3K36me3 recruits enzymes such as histone deacetylases to condense chromatin and prevent the activation of cryptic start sites. In mammals, DNMT3a and DNMT3b PWWP domain binds to H3K36me3 and the two enzymes are recruited to the body of actively transcribed genes.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, Baker {{left the}} National Institute of Health {{to work as}} an {{independent}} researcher at MIT. Here she discovered that mu <b>transposons</b> behave similarly to <b>transposons</b> and retrotransposons involved with bacterial resistance. Retrotransposons are <b>transposons</b> that first transcribe the moving gene sequence into RNA. This RNA then gets retro transcribed back into DNA, {{and it is this}} DNA that ends up being reincorporated somewhere else in the chromosome. Through her work with these different <b>transposons,</b> Baker started to look at unfoldases, which are a type of protein chaperone. Unfoldases serve to unfold or degrade proteins found in cells. Unfoldases are related to <b>transposons</b> because some of them release proteins that aid in transposition. When the proteins are released, transposition of the DNA sequence is stopped, and Baker wanted to know what caused the proteins to release from DNA.|$|R

Well-known biological phenomena involving DNA methylation as an underlying mechanism include imprinting, paramutation and X chromosome inactivation. In plants, <b>transposons</b> and repetitive elements are methylated, thereby keeping <b>transposons</b> silenced and immobilized and consequently protecting the genome from damage by these mobile elements.

50|$|RNA {{silencing}} is {{the mechanism}} that our cells (and cells from all kingdoms) use to fight RNA viruses and <b>transposons</b> (which originate {{from our own}} cells {{as well as from}} other vehicles). In the case of RNA viruses, these get destroyed immediately by the mechanism cited above. In the case of <b>transposons,</b> it's a little more indirect. Since <b>transposons</b> are located {{in different parts of the}} genome, the different transcriptions from the different promoters produce complementary mRNAs that can hybridize with each other. When this happens, the RNAi machinery goes into action, debilitating the mRNAs of the proteins that would be required to move the <b>transposons</b> themselves.|$|R

2500|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} concerning transgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. [...] This organism has been a helpful genetic model for over 100 years, due to its well-understood developmental pattern. [...] The transfer of transgenes into the Drosophila genome has been performed using various techniques, including P element, Cre-loxP, and ΦC31 insertion. [...] The most practiced method used thus far to insert transgenes into the Drosophila genome utilizes P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as transposons, are segments of bacterial DNA that are translocated into the genome, without the presence of a complementary sequence in the host’s genome. [...] P elements are administered in pairs of two, which flank the DNA insertion region of interest. [...] Additionally, P elements often consist of two plasmid components, one known as the P element transposase and the other, the P <b>transposon</b> backbone. [...] The transposase plasmid portion drives the transposition of the P <b>transposon</b> backbone, containing the transgene of interest and often a marker, between the two terminal sites of the <b>transposon.</b> Success of this insertion results in the nonreversible addition of the transgene of interest into the genome.
